Yet it remains a two-horse race, when what would be glorious to see is a truly competitive, multiple-team fight. It need not be a pipe dream. How encouraging this week to observe some consensus and optimism about the need to address the spending arms race that has spiralled out of control and resulted in a two-tier grid. Talk of a level playing field has been bandied about before in F1, but there are now genuine signs that in the background the heavy roller is being deployed. Periods of dominance are nothing new in the sport, indeed they have defined entire eras of racing, but the gap between Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull and the midfield has become a chasm. Efforts at cost cutting have effectively come to nought and the numbers reflect it. Figures from a 2016 Autosport study of budgets are breathtaking. Ferrari’s was put at £330m; Mercedes at £265m and Red Bull at £215m. Force India came fourth in the constructors’ championship on just £90m. Williams, who know all too well about dominating, with nine constructors titles in the 80s and 90s, were estimated to be on a budget of £105m. The team announced this week that they had made a pre-tax profit of £10.1m over the first six months of this year. A substantial part of which is believed to be based on the payment the team received from Mercedes to allow Valtteri Bottas to join them but Williams would not confirm it. Regardless of which it is not a sum that is going to give the frontrunners sleepless nights. The numbers are, after all, what matters. Talent and hard work alone are not enough to bridge the differential. Once the basic cost of a car has been met, those extra hundreds of millions are used to refine every aspect of it. Every part receives increased research and development and those with more money are able to pursue potential avenues of advantage beyond the means of the smaller outfits. The Williams group chief executive, Mike O’Driscoll, who calls financing F1 for an independent a “highwire act” put it succinctly. “The cost pressures are largely driven by the corporately owned teams spending substantially more,” he said on Wednesday. “That leads to an unbalanced playing field when it comes to resources and capability.” Interestingly, his view was also echoed this week by the McLaren executive director, Zak Brown, who is in charge of a team that boasted a budget of £185m in 2016. “I think those that can afford to raise the budget levels they are at will do everything they can to maintain that,” he said. “That gives them a competitive advantage, but it is a bit like having two extra players on the field in a football match.” McLaren are, in every sense except recent results, one of the big teams, so that Brown and O’Driscoll share such similar views is instructive of the way the wind is blowing. O’Driscoll is emphatic on the action that needs to be taken: “I don’t believe we can bridge that gap without action at an industry level,” he said. “We need fairer revenue distribution amongst the teams and we need cost controls. There is no doubt that if we have that we will see more exciting and closer racing throughout the grid.” Brown concurred. “Speaking for McLaren, we’re a fan of budget caps,” he added. “Most other sports have it and it will equal the playing field.” Any agreement on revenue distribution will have to wait until the new concorde agreement, which is set to be renegotiated for 2021 and while their stance might be expected from teams in the midfield, crucially both appear ready to go even further to try and make that deal a genuinely new start for F1. McLaren are understood to receive an annual constructors championship payment of £35m (as do Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari) and Williams a heritage bonus of £10m. Voluntarily losing these has always appeared to be a sticking point in an equitable redistribution of revenue but perhaps not any more. “We recognise we’re one of the four teams that get special payments,” said Brown. “That might mean some compromise but we feel if the sport is healthier ultimately that will benefit all of us.” O’Driscoll would not comment on payments from the Formula One Group but when asked about it appeared open to the idea of compromise for the greater good. “If Formula One arrived at a model where they distributed revenue equally to all teams, we would be very satisfied with that result,” he said. Both expressed optimism that change was coming, with O’Driscoll in particular impressed by the sport’s new owners and their ability to bring about long-needed change. Indeed Chase Carey, the chief executive of the Formula One group, has noted that the disparity in spending “undermines the competitive balance of the sport”. Addressing and solving it will be no mean feat but if successful it could guarantee not only better competition but the very future of the sport. As Paddy Lowe, the William’s technical officer notes of the independents: “We are here fair weather or foul. Teams that are fundamentally backed by corporate structures are always at the whim of what that business wants. You wont find that with the independents – that’s their life, they are in there for ever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/28/audrey-hepburn-breakfast-at-tiffanys-script-sells-auction-630000","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T11:45:12Z","webTitle":"Audrey Hepburn's Breakfast at Tiffany's script sells for £630,000","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/28/audrey-hepburn-breakfast-at-tiffanys-script-sells-auction-630000","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/28/audrey-hepburn-breakfast-at-tiffanys-script-sells-auction-630000","fields":{"headline":"Audrey Hepburn's Breakfast at Tiffany's script sells for £630,000","bodyText":"Audrey Hepburn’s personal shooting script for Breakfast at Tiffany’s has been sold for just over £630,000, seven times its pre-sale estimate, at a London auction of the actor’s private possessions. The script, which included Hepburn’s annotations, was one of many lots that smashed exceptions, with the sale generating a total of £4.6m, the auctioneer Christie’s said on Thursday. The sale, the largest of her personal possessions, included items from Hepburn’s wardrobe and dressing table, as well as photographs. A bidder paid £332,750 for a Tiffany bangle that was a gift to Hepburn from the director Steven Spielberg, inscribed with the message: “You are my ‘inspiration’.” A black satin Givenchy cocktail gown, worn in the 1963 film Charade, and a Burberry trenchcoat each sold for £68,750. The designer Hubert de Givenchy was a close friend of Hepburn’s and advised her on her wardrobe. He described her as his muse and the pair eventually became business partners. A colourless tiara, worn by Hepburn to the London premiere of The Nun’s Story in 1959 and in the 1967 film Two for the Road fetched £43,750. A bidder paid £56,250 for a Cartier lipstick holder, almost 19 times the pre-sale estimate, while a satin sleep mask that had been expected to fetch up to £150 sold for £6,250. A 1963 photograph of Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, taken by the celebrated portrait photographer Cecil Beaton, went for £93,750, more than 30 times the estimate. The items were made available by Hepburn’s sons, who are selling about 500 items in total through live and online sales at Christie’s. The online sale continues until 4 October. Overall, the sale at the auction house fetched seven times the expected amount, Christie’s said. Many of the lots were in flawless condition, having been kept by Hepburn in a closet in Switzerland, according to Luca Dotti, her younger son by her second husband, the psychiatrist Andrea Dotti. Hepburn died in 1993 from cancer, aged 63, but her popularity has endured, winning her a new generation of fans. Her eldest son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer, said: “Now, 50% of her fanbase are teens and tweens. She has replaced James Dean on that closet drawer in kids’ bedrooms. It’s quite extraordinary.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2017/sep/28/bate-borisov-v-arsenal-europa-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T18:49:49Z","webTitle":"Bate Borisov 2-4 Arsenal: Europa League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/sep/28/bate-borisov-v-arsenal-europa-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/sep/28/bate-borisov-v-arsenal-europa-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Bate Borisov 2-4 Arsenal: Europa League – as it happened","bodyText":"An entertaining contest and a satisfying win for an experimental Arsenal side. Borisov started terribly but turned out to be decent opponents. Wilshere was outstanding in the first half but faded towards the end. All Arsenal’s youngsters impressed, and Holding and Giroud scored landmark goals. There was some defensive nonsense, of course, but generally this was hunky and dory for Wenger. 90 min: There will be at least two more minutes. 89 min: After a neat backheeled tee-up, Rios wallops a shot over from 20 yards. Arsenal substitution: Nketiah (another 18-year-old) on, Willock off. 88 min: Stashevic cause yet more bother down the left. But after getting himself into a good position, he blasts high and wide from the corner of the box. 85 min: Willock has a shot charged down at the edge of the area. Borisov break. They worked it out to Stashevich wide on the left again. He drills in a low cross. Mustafi does well to clear it at the near post, at the expensive of a corner. Borisov substitution: Baga on, A Volodko off. 83 min: Maitland-Niles gambols down the left. Then he curls a lovely pass across field to McGuane, who slips a canny ball through to Walcott. Accomplished play by the two youngsters. All of which is undone by Walcott, who bogs a weak shot way wide. A bad option badly executed. 81 min: Giroud tries a cheeky lob from 20 yards. It’s a good effort but floats a yard over the bar. Arsenal substitution: McGuane on, Nelson off. McGuane is 18, a year older than Nelson, who performed well but most of Borisov’s attacks in the second half came down his side. He didn’t get much help from Walcott, either. 77 min: Nelson makes good ground down the right and then shows composure to pick out a pass, shifting the ball to Giroud on the other side of the box. Giroud, by contrast, smacks a rash shot way of target. 76 min: Dragun slices open the Arsenal defence a little too easily, pinging a pass from just inside the Arsenal half into the path of Stashevich, who had charged in from the right. Only bad control spares Arsenal. Hats off to Borisov, they could have given up but they’re seriously making Arsenal fret now. And Arsenal have become sloppy. 75 min: Scherbitski punches Walcot’s corner away Second later, Borisov are bearing down on Arsenal’s goal. And they get a freekick for a foul on Ivanic. It’s wide on the left. The delivery is poor, allowing Ospina to gather. 73 min: Corner to Arsenal after a cross by Giroud is deflected behind... 71 min: Gordeichuk bulldozes his way into the box from the left, barging past Nelson and Mustafi. Then he pulls it back to A Volodko, who tries to sidefoot it into the top corner from the edge of the box. But he blazes it wide! 68 min: Stasevich flies down the left wing and hoists over a dangerous cross. Ospina charges off his line and punches it away. Forget petering out, this game is up for grabs again. Arsenal are wobbling in defence. A tidy move down the left, followed bya weak sliding tackle by Mertesacker, which allows a cross to come in from the left-hand byline. Holding slips as he goes to intercept, and Gordeichuk is left with a simple chance from three yards. And he hammers it into the net. 63 min: Walcot is pulled back near the right-hand corner of the Borisov box. Milunovic gets a well-deserved booking. But Wilshere’s freekick fails to beat the one-man wall. Can one-man be a wall? Maybe he’s just a brick. Or a bollard. “Man, I feel old,” confides Robert Lowery. “First I’m sitting here seeing The Boy Wilshere is balding and grizzled next to his even younger teammates. Then Arsenal’s record European score comes up and I can’t believe that not everyone remembers Liege 0-7 Arsenal. Next I realise it was 24 years ago and the scorers were Selly, Merson, Adams, Campbell and McGoldrick ( I didn’t even have to google that.....) and that I had double maths and hurling training the next day. And now I’ve realised that I’m just like the Arsenal fans of my youth who would discuss the merits of Brady or his contemporaries......The world turns full circle, generation replaces generation and Arsenal are back on TV playing European football on a Thursday night....looking forward to Danny Wellbeck cracking one in on the volley to win the final this year. Gareth Bale scoring from half way in last minute of next year’s Champions League final, not so much.” 61 min: The game is petering out. Shame. 59 min: Willock commits a heavy touch and almost loses possession. but he then shows tremendous determination and strength to win it back outside his own box, and then strides forward and sets an Arsenal attack in motion Fine play by the young man. 57 min: A freekick is whipped in from the right. Signevich gets a glancing header to it, and Ospina’s reflexes allow him to make a smart parry. Borisov substitution: Sihnevich on, Rodionov off. 53 min: Corner to Borisov after Mustafi cuts out a cross. 51 min: Wilshere is fouled on the edge of the area but the ref doesn’t award a freekick. No point compensating now. Giroud claims his 100th goal for Arsenal by stroking a low spotkick into the net as the keeper flopped the other way. 48 min: Nelson intercepts on the right wing, then drives forward and is brought down by Volodko. That’s a freekick to Arsenal in a useful position for a cross into the area. Walcott’s makes a mess of it. But no matter, because the ref has awarded a penalty! No one is sure why! Dragun gets a booking and the replay shows he touched Mustafi, maybe even took a little tug of his shirt. That was about the extent of it. Either that’s a lamentable decision or something happened that hasn’t been picked up by the camera. 46 min: We’re back. Brave yourselves! “I think we must ask ourselves, what’s the most Arsenal thing that can happen from this point on?” parps John Cashman. “Do they switch off at the back and give up two in rapid succession, only to win in at the death via a Giroud header? Is there a Wilshere season-ending injury? What else?” As Bruce Springsteen once sang, SHOW A LITTLE FAITH, there’s magic in, um, Wenger’s history. But no European trophy. This is the season all that will change. Maybe. What an entertaining knockabout half that was! There could have been double the number of goals, at least. Borisov showed themselves to be pretty handy going forward as the half wore on, but they’re in tatters at the back, partly because Arsenal have attacked well, with Wilshere exceptional. The youngsters have done well, too, especially Nelson. 44 min: Wilshere tries to slip a pass through to Giroud but his pass is intercepted. But a deflection takes it into the path of Walcott, who stabs the ball towards the far corner from eight yards. Great finger-tip save by the keeper! And from the ensuing corner Borisov are all ove the place again. Holding slashes a close-range shot off the outside of the post! 43 min: Willock is down holding his head after catching a swinging arm from Milunovic. That didn’t look accidental. Milunovic should be on his way to the shower. 41 min: Arsenal have devoted the last fe minutes to puncturing Borisov’s resurgence. Sensible, but not so much fun. 39 min: Wilshere is taken down from behind and for a moment it looks like he may stay in a heap on the ground. But soon he jumps to his feet, ready to carry on orchestrating Arsenal’s play. He really has been excellent so far. 37 min: Maitland-Niles does well to win a corner down the left. The last one produced a goal. This one is punched clear by the keeper. 35 min: Moments after another sharp break led by Wilshere, Borisov threaten at the other end, forcing a good save from Ospina. What an open game this is! It’s hard to keep up. 33 min: A freekick from the left is curled in towards the penalty spot. Dragun gets a nice glancing header to it. Ospina flings himself to his left to make a tremendous one-handed save. But he needn’t have bothered, because Dragun was offside. 30 min: In answer to my previous question, Arsenal’s biggest win in Europe is 7-0, which they’ve mustered twice, once against Standard Liege and once against Slavia Prague. They obviously can’t shut out Borisov now, but we shouldn’t discount them hitting eight. If they decide to just shut up shop, I may stop this MBM in protest. The swill strike back! And it was a very fine goal. A good cross from the right by Rios flies a little too easily past Elneny and is met by Ivanic, whose header is so powerful it whizzes past Ospina from 10 yards. From a corner won following a good mvoe involving Nelson, Wilshere and Maitland-Niles, Mertesacker gets off a header, and Holding shins it past the keeper from two yards! That’s his first goal for Arsenal! And you wouldn’t rule out a hat-trick for him today. Borisov are absolute swill. What’s Arsenal’s record win in Europe? Dear oh dear, that is abysmal goalkeeping! Scherbitski collects a humdrum pass back and controls with his right foot ... before passing it straight to Walcott 16 yards out. The forward suppresses the urge to laugh, ignores Giroud, who wants a pass, and slots a low shot into the corner past the keeper. Now Walcott can laugh. 21 min: Giroud gives the ball away, allowing Borisov to counter. A cross from the let is cleared to just outside the box, giving Ivanic a chance to try another shot. It’s a good effort on the half-volley, but whizzes a couple of yards wide. 20 min: Ivanic tries to launch one into the top corner from 30 yards. That’s testament to how rarely Borisov have got sight of Arsenal’s goal. The shot is way off target. 17 min: Wilshere, pulling strings again, nips a pass in to Giroud at the edge of the area, then darts forward to collect the return. He then pops the ball wide to Walcott and darts forward again to receive the next return pass, which he deviates into the net from close range. But it won’t count because the offside flag had been raised. I’m not sure that as the correct decision; but it was definitely a dainty move. Wilshere’s having a ball. 14 min: Arsenal are in total charge at the moment, monopolising possession. 11 min: Nelson, aged 17, is looking very accomplished. And that goal can only help him and the other youngsters to gain confidence to perform even better. Not that they’ve looked short of confidence so far. They’re rising to Wenger’s challenge so far. But it’s an ex-prodigy, Wilshere, who’s running the show. A close-range finish - followed by a bow-and-arrow celebration for some reason - after a gorgeous little cross from the left by Wilshere, concluding a move in which he was instrumental. 8 min: Nelson leads a an attack before passing to Wilshere a few yards outside the Borisov D. Wilshere flips a dinky pass through to Walcott, who dabs it past the keeper on the run from 12 yards ... but it bounces back of the post! Walcott tries to turn in the rebound from an acute angle, but a defender read that danger and blocks. 6 min: It’s been a steady opening by Arsenal. And by Borisov. Lots of neat passing in midfield but moves break down as soon as they get beyond that point. Borisov, at least, are committing lots of players to attack when they get the chance. 3 min: Ivanic fires off the game’s first host, a wobbly effort from 25 yards that comes to a halt near a photographer. 2 min: The early indications suggest this is a ref that likes to blow his whistle regularly. All very bitty so far. 1 min: We have go. Does anyone know which font Borisov have used for the names on the back of their jerseys? It’s choice. Here come the teams. Borisov, winners of the Belarussian title for each of the last 11 years, are in an all yellow kit, except with a blue V across their chests. Arsenal, meanwhile, are decked out entirely in blue, their shirt combing dark- and sky-blue, like a half-in-half Man City-Chelsea number. Speaking on the BT sports channel, Martin Keown says Borisov’s weakness is their left-back, Pyatov, who continually gets caught out of position. Keown expects Walcott to go on a spree. Asked about how tough an assignment he expects this to be for his youngsters, Wenger coddles no mollies: “It’s a good test. In life and in our jobs you don’t get 50 opportunities. When you look back at all the players who’ve made it, usually they took their first opportunities ... Borisov are well organised, they’ve played in the Champions League, they’ve beaten Bayern at home [five years ago], so it’s a good test for us and we want to see how well they cope.” As expected, Arsene Wenger has plumped for a youthful lineup. Big things are expected from the lad Mertesacker. Bate Borisov: Scherbitski; Rios, Gaiduchik, Milunovic, Polakov, Volodko, Dragun; Gordeichuk, Ivanic, Stasevich; Rodionov. Subs: Veremko, Yablonski, Berezkin, Signevich, Tuominen. Baga, M Volodko Arsenal: Ospina; Mustafi, Mertesacker, Hlding; Nelson, Willock, Elneny, Maitland-Niles, Wilshere; Walcott, Giroud. Subs: Macey, Dasilva, Gilmour, McGuane, Dragomir, Akpom, Nketiah.

The intervention by two specialists working for the UN human rights council comes as senior Catalan politicians urge the EU to step in to address Spain’s worst territorial crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago. Although the referendum has been declared illegal by both the Spanish government and the country’s constitutional court, Catalonia’s pro-independence regional government is pushing ahead with the vote in the face of ever sterner countermeasures from the courts and the police. In a statement on Thursday, David Kaye and Alfred de Zayas noted the recent arrests of 14 Catalan government officials, the blocking of referendum websites and the possibility that protest organisers could be charged with sedition. “Regardless of the lawfulness of the referendum, the Spanish authorities have a responsibility to respect those rights that are essential to democratic societies,” the experts said. “The measures we are witnessing are worrying because they appear to violate fundamental individual rights, cutting off public information and the possibility of debate at a critical moment for Spain’s democracy.” Kaye, special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and De Zayas, an independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, also expressed reservations about the Spanish government’s decision to deploy thousands of extra police officers to Catalonia. “We are concerned that this order and the accompanying rhetoric may heighten tensions and social unrest,” they said. “We urge all parties to exercise the utmost restraint and avoid violence of any kind to ensure peaceful protests in the coming days.” The pair have spoken to the Madrid government about the issues they raised in the statement. On Wednesday, the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, said the EU was turning its back on the region, and the Catalan foreign minister, Raül Romeva, accused the Spanish government of a “brutal crackdown”, adding that the EU needed to “understand that this is a big issue”. Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona, struck a more emollient note in an article for the Guardian, asking the European commission to “open a space for mediation between the Spanish and Catalan governments to find a negotiated and democratic solution to the conflict”. Earlier this week, the Catalan high court stepped in to stop the vote, instructing local and national police officers to prevent public buildings from being used as polling stations and to seize any material related to the referendum. However, Catalonia’s regional police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, has said shutting polling stations risks “a disruption of public order”. The Spanish government has vowed to prevent the vote from being held, arguing that it would be a clear breach of the country’s constitution. But Puigdemont insists the vote will go ahead and that Catalonia will declare its independence from Spain within 48 hours of a victory for the yes campaign. A European commission spokesman declined to comment on how the commission would respond if such a declaration of independence were made, saying: “I will not speculate on what will happen 48 or 36 or 72 hours afterwards.” Thursday saw thousands of university students abandoning their classes to march through the streets of Barcelona, to protest against what they see as a draconian response to calls for independence. Laia Ferrus, a 20-year-old studying education, said the issue had moved beyond simple sovereignty. “It’s no longer about calling for independence,” she told the Associated Press. “It’s about standing up for our basic principles and rights.” As the vote draws closer, the war of words between the central and regional governments has grown increasingly heated. Puigdemont has accused the Spanish authorities of exceeding “the limits of a respectable democracy” and dragging Spain back to the Franco era, while others have compared the blocking of referendum websites to the actions of governments in Turkey, China and North Korea. The Spanish government hit back, describing the Catalan independence movement as a manifestation of “extreme nationalism” and an “expression of populism” similar to those seen elsewhere in Europe. Speaking to reporters in Barcelona on Thursday, a spokesman for the Spanish finance ministry said the outbreak of Catalan nationalism was nothing new: “It always erupts at times of economic difficulty. It always looks for an external enemy and it always has magic recipes – from Brexit to Marine Le Pen to the AfD.” The spokesman dismissed Puigdemont – “His only mission is independence and to be a martyr for the cause” – and said Colau’s calls for European commission mediation were likely to go unheeded as the EU had made it quite clear that it regarded the Catalan question as an internal Spanish matter. He argued that Catalonia already had considerable autonomy; with the exception of the armed forces, international diplomacy and pensions, Catalonia has control over all its affairs, including health, education and public order. The spokesman also said that financial issues could always be reviewed. “Last year we proposed a new system of financing that would give autonomous regions more control over their finances, but Catalonia refused to attend the meeting of regional presidents. They didn’t want to take part in the negotiation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/28/protests-patriots-and-the-rebirth-of-kanye-west-hightide-hits-walthamstow","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T17:41:37Z","webTitle":"Protests, patriots and the rebirth of Kanye West: HighTide hits Walthamstow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/28/protests-patriots-and-the-rebirth-of-kanye-west-hightide-hits-walthamstow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/28/protests-patriots-and-the-rebirth-of-kanye-west-hightide-hits-walthamstow","fields":{"headline":"Protests, patriots and the rebirth of Kanye West: HighTide hits Walthamstow","bodyText":"In Franz Kafka’s Metamorphosis, Gregor Samsa wakes up to discover he’s been turned into a giant beetle. In Sam Steiner’s Kanye the First, a young, stressed white woman called Annie – who feels as if she has failed in life – wakes up to find she has been transformed into the superstar Kanye West, who has recently died. Inside, she’s still Annie but she now looks and speaks just like Kanye. Not surprisingly, her terminally ill mum and high-achieving sister are shocked, but dealing with them is nothing compared with negotiating Kanye’s second coming – not to mention life with Kim and the kids, and meeting the expectations of fans. In 2014, Steiner’s ingenious debut play Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons, about a world where everyone is given only 140 words a day to express everything they want and need to say, announced him as an eye-catching talent at the Edinburgh fringe. His own second coming is part of the HighTide festival’s pop-up season in Walthamstow, London: two weeks of comedy and performance in a temporary tented venue called the Mix. The beauty of Lemons was its simple audacity. Here, the weight of complexities that arise from the initial conceit constantly threaten to capsize Steiner’s play as he attempts to cover everything from cultural appropriation to the role of fandom in contemporary culture. Imogen Doel gives a terrific performance as Annie and the play is often interesting in a this-could-go-anywhere way, but Steiner sometimes forgets to entertain us while he’s busy cramming in all the issues. Not for nothing is Annie’s more successful sister Eve (Keziah Joseph) planning to write a thesis on “the inherent violence of narrative form”. The casting and doubling of characters cleverly undercuts our expectations and toys with ideas of shifting identity and how we construct and present ourselves to the world. The play also often hits the comic sweet spot. But it never makes us empathise either with Annie or Kanye, who are both in their own ways facing enormous pressures to be the people who others demand. It also seems a bit of a cop-out when it becomes increasingly apparent that the whole thing might merely be an anxiety dream. Of course, after such a distinctive debut, Steiner – like both Annie and West – is subject to our expectations. If Kanye the First is not an outright winner, it gives notice of the scale of Steiner’s ambition. The HighTide lineup includes another chance to see David Aula and Simon Evans’ sneakily confounding magic show The Vanishing Man, Paper Birds’ Mobile and Theresa Ikoko’s Girls, hatched at HighTide’s Aldeburgh festival last year. There’s also a new piece by Nessah Muthy, Heroine, about mixed-race soldier Grace (a very good Asmara Gabrielle) who is given a medical discharge after her tour in Afghanistan. Grace gets involved with an apparently benign group of women in a Croydon community centre and gradually their real motivations become apparent. The flat naturalism of Muthy’s drama seems more TV friendly than theatrically vibrant. It comes from a long tradition of plays about women finding community and strength through protest typified by Nell Dunn’s 1981 play Steaming, but gives the subject a twist as it turns out that Wendy (Lucy Thackeray), who is leading the group to save the community centre from being sold, is a former English Defence League member, and that Grace has her own ideas about what constitutes patriotism. It terrific to see working-class women portrayed on stage, and plays such as this and Andrea Dunbar’s Rita, Sue and Bob Too, currently touring, remind us how rare that is. But the relationship between Wendy, bereaved mother Cheryl (Wendy Morgan) and the food bank-dependant Bev (Maggie McCarthy) lacks grounding detail and comes perilously close to sentimentality. Neither Heroine nor Kanye the First sits particularly well in the Mix, a venue that when used end-on, as it is here, has a wide exposing stage and none of the tight intimacy of a pop-up space such as Paines Plough’s Roundabout (which has been such a shot in the arm for new writing). As the National Theatre’s Shed proved, and the Edinburgh fringe demonstrates every year, temporary spaces can be nifty platforms for work that may sit uncomfortably in more traditional plush-seated venues that come with a range of expectations about what theatre is and how it should look and sound. Both plays here not only compete with the noise of passing busses, but are also hampered by perfunctory designs – and in the case of Heroine by lacklustre direction – that is in danger of making them look cut-price rather than enticingly rough and ready. • HighTide is at various venues in Walthamstow, London, until 8 October.

Dan Kitwood was dispatched to Bangladesh to cover the unfolding story in Cox’s Bazar, close to the border. Here he describes his experiences. Refugees gather on a mud bank after security forces temporarily stopped people crossing into Whaikhyang I flew Gatwick–Dubai–Chittagong, then a five-hour taxi ride south to a hotel, an Eco Lodge 40 minutes south of Cox’s Bazar. The story was quickly unfolding so the brief was simply to get on the ground ASAP and get to work. Refugees were still crossing and, though in smaller numbers, continue to do so. The idea was to show the scale of the story but try to give it a human face in as sensitive a way as possible. The border between the two countries runs over difficult terrain, from hill tracts over mountainous jungle further north to large expanses of paddy fields as the land flattens and follows the course of the river south, eventually widening as it makes its way to the sea. Depending on where they were fleeing from, refugees were crossing all along the border, by trekking over the hills, wading and swimming across shallow rivers, across the ridges between the paddy fields, in small boats between marshes, and then eventually in the larger fishing boats bringing people over the 1.2 miles (2km) to the southern tip of the Bangladeshi peninsula. Rohingya refugees walk across paddy fields at dusk after crossing the border from Myanmar Between the scattering of villages, trees and occasional hills, views across the landscape from the road that ran north to south dissecting the peninsula, you could see the hilltops of Myanmar looming over the horizon. Trying to find people making the journey was simply a case of keeping your eyes open and scanning the horizon. Tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees already lined the roads, some new arrivals and many who had made their home there since the last wave of violence swept through Rakhine state in 2016. As is nearly always the case, I was working alone. I had arranged a local fixer and driver. My fixer, Mostafa, was a 25-year-old English student from Cox’s Bazar Human Resource Development Foundation. A new settlement of Rohingya refugees begins to form in hills off the main road in Whaikhyang The scenes were incredibly reminiscent of those I experienced while covering the migrant crisis in 2015 in the Balkan region: a constant stream as thousands of people – men, women and children – fled a place they had called home for reasons completely out of their hands and headed into the unknown. A young Rohingya refugee gathers firewood after arriving in Whaikhyang from Myanmar The geography of the land and the heat and humidity were what set it apart. Bangladesh is in monsoon season. At times the mud was knee-deep, making every step so much more difficult. One of the moments that will stay with me for some time is the morning I spent on the beach at the far south of the peninsula. We had started the day early, around 4.30am, and made the one hour and 40-minute journey as far as the road would take us to Dakhinpara. Rohingya refugees jump from a wooden boat as it begins to roll over From there, the road had been washed away and what had once been land had now been taken over by the tide. The only way to get across was by boat so we managed to get a small wooden boat to take us. The water was incredibly shallow as it was low tide, so we got stuck several times and had to push the boat out of the mud. Once across there we had to get a rickshaw to the jetty, and then walk for half an hour or so to the water’s edge. The shore was littered with the carcasses of dead animals. The boat was being picked clean by locals looking for anything useful. A Rohingya refugee breaks down in tears after jumping from a wooden boat that began to tip over We were joined by a couple of border police, who had been given information that a boat had left from the other side and was expected to arrive. After 40 minutes or so we caught a glimpse of the boat, but it seemed hesitant to come in, instead making its way up and down the shore about 500 metres off the beach. It seemed that they were hesitant to come ashore, perhaps because of the police. After half an hour they clearly had decided it wasn’t worth the risk and disappeared out of sight back towards Myanmar. We had all but given up as the day was drawing on and started to make our way back when we passed a local man who was coming back and said he had info that there was a boat coming in. Sure enough a boat came into sight, but this time it was being escorted by the Bangladeshi coastguard, so it had no choice but to come in. As it came in it turned sideward because of its design and the waves began to tip it over, sending everyone with it. A man carries an elderly woman ashore Most people got to shore relatively unscathed, but soaked to the bone and utterly exhausted. Their journey across from mainland Myanmar had been the final part of a long journey. One elderly woman had been pushed under the water and was helped by a relative, but she was in a poor state and collapsed on the shore. Scanning the scene, it appeared that apart from the old lady, most people were OK, yet everyone was screaming and shouting hysterically. Several of the women were throwing themselves on the floor at my feet and screaming to me as if they needed help. I didn’t know what to do as I thought perhaps a child had been left behind or was still in the sea. Refugees comfort the elderly woman on the shore A huge fight soon broke out between some of the men. Mostafa, my fixer, and I tried to break it up and find out what was happening. It turned out that the two young men “piloting” the boat had stopped halfway across and demanded that all the refugees give them all their valuable possessions, including necklaces, rings. I was speechless that anyone could be capable of such a thing, but unable to do anything. Luckily, the coastguard were running towards the scene and took the men to one side to “gently persuade” them to hand people back their possessions. We went back to help the elderly woman and suggest people get her out of her wet clothes and try to get her dry, which they did. Sadly, I don’t know what happened to her as we were asked to leave by the coastguard so they could do some more “persuading”, but I do fear the worst. I hope she made it.

Below: Children gather by the side of the road and under makeshift shelters I visited the Sadar hospital, which was looking after about 30 patients suffering from a range of things, including injuries from road accidents, beatings and gunshot wounds, in Cox’s Bazar, in an area that had been sectioned off especially for Rohingya refugee arrivals. Inam Hussain holds an x-ray showing a bullet in his knee at the Sadar hospital There was a real range of injuries and conditions, from young children to the elderly. Several of the patients had been given x-rays and bullets could clearly be seen. Dilder Vezum, 30, and her daughter Noor-Karima Vezum, 10, from Tula Tuli in Myanmar, sit on a bed in the Sadar hospital I photographed a woman with her only remaining child. According to their accounts, they had both been attacked by the Burmese military with machetes and her husband and other child had been killed. They were clearly still in shock and nursing injuries under their bandaged heads. It was shocking that anyone could do that, especially to women and young, innocent children. Most of the hospitals had been overwhelmed with injured people, but the Bangladeshi nurses and doctors were doing all they could to help people.

After a number of years of falling short in Division Two, promotion last season was a huge achievement. But nothing in the recent history of the game led me to expect anything but a grim, probably hopeless, struggle for survival. A couple of draws against the run of play sandwiched by a good win at Somerset in our first three games was an encouraging start. But I still suspected we were fighting out of our weight class and as the bigger sides settled into the season the blows would start to land. Thankfully I am an awful pundit. As the weeks went on, the wins mounted. And not gritty victories in tight games, but authoritative dismissals. Huge credit has to go Chris Silverwood and Ryan ten Doeschate. Division Two cricket had become normal currency at Chelmsford but, in the two seasons since they assumed their roles, we first took the sole promotion spot available then followed it with our first title in a generation. For all the excellence of overseas players such as Neil Wagner, this was a success underpinned by local talent. Jamie Porter has been a menace to batting society all season, an immense achievement as this is his first year in the top division and his first time as leader of the pack. Simon Harmer has been an exceptional signing too. His six and eight against Warwickshire followed immediately by five and nine against Middlesex really lit the blue touch paper for us. Captain Ten Doeschate had it absolutely right when he pointed to the contributions that came from all corners throughout the season. You could call it a triumph by the many, not the few. DelbertGrady Lancashire Having finished as runners-up, I’m delighted with our performances this year. I care little for one-day cricket but the County Championship performances have surpassed my modest expectations after we were nearly relegated last year. I wasn’t happy at us exploiting the Kolpak rules so shamelessly but Ryan McLaren has been excellent, the apparently departing Kyle Jarvis likewise. And I love watching Shiv Chanderpaul chisel his way to a score, but who doesn’t? Dane Vilas, his big double-hundred aside, has been a disappointment and gets out too easily for a player of his obvious class. I’d have preferred Luke Procter to have kept his place. With Haseeb Hameed having struggled, the onus was on Alex Davies to score runs early doors and he’s largely done that – and at a decent rate too. It’s never easy keeping and opening but Davies has done it and his reward should be a place on the Lions tour. Liam Livingstone has also enjoyed an excellent summer. His six wickets in the second innings against Surrey in the last game of the season proved his worth with both bat and ball. Mike Barnett Surrey It’s been a curate’s egg of a season. On the plus side we’ve only lost twice, but 10 draws tells its own story. We were always too good to go down but not good enough to challenge. The brightest points of our season were mainly down to the once-in-a-lifetime genius of Kumar Sangakkara, and England not getting around to picking Mark Stoneman until the first half of the season was over. But we really struggled to bowl teams out. Zafar Ansari’s shock retirement, the departure of Mark Footitt to Nottinghamshire after a few games meant we relied on the re-signed evergreen all-rounder Rikki Clarke. He ended up leading the attack and the averages. We fielded 22 different players during the season, a fairly shocking state of affairs. Simon Thomas Yorkshire I wish I could sum it up by saying “pretty ordinary” but that would suggest it’s been average and it’s been far, far from that. We have managed to avoid relegation because Somerset, Middlesex and Hampshire were slightly worse than us. The 376-run defeat against Essex in the last game of the season was just the latest in a long line of capitulations. The usual excuses about England call-ups for Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow will be trotted out but since coach Jason “Dizzy” Gillespie left things have gone downhill from top to bottom. Andrew Gale was a legend for us, but it’s clear he cannot lead or motivate from the top. Aside from Gary Ballance, senior players such as Adam Lyth, Alex Lees, Andrew Hodd, Steven Patterson and Jack Brooks have just been poor. If it wasn’t for Ballance’s batting at the start of the season, we would almost certainly be playing Division Two cricket next season. An honourable mention must go to young Ben Coad who has been superb with the ball. He’ll go on to bag a lot of wickets over the next decade and more. Dan Woodhouse Hampshire After last year’s reprieve many people were hoping we would go down on the last day of this season. But, justly or not, a draw at already relegated Warwickshire means we have survived again. We started relatively well this season but it seemed we were satisfied to draw games rather than push for wins. As the season progressed, it became obvious some senior players were past their best and the younger players have not been good enough to step up to the mark. There were a couple of big scores for Sean Ervine and James Adams but otherwise very little. James Vince is a class act and a joy to watch but he always gets in and gets out again. Liam Dawson has not pushed on; Mason Crane has not taken enough wickets; and captain George Bailey has been a huge disappointment. Fidel Edwards only came good towards the end of the season when a new contract was up for grabs. Kyle Abbott and Gareth Berg have been two of our most reliable batsmen, which says it all. Abbott is my pick for player of the season – with both bat and ball. John Hooper Somerset After the heroics of 2016, it’s been a very frustrating season. After the agony of losing the title at the last gasp, it appeared that we had consolidated the batting line-up with the arrival of Dean Elgar and solved our wicketkeeping problem with Steven Davies. I thought we could win the Championship. But this season our nerve has failed us at vital moments. We have secured so many first-innings leads only for our fragile batting to let us down in the second innings. New captain Tom Abell couldn’t buy a run for the first half of the season and ended up dropping himself. Our established batsmen have also let us down. Marcus Trescothick and James Hildreth no longer turn twenties into fifties; Peter Trego looks all at sea; and the all-rounders just haven’t made enough runs. Matthew Maynard’s coaching has also been a contributing factor. It was known before the season that our overseas player, Elgar, would be playing for South Africa during the Test series but we have played most of our games with no replacement. Too many of the players he has recruited – Jim Allenby and Roelof Van der Merwe in particular – have failed to click. On the bright side there is no more formidable spin pairing in the country than Dom Bess and Jack Leach. I thought the latter looked like a better prospect than Mason Crane for the Ashes. I also tip my hat to Craig Overton, who has bowled brilliantly all season. Eddie Byrom came into the team at a difficult time and has performed admirably. He might give us some much needed stability at the top of the order, when Trescothick retires. Simon Huxtable Middlesex From heroes to zeros in the space of a season. It was always going to be tough getting a win at Taunton and, “excessive spin” or not, Middlesex were really outplayed throughout. We can have no complaints really, having only won three games this season. Sam Robson and Steven Eskinazi have done their very best in the batting stakes throughout but they haven’t been supported well enough. We were third from bottom in the T20 tournament, and second bottom of the Royal London One-Day Cup, so relegation wasn’t a fluke. We really were consistently awful across all the domestic competitions. It’s a huge disappointment after the highs of last season. Hopefully we can bounce back. It’s a shame Lords won’t see any Division One action next year, but when you rely on Hampshire to stay up, the writing is on the wall. We just weren’t good enough. Alex Hill Warwickshire This season has been desperately poor and we can have no complaints about being relegated. There have been very few individual performances this season to warm the cockles of a true Bear’s heart. Several of the more experienced players are past their sell-by dates and underperforming. While younger players have been blooded, none really look to be up to it yet. Jeetan Patel followed up last season’s heroic performances with another good season in a dark year. Keith Barker has been OK too. The rest have been truly woeful and need to look at themselves. Big Bear Worcestershire This has been a fantastic season in Division Two, with promotion a testament to a genuine team effort among a group of talented mainly young players. A belief in youth has been at the core of our success; having versatile players in almost every position who can chip in with bat and ball has helped. There has not been a better showing of team spirit in the County Championship this year. Signing India’s Ravi Ashwin for the run-in was a stroke of genius too. I’m very pleased local Worcestershire stalwart Darryl Mitchell had such a good season after what must have been the real disappointment of losing the captaincy. Tim Powell Nottinghamshire The wait for promotion to Division One was nervous but a draw at Hove got us over the line. The two trophies in white-ball cricket, the T20 and the Royal London One-Day cup, already in the cabinet means we have had success across all forms of the domestic game this season. So we have to be delighted with that. The huge depth of the squad has been the most impressive thing this season. Someone always seems to pop up to give a match-winning performance. We were there to be shot at because of the options available in every game, but thankfully everyone stepped up to the plate when needed. Alex Hales has had an outstanding season, and it beggars belief that he’s not on the plane to Australia this winter. Samit Patel has also shown what a magnificent servant he is to the club, and Chris Read also made sure his last season for us was one to remember. Brian Willett Northamptonshire For a county with the restraints that Northamptonshire endure season after season, it is a minor miracle that the men in maroon were favourites for promotion just 48 hours before the end of the season. However, events at Hove mean that Northants are stuck in the basement for another season, with two major Test ground counties looking to bounce back immediately in 2018. Promotion this year would have been a wonderful opportunity for the plucky underdog to once against ruin the establishment’s party – especially in the same season city-based cricket was officially announced. The opportunity wasn’t squandered by not winning enough games, or by the deduction of five points, but by Northants’ inability to score runs in the first innings. Too often a strong platform of 150 for two quickly became 220 for eight and, had it not been for the lusty blows by standout player Rory Kleinvelt at the end of the innings, several of our nine wins may not have happened. The ability to take 20 wickets consistently hasn’t been known at the County Ground for quite a few seasons and long may it continue. The white-ball cricket results were disappointing, purely due to the fact that fans have now became used to winning games in the shorter formats, especially in the T20 Blast. Failing to get the two points required from the final three games to reach the knock-out stages was painful. The disappointed feeling will disperse soon enough for Northamptonshire fans, when they come to realise the team continue to punch above their weight. And there is agreement among many that the county are just a few tweaks and a player away from mounting a serious challenge on all three fronts. Peter Short Sussex Every year Sussex supporters are told that we have recruited important new players and that we have a promising bunch of youngsters. And each year the imports disappoint (see Laurie Evans and Ross Taylor) and keep the upcoming players out of the first eleven. We struggle with white-ball cricket, especially the 50-over game, and get better results in County Championship games but we arestill not good enough for promotion. Experienced stalwarts have had varying success. Chris Nash and Luke Wells have done well with the bat and Jofra Archer has been our outstanding bowler. Others have been very disappointing. David Harrison Kent Having been a member of the club since 2004, I had high hopes after a we started the season with four straight wins in the County Championship. But once Jason Gillespie’s short-term coaching contract came to an end, the season effectively went with him. We had just the one win in the Royal London Cup, likewise in the T20 tournament. There was more misery at the tail end of the season with a series of draws and a washout at Derbyshire ensuring another year in Division Two. Matt Walker is a Kent legend but there have to be big question marks over his coaching ability. Once Gillespie left for Australia his shortcomings were exposed. Sam Northeast had a great season with the bat but seemed to lack the motivational qualities necessary to get the best out of those around him. There were far too many key players below par, with Daniel Bell-Drummond, Sean Dickson, Matt Coles three of the main culprits. At 41, Darren Stevens had an awesome season and ended up with 63 county championship wickets at 18.08. It makes you wonder what the rest of the squad have been doing when a player in his fifth decade can produce such outstanding figures. Alastair Milne Gloucestershire As usual the optimism faded rapidly, with our inability to score runs the main culprit. Michael Klinger was an expensive disappointment and we need to look elsewhere next season. We always seem to get the crumbs left on the table and I can’t see much changing. Late season we saw a glimpse of what might be with a couple of youngsters making good scores but the opposition wasn’t great. And the performance in the T20 and Royal London competitions were dreadful. Roll on next season. Mike Glamorgan We had a reasonable season in the T20 Blast, but were not so hot in the 50-over competition. The County Championship has again been rather poor, with quite a number of inept batting performances. The bowling attack has been OK but with no runs to defend it has been another disappointing campaign with little evidence of improvement or advancement. It’s all down to a lack of investment on the playing side unfortunately, as a result of the debt from the redevelopment of Sophia Gardens. Michael Hogan played his heart out in all competitions. And Colin Ingram played outstandingly well in the T20. Huw Griffiths Derbyshire It’s been another normal season for Derbyshire, with the team losing more games than it won. But there were some standout performances in an excellent T20 run that saw the side amass more runs in 20 overs than we often do in 50. It was a shame that Shahid Afridi playing for Northamptonshire decided to roll back the years for one more effort to thwart Ben Godleman, Wayne Madsen and co. But the journey to that point had given promise and a little hope. And that is all we can ask for at Derbyshire. Daniel Simson Durham This season wasn’t a total disaster considering the enforced relegation, key players leaving and a 48-point deduction. Our form in the County Championship was mixed, but beating Derbyshire and Glamorgan both home and away showed signs of promise in a now short season. The T20 Blast campaign was disastrous (finishing bottom of the North group) and we finished a disappointing fifth in the One-Day Cup North table. The evergreen 41-year-old Paul Collingwood is still one of the best players in the English system, ending as Durham’s top scorer in 2017 and remaining eternally reliable. Graham Clark graduated from the second XI and acquitted himself admirably. Californian batsman Cameron Steel proved a good gamble by coach Jon Lewis. Irish international Barry McCarthy should cement himself as one of the leading bowlers in the void left by Graham Onions. Jack Burnham remains the potential world-class talent but he has had a stop-start season with the bat. The last couple of seasons have seen our team depleted of quality, namely Stoneman, Borthwick, Mustard, Jennings and Onions, who all had international experience and whose quality is sorely missed. Paul Coughlin is another loss. Will Smith is returning though and so far we’ve held on to the centrally contracted pair of Stokes and Wood, which should provide us with much needed experience going into 2018 with such a young side. I’m already looking forward to next season. There will be no points deduction so we could potentially make an assault on Division Two, but the likelihood is we’ll finish midtable while bedding in more promising young players. Daniel Winter Leicestershire This has been an absolute unmitigated car crash of a season. No wins in the Championship at all and a total inability to either bowl a side out or bat with any resolve in a second innings. This has been compounded by the harsh early season points deduction and the perplexing departures of established senior players. The club were unable to replace the much respected coach Andrew McDonald. It was clear that new coach Pierre de Bruyne’s abrasive style antagonised an already demoralised and failing squad of players. This led to his late-season departure. County chief executive Wasim Khan has a difficult winter ahead as he tries to recruit talented and committed players and a new coach. The recent two-year contract offered to quickly fading 36-year-old batsman Michael Carberry is symptomatic of the current crisis at Grace Road. The standout player by a mile has been club captain Mark Cosgrove. He deserved much better from those around him.

Elarqam (3.45), the favourite for the Somerville Stakes, is the one whose breeding and price tag leap out of the page, as the son of Frankel out of the dual 1,000 Guineas winner Attraction cost 1.6m guineas at last year’s Book 1 sale at Tattersalls in Newmarket. Mark Johnston, who trained his dam, has stepped him up after a convincing success on his racecourse debut at York this month, a six-runner race that has already produced two subsequent winners. Elarqam won with any amount in hand there, earning a quote of 33-1 for next year’s 2,000 Guineas in the process, and it will be a disappointment if he cannot take this next step up the mountain in his stride. The field for the opening maiden includes both the debutant Midi, who is by Frankel out of the six-times Group One winner Midday, and Ghaiyyath, who cost €1.1m as a foal and is by Dubawi out of the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Nightime. This is a race to watch with an eye to the future, since Ghaiyyath showed promise when third on his debut at Doncaster but still failed to justify strong support, while Sir Michael Stoute, Midi’s trainer, wins with only one in 10 of his juveniles first time up. If there is to be an upset, Para Mio (2.00) could go well at around 16-1, having shown plenty for Seamus Durack to work on when fourth at Ascot on his debut in a race run in a useful time. Summer Chorus (3.10) has found some more improvement since stepping up to seven furlongs and the form of her close second behind Big Tour at Chelmsford last time was boosted when the winner followed up at Yarmouth last week. Reach High, who beat the subsequent Group One winner Harry Angel by a nose at Ascot in May 2016, is an interesting runner later on the card when he makes his first start since, though Sun Lover (5.30) may have the beating of him today. Jupiter (6.15) has run into some useful types in his four starts to date and looks to be starting out his handicapping career on a very fair mark at Chelmsford this evening, while Johnny Cavagin (3.30) and Mac N Cheese (5.40) look best at Pontefract and Perth respectively after both cards passed inspections this morning.

Caroline Bird’s poems have a structural density that frees rather than constrains their energy, as Dave Coates remarks in his review of her collection, The Hat-Stand Union. It’s an important foundation for the kind of risk-taking sometimes employed by poets such as John Ashbery. The more trustworthy the basic verbal logic, the more interesting and various the connecting flights a reader is willing to take through uncertain territory. Her latest collection, In These Days of Prohibition, contains high spirits, humour and fierce sparkle, which sometimes seem distilled from dread. Her personae often dance on sharp emotional ledges, making the measured focus of I Keep My Eyes on the Ground something of an exception. As the penultimate poem in the book’s final section, it draws together the acts of reading and writing, and shows the flux of process essential to them as controllable and pleasurable. The simplest way to read I Keep My Eyes on the Ground is to trust the narrator to realise the performative promise of her title. S/he is looking at different areas of ground, and being reminded of text, and looking at texts as if they were formations of the ground. The almost-shadow (penumbra) of the opening line need not be interpreted as an astronomical phenomenon. Semitones from the scale of shade occur everywhere light falls. Direct address creates a listener: “Your penumbra shimmers with small print / in Papyrus font.” Papyrus font is designed to make English text look like mock-cuneiform, and the two words might also be a way of fusing earth and text visually, perhaps with added metaphor. Hieroglyphics, to a non-reader’s eye, evoke threadlike bird prints, tiny sticks and stalks and droplets. If you stare at them intently, such mirages made of letters can “shimmer” on all kinds of humble surfaces – the city pavement, the woodland floor, the seashore. This is where we arrive in the second stanza, after that mysterious span of metaphor across the stanza break, like a book spine with faded lettering. “Your shadow is a thought // essay typed on the air … ” suggests an at-least-passing aspiration to academic correctness, but the attainment of essay style is swiftly ruffled. The poem’s addressee simply won’t keep still, physically or mentally. “Erased”… “re-written”… “stick-scrawled”, the “proposals” become a more than usually casual game. The wave that “licks its finger” to “flip the beach” displays a comically unsophisticated approach to reading. And it destroys what was written: it radically alters the beach. There may be a glimpse, here, of Philip Sidney writing “her name upon the strand”, the suggestion of a fully personal “you”. This is reinforced by the later statement about the subject’s “honesty”. Does the speaker approve of the “live- / feed emotional updates” and the other shifts the addressee allows? The mutability isn’t only physical. The moral core emerges in another pivotal, stanza-crossing thought: “For you, honesty is constant // amendment … ” The poem might not be so neutral towards the revisions and erasures as its calm rhythms and studied metaphors suggest. Going back to the Papyrus font, the speaker might have already begun to tease the subject. Papyrus has been dubbed “the king of bad fonts”. It’s a little vulgar, like the habit of licking a finger to turn pages. Then there’s the joke about the “notes” that “spool out” from the addressee’s feet to become “footnotes”. The narrator must be smiling at the protagonist here, and perhaps cleverly winding a path between derision and admiration. So the “ground” comes in and out of focus. It seems increasingly human. The person-as-solid-ground is difficult to read. There are both “clarifications” and “erasures”. The unstable ground may signify the changing self, making necessary adaptations and revisions and refusing a fixed identity. I felt this could be read as a love poem, tempted by Philip Sidney and the ambition of the last line: “I try to speed-read fast enough to know you.” Admittedly, this assertion might also be interpreted negatively or ironically. Speed-reading doesn’t usually deepen understanding. But there might be a kind of subject, text or person, so exquisitely volatile they can be known only by this method. It’s worth remembering that the title itself might be, or include, a joke. Eyes kept literally on the ground would look upwards, and so we might reverse the poem’s visual field, taking the words “penumbra” and “shadow” into their astronomical reaches after all. The speaker may not want to look up to the person addressed, or may resist the temptation of dazzlement, and enjoy, instead, being calmly and nonjudgmentally amused – grounded, in fact, by the true fidelity of “constant amendment”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/28/jared-kushner-registered-as-a-female-voter","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T13:27:17Z","webTitle":"Jared Kushner's latest surprise: he is registered as a female voter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/jared-kushner-registered-as-a-female-voter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/jared-kushner-registered-as-a-female-voter","fields":{"headline":"Jared Kushner's latest surprise: he is registered as a female voter","bodyText":"Jared Kushner is no stranger to queries about his form-filling – a request for White House security clearance had to be resubmitted to include all his foreign contacts – but his latest controversy has perhaps come as more of a surprise. He has been registered to vote as a woman for the last eight years. Records filed with the New York state board of elections show Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser registered as a female voter in 2009. The news comes as Kushner’s lawyer acknowledged Kushner used a private email account for official business – despite Trump having regularly excoriated Hillary Clinton for doing the same – and it emerged that the property firm run by his family was being sued for allegedly adding illegal fees to its tenants’ rent. In January it was reported that Kushner was registered to vote in two different US states. Trump has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that he would have got a greater share of the popular vote in last year’s election but for millions of people voting “illegally”. There is no evidence that Kushner has committed voter fraud, which would require him to have deliberately misled the authorities. It is not the first time he has made administrative errors. In July it emerged that he had missed out details of a meeting he attended with Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer when he applied for White House security clearance. He was required to disclose all meetings with foreign government officials over the past seven years and had to include the information on a supplemental form. The errors have led some to question his suitability for such a high-ranking position. “Kushner can’t even fill out the most basic paperwork without screwing it up, so it’s a mystery why anyone thinks he’s somehow going to bring peace to the Middle East,” Brad Bainum, a spokesman for the group that first identified Kushner’s voter slip-up, told Wired. Bainum, a representative of the American Bridge liberal opposition research group, added: “Would anyone but the president’s son-in-law still have a West Wing job after repeated disclosure errors and a botched security clearance form?” Neither Kushner nor the White House have commented publicly on the voter registration reports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/28/football-transfer-rumours-free-agent-carlton-cole-to-join-crystal-palace","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T08:58:22Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Free agent Carlton Cole to join Crystal Palace?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/28/football-transfer-rumours-free-agent-carlton-cole-to-join-crystal-palace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/28/football-transfer-rumours-free-agent-carlton-cole-to-join-crystal-palace","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Free agent Carlton Cole to join Crystal Palace?","bodyText":"Close your eyes, sit back and think yourself back to the 2008-09 season. These were happier times. Innocent times. Sir Alex Ferguson was still warming the bench and indeed the dressing-room air at Manchester United; Arsène Wenger could still be relied upon to qualify Arsenal for the Champions League; and Roy Hodgson’s stock was riding high as he guided Fulham to seventh place in the Premier League and qualification for the Europa League. Who wouldn’t want to go back to 2008-09? Hodgson certainly would, which could be why he seems so keen to sign Carlton Cole. The Englishman, now 33, was still a promising young pup then, and on his way to a best-ever single-season league-only goal return of 10. Since then he has been released by West Ham, signed by West Ham again, released by West Ham again and had spells at Celtic (five games), Sacramento Republic (four) and Persib Bandung (five), the Indonesian side and current answer to the question “where the heck is Michael Essien these days?”. However Crystal Palace, Hodgson’s latest employers, are neck-deep in a striking crisis and any out-of-contract player with Premier League experience, two legs and no crutches is therefore of interest. Manchester United have despatched scouts to Italy, where they are busily monitoring the Roma midfielder and long-term friend of the Mill, Radja Nainggolan. “Mourinho is understood to be making plans for Michael Carrick’s retirement,” reports the Mirror, “and the Belgium international is his first choice. But United are also scouting young people who you might not already have known about for several years, and had a representative keeping a close eye on Keinan Davis during Aston Villa’s 4-0 win over Burton Albion on Tuesday night. They’re not the only ones keen on Keinan, as Arsenal, Everton, Swansea, Stoke and Brighton also had scouts at the game. United scouts have clearly been busy, with news also breaking that they have been avidly pursuing the Sarpsborg midfielder Krepin Diatta. “I’ve spoken to Manchester United’s scouts twice,” the 18-year-old told Norwegian television. “First at the Under-20 World Cup, and again after the game against Brann. To join them would be a dream come true. I think I’m good enough, but we’ll see what happens in the future.” The Sarpsborg sporting director, Thomas Berntsen, has also been chatting about Diatta, insisting “that there are many clubs” watching him, that “he is the most exciting young player in Norway” and that “he will cost a lot of money, without any shadow of doubt”. Elsewhere, Internazionale have abandoned all hope of signing Shkodran Mustafi from Arsenal in January, because they won’t be able to. And the forgotten Watford defender Brice Dja Djedje, left out of the club’s Premier League squad yet again, has vowed to force through a move to Marseille in January. “I hope to leave Watford,” he said. “I can’t bear it any more. It has crossed the line. I’m at my limit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/28/imperial-brands-cigarette-tobacco-palmer-harvey-tesco","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T21:28:36Z","webTitle":"Imperial Brands in talks to rescue wholesaler Palmer & Harvey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/28/imperial-brands-cigarette-tobacco-palmer-harvey-tesco","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/28/imperial-brands-cigarette-tobacco-palmer-harvey-tesco","fields":{"headline":"Imperial Brands in talks to rescue wholesaler Palmer & Harvey","bodyText":"The tobacco firm Imperial Brands is working on a rescue deal for the wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey, which supplies tobacco to Tesco and other retailers. Palmer &amp; Harvey is the biggest cigarette supplier in the UK and employs 4,000 people. Imperial and Japan Tobacco International, which were involved in a refinancing round in early April and each gave Palmer &amp; Harvey a £30m loan, are expected to provide enough funding to keep the firm afloat, allowing it to hammer out a rescue deal with Carlyle, a private equity firm. Imperial, maker of Davidoff and Gauloises cigarettes, said in a trading update that it was working with others to create a sustainable future for Palmer &amp; Harvey, stressing its “close trading relationship”. Another key partner is Tesco, which accounts for about 40% of Palmer &amp; Harvey’s revenues. Any rescue deal is expected to include an extension of the supermarket’s three-year distribution deal with Palmer &amp; Harvey. The wholesale sector has been rocked by Tesco’s £3.7bn takeover of the cash and carry group Booker, which faces an in-depth investigation by the competition watchdog. Industry experts have warned that if Tesco shifts its business from Palmer &amp; Harvey to Booker, the former will not be able to compete. But Tesco could extend its contract with Palmer &amp; Harvey in an attempt to get its Booker takeover cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority. Based in Hove, East Sussex, Palmer &amp; Harvey supplies 12,000 products such as chilled foods and alcohol to 90,000 shops around the country, including large retailers, corner stores and petrol station forecourts. The business, which was launched in 1925, is owned by current and former employees. It is run by Tony Reed, a former Tesco executive who previously managed the supermarket’s 3,000 convenience stores. Reed became chief executive of Palmer &amp; Harvey last October and is expected to stay on after the rescue deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/29/fridays-best-tv-unreported-world-britains-rebel-djs-the-last-leg","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Friday’s best TV: Unreported World; Britain’s Rebel DJs; The Last Leg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/29/fridays-best-tv-unreported-world-britains-rebel-djs-the-last-leg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/29/fridays-best-tv-unreported-world-britains-rebel-djs-the-last-leg","fields":{"headline":"Friday’s best TV: Unreported World; Britain’s Rebel DJs; The Last Leg","bodyText":"Unreported World 7.30pm, Channel 4 The Chinese Communist party tries to keep a lid on all forms of cultural dissent, but in a country increasingly open to western culture, that is proving difficult.

Essex are worthy champions, and it’ll be a delight to have Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire back in Division One. Middlesex and Warwickshire drop down a division and have much to ponder. All that’s for another day, though. Thanks again, and my sincerest apologies that comments have not been open for our last hurrah. It’s a shame, but understandable and beyond our control. Thanks for all your emails, tweets and the rest, it’s kept things moving! All being well we will be back next April, comments open and raring to go. Here’s the last round of results: Division One: Warwickshire drew with Hampshire Somerset beat Middlesex by 231 runs Lancashire beat Surrey by 7 wickets Essex beat Yorkshire by 376 runs Division Two: Worcestershire beat Durham by 137 runs Sussex drew with Notts Northamptonshire beat Leicestershire by 6 wickets Derbyshire beat Gloucestershire by 157 runs Glamorgan beat Kent by 5 wickets Thanks again, and good night! Good question. Middlesex go down with Warwickshire, by a single point. That’s a draw, and there are huge cheers from the Hampshire dressing room. Vince batted superbly to save that. 3 balls left: defended, and no run. This is last chance saloon for Middlesex. 4 balls left: driven through mid-off, where there obviously isn’t a fielder, and Abbott takes two... 5 balls left: that’s four: Abbott turns round the corner and it runs away to the fence. Hampshire almost out of the woods. 6 balls left: Jeetan is done, as Holland turns to short leg along the floor. One more over this summer. OHD bowling to Abbott. Three wickets required. 7 balls left: Jeetan takes his time over this one. There’s an lbw shout but I could hear the wood from here. 8 balls left: edged! From round the wicket, Jeetan has take Holland’s edge and it’s dashed between Ambrose and Trott at slip! Runs away for four... No hand to it. 9 balls left: defended firmly to silly point. 10 balls left: appeal, hit on the pad, miles outside the line, no dice. 11 balls left: Holland defends to short leg. Jeetan Patel is coming on. Of course he is. Two short legs, two legslips, silly point, slip. 12 balls left! I might as well go ball by ball. Berg and Holland have put on 61 here since Vince fell, and it’s been vital. Chapeau. Ian Holland, another stray Aussie who has come through second team cricket, has proved quite a find this year. He’s faced 84 balls. But now Berg has been bowled by OHD. 14 balls to go, three wickets remaining!!!! Three overs left! Hampshire starting to look like they want to win this... (74 required) Getting very close to the point where we can pack up and go home. Not quite, though. It only takes four balls... Four. More. Overs. Five overs left. My word, this has been a slow death for Middlesex. Almost exactly five hours since they lost their game against Somerset. Six to go, and Hampshire looking very solid. Sidebottom has three left, and they are the key... Lights coming on at Edgbaston... Seven overs to go... Right, Hampshire have eight overs to survive. New ball taken. Four wickets in hand. Nine overs left ... Warwickshire need the breakthrough asap. OHD to bowl the last before the new ball. 10 overs. This partnership has been a fine one, lasting 11 overs now. Jeetan to bowl what will surely be his last before Warwickshire have a dip with the new ball. OHD back, and there's a huge lbw shout against Berg on 20! No dice. 12 overs left. Warwickshire have more helmeted fielders than un-helmeted; two short-legs, to leg-slips, and silly-point. Jeetan into his penultimate over I suspect, with the new ball due in four. Hear hear Lovely stuff. Tense here too... Now six fielders close in round the bat for Jeetan... Holland resisting well, Berg wheeling away busily as ever. 16 overs remaining, then. Into the final hour. New ball due in eight. Four wickets standing. David Lloyd, a Worcestershire supporter, writes: Yes, the 5 point deduction hurt Northants, but they had 15 fewer batting bonus points than Notts, and 16 fewer than Worcs, so there are other reasons too. Also, as a Worcester supporter, Ashwin really turned up for us. 7 wickets and 82 runs in this match, for a start. Certainlt earned whatever we paid him. Correct on both counts. Let’s hope Ashwin returns at some stage next year, although I think the Duke John Hastings is signed on for another year. Indeed. They finished five points behind Notts, but won two more games, so would have gone up without it. Tres’s trick is catching on! So this is the only game still going this season... Feels rather odd. Hampshire have four wickets in hand, and 18 overs to survive. Eight of them could be with a new ball. Jeetan is swapping ends. Wahoo! Match drawn at Hove as Sussex declare on 229 for seven. Notts get the draw they need for promotion in second place! Ashwin gets his fifth wicket, his second five-wicket haul for Worcestershire, dismissing Onions, who made 15 from 10 in his final game for Durham. It’s all over: Worcestershire are Division Two champions! You can watch this here, by the way. Keep this tab open, mind. Here’s the Vince wicket. Total opposite, actually. Dug in gallantly, lasted 124 balls. And not sure he hit the one he was given out to. Derbyshire beat Gloucestershire by 157 runs! Wicket! Vince gone, and he can’t believe it! He doesn’t reckon he’s hit this, and is crawling off very slowly. But the finger has gone up, and it looks a belting delivery from Sidebottom. That’s the big one. Berg in now. Hope remains for Middlesex... 21 overs remain after this one. Said it before, I’ll say it again. This is not how an exclusive works. Durham nine down and Ashwin on a hat-trick! Worcestershire are about to become Division Two champions! Vince is out of the 20s, where he had been for 91 balls... 24 more overs for Hampshire to survive. Ha! Been an absolutely superb season for Northants. Well done them. Nine wins and no promotion feels mad and sad but no doubt they will celebrate heartily tonight nonetheless. I fancy The Other Ryan Sidebottom to take a heap of wickets in Division Two next year. I’ve seen him a few times now, and today is by some distance the quickest he’s looked. Late swing as well. His brother, brilliantly, is an Aussie Rules player for Collingwood called Steele Sidebottom. We will get a new ball with eight overs remaining in the match. Could be fascinating... Wicket! Dawson had dug in so well but he has flashed hard at The Other Ryan Sidebottom and is caught at first slip by Jeetan! 32.4 overs left... A fourth ton of the season for Luke Wells, who is now top of the Division Two run charts, and behind only Sanga. Great effort. Draw incoming, and promotion for Notts. So, here we go for the final session of the season. Jeetan is swapping ends. The short boundary is there for both Vince and Dawson if they fancy taking it on on the legside. Probably unwise. 33 overs to survive. Norwell wins the long-running trophy! Congratulations, Liam (and namesake). Don’t forget, Hampshire do have some fans, though... RomeoRomeoTango writes: Afternoon Will, afternoon everyone. I’ve been otherwise engaged. Am I a bad person for having certain thoughts about Edgbaston? Didn’t think so. Looking very much like the neutrals – and Durham fans – won’t get what they want from this game... News: And that’s tea: Hampshire are 113 for three. Partnership of 41 in more than 28 overs between Vince and Dawson has taken them to the brink of safety. 33 overs remaining, and 25 before the new ball. There will be one tough hour, you’d think, for Warwickshire to go hard in hunt of wickets. If Hampshire get through that, hands may well be shaken. It is looking overwhelmingly like Middlesex are going down. Durham six down. One great offie gets another: Pringle goes to Ashwin. Worcestershire should win. Tea at Grace Road! Northants are two down, needing 43. Procter has 84. Tea is 15 minutes away, the partnership is 40 in 25 overs, and Trott turns to Matt Lamb, his partnership breaker. Warwickshire need six wickets in 39 overs if Middlesex are to go down. Hampshire looking very solid, and it’s 111 for four. Durham are five down! Barnard gets Graham Clark. Finishing with a flourish. Four men round the bat to Jeetan for Dawson. 107 for four now... These two have batted very well indeed. Collingwood gets one that stays low from Barnard at Grace Road and he’s gone! He put on 88 with Graham Clark, who has 62, and Durham need 231 more, while Worcestershire need six wickets. 51 balls for Dawson’s four. Vince, after 23 balls on 24, takes a single and Hampshire move to 100 for four. The first run off the bat in eight overs. 20 balls on 24 for Vince... No runs off the bat for seven overs here.... Hampshire 99 for four. They are just cricketing their way to handshakes at Hove, where Sussex are none down leading by 175 with 47 overs left. They wouldn’t fancy a little declaration and a dart at some stage would they? Vince and Dawson have dragged Hampshire to 99 for four, putting on 27 in 13 overs. They need 160 to win. That feels unlikely, so they need to survive 49 overs to draw. Northants are going nicely, but it’s not likely to matter. Procter has another 50, and they need 93 to beat Leicestershire with nine wickets in hand. Really sorry, but looking very much like comments won’t be going on all day. Totally out of my hands and to do with cricketing goings on way beyond the county game. 24 balls on 0 for Liam Dawson ... Warwickshire need six more wickets to send Hampshire down. Jeetan into his work from the Birmingham End. Vince has zipped to 14 with a couple of lovely backfoot drives through the offside. 82 for four, needing 177. Wayne Noon, the CLO, said that the pitch was “below average” because of excessive turn but that does not constitute any points penalties (it’s the first one of those down here). Bailey was reverse-sweeping, by the way... Wicket! Bailey gone! Hampshire have lost three wickets in 19 balls since lunch. Bailey gone second ball to Jeetan (lbw), and in comes Dawson to join Vince. Jennings’ final innings for Durham ends on 20. Gone to Ashwin. Durham 48 for three, and Worcestershire marching to the Division Two title. Wicket! Next over, Alsop edges a Jeetan turner to slip! Simple for Trotty. To be fair, that looked very likely to happen before lunch. Three down, 191 required... Indeed. Big session until tea for Hants, because if Warwickshire aren’t looking like winning by then, you could see the relegated team’s head dropping. Wicket! What a ball! Ervine straight drove Sidebottom for four, but third ball after lunch he is gone! It’s angled in at the pads and jagged away and been caught behind. Ambrose was heading legside to take it. Ervine bashes his pad on the way off. Need 191 more. The Ashes’s James Vince in. We are back underway. Robin Durie writes: I’m sitting in a sun-kissed Taunton, having watched Leach &amp; van de Merwe bowl beautifully to dismiss Middlesex before lunch. The ball that got Voges from Leach was a real ripper - dipped into his pads, then gripped, turned &amp; bounced to take the outside edge. Whilst it was thrilling to watch attacking spin bowling in such an important match, it was disappointing to see how easily Middlesex capitulated. It’s hard to fathom what the England selectors see in Crane that they don’t see in Leach (who, btw, bowled unchanged from the River End for the entirety of both Middlesex innings). It might be time for a half of zyderrr! Middlesex were bowled out twice for a combined 255... Very, very poor. Special bloke. I’m off to grab a bite of lunch. Play to start at 1pm at Hove. Hopefully some time very soon we will be able to open the comments section. And that is lunch. Hampshire have survived the first hour, and their batsmen will learn now that if they survive two more session, they will retain their Division One status. 65 overs to survive, or 195 runs to score. One to savour, Somerset fans. Well, moments after Somerset completed their victory, Jeetan thought he had Alsop, twice. No dice. Hampshire need 200... It’s over by 241 runs. Leach takes the last wicket Finn lbw - to finish with five (for the fourth time this year). 2000 rise to their feet ... and they’ve escaped. Over to you Will... Tim Sanders (DaddyPig) has been in touch. Jeetan Patel is a very tricky proposition for left-handers on the fourth day, bowling into the rough stuff created by right-arm over bowlers. But is there any turn from a good line and length to threaten the right-handers ? If he tries bowling into the leg-stump rough like he did at Headingley last week, then Hampsvaal will get ‘em (and stay up) in byes. He’s turning it, but it’s not a fourth day track at the mo. First day missed due to rain. Good spot. He has 4 for 16. Murtagh bowled swinging at vdm 101-9... Right then, here comes Jeetan Patel. Bit late imo. Two lefties in, nine to get, 49 for one. Turn straight away. 93-8 Harris, caught from a top-edge sweep against van der Merwe. Quantocks still fully visible... Warwickshire have been a bit pants this morning, and Jeetan really can’t be far away. Stuie not giving up yet. Charlie Ball - or HighPeakGeek BTL - has been in touch with regards to Lancashire. “It has been a great season for Lancs,” Charlie writes. “What’s really gone unnoticed is that with the exception of Haseeb (for reasons that have been documented but not, I think necessarily absorbed by some commentators) and arguably the skipper himself (who remains very underrated but who may be winding his career down), all the first team regulars who have come up through the system appear to have improved this season. It’s not just the obvious ones like Al Davies, Liam Livingstone and Matt Parkinson. Steven Parry, Tom Bailey and especially Jordan Clark have come on as well. And Lancs have a cracking set of young players waiting to come up. And all in the wake of the untimely retirement of the popular and talented Tom Smith over the winter. “My only real disappointments are that Rob Jones and especially Arron Lilley haven’t had much chance this season, and Simon Kerrigan may not have a Lancs future. And that Yorkshire stayed up, obviously.” Interestingly, I reckon even Hameed has improved actually. Seems much steelier for his summer, and a shame that it ended in injury. Now needs to work out how to turn over the strike more. Lloyds Leach strikes in the first over of Durham’s chase. Of course he does. Steel gone. Jennings have his last bat for Durham. It’s 6 for 1. Alsop edges wide of third slip for four! 38 for one... Ah so there is a contrivance at Bristol! Sorry I missed this. Good to see. Gloucestershire declared overnight, 236 behind, then Derbyshire smashed 144 for none in 13.4 overs (nice work if you can get it for Ben Slater and Luis Reece). Gloucestershire are now 15 for one (Podmore with the wicket of Howell), requiring another 366 in 72 overs. Hell of a lot of sawdust out there at Edgbaston. 28 for one. Stirling ct Overton b van der Merwe 80-7 ... at slip again VDM actually looking more dangerous than the other two at the moment. Simpson lbw Leach 80-6 - stuck on back foot..did it turn enough? Leach’s 50th wicket of the season Certainly right up there. Remarkable, really. Three full-point wins better than any other side. The only team they didn’t beat this summer was Lancashire, who finished second. Worcestershire declare! Durham need 370 to win in 74 overs. Mitchell made 123, and Graham Onions was given a big ovation. Lovely. Watch live! Warwickshire v Hampshire at Edgbaston Somerset v Middlesex at Taunton Hannon-Dalby has found extravagant movement in his first over. This would be one hell of a chase from Hampshire. Here’s the Leach wicket. Lovely ball. Alsop and Ervine on the way out for Hampshire. Wright to get Warwickshire going. Agree. Plenty of good things happening at Old Trafford and – though members will not want to admit it – plenty of them were put in place under Ashley Giles. Hearing that they plan to spend the winter spending big. Right, well I’m pleased to say we are five minutes away from getting going at Edgbaston. Middlesex badly need Warwickshire to take nine wickets in 80 overs. After a period of calm Voges ct Overton (at slip) b Leach ... pushing forward defensively and an outside edge ... anticipating more belligerence from Stirling. 71-5. 100 for Daryl Mitchell! What a guy. The Woosters crack on. Worcestershire just seem to be merrily batting their way to the Division Two title. They are 324 in front and Daryl Mitchell is approaching his seventh century of the summer. Here’s that catch Vic referenced. Tres, you absolute marvel. As Paul Frame points out, the Essex groundsman Stuart Kerrison, the best on the circuit for both pitches and chat, has been at it again. Livi ends 69 not out, and Lancashire finish second, Surrey third. Lancashire share £240,000 worth of prize money, Surrey get £115,000. Graham Porter asks: Will, If the erstwhile BTLers are yet to be conVinced, do you think you might be able to open the comments if (sorry, once) he starts stroking Sid the 2nd and OHD all around south Birmingham? Or is the real reason something else that I definitely only dreamed seeing on the Sun website late last night? I have no idea what this thing on the Sun you’re asking about is, but it’s certainly not a dream, it’s a cricketing nightmare... I’m looking forward to some sleep, but I am also a bit sad. Can’t wait to get back to Worcester next year either. Lee Smith writes talking about Chris Read. What a cricketer he’s been. He points me in the direction of this rather nice appreciation. I have to say, I’m a bit sad that Northants are missing out on promotion, but what a wonderful way to sign off for Read. Fully deserved, and he has been a very special county cricketer. A good question from John Atherton! “Earlier in the season,” he asked, “there was a rumour that Moeen Ali was going to swap Worcs for Warks. As the two counties are swapping divisions, is that rumour dead?” There is a funny story about this. Moeen’s agent thought his Worcestershire contract ended this September, and he would therefore be able to move now. But it doesn’t, it ends next September, so that idea was dead in the water. He still lives in Birmingham and I wouldn’t be remotely surprised if ends up going back at some stage. 11.30 start at Edgbaston. 16 overs have been lost, so Hampshire have 80 to survive, basically. Eskinazi ct Trescothick b van der Merwe 43 for 4. A remarkable catch. Trescothick fields on his knees in the gully for spinners, which is odd and possibly unique. The ball before the ball had looped over his head off the edge - why doesn’t he stand up?. Next ball another edge that comes to him an inch off the ground. Trescothick lurches forward from his kneeling position and holds on. Inspection underway here, and warm-ups happening in earnest. Maybe start at 11.30? This indeed the problem. Not that I’ve heard. Not aware that they are actually behind the rate, which is for the match: the amount of spin they bowled in the first innings probably means they had plenty of leeway. Inspection at 10.45am here at Edgbaston. A delay at Hove, too. Good news for Notts. The stumps are actually in the ground at Edgbaston, so mayeb the start isn’t too far away. Quantocks visible just about and hazy sunshine for the last day of Matthew Maynard’s period in charge and that of the Somerset physio, Darren Veness. And the equation is simple, as most of you will know. If Somerset win they stay in the first division, provided there are no points deduction outrages. As for Middlesex, if they avoid defeat they are safe; if Hampshire lose at Edgbaston, they are safe. On another day it would be the sole topic of debate among the cricketing fraternity, but my suspicions are that may not be the case. Interestingly, Hampshire’s team bus is parked up just outside Edgbaston in a layby – ready for a swift getaway? Definitely a delayed start here. Will keep you posted. Hampshire will be delighted. Delayed start at Grace Road, where Northamptonshire need 180 to beat Leicestershire. Thank you for following Stuie – already a true stalwart! I wonder if Gloucestershire and Derbyshire will contrive something at Bristol? The rain in Birmingham was fairly torrential overnight so the umpires are just doing a little inspection. May be a slightly delayed start. Indeed. We are endeavouring to have comments open as soon as possible so all this chatter can go on BTL. Once more with feeling. We are almost there, the setting of the season. Welcome to the final day of the 2017 County Championship season. I’ve no idea what number County Cricket - live! this is for the summer (the fixture list is too imperfect to know), but this is certainly the last. It’s been emotional. A word of thanks to all of you who’ve read, commented, emailed, tweeted, argued and the rest. It’s been great fun. I’m afraid that, for obvious but unavoidable cricketing reasons, comments have to be closed for now. Hopefully we can crack them open some time very soon. See above or below for how to contact me in the meantime – I will endeavour to include them all ATL to keep the conversation going. Anyway, business: we are not quite done yet! I’m Will Macpherson and I’m at Edgbaston, where Hampshire need to avoid defeat against Warwickshire to stay in Division One. In a game with a top score so far of 188, Hampshire are 20 for one, needing another 239 runs. If Warwickshire take nine wickets, Hampshire are in deep strife. They are in deep strife because of events at Taunton, where m’colleague Vic Marks lies in wait. Somerset, armed with Leach and Bess, need seven more Middlesex wickets to win. Middlesex need an improbable 305 runs to win. Indeed it’s highly improbable that they are capable of batting all day, even if the pitch has calmed. If Middlesex lose, they need Hampshire to lose if they are to survive. Worcestershire are up! Great news. CC - live! from New Road next year sounds fun. After heroics from Chris Read, in his final game, and tomorrow’s man Billy Root, it looks overwhelmingly like Nottinghamshire will get the draw they need to go up. If you’d told me on Finals Day that it would prove this much of a struggle for them I’d have laughed right in your face. It feels like Northamptonshire, who need another 180 runs against Leicestershire, are going to end up with nine wins but remain in Division Two. Extraordinary, and a shame. Here’s the scores on the doors: Division One: Essex beat Yorkshire by 376 runs Middlesex 142 &amp; 40-3 v Somerset 236 &amp; 250-9d Lancashire 268 &amp; 132-3 v Surrey 201-8d &amp; 242 Hampshire 116 &amp; 20-1 v Warwickshire 188 &amp; 186 Division Two: Northants 202 &amp; 17-0 v Leicestershire 128 &amp; 270 Nottinghamshire 477 v Sussex 565 Worcestershire 335 &amp; 157-3 v Durham 208 Glamorgan beat Kent by 5 wickets Gloucestershire 224-2 v Derbyshire 460 And here’s yesterday’s report from Chelmsford and roundup of the rest. I can still be contacted! Here’s how: By email: will.macpherson.freelance@theguardian.com On Twitter: @willis_macp I greatly look forward to hearing from you.

The environment secretary said the government would examine “legal or policy avenues” to end the scheme that has triggered months of protests by residents. On a visit to the city on Wednesday, Gove said he hoped a “decent conversation” with Sheffield city council would help solve the dispute. But he added: “It is also the case that we will explore what legal or policy avenues we have. “In some respects time is marching on and with every week that passes more trees are designated for felling but I’ve asked the [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] lawyers and policy officials to let me know what we can do either now or in the future to cause the council to pause, think again and go down a different route.” Gove’s intervention comes a month after Sheffield city council dismissed his demands to halt the programme, which involves 6,000 trees being chopped down as part of a 25-year £2bn highway maintenance scheme. It also emerged on Thursday that the council has spent £250,000 on legal fees in defending its tree-felling operation, including £149,660 on costs connected to a high court order barring people from standing inside safety zones erected around doomed trees. Council bosses say the programme is essential if the city’s 36,000 street trees are to be managed for future generations. It insists the trees earmarked for felling are dying, diseased or dangerous – a claim disputed by residents and campaigners. Gove met two pensioners and a Green party councillor who are among those who have been arrested while trying to stop council contractors chopping down trees. Speaking after the meeting, he told the Yorkshire Post: “Having listened to people who have been on the frontline, it seems to me clear that the council has no adequate defence for continuing to cut down trees in the way that it has been. “Sheffield is losing, we are losing, an amazingly valuable natural resource and the justification for it seems as flimsy as an autumn leaf. The idea that because tree roots might potentially cause a kerbstone here to be slightly out of alignment or might theoretically pose a risk to someone’s mobility and therefore that justifies felling trees that have been here for generations is bonkers. “What the council should be doing, I think, is trying to work with the contractor, Amey, to find different solutions rather than cutting down trees.” Sheffield city council has been approached for a comment. Speaking before Gove’s statement, Bryan Lodge, the council’s cabinet member for the environment, said: “We hope that following his visit, Michael Gove will now have a more informed understanding of the work we are doing, in partnership with his government on the Streets Ahead programme, which will transform our roads and pavements and ensure long-term benefits for the people of Sheffield.” Last month the council obtained a high court injunction in an attempt to prevent protesters from standing in the way of tree-felling contractors – a new legal avenue following a spate of arrests in scenes compared by Nick Clegg, the former Sheffield Hallam MP, to “something you’d expect to see in Putin’s Russia”. Campaigners have vowed to continue their opposition, blockading a council depot to prevent tree-felling workers from leaving hours after the injunction came into force last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/sep/28/brexit-press-conference-davis-barnier-theresa-may-speech-may-hits-back-at-corbyn-saying-free-market-greatest-agent-of-human-progress-ever-created-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T15:35:36Z","webTitle":"CBI and TUC jointly urge government to unilaterally guarantee rights of EU nationals after Brexit - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/28/brexit-press-conference-davis-barnier-theresa-may-speech-may-hits-back-at-corbyn-saying-free-market-greatest-agent-of-human-progress-ever-created-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/28/brexit-press-conference-davis-barnier-theresa-may-speech-may-hits-back-at-corbyn-saying-free-market-greatest-agent-of-human-progress-ever-created-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"CBI and TUC jointly urge government to unilaterally guarantee rights of EU nationals after Brexit - Politics live","bodyText":"The Brexit negotiations could be in a stalemate for months unless the UK agrees to honour all its financial commitments, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has suggested at the end of the latest round of talks. The CBI and the TUC have issued a joint statement urging the government to unilaterally guarantee that EU nationals will be able to stay in the UK after Brexit. They say the uncertainty facing the 4m EU nationals in the UK and Britons living on the continent has become “intolerable” and that these people need reassurance now in case the Brexit talks end without a deal. (See 2.11pm.) Theresa May has dropped a strong hint that the government will stop ordering planes from the US aerospace giant Boeing following the decision to slap punitive tariffs on planes part-made in Belfast by the Canadian company Bombardier. Damian Green, one of the prime minister’s closest allies in the cabinet, has insisted she will fight the next election, hinting he expects votes for the Lib Dems to deliver a Tory victory. May has conceded her party was not ready when she called a snap general election in which the Conservatives lost their majority despite a hefty lead in opinion polls. The former chair of the BBC Trust Rona Fairhead has been appointed as an international trade minister with a life peerage, Downing Street has announced. Gordon Brown has said the Bank of England will be vulnerable to populist demands to “take back control” unless elected politicians accept joint responsibility for heading off future financial crises. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. A slight tremor at the department for education as the long-serving education minister in the Lords, John Nash, steps down, to be replaced by the newly-enobled businessman Theodore Agnew. Although the role is officially that of parliamentary under-secretary of state, Nash’s job was that of minister for academies, after being appointed by Michael Gove back in 2013. It’s a like-for-like swap: Nash was a Conservative party donor who founded a chain of academy schools; likewise Agnew is a Tory party donor who founded a chain of academies and free schools - in Agnew’s case the Inspiration Trust in Norfolk. Agnew takes over a tricky brief, with multi-academy trust governance under strain amid a growing suspicion that the DfE has failed to build a system that can scale up. As more schools have become self-governing academies, the number of DfE staff devoted to fire-fighting has multiplied. The teaching unions are among the more suspicious, with the National Education Union (the merged NUT-ATL) saying that Agnew “will be dogged by the same issues as his predecessor over the future of this directionless policy. Every week brings news of a new financial scandal or collapse of a previously celebrated academy chain.” The Lib Dems’ education shadow Layla Moran says that Agnew “must make guarantees that his own personal involvement in the free school movement will not stop him from being impartial when looking at the evidence of the many problems with the delivery of this programme.” As Daniel Boffey, Jennifer Rankin and Lisa O’Carroll report, the European parliament has drawn up a resolution, to be voted on next Tuesday, saying there is clear evidence that EU nationals are being treated unfairly in the UK and that Britons in mainland Europe are also suffering. They report: “Recent administrative incidents have demonstrated that discrimination against citizens of the EU27 in the United Kingdom and UK citizens in the EU27 is already taking place and is having an impact on the daily lives of the citizens concerned, limiting the effective exercise of their rights,” the document says. The resolution also attacks the British government’s handling of the Brexit negotiations and claims that for May to live up to her pledge that there will be no physical infrastructure at the Irish border after Brexit, the province of Northern Ireland will have to stay in the customs union. The European parliament will have the right to veto any agreement between the EU and the UK. Barnier meets its Brexit steering committee almost weekly. Strong language is used in the nine-page resolution about Britain’s positions, including what it describes as a failure to provide concrete proposals on the financial settlement. The draft resolution says that “so far the absence of any clear proposals has seriously impeded the negotiations”. You can read the resolution in full here (pdf). Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leadership contender backed by Jeremy Corbyn supporters, has chastised members of his own team and those of his rival Anas Sarwar after a bruising spat between the two camps. Leonard urged his supporters to “conduct the campaign in a spirit of comradeship” and “as the proponents of hope and change” after both sides exchanged abuse and counter-accusations against each other on Wednesday. The dispute erupted after Alex Rowley, Scottish Labour’s interim leader, was recorded telling delegates at Labour conference in Brighton that he backed Leonard and that left-wingers in the Scottish party had long wanted to replace Kezia Dugdale, who stood down suddenly last month. The dispute, which erupted while Corbyn was commending Scottish Labour for its unity in his conference speech, has vented long-standing tensions between the party’s centrists and its Corbynites over policy and their loyalty to the UK leader. In a transcript published in full by the Sun, Rowley told two delegates: “Although I’m neutral in the leadership, I believed that Richard Leonard has everything that we need to win in 2021.” Rowley’s neutrality as acting leader was questioned after he appeared to set up Sarwar up for ridicule by Nicola Sturgeon at first minister’s questions last week over Sarwar’s use of private schools for his kids and his family firm’s decision to pay its staff the minimum wage. Rowley cited Labour’s catchphrase “the many not the few” in an exchange with Sturgeon on child poverty and taxing the rich. Rowley’s daughter Danielle Rowley, the newly-elected Labour MP for Midlothian, is Leonard’s campaign manager. Jackie Baillie, one of Labour’s most senior MSP and a close ally of Sarwar’s, accused Rowley of hypocrisy over his remarks in Brighton since they proved the left was secretly plotting against Dugdale while publicly demanding loyalty to Corbyn. In retaliation, Leonard’s press officer Stephen Low, a Unison official, sent out a press release referring to Baillie’s remarks as “pish” – the Scots vernacular for piss. The dispute has unnerved Leonard’s camp as it allows Sarwar’s allies to present Rowley’s remarks as evidence of leftwing disloyalty and factionalism to Scottish Labour’s 22,000 members and the 11,500 or so affiliates and registered members. Until now, Sarwar had lost significant momentum in the attacks on his private schooling, his £20,000 a year income from shares in the family firm and the company’s lack of unionisation. In a long statement, Leonard said: There is no place in this campaign for making unfounded allegations about colleagues and fellow party members, for any abuse including online, or for that matter using language that lowers the tone. I make clear to my supporters that we are conducting this campaign as the proponents of hope and change, and not the old way of doing things, and that starts with my campaign itself – where there is no place for the kind of language we saw yesterday [...] I call on everyone in Scottish Labour to conduct this leadership election in a way that strengthens rather than weakens the unity and effectiveness of our party. Each candidate’s team must work towards this objective. A House of Lords committee has released a report saying the EU withdrawal bill gives ministers “unacceptably-wide” law making powers. The delegated powers and regulatory reform committee proposes a number of changes to the bill, including proposing that MPs and peers should be able to force a vote on significant secondary legislation being introduced under the bill. The bill will give ministers so-called Henry VIII powers to amend primary legislation using secondary legislation on matters relating to Brexit. There are different methods of scrutinising secondary legislation in parliament. The most important measures go through the affirmative procedure, which means MPs and peers have to vote in favour for them to become law. But much secondary legislation goes through the negative procedure, which means it automatically becomes law unless either the Commons or Lords votes it down. Since it is up to the government to decide if a vote takes place, negative procedure secondary legislation almost never gets blocked. The Lords committee says, if ministers want to use the negative procedure to pass secondary legislation under the bill, “a committee of each House, or a joint committee of both Houses, should be given 10 days to overturn the minister’s proposal and upgrade scrutiny to the affirmative procedure.” Commenting on the proposal, Lord Blencathra, the Conservative former minister who chairs the committee, said: The European Union (withdrawal) bill is one of the most important bills in the constitutional history of the UK, and it seeks to confer on ministers an extensive range of powers, unique in peace-time. We have put forward what we think is a sensible proposal which will enable the government to use secondary legislation to implement the decision to withdraw from the EU whilst ensuring that it is parliament – not the government – which decides the level of scrutiny applied to that legislation. MPs will get the chance to amend the bill during its committee stage later in the autumn, and it is likely that amendments creating a sifting mechanism of the sort proposed by the Lords committee will get enough support to pass. In an unusual move the CBI and the TUC have issued a joint statement about Brexit. It is about the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. With speculation continuing that the UK could end up leaving the EU with no deal, they are both demanding an assurances that the EU nationals will be allowed to stay regardless of what else is agreed, or not agreed, in Brussels. In the statement Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, and Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, say: After 15 months of human poker, the uncertainty facing 4m European and UK citizens has become intolerable. It is a blight on the values of our nations. Millions of workers and thousands of firms are today united in their call to leaders on both sides to find an urgent solution. A clear guarantee of the right to remain for citizens in both the UK and EU27 is needed within weeks. EU citizens account for 10% of registered doctors and 4% of registered nurses across the UK. Millions more work in the public and private sectors delivering public services and making a vital contribution to our economy. They need to hear that they will be allowed to remain in the UK, whatever the eventual outcome of negotiations. Not only is this important for our economy, it is the right thing to do. Once agreed, this guarantee must be implemented independently of the rest of the negotiations to avoid the risk that ‘no deal’ in March 2019 leads to uncertainty and heartache for millions of people. A unilateral guarantee that EU nationals will be allowed to stay in the UK, regardless of what happens in the Brexit talks, is a longstanding Labour party demand too. Campaigners for EU citizens’ rights said there were some “really positive” agreements in the 4th round of talks. In particular, it welcomes the EU agreement to Theresa May’s proposal that they could have their right to retain their rights written into the withdrawal agreement. That will give the law “direct effect”, allowing EU citizens to challenge any future attempt to tinker with their rights in the British courts. “The direct effect is really welcome. I think it is really positive because it will mean if there any attempt to change our rights by a future government, or the Home Office, we will be able to challenge in in the UK courts,” said Nicolas Hatton, the co-chair of the3million. British in Europe, which represents 10 groups of British nationals living on the continent has also welcomed Davis’s declaration they they would have a lifetime “right to return” to the UK. They had voiced concern that those who had settled abroad would be restricted in their ability to return to the UK in future to look after sick relatives for example. The3million are still pushing for the UK courts to be able to refer disputes over their legacy rights to the ECJ in future, something Michel Barnier described as a continuing “stumbling block”. Downing Street has announced that two business figures are being given peerages and made unpaid government ministers. Rona Fairhead, the former Financial Times chief executive and former chair of the BBC Trust, is being made a minister of state for international trade. And Sir Theodore Agnew, a businessman and founder of a trust that runs academies, is being made a junior education minister. Here are the main points from the press conference with David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. On the negotiations overall Barnier said it could take “months” before the EU agrees to move the Brexit talks to phase two, where the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU will be discussed. The EU wants the talks to move on as soon as possible. Originally it was hoped that the move to phase two might take place after a summit of EU leaders towards the end of next month but that now looks unlikely. (See 12.13pm.) Davis gave an overall assessment of this weeks talks that was notably more upbeat than Barnier’s. Davis said in his opening remarks. I believe that thanks to the constructive and determined manner with which both sides have conducted these negotiations we are making decisive steps forward. But Barnier said in his opening remarks: We managed to create clarity on some points. On others, however, more work remains to be done. We are not there yet. Rights of EU citizens Davis said the UK had agreed that the withdrawal agreement, giving rights to EU nationals, would have “direct effect” in UK law. We must also acknowledge that a major question remains open between us – it relates to the enforcement of citizens rights after we leave the European Union. The UK has been clear that, as a third country outside of the European Union, it would not be right for this role to be performed by the European court of justice. But we have listened to the concerns that have been raised – and as a direct result of hearing those concerns the United Kingdom has committed to incorporating the final withdrawal agreement fully into UK law. Direct effect if you like. We also recognise the need to ensure the consistent interpretation of EU law concepts. We have not agreed the right mechanism for doing this yet but discussions this week have again been productive. During the Q&amp;A Davis said there would be nothing unusual about this. We accept, and have done from the start, that there is a need for certainty for them [EU nationals]. That’s what we are aiming to produce, without allowing the European court of justice to make rulings within and on cases in the UK. And this is the compromise we are working towards. It is not unusual. There are plenty of arrangements where we have treaties that confine what the United Kingdom [can] do - very specific, with very real aims. And that’s what we are doing here. Barnier welcomed this, saying that agreeing “direct effect” was very important. He said: It will give the assurance to our citizens that they will be able to invoke their rights, as defined by the withdrawal agreement, before UK courts. We agreed to guarantee - for the citizens concerned - that the UK will apply EU law concepts in a manner that is consistent with EU law after Brexit. But Barnier also renewed his call for the European court of justice to play a role in guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals after Brexit. He said: We failed to agree that the European court of justice must play an indispensable role in ensuring this consistency. This is a stumbling block for the EU. Barnier said a “big gap” remained between the EU and the UK on the issue of family reunification (what happens if an EU national living in the UK after Brexit wants a relative to move there too) and that there were other issues to be resolved too. He said: There are others [areas of disagreement]. 1) A big gap remains between our positions on family reunification. We want existing rights to continue for the citizens concerned. 2) The export of social security benefits also remains to be discussed. 3) Citizens need simplified administrative procedures. The UK stated its intention to put in place a streamlined system. Davis said the UK has decided that EU nationals with permanent residency documents will not have to go through a full application process all over again to be allowed to stay in the UK after Brexit. He said: We have provided further reassurance on how European Union citizens will be able to apply for a new status, once we leave. And we know that those already holding permanent residency documents should not have to go through the full process. So we presented early thinking on detailed processes and plans on how we might ensure this does not happen. Davis said the UK had offered “guaranteed rights of return for settled EU citizens in the UK”. This means they can leave the UK for a period without losing the right to come back. In his opening statement he said: The United Kingdom thinks that in some cases we must go beyond the strict requirements of current EU law in order to protect citizens. For example we have offered the European Union guaranteed rights of return for settled EU citizens in the UK, in return for onward movement rights, right for onward movement, for our UK nationals who currently live within the EU27. Money Barnier implied that Theresa May’s offer in her Florence speech to make contributions to the EU after Brexit did not go far enough. In his opening remarks he said: Prime Minister May said two things in Florence. First: that no member state should pay more; and no member state should receive less because of Brexit. Second, that the UK will honour commitments taken during its membership. This week, the UK negotiating team made clear that applying the first principle would be limited to 2019-2020. The UK explained also that it is not in a position yet to identify its commitments taken during membership. For the EU, the only way to reach sufficient progress is that all commitments undertaken at 28 are honoured at 28. During the Q&amp;A he repeated the point about commitment made by the EU28 having to be honoured by the EU28. Barnier’s opening comment implied that the UK was somehow watering down the commitment made in May’s speech, because he suggested that the EU had only just been told May’s ‘no state should have to pay more or receive less’ promise only applied up to 2020. But May actually made this clear in her speech. She said: “I do not want our partners to fear that they will need to pay more or receive less over the remainder of the current budget plan [which lasts until 2020] as a result of our decision to leave.” (My italics.) Barnier is overstating what May actually promised. Barnier ruled out linking a deal over the UK’s payments to the EU with an understanding on the future trade relationship. The British government does not want to commit itself to paying a sum to the EU until it has an assurance about the free trade deal it will get. But Barnier said there was “no possible link” between the two. (See 11.42am.) Davis said that, although May has said the UK will honour its commitments to the EU, it was “not yet at the stage of specifying exactly what these commitments are”. He also said the final agreement on money would be “a political agreement”, implying that it will not simply by settled by lawyers and accountants. That may have been a signal that the UK will pay more than it thinks it legally owes. Ireland Davis said both sides had this week started drafting joint principles on preserving the common travel area. Euratom Davis said both sides were “close” to reaching agreement on “the vast majority” of issues set out in their positions papers on Euratom. Here is some Twitter comment on the press conference. From AFP’s Danny Kemp From ZDF’s Stefan Leifert Brexit in quotes. Barnier (Brussels): “have no sufficient progress.” Davis (London): “have made substantial progress.” From BuzzFeed’s Alberto Nardelli And here is the full text of Michel Barnier’s opening statement at the press conference. Here is the key quote from Michel Barnier about how it could take “months” until the Brexit talks are ready to move on to phase two, the part dealing with the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Currently the talks are still in phase one, dealing with withdrawal issues: the rights of EU citizens, the financial settlement and Ireland. Barnier said: I think it’s positive that Theresa May’s speech made it possible to unblock the situation, to some extent, and give a new dynamic to the situation. But we are far from being at a stage - it will take weeks, or maybe even months - where we will be able to say ‘Yes, okay, there has been sufficient progress on the principles of this orderly withdrawal.’ Here is the full text of David Davis’s remarks at the start of the press conference. And that’s it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: The UK says it can only agree the financial contribution when the UK’s future relationship with the EU is clarified. Do you accept that? Barnier says May’s speech helped to clarify things. It was very useful to hear her say that no EU country would lose out up to 2020 because of the UK’s withdrawal. She also said commitments would be honoured. He says he hopes to get clarification on this point. He says he sees no logical and coherent link between discussing the new partnership and discussing the financial obligation. There is no “possible link” between that and the separation issues. Barnier rules out linking a deal on UK’s financial obligations to a deal on the future relationship. The two issues are not connected, he says. Q: What does your plan on EU nationals mean? Which financial commitments will the UK honour? On EU nationals, Davis says the plan is to allow UK courts to take into consideration EU law. There are many precedents for this. On finances, he says he is not doing the negotiation here. Q: We are told the UK may make concrete proposals on 9 October. If the UK does, will you ask EU leaders to adjust your mandate so you can debate the transition? Barnier says the EU wants commitments entered into by the EU28 to be honoured by the EU28. It is as simple as that. And, as soon as sufficient progress has been made, he will recommend to EU leaders that they move on to phase two. He says EU leaders were not surprised by the request for a transition. He says his mandate is very specific about the circumstances which will have to apply for this to be discussed. It will be in the second stage, he says. Q: Is this a real negotiation? Davis says of course this is a proper negotiation. Later today the government will publish a chart on EU nationals’ right showing where there is agreement and where there is still disagreement. Most areas in the chart will be green (ie, indicating that agreement has been reached.) Q: Can you define “sufficent progress”? Barnier says the UK decided to leave the EU. That was their decision. There are complicated consequences as a result, he says. So you should not be surprised that these negotiating rounds, which are all useful, sometimes have stumbling blocks, or that this takes time. EU taxpayers should not have to pay the cost of decisions taken by the UK. And the integrity of the single market must be protected, he says. He says May’s speech “made it possible to unblock the situation, to some extent”. But it could be “weeks or even months” before the EU can say enough progress has been made he says. Barnier says it may take “months” before EU will allow Brexit talks to move on to phase two. Barnier says he looks forward to the resolution from the European parliament on the pace of Brexit talks. He says the talks will pick up again in October. (He does not commit himself to saying whether he will say that sufficient progress has been made for the talks to move on to phase two when EU leaders meet at the end of October.) On the financial settlement, Barnier says the talks on this have been “useful”. May said no member state would have to pay more, or lose out, because of Brexit, he says. But the UK is saying that will only apply for 2019 and 2020 - the end of this EU budget round, he says. And May said the UK would honour its commitments. But the UK has not identified what those commitments are, he says. He says the EU’s view is that all commitments taken by the EU28 (ie, with the UK) must be paid for by the EU28. He says, on citizens’ rights, the UK has agreed to give “direct effect” to the withdrawal agreement. This is very important, he says. It means EU citizens will be able to go to the UK courts to enforce their role. And the UK has agreed that European court of judgement rulings will be taken into account by UK courts. But the EU is still pressing for EU nationals to be able to take cases directly to the ECJ. This is still a point of dispute, he says. He says they created clarity on some points. On others, more work needs to be done, “and we are not there yet”. But they will keep working til they get a deal, he says. Michel Barnier is speaking now. He says Theresa May’s speech last week has created a new dynamic in the negotiations. He says he said on Monday they needed a moment of clarity. Both teams have worked well together, he says. Davis says the EU withdrawal agreement will be adopted in EU law. He says it will have “direct effect”. He says EU citizens who have permanent residency documents will not have to go through the whole process of re-applying again. He says the UK has held “very constructive” talks on the financial settlement. The UK will honour its obligations, he says. He says the UK and the EU are close to an agreement on Euratom. He says he leaves Brussels optimistic. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, are holding their press conference now. Davis says they are making “decisive” progress. Here are the main points from Theresa May’s speech. It was bold on analysis, but very thin on prescription. May said free market economics were currently “not delivering for ordinary working people”. And those of us who believe that the interests of the British people are best served through a successful open, free market economy need to be honest about where it is not currently working or delivering for ordinary working people today. This was probably the most interesting claim in the speech. But after making this point, she followed it with a long passage defending existing government policy in areas like banking, industrial policy, financial services, labour market reform and education. She mentioned the Taylor review (without saying which of its recommendations she would accept), and said too many young people don’t have the right skills, but she did not mention housing or low wages, and overall she did not really explain how the system might be changed to address the problem she identified. She said that the free market economy was “the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created”. She explained: When countries make the transition from closed, restricted, centrally-planned economies to open, free market policies, the same things happen. Life expectancy increases, and infant mortality falls. Absolute poverty shrinks, and disposable income grows. Access to education is widened, and rates of illiteracy plummet. Participation in cultural life is extended, and more people have the chance to contribute. It is in open, free market economies that technological breakthroughs are made which transform, improve and save lives. It is in open, free market economies that personal freedoms and liberties find their surest protection. A free market economy, operating under the right rules and regulations, is the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created. It was the new combination which led societies out of darkness and stagnation and into the light of the modern age. She explained what she saw as the foundations of a free market economy. In essence, it is very simple. It consists of an open market place, in which everyone is free to participate… …regulated under the rule of law… …with personal freedoms, equality and human rights democratically guaranteed … …and an accountable government, progressively taxing the economic activity which the market generates… …to fund high-quality public services which are freely available to all citizens, according to need. That is unquestionably the best, and indeed the only sustainable, means of increasing the living standards of everyone in a country. She said those arguing for free market economics to be abandoned were wrong. Now, some argue that a free market economy is an end in itself, and that drawing attention to the downsides is somehow anti-business. Others would use the imbalances which are now apparent as a justification for the total rejection of the free market economy, which has done so much to improve our lives. Instead they advocate ideologically extreme policies which have long-ago been shown to fail, and which are failing people today in places like Venezuela. My argument has always been that if you want to preserve and improve a system which has delivered unparalleled benefits, you have to take seriously its faults and do all you can to address them. Not to do so would put everything we have achieved together as a country at risk. It would lead to a wider loss of faith in free markets, and risk a return to the failed ideologies of the past. A return to protectionism in international trade, and to inflationary policies at home. Far from somehow protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society, that outcome would surely hurt them the most. Although May did not mention Labour or Jeremy Corbyn, she was clearly referring to them here. But her claims were very generalised, and ignored the point that Corbyn is not calling for the entire abandonment of market economics (although he would not defend it in the terms May does). He is attacking what he describes as its neoliberal incarnation - deregulation, privatisation, and cuts to government spending. May said little to address the case Corbyn has been making on these points. Here is Ed Balls, the Labour former shadow chancellor, on Theresa May’s speech. In the Q&amp;A Theresa May was asked about Bombardier. Confirming comments made by government colleagues yesterday, she signalled that the UK could stop placing orders with Boeing if it did not drop its trade dispute with Bombardier, the aerospace company employing 4,000 people in Northern Ireland. She said: What I would say in relation to Boeing is of course we have a long-term partnership with Boeing, various aspects of government, and this is not the sort of behaviour we expect from a long-term partner. It undermines that partnership. Q: There were aspects of your speech that could have been made by a German chancellor. Will you rely on your relationship with Angela Merkel to help with Brexit. May says her relationship with Merkel is important. But her relationship with the 26 other EU leaders is also important. She says the UK is not leaving Europe. It is leaving the EU. It wants an end solution that will benefit the UK and the EU. And that’s it. I will post a summary soon. May says it is possible that some aspects of the Brexit transition, or “implementation”, could take less than two years to implement. Q: Low interest rates and QE have had a bad impact on poor people. What can be done about that? May says she was pointing that out in her speech. The government looks at what can be done to mitigate the impact of QE. For example, it has taken steps to help savers. Q: Can you assure exporters that we are not about to have a trade war with the US? May says more than 4,000 people are employed by Bombardier in Northern Ireland. The American judgment was a preliminary one. She says she will continue to press on the Americans the importance of Bombardier. The UK government has a long-term partnership with Boeing. This is not the sort of action one would expect from a partner, she says. May says Boeing’s legal case against Bombardier is not the action the UK would expect from a partner. (That sounds like a possible veiled threat to stop buying Boeing planes, but that may be reading too much into it.) She says the UK is a champion of free trade. We need to ensure people are not left behind, she says. She says element of protectionism are creeping in around the world May is now wrapping up. She wishes the Bank well in the future, and for the rest of its conference. She is now taking questions. May says giving up the government’s “balanced” approach to public spending would mean more borrowing and higher taxes. May says leaving the EU will mean changes. She wants the UK to have a close economic partnership, but with rights and obligations in a new balance. The challenge will be not how to align UK regulation and EU regulation; it will be what to do when they start to diverge. May says some people are questioning the market economy. May says if you want to deliver a system that delivers for everyone, you have to acknowledge its faults. Giving up on market economics, far from helping poorest and most vulnerable, would harm them most, she says. May says the flexible labour market has contributed to the UK’s success. Many people value flexible work. But it cannot be one-sided, she says. That is why she commissioned the Matthew Taylor report. May says the government’s industrial strategy is promoting growth across the whole of the UK. A financial services sector, providing jobs across the whole of the UK, is vital for the country’s prosperity, she says. May says those who believe in free market economics have to be honest about where it is not working. For too long, too many communities have not seen the benefits of prosperity. That waste of potential is bad for the economy as a whole, she says. May says raising the living standards and protecting the jobs of ordinary people is the main aim of economic policy. May says it is in open, free market economies that new developments occur that save lifes. And it is in open, free market economies that freedoms are guaranteed. Theresa May is speaking now. She says she was a newly elected MP when the Bank of England was made independent. She says many sacrifices were made after the crash. But the system is not working for everyone, she says. Here are the main points from Mark Carney’s speech. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, says the UK’s future prosperity will depend mostly on what kind of Brexit occurs, not on what the Bank does. While carefully circumscribed independence is highly effective in delivering price and financial stability, it cannot deliver lasting prosperity and it cannot solve broader societal challenges. This bears emphasising because in recent years a host of issues have been laid at the door of the Bank of England from housing affordability to poor productivity. Calls for the Bank to solve these challenges ignore the Bank’s carefully defined objectives. And they confuse independence with omnipotence. Monetary and financial stability are foundational. They are necessary for prosperity but they aren’t sufficient to deliver it. The biggest determinants of the UK’s medium-term prosperity will be the country’s new relationship with the EU and the reforms it catalyses. Most of the necessary adjustments are real in nature and therefore not in the gift of central bankers. In other words, he’s saying: Don’t blame us if it all goes wrong ... He says Bank of England independence has been a success. The gains from independence have been enormous. In the two decades that followed independence, inflation averaged just under 2% compared with over 6% in the preceding two. It’s been one-fifth as volatile. Crucially, independence allowed monetary policy to respond boldly and effectively to the biggest financial crisis in a century. And it leaves the Bank well placed to address a range of possible developments around Brexit. Carney says price stability is “the best contribution monetary policy can make to the public good”. He explains: High inflation hurts the least well off in society the most. It distorts price signals, inhibits investment, and ultimately damages the economy’s productive capacity. Equally, deflation imperils growth and employment, and, in the extreme, leads to financial ruin and economic collapse. The happy medium is low, stable and predictable inflation. A little inflation greases the wheels of the economy, and it gives monetary policy space to deliver better outcomes for jobs and growth when shocks hit. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is opening the event at the Bank. There is a live feed here. Ed Balls, who was Gordon Brown’s chief adviser when the Bank of England was given independence (and how is credited with converting Brown to the idea in the first place), has written an interesting post about the anniversary of the announcement on his blog. It includes a link to the original draft of the letter to the Bank making the announcement, as well as to the revised final version. Balls doesn’t go into full “I told you so” mode, but he does make the point that his original plan, which was amended before the final letter was sent, would have given the Bank more role in ensuring financial stability (and thereby in protecting the UK from the financial crash) than it ended up getting. Balls writes: It is clear from my draft that the deputy governor (financial regulation) was intended to play a vital role in macro-financial stability within the Bank, with ‘conduct’ regulation moved to a separate institution. As is well known, some senior figures at both the Treasury and the Bank wanted a more decisive break. And the final compromise evolved progressively, and problematically, over the following decade as the Bank’s engagement in financial stability steadily eroded. And the Independent’s John Rentoul (who is not a Corbyn supporter) has written a blog at the Independent saying the very fact that Theresa May is giving this speech this morning shows that Jeremy Corbyn is setting the agenda. She is “paying Jeremy Corbyn the compliment of taking him seriously”, he writes. Paul Mason, the Corbyn-supporting Guardian columnist, points out that Theresa May is speaking at an institution nationalised by Labour. He could, of course, have pointed out as well that Bank of England independence was a Labour achievement. It was Gordon Brown’s first key decision when he became chancellor in 1997. In her speech Theresa May will also promise a “balanced” approach to public spending. According to the extracts released in advance, she will say: That means continuing to deal with our debts, so that our economy can remain strong and we can protect people’s jobs. At the same time, it means investing in our vital public services, like schools and hospitals, which our successful management of the economy has made possible. To abandon that balanced approach with unfunded borrowing and significantly higher levels of taxation would damage our economy, threaten jobs, and hurt working people. Ultimately, that would mean less money for the public services we all rely on. At the Labour conference yesterday Jeremy Corbyn argued that the neoliberal economic model was broken. This morning, in a speech at a conference to mark the 20th anniversary of the Bank of England getting independence, Theresa May will hit back with a strong defence of the free market system. According to extracts released in advance, she will say: A free market economy, operating under the right rules and regulations, is the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created. It was the new combination which led societies out of darkness and stagnation and into the light of the modern age. It is unquestionably the best, and indeed the only sustainable, means of increasing the living standards of everyone in a country. And we should never forget that raising the living standards, and protecting the jobs, of ordinary working people is the central aim of all economic policy. Helping each generation to live longer, fuller, more secure lives than the one which went before them. Not serving an abstract doctrine or an ideological concept – but serving the real interests of the British people. (Corbyn’s speech yesterday focused on what he said were the flaws with neoliberalism, a particular government approach to free markets. He was not arguing that the free market is always inherently bad, although it is hard to imagine him defending free market economics in the terms May is using today.) Here is Larry Elliott’s preview story. Theresa May is speaking at 9am. I will be covering it in full. Then later, at around 11am, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, hold a press conference in Brussels after the conclusion of the fourth round of Brexit talks. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

The Hatton gallery, founded in 1925 and part of Newcastle University, has undergone a £3.8m refurbishment ushering in what should be a new era. While the gallery is internationally important, it has for decades been hard to love and difficult to find. It will finally reopen to the public on Friday next week with an exhibition exploring the role Newcastle played in the rise of pop art. But for many art lovers, the chief draw will be the chance to see Kurt Schwitters’s restored Merz Barn wall, a modernist masterpiece that was rescued and installed at the Hatton in 1965. The 20-month redevelopment, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, has created bigger spaces that are airy, bright and pleasant – a far cry from the old Hatton. “There were no environmental controls; the lighting was terrible,” said Richard Talbot, head of fine art at the university. “The fittings were such you couldn’t even get the bulbs for them.” Julie Milne, chief curator of the city’s art galleries, recalled the complaints from visitors. She said: “Most of the feedback we got was about the gallery’s gloominess. There were wires all over the place and lumpy walls, which were difficult to hang on. Intrinsically, the building is beautiful – it was just very shabby and run down.” In the days before instant access to maps, the gallery was also difficult to find, something that has also been addressed by better signage. “It has been a real problem,” said Talbot. “We’ve had meetings for years talking about it, but it is a lot more visible now.” The lack of proper environmental controls often meant borrowing works for exhibitions was tricky. It also posed huge problems for Hatton’s star work, the Merz Barn wall. The wall was created by Schwitters, an artist who is today considered a giant of modern art. It is based on the idea of collage, with found objects incorporated with paint and plaster swirled in to the wall to create an artwork that the Observer’s Rachel Cooke described as “part cave painting, part modernist fantasia.” The wall is from his dadaist Merzbau project, one that dominated Schwitters’s life. He created his first Merzbau between 1923-33 in his family home in Hanover, but it was destroyed by an RAF bomb in 1943. As a “degenerate” artist, Schwitters fled Germany in 1937 and headed to Norway, where he began work on a second Merzbau. That had to be abandoned after Germany was invaded and the artist made his way on an icebreaker ship to Edinburgh. After the war – he was interned as an “enemy alien” on the Isle of Man – Schwitters attempted to resume his career as an artist. Although impoverished and largely ignored by the art establishment, he worked successfully, having married a woman who adored him. The couple lived in the Lake District and it was there that he managed to get hold of a place for his final masterpiece, a rough and ready isolated barn near Elterwater. Although very ill, Schwitters spent three months in the cold and damp creating the work before his death aged 60 in January 1948. The wall would likely be long gone if Richard Hamilton, the artist and Newcastle University lecturer, had not helped engineer its rescue in 1965. The then outrageous sum of £5,000 was spent to remove the wall from its Cumbrian location and slowly transport it 120 miles to Newcastle, where it is now part of the gallery fabric. Over the years art lovers have made pilgrimages to the Hatton to see the wall, but the lack of environmental controls was putting it at risk. It has now been conserved – 52 years of dust removed – and its setting improved; a slate-grey floor has replaced the red wooden parquet. “It was incredibly grimy and looked quite dark,” said Milne. “Now it has been conserved, it is amazing how bright it looks.” The gallery, managed by Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums on behalf of the university, hopes to triple visitor numbers to 66,000 annually. It will stage modern and contemporary exhibitions, beginning with Pioneers of Pop, exploring the little-known story of Newcastle’s role in the birth of pop art, largely because of Hamilton, who taught at the university from 1953-66. It was while he was in the city that Hamilton wrote: “Pop art is: popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass-produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business.” That was five years before the most famous pop artist, Andy Warhol, made his first forays into the genre with his Campbell’s Soup Cans. Milne hopes that the show will put the record straight, establishing that pop art did not start in the US, but “that a lot of the thinking and work behind it was happening in the UK, and not just in London, but also Newcastle”. • The Hatton gallery, free to enter, reopens on 7 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/29/abcs-empires-braced-for-battle-as-guthrie-marshals-forces","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T22:37:58Z","webTitle":"Guthrie's content shake-up threatens ABC empires | The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/29/abcs-empires-braced-for-battle-as-guthrie-marshals-forces","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/29/abcs-empires-braced-for-battle-as-guthrie-marshals-forces","fields":{"headline":"Guthrie's content shake-up threatens ABC empires","bodyText":"The ABC’s senior executive is busy finalising a restructuring plan originally scheduled for October but which has now been pushed back as late as November. With 16 months now under her belt, the managing director, Michelle Guthrie, is getting on with her “transformation” agenda which includes creating the $50m GIG, or Great Ideas Grant, creating 80 new jobs in regional Australia and shedding 200 jobs in management, support and content areas. Now, with the help of consultants, she is attempting to reorganise the national broadcaster for the post-analogue age. What this means is rearranging the broadcaster along genre lines rather than the traditional platforms of television, radio, news and online. Nothing is set in stone but the idea is to put a TV show such as Catalyst and a radio program such as Robyn Williams’s The Science Show under the new genre heading of science – and to move them out of the TV division and Radio National, respectively. The science unit would be platform-agnostic and produce content for TV, digital and radio, sharing resources and ideas. The “proposed content team design” has been informed by a lengthy period of programming and commissioning workshops and “cascade sessions” that content leaders – executive producers in the old language – have held with their teams. All of it has been done with pitch-perfect management speak so beloved by the ABC bosses. “This feedback is informing how we organise our content teams to focus on audiences and how they want to consume content, rather than based on platforms,” the latest memo says. “As we have discussed in our workshops and cascade sessions, our aim is to create opportunities for our people to grow our reach and relevance to Australian audiences. It is also important that the roles, work flows and culture is fundamentally better than what we have now.” This radical restructure will necessarily mean loss of empires. The executive team responsible for managing the restructure are Gaven Morris (news), David Anderson (TV) , Fiona Reynolds (regional) and Michael Mason (radio). Adding to the power struggles inside Aunty is the arrival of John Lyons, the former associate editor of the Australian, who has landed the powerful role of head investigative and in-depth journalism, making him responsible for 7.30, Australian Story, Four Corners, Q&amp;A, Insiders, Offsiders, Lateline, Foreign Correspondent, Behind the News, AM, PM, The World Today and Correspondents Report. Bauer’s risk management The Bauer chief executive, Paul Dykzeul, is a plain talker. He is unfazed by criticism the company has received after an exodus of magazine editors and senior management since he took over in June. “If people think I’m a prick, if people think I’m an asshole, that’s fine, he told Mumbrella this month after shaking up the magazine company. “I can’t do anything about that.” So it’s perhaps not surprising the historic $4.5m payout to the actor Rebel Wilson has not cramped his style. In an interview with trade publication MediaWeek, Dykzeul conceded the judgment was a “difficult issue” but it’s business as usual as far as celebrity gossip is concerned. “There are some significant issues for media generally in that document, which we want to consider,” he said. “No one goes out of their way to get it wrong and to defame people. The company has been through this on many occasions and I have been through it when we lost the biggest case ever in New Zealand some time ago. “This won’t materially change our business. I am not suggesting the amount of $4.5m is insignificant. [Celebrity coverage] is the nature of what we do. There are risks attached to what we do and we have to accept those risks.” Lowy highs There was passionate support for foreign news reporting at the Lowy Institute’s media awards in Sydney on Saturday night at which the New York Times columnist Bret Stephens delivered the keynote address. Australian foreign correspondents past and present, including Leigh Sales, Hugh Riminton, Chris Reason, Michael Usher, Ed Roy, Max Uechtritz, Michael Carey, Philip Williams and Monica Attard, turned out in force to support the dying art of Australian correspondents covering the world for Australian eyes. Stephens referred to the controversy that followed Lowy’s invitation for him to speak at the media award ceremony, which was to be named after the late ABC broadcaster Mark Colvin. But Lowy removed Colvin’s name after a family disagreement. “I’m aware of the controversy that has gone with my selection as your speaker,” Stephens said. “I respect the wishes of the Colvin family and join in honouring Mark Colvin’s memory as a courageous foreign correspondent and an extraordinary writer and broadcaster. And I’d particularly like to thank [Lowy director] Michael Fullilove for not rescinding the invitation. “This has become the depressing trend on American university campuses, where the roster of disinvited speakers includes former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice, former Harvard University president Larry Summers, actor Alec Baldwin, human rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, DNA co-discoverer James Watson, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, film-maker Michael Moore, conservative Pulitzer prize-winning columnist George Will and liberal Pulitzer prize-winning columnist Anna Quindlen, to name just a few.” You can read Stephens’ speech in full here. Matt Brown’s home truths The nominees in the room included the ABC’s PNG correspondent, Eric Tlozcek, Fairfax’s Nick McKenzie and Sashka Koloff and Guardian Australia’s Ben Doherty and Nick Evershed. Nine’s new political editor, Chris Uhlmann, who was nominated along with Fairfax for his work on Four Corners, was stopped from attending at the eleventh hour by bushfires along the Hume. Popular winner Matt Brown, the ABC’s Middle East correspondent, gave an emotional speech in which he thanked his parents for “never once asking me to stay home” despite the fear of fate intruding again, as it did 23 years ago with the loss of his sister. ABC news management conspired with the Lowy Institute to get Brown home for the award, without letting on that he was the winner. Brown said his entry was based on a Four Corners report but also for a whole body of work on Islamic State and Mosul he had done over several months for online, either directly or repurposed from radio and TV reports. The corporate line, Brown said, is that we are a multi-platform organisation available wherever and whenever audiences want us, but in reality “ABC editors are better than any editor anywhere in the world at squeezing more product out of a reporter for more platforms than you can imagine”. Tibetan in, Māori out at SBS Every five years SBS Radio has to rethink what languages it will provide as a result of changes to the population – a further 1.3 million people have migrated to Australia in that time and nearly 4.87 million speak a language other than English at home. Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics census data, SBS World News Radio reviewed its roster of 70 languages and, with a high degree of diplomacy, brought new communities into the fold and cut others adrift. Adjacent to this difficult process – which sources say has led to groups turning up at SBS to lobby in person – is the death of the SBS Radio news broadcast. Hidden in the fine print was the decision to end the broadcast of the daily English-language news bulletins – which had already been cut to just a half-hour a day – from 20 November. World News Radio, a current affairs program broadcast weekdays at 6pm on the AM networks in Sydney and Melbourne and on the national network, will be “discontinued”. Instead SBS will offer on-demand audio news updates. The seven new languages SBS will add are Telugu, Karen, Tibetan, Hakha Chin, Rohingya, Mongolian and Kirundi (Rundi). Twelve languages are being dropped: Kannada, Tongan, Norwegian, Cook Island Māori, Fijian, Swedish, the African program in English, Lithuanian, Malay, Latvian, Danish and Māori. SBS’s director of audio language and content, Mandi Wicks, said she had made the tough decisions based on published criteria such as size of population and high needs. “It’s a long and sensitive process because Australia has changed so much in the last 40 years since SBS was set up and our challenge is to continue to evolve,” Wicks said. “People value those services which provide them with important news and information.” Like the news bulletins, the new languages will be launched as digital-only because they are designed for much younger audiences and will feature podcasts and online articles. Each language service will include news and current affairs, as well as guides to accessing healthcare and other services in the Australian community, celebrating culture and discussions on Australian values. Despite the changes SBS Radio will remain the most linguistically diverse public broadcaster in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/we-didnt-want-the-postal-survey-but-lets-focus-on-the-positives-following-it","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T18:00:03Z","webTitle":"We didn't want the postal survey, but let's focus on the positives following it | Simon Copland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/we-didnt-want-the-postal-survey-but-lets-focus-on-the-positives-following-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/we-didnt-want-the-postal-survey-but-lets-focus-on-the-positives-following-it","fields":{"headline":"We didn't want the postal survey, but let's focus on the positives following it","bodyText":"Last week I went around the offices at my university department, giving everyone a yes poster. Our corridor is now a big rainbow, showing support to every student who walks through in the coming months. While this gesture was small, I can’t help but think it would never have happened without the same-sex marriage postal survey. In fact, despite all the negative coverage, the survey is already creating a lot of positives. Just look at the mobilisation of the queer community. Since the announcement of the postal survey they have begun to organise, and with amazing results. We’ve seen rallies across the country, with the two largest ever in favour of LGBTIQ rights happening in Melbourne and then Sydney. Meanwhile, thousands of people have begun phone banking and door-knocking in favour of a yes vote, while our cities are being covered with rainbows; with councils, businesses and regular citizens getting in on the action. This is not just coming from the usual suspects. The postal survey is bringing people from all walks of life out to publicly support marriage equality. Just look at the business support for marriage equality. We’ve seen ad companies refuse to produce no campaign ads, Officeworks say they won’t print homophobic materials and small businesses plastering their windows with rainbows. The AFL, NRL, and Cricket Australia have encouraged people to vote yes, while some of Australia’s most working class unions have also come out in support. This is not just restricted to the city either, with positive actions happening across rural and regional areas. Toowoomba, the home town of Lyle Shelton for example, has had a rally, door-knocking and phone calling parties. Advocates in Mackay, one of the larger towns in George Christensen’s electorate, are organising movie showings and a rally in the town. There are groups and actions set up in Ballarat, Albury-Wodonga, the Wimmera Mallee, Dubbo, Townsville, Carnarvon, Port Lincoln ... the list goes on. This to me has always been the potential positive that could come from a postal survey on marriage equality. Firstly, this survey is forcing a movement that has been primarily based in the halls of parliament to mobilise on the streets. Advocates are now having hundreds of thousands of conversations with people across the country, the sort of engagement that has been proven to be the best way to overcome homophobic attitudes. These activities are building queer communities, strengthening the resilience among them in a time when we are facing increasing attacks. The debate is also flushing out supporters of marriage equality who once were mostly quiet on the issue. The vote is forcing people to take a side, and publicly, and, surprise surprise, a large number of people are coming out in support of yes. In just the past few days for example Frances Abbott, the daughter of former prime minister Tony Abbott, filmed an ad in support of marriage equality. This kind of support, which makes Tony Abbott’s views look increasingly isolated, is something that would likely have never happened without the campaign. The value of this is being totally underrated. Most queer kids growing up in isolated areas, those we are most concerned about during this postal survey, would already know that there are many in their community who are homophobic. What they may not have known was that their teacher, counsellor, or even a family member were actually supportive. Even if just one person in a local community does this, even if just one person pledges a yes vote, then that one person is likely more support than many kids had before. This is the thing about a postal survey. By forcing the debate we’re bringing people out of the woodwork. Supporters are standing up in communities around the country, a huge and bold show of force in favour of LGBTIQ people. This will build alliances and strength that will last well beyond the vote. I appreciate people’s concerns about the impact of the debate, and I know many are struggling. While we’ve concentrated on the “barrage of bigotry” however, we’ve ignored the potential that the positives could actually outweigh the negatives. This was the experience in Ireland, where the huge yes vote resulted in young LGBTIQ people feeling more comfortable in society and in turn more willing to come out. I know many did not want this postal survey. But instead of worrying about a few high-profile homophobes, it is the positives we should be focusing on. In doing so we can provide support for young queer kids and build a sense of solidarity and community that will genuinely change homophobic views in our society. If we do that, this survey will have a legacy going well beyond marriage equality.

But the ongoing violence and humanitarian crisis in Rakhine risks derailing that progress,” he added of the ex-British colony. Close to half a million Rohingya, a Muslim minority in majority-Buddhist Myanmar, have fled the army into Bangladesh. While the government says it is fighting an emergent “terrorist” group, the UN rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, has described it as a “textbook example” of ethnic cleansing. Field said Aung San Suu Kyi had given him assurances those who had fled their homes would be able to return across the border. “The proof will be in the pudding, and whether she will allow those who wish to return to do so,” he later told the BBC. “There are now hundreds of thousands of Rohingya on the Bangladeshi side of the border and there is a big question mark just how many will feel confident enough with the security implications on what is happening in the country to return.” He said Aung San Suu Kyi did not share the views of some ministers who have claimed burned land becomes government land and remained the best hope for “ongoing democracy” in the country, despite failing to stop the violence against the Rohingya minority. “She finds herself treading fine line between the international criticism that we have seen in the past six weeks, but also public opinion in Burma that remains very strongly anti-Rohingya,” he said. “What would be calamitous essentially is for it to fall back into a military dictatorship. She is a 71 year old lady. She is perhaps not entirely comfortable emoting. She is not someone prone to the political and public relations that we are all used to ... but she is increasingly aware that much needs to be done.” United Nations secretary-general António Guterres will brief the UN security council on the crisis later on Thursday in New York. Guterres has sent a letter to the council to express concern about the “humanitarian catastrophe” unfolding in Myanmar. The latest campaign, the deadliest so far, ramped up after the army launched a huge counter-offensive in retribution for guerrilla-style ambushes on 25 August by a Rohingya militant group. Satellite imagery shows more than 200 Rohingya villages have since been burned. As Myanmar does not allow unfettered access to the conflict zone, it is impossible to corroborate how many people have died. The army has rebuffed accusations of war crimes and points to attacks by “extremist terrorists” against Buddhists and Hindus. On Wednesday, the government brought some reporters to an area in northern Rakhine where a mass graves of Hindus, including many women and children, were exhumed this week. Villagers said black-clad attackers had killed more than 100 people. Requests for access to hundreds of Muslim villages have mostly been denied. The roughly 1.1 million Rohingya have suffered decades of discrimination in Myanmar, where they not granted citizenship. Desperate Rohingya have for years paid people smugglers to get them out of the country, often resulting in deaths at sea or exploitation when they are locked up for ransom by the criminals they trusted to deliver them to Thailand and Malaysia. Thailand is facing mounting calls to stop its policy to push the migrant boats back out to sea. A 2015 Thai crackdown led to ships full of people being stranded at sea, and there are concerns that the recent crisis will lead to a resurgence. “Thailand urgently needs to set a regional example by adopting humane refugee policies,” said Audrey Gaughran from Amnesty International. “Instead of callously repelling people fleeing unimaginable horrors, the Thai government should ensure safe passage for those seeking international protection in Thailand.” Aung San Suu Kyi has disappointed human rights groups who looked to her as an icon in the fight against oppressive rule. The Nobel peace prize winner spent 15 years under house arrest and won a landslide election in 2015, seen as a huge victory for democratic reform in the country. The recent violence has shocked governments that ardently supported her, including the UK, and there are concerns for the civilians who have arrived – many with bullet wounds – in Bangladesh. Oxfam has warned that close to 70% of the nearly 480,000 Rohingya refugees are without adequate shelter and half have no safe drinking water. The international agency launched an urgent appeal for more than £5m after heavy rains and floods in camps have left people facing extreme hardship. “Oxfam is witnessing an unprecedented number of refugees arriving into Bangladesh in a very short period of time,” it said. “Tens of thousands don’t have food or clean water. If they are very lucky they have some plastic sheeting to take shelter under – but most of the time families are huddled under sarongs.” Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/28/peter-dutton-lets-fly-at-armani-clad-economic-refugees-sent-to-us","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T03:25:44Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton launches extraordinary attack on 'economic refugees' sent to US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/28/peter-dutton-lets-fly-at-armani-clad-economic-refugees-sent-to-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/28/peter-dutton-lets-fly-at-armani-clad-economic-refugees-sent-to-us","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton launches extraordinary attack on 'economic refugees' sent to US","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has verbally abused the first group of refugees to leave Australia’s offshore detention centres for resettlement in the United States, labelling them “economic refugees” – a term that does not exist in domestic or international law. Fifty-two refugees this week left offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru for resettlement in the US. Sydney radio host Ray Hadley put to the immigration minister during a regular interview on Thursday that a photograph of the group published by News Corp this week looked like a fashion show on a catwalk in Paris or New York. “They’re economic refugees, they got on a boat, paid a people smuggler a lot of money, and somebody once said to me that we’ve got the world’s biggest collection of Armani jeans and handbags up on Nauru waiting for people to collect it when they depart,” Dutton told 2GB radio. Dutton claimed many of those who ended up in the island camps had not come from war-ravaged areas but were instead seeking economic advantage. They had received “an enormous amount of support” from Australian taxpayers for a long time. Dutton’s comments contradict statistics from his own department. Some 1,780 of the 2,000 people currently held offshore have been found to be refugees under the 1951 refugees convention, to which Australia is a party. Those refugees have been found to have a “well-founded fear of persecution” in their homeland. They cannot be returned there and are legally owed protection. Among those being resettled in the US, are refugees from Sudan, which has been riven by brutal internecine wars for decades, Somalia, which has experienced near-constant conflict since the 1980s, and Myanmar, where the country’s military is undertaking an ethnic cleansing operation of the Rohingya minority, forcing more than 400,000 people to flee. However, Dutton said conditions in offshore detention – which were ruled illegal by the Papua New Guinea supreme court – were not as bad as had been portrayed. “We have been taken for a ride, I believe, by a lot of the advocates and people within Labor and the Greens who want you to believe this is a terrible existence,” Dutton said. “These photos demonstrate otherwise. People have seen other photos in recent weeks of those up on Manus out enjoying themselves outside this centre, by the beach and all the rest of it.” Dutton said he had long predicted once people were off Manus Island and Nauru “they’ll start to tell a very different story about how it wasn’t that bad”. “There is a very different scenario up on Nauru and Manus than people want you to believe,” he said. Amnesty International labelled the comments extremely irresponsible. “They also show a complete lack of understanding of the refugee convention,” refugee co-ordinator Graham Thom said in a statement. He said Dutton was putting at risk the opportunity for vulnerable and traumatised refugees to be safely resettled in the US. “It is absolutely despicable that Peter Dutton would risk that by downplaying the acute vulnerability of these refugees at a time when the US is looking to cut its humanitarian program to its lowest level in over a decade,” he said. The four years of Australia’s second iteration of offshore detention – which has cost nearly $10bn – have been plagued by consistent revelations of physical violence including murder, rape and sexual abuse of women and children, allegations of torture by guards, medical neglect leading to death, and catastrophic rates of mental health damage, self-harm and suicide attempts. More than half the countries of the UN have criticised Australia’s offshore regime as an abuse of human rights. United Nations bodies have consistently condemned Australia’s policies. On separate occasions, the UNHCR has described offshore detention as “immensely harmful”, “contrary … to common decency” and “dire and untenable”. The special rapporteur on torture said Australia’s regime was “cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment”. And the Australian Senate said the government had “failed” to provide a safe environment for refugees and asylum seekers. In June, the Australian government agreed to pay $70m in compensation for illegally detaining people on Manus Island and holding them in dangerous and damaging conditions. In response to Dutton’s comments, Labor’s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, said to him via Twitter: “Instead of worrying about fashion, you should do your job and find 3rd country resettlement options for all eligible refugees.” Refugees held on Nauru and Manus Island arrived in Australia as long ago as 2012 and were transferred to offshore detention under a strict government policy to block anyone who arrived by boat from entering the country. They were recently cleared by US authorities for resettlement under a deal struck between the former Obama administration and the Turnbull government. Up to 1,250 refugees are expected to be resettled in the US, but the US refugee deal is not expected to clear the Australian-run camps. Those held there remain Australia’s legal responsibility. • Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/05/california-sanctuary-state-law-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T19:57:09Z","webTitle":"California adopts 'sanctuary state' immigration law in snub to Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/california-sanctuary-state-law-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/california-sanctuary-state-law-trump","fields":{"headline":"California adopts 'sanctuary state' immigration law in snub to Trump","bodyText":"California has adopted the most expansive “sanctuary state” law in the US with the goal of obstructing Donald Trump’s deportation agenda by prohibiting police in the country’s most populous state from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. The landmark bill, signed into law on Thursday, restricts police from questioning people about their citizenship status and detaining foreign-born residents on immigration violations. The law, which also prohibits police from transferring certain inmates to immigration authorities, could lead to a major legal showdown between the White House and California and is the latest example of the liberal Golden State creating roadblocks to Trump policies. The legislation is more far-reaching than an existing sanctuary state policy in Oregon and could help shield immigrants from aggressive deportation efforts in a state home to more than two million undocumented people, nearly a quarter of all unauthorized immigrants living in the US. The California Values Act builds on the sanctuary city policies that Trump aggressively targeted during his 2016 campaign and which exist in hundreds of municipalities. Studies have challenged Trump’s claims that sanctuary jurisdictions attract crime; some research suggests cities with sanctuary policies have significantly lower crime rates than comparable municipalities that allow local police to enforce immigration laws. Some liberal cities, such as San Francisco, have sued the Trump administration over his threats to withhold federal public safety grant money as a punishment. Those cities have argued that when police stay out of immigration enforcement, undocumented people are more likely to report crimes and work with police. Even before California’s governor, Jerry Brown, signed the new law, the bill was the subject of widespread attacks by the Trump administration and conservatives across the country. The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recently called the bill “unconscionable” and said it “risks the safety of good law enforcement officers and the safety of the neighborhoods that need their protection the most”. In California, a state controlled by Democrats, the proposal has faced significant pushback from some conservative sheriffs. Brown, a Democrat, recently negotiated revisions with sponsoring senator Kevin de León that loosened restrictions on police, giving them discretion to hold certain people for federal authorities if they have been convicted of serious or violent felonies. Brown said: “These are uncertain times for undocumented Californians and their families, and this bill strikes a balance that will protect public safety, while bringing a measure of comfort to those families who are now living in fear every day.” Though the bill is watered down from its original version, which created stricter boundaries on police, some right-leaning law enforcement officials have continued to vocally oppose the measure. Thomas Homan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), said in a statement that California had “chosen to prioritize politics over public safety”. De León said the state is preparing to defend the legislation in court if Trump’s administration takes legal action. It is unclear what kind of opposition the law could face in California. Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara County, president of the California State Sheriffs’ Association, which opposes the law, said: “We’re sworn to uphold the law. I don’t know of any sheriff in the state who is not going to adhere to this.” John McGinness, a consultant with the California Peace Officers’ Association, which also opposes the law, said there was a “high level of frustration” among officers. “I hope they remember their obligation to comply with the law, and I hope they will, but I understand there might be some thinking, ‘I want to do the right thing’, and resistance could be a part of that.” Even in liberal California counties that already have sanctuary rules on the books, local police have faced criticism from immigration advocates for continuing to work with Ice. After the law’s passage, Jennie Pasquarella, immigrants’ rights director for the ACLU of California, said in a statement that the law would “lift the bar statewide to safeguard Californians’ due process rights, particularly in those jurisdictions that have proven to be active, even enthusiastic, participants in the Trump mass deportation agenda”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/28/from-andrew-bolt-to-macklemore-a-brief-history-of-tony-abbott-on-free-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T07:21:06Z","webTitle":"From Andrew Bolt to Macklemore: a brief history of Tony Abbott on free speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/28/from-andrew-bolt-to-macklemore-a-brief-history-of-tony-abbott-on-free-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/28/from-andrew-bolt-to-macklemore-a-brief-history-of-tony-abbott-on-free-speech","fields":{"headline":"From Andrew Bolt to Macklemore: a brief history of Tony Abbott on free speech","bodyText":"“With less common knowledge, shared understandings become more difficult. “What’s deep and lasting becomes harder to distinguish from the ephemeral and we end up taking sport more seriously than religion.” So said freedom of speech warrior Tony Abbott last year, in a speech to the Samuel Griffith Society, as he lamented his inability to repeal section 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act. That is because, Abbott told us in 2011, in response to Andrew Bolt losing his Racial Discrimination Act case, freedom of speech was a “sacred principle”, in that he believed it to be “the right of people to say what you don’t like, not just the right of people to say what you do like”. Wrangling of Evelyn Hall’s descriptor of Voltaire’s ideals aside, Abbott had been moved to defend the right to express yourself, after Bolt was found by a court to have written articles which contained “multiple errors of material fact, distortions of the truth and inflammatory and provocative language”. It was this breach of the “sacred principle” that prompted Abbott to promise to repeal section 18c, telling the Australian in 2013 people should have the right to say what they liked. “Any suggestion you can have free speech as long as it doesn’t hurt people’s feelings is ridiculous,” he said as opposition leader. “If we are going to be a robust democracy, if we are going to be a strong civil society, if we are going to maintain that great spirit of inquiry, which is the spark that has made our civilisation so strong, then we’ve got to allow people to say things that are unsayable in polite company.” Ultimately, Abbott made a “leadership call” in 2014 to abandon his campaign to scrap the race-hate laws, because the issue had become a “complication” as he strove to unite the community. “In the end, leadership is about preserving nation unity on the essentials and that is why I have taken this action,” he said at the time. It was a backdown from his 2012 speech to the Institute of Public Affairs, Freedom Wars, where he argued freedom of speech “is not just an academic nicety but the essential precondition for any kind of progress”. “A child learns by trial and error. A society advances when people can discuss what works and what doesn’t. To the extent that alternatives can’t be discussed, people are tethered to the status quo, regardless of its effectiveness,” he said. Going further, Abbott added that without “free speech, free debate is impossible and without free debate, the democratic process cannot work properly”. “Freedom of speech is part of the compact between citizen and society on which democratic government rests,” he said. “A threat to citizens’ freedom of speech is more than an error of political judgment. “It reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the give and take between government and citizen on which a peaceful and harmonious society is based.” Abbott in 2012 would not only support things being said that he agreed with: “It’s human nature of course, to support free speech, as long as it’s agreeable. The trouble is deciding which opinions can be censored.” Late last year he was back to calling for an end to restrictions on freedom of speech, which he focussed on 18c, in the wake of the case against Queensland university students, which was ultimately dismissed, and the Bill Leak case, which was dropped. “What happened to those students in Queensland is just outrageous, what’s happening to Bill Leak right now is just outrageous,” he told the Australian in November 2016. “We are not precious little flowers in this country, we have robust debate and the best antidote to something that you find offensive or even insulting is to point our exactly why it’s not true and not fair.” But the man who shaped his later political career out of standing as a defender of freedoms, most crucially of expressing what you believe, even if he doesn’t care for it, now wishes to see a popular song by an American rap artist banned from the rugby league grand final. Footy fans, he said, shouldn’t be “subjected to a politicised grand final”, despite his very public support for a campaign he said the nation had to have, while the artist in question was announced a week before the survey was ruled lawful by the high court, following a request from a NRL fan focus group. The man who stood side-by-side with Abbott in 2013 in support of reforming 18c, a task he once said he was “born for”, exercised his own freedom of speech in response to Abbott’s call on Thursday. “It is one of his most popular songs and for Mr Abbott and anyone else to say that it should be banned I think is a bizarre thing to say,” George Brandis told ABC TV. “I thought Mr Abbott believed in freedom of speech.” As for how Macklemore himself feels about potential intrusions on his right to free speech? He’s just said he will “go harder”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/28/pauline-hanson-joins-labor-in-praising-review-of-family-law","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T05:06:34Z","webTitle":"Pauline Hanson joins Labor in praising review of family law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/28/pauline-hanson-joins-labor-in-praising-review-of-family-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/28/pauline-hanson-joins-labor-in-praising-review-of-family-law","fields":{"headline":"Pauline Hanson joins Labor in praising review of family law","bodyText":"Labor, One Nation’s Pauline Hanson and the Law Council of Australia have all welcomed the government’s decision to review the family law system. The attorney general, George Brandis, has asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to undertake the “long overdue” review, saying Australian families have evolved significantly since the Family Law Act 1975 came into force. He wants the commission to consider if the family law system still prioritises the best interests of children, best addresses family violence and child abuse, and helps families resolve their family law disputes quickly and safely while minimising the financial burden. The commission has been asked report back to government by 31 March 2019. Mark Dreyfus, the shadow attorney general, welcomed the government’s review, but criticised Brandis for creating some of the pressures on the system the review was intended to examine. “His failure to appoint a federal circuit court judge in Newcastle for 12 months, for example, has created huge backlogs in that jurisdiction that have harmed families,” Dreyfus said on Thursday. “Threatened cuts to legal assistance services have created major uncertainty for a key support network in the family law system, and the government has still not announced any funding to facilitate an end to domestic violence survivors being cross-examined by their abusers in court. “None of these problems can afford to wait until the report’s due date in 2019. Action must be taken concurrently with the ALRC’s work,” he said. Hanson said she was “so happy” with the news. She has campaigned for changes to the family law system for years, claiming it unduly advantages mothers in family breakdowns. “What needs to be addressed is the domestic violence orders. Women, mostly women, are going out throwing them around left, right and centre,” she told Channel Seven’s Sunrise program. “A domestic order, or an AVO … if the partner wants to ring up and say ‘look I want to see my children’, well that’s a DVO. How ridiculous is that? Because they call that harassment. “What I would like to see is that children, at point of separation, [the parents] have joint custody. Unless that parent has a criminal offence against them, they are on drugs, or they have a domestic violence order already on them. This is what I’ll be pushing for.” Fiona McLeod, the president of the Law Council of Australia, also praised the announcement of the review. “The Law Council has long been warning that our family law system is in crisis, primarily due to a lack of funding and resourcing,” she said. “While the number and complexity of family law cases has increased sharply in recent years, resourcing has not adequately increased to compensate. “Those on the frontline of our family law system have been sounding the alarms for years. So ‘the appropriate, early and cost-effective resolution of all family law disputes’ is a very appropriate focus of recommendations in this review. “The current lack of resources has meant that families facing the most serious family law issues are waiting for up to three years or more before a final trial,” she said. Brandis said on Thursday there were always financial demands on the system, but the Coalition had still managed to beef up the federal circuit court of Australia, which now has more than 60 judges and deals with nearly 90% of family law matters. “Now that was actually a court that, during the previous Labor government, at one stage, they wanted to abolish,” he said. “So of course there are pressures on the system, but we have put more judges into the system to deal with family law matters.” Brandis has appointed Prof Helen Rhoades to lead the two-year review. Rhoades has been a professor at Melbourne law school since 2012, the co-convenor of the Melbourne Law School’s family and children’s law research group, and the chair of the Family Law Council from 2010 to 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/27/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-2016-election-fake-news","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T23:51:06Z","webTitle":"Mark Zuckerberg: I regret ridiculing fears over Facebook's effect on election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/27/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-2016-election-fake-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/27/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-2016-election-fake-news","fields":{"headline":"Mark Zuckerberg: I regret ridiculing fears over Facebook's effect on election","bodyText":"Mark Zuckerberg said he regretted dismissing concerns about the Facebook’s role in influencing the US presidential race, his latest acknowledgement that misinformation on the platform has affected elections. Shortly after Trump’s surprise victory, the Facebook CEO had brushed aside charges that Facebook had had an impact on the race, calling it a “pretty crazy idea” and saying that voters “make decisions based on their lived experience”. But in a post on Wednesday directly responding to Donald Trump’s tweet labeling Facebook “anti-Trump”, Zuckerberg expressed remorse for his earlier statements rejecting concerns about the dangers of propaganda and fake news on Facebook. “After the election, I made a comment that I thought the idea misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election was a crazy idea. Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it,” the founder wrote, offering his first public admission that his initial remarks were off-base. “This is too important an issue to be dismissive.” Facebook’s role in the election has faced close scrutiny in recent weeks following the company’s disclosure that a Russian-based influence operation had purchased $100,000 in ads to promote divisive political and social messages during the presidential campaign, prompting the company to agree last week to provide the contents of 3,000 ads to Congress. The Russian ads spread controversial views on topics such as immigration and race and promoted 470 “inauthentic” pages and accounts, according to Facebook’s own description. The disclosure has added fuel to the findings of US intelligence officials that Russia was involved in influencing Trump’s race against Hillary Clinton. Leaks this week have further suggested that the ads targeted groups like Black Lives Matter in an effort to exploit racial divisions and may have focused on audiences in specific locations, including Ferguson and Baltimore, the center of major police brutality protests. Facebook has become increasingly important in a special counsel’s investigation of potential collusion between the Kremlin and Trump associates, prompting the president to directly attack Facebook and dismiss the scandal as a “hoax”. Addressing the president’s latest tweet, Zuckerberg wrote: “Trump says Facebook is against him. Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don’t like. That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like.” Although the CEO has continued to try to present Facebook as a neutral platform, evidence has repeatedly suggested that propagandists have exploited the site to promote pro-Trump views, with the majority of top-performing false election stories during the campaign favoring the Republican candidate. Zuckerberg, who has dismissed rumors that he plans to run for president in 2020, has increasingly weighed in on politics and publicly opposed a number of Trump’s policies. The CEO was critical of Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric during the campaign and recently doubled down on his opposition to the president’s decision to end a program protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. Zuckerberg’s latest post once again tried to paint Facebook as a force for good in the election, noting that candidates communicated directly with tens of millions of followers each day and that the social network helped register people to vote. Critics, however, have argued that Facebook is not doing enough and allows propaganda to spread with a model that depends on huge profits from cheap and easy ads purchased without any sales staff reviewing them. Facebook has faced backlash for influencing politics across the globe. The Guardian reported earlier this year that a series of Conservative party attack ads in the UK were sent to voters in a key marginal constituency, utilizing dummy Facebook accounts. Facebook also admitted last week that it had designated a Rohingya insurgent group a “dangerous organization” that should be censored, meaning it was silencing a group opposing Myanmar’s military, which has been accused by a United Nations official of “ethnic cleansing”. Last week, the CEO said Facebook was “working to ensure the integrity of the German elections” and had taken actions against “thousands” of fake accounts. Facebook officials announced on Wednesday that the company had removed “tens of thousands” of fake accounts in Germany in the month before the election and claimed that it planned to expand its partnerships with election commissions around the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/28/brandis-criticises-abbotts-bizarre-call-to-ban-macklemore-gay-anthem-at-nrl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T22:40:45Z","webTitle":"Brandis criticises Abbott's 'bizarre' call to ban Macklemore 'gay anthem' at NRL","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/28/brandis-criticises-abbotts-bizarre-call-to-ban-macklemore-gay-anthem-at-nrl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/28/brandis-criticises-abbotts-bizarre-call-to-ban-macklemore-gay-anthem-at-nrl","fields":{"headline":"Brandis criticises Abbott's 'bizarre' call to ban Macklemore 'gay anthem' at NRL","bodyText":"Australia’s attorney general, George Brandis, has defended American rapper Macklemore after the former prime minister Tony Abbott called for a performance of his hit song Same Love to be banned. Abbott’s daughter, Frances, who has emerged as a vocal supporter of same-sex marriage, has encouraged the American rapper to “go harder” in the face of her father’s criticism. Macklemore’s scheduled performance at Sunday’s NRL grand final, in the middle of the country’s same-sex marriage postal survey, has sparked outrage from no campaigners who oppose marriage equality. On Wednesday, the former Prime Minister said the season-ending event should not be “politicised” by the pro-LGBT rights song, after the former rugby league player Tony Wall launched a petition on Change.org to stop its performance. But his daughter, Frances, who this week appeared in a video backing same-sex marriage, has come out in support of the rapper, writing on social media site Instagram that “this is what we need right now”. “I still remember the first time I heard this song. I was sitting in my car, about to get out and go to work ... but stopped and listened. And that same day I went and bought the album and kept it in my car and listened to it over and over again. “I can’t think of a better song for all the hundreds and thousands of people to listen to on Saturday. This is what we need right now. “Go harder @macklemore.” She also wrote “press play”, a reference to the song’s lyrics: “we press play, don’t press pause. Progress, march on.” It came after Abbott’s senior colleague Brandis defended Mackelmore and labelled Abbot’s stance “bizarre” earlier on Thursday. “It is one of his most popular songs and for Mr Abbott and anyone else to say that it should be banned I think is a bizarre thing to say,” he told ABC TV. “I thought Mr Abbott believed in freedom of speech.” Macklemore himself and the NRL also refused to back down. The rapper said he would “go harder” as a result of the criticism. “I’m going to Australia to perform at kind of the Superbowl of their rugby league,” he told a US radio station. “I’m getting a lot of tweets from angry old white dudes in Australia. I think there’s a petition today to ban me from playing it. It’s interesting times in Australia.” In a statement, the NRL said fans “would not expect anything less” than a full-throated performance of Same Love. “Macklemore was chosen as the grand final act because he is currently one of the top acts in the world,” a spokesman said. “The response from fans has been overwhelmingly positive – many young people are coming to the grand final just to see him. “Naturally he will be performing his number one hits on Sunday. The fans would not expect anything less.” The rapper, who formerly performed as Professor Mack Lemore, won four Grammy awards in 2014 including best new artist and best rap album. His hit songs Thrift Shop and Same Love both topped the Aria charts between 2012 and 2013. Last year’s grand final was watched by a peak of 4.2 million Australians, which broke records for metropolitan audiences, and drew a crowd of 83,625 attendees. Wall, who started the petition to ban the song and who played 10 games for the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1995, asked the NRL to “reconsider its political position”. “My family and many other loyal NRL fans, who are no voters, will not feel comfortable watching the grand final when the NRL is imposing such a bold political stance on its fans while the issue is currently being voted on by the Australian people.” His petition also received support from the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, and the Liberal senator Eric Abetz. “Look I don’t even know who he is, Macklemore, anyway,” Hanson told Channel 7’s Sunrise program. “That’s how much important he is to me [but] the whole fact this is politicised is absolutely ridiculous.” Abetz told ABC radio that the NRL and AFL, who also supported marriage equality, had “done themselves a gross disservice” by “trying to force a political agenda”. Same Love, released in July 2012, references Macklemore’s uncle, John Haggerty, who is gay, and asks to end the culture of homophobia in rap music. It reached number one on the Aria charts for four weeks. Mackelmore’s performance on Sunday will last 15 minutes and will also include the songs Glorious, Downtown (featuring Eric Nally) and will feature singer Mary Lambert for Same Love, according to an NRL spokesman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/27/listen-radiohead-hans-zimmer-blue-planet-ocean-bloom-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T23:04:07Z","webTitle":"Listen to Radiohead and Hans Zimmer's Blue Planet collaboration (Ocean) Bloom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/27/listen-radiohead-hans-zimmer-blue-planet-ocean-bloom-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/27/listen-radiohead-hans-zimmer-blue-planet-ocean-bloom-bbc","fields":{"headline":"Listen to Radiohead and Hans Zimmer's Blue Planet collaboration (Ocean) Bloom","bodyText":"Radiohead and Hans Zimmer have released a clip of their collaboration (Ocean) Bloom, which will be the opening music for the forthcoming BBC series Blue Planet II.

In an interview with the Guardian last month, Cameron called praise for Wonder Woman “misguided”, adding that the film constituted a “step backwards”. The comments angered some and prompted a response from Jenkins. “James Cameron’s inability to understand what Wonder Woman is, or stands for, to women all over the world is unsurprising as, though he is a great film-maker, he is not a woman,” she wrote on Twitter. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter published on Wednesday, Cameron defended his critique of the film, stating that Wonder Woman was a “good” but not “groundbreaking” film because of Gadot’s depiction. “I’ll stand by that. I mean, she was Miss Israel, and she was wearing a kind of bustier costume that was very form-fitting,” Cameron said, referring to Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot. “She’s absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. To me, that’s not breaking ground. They had Raquel Welch doing stuff like that in the 60s.” He added that he was talking about Wonder Woman in the context of Linda Hamilton’s portrayal of Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, a role in which he says her sexuality was purposefully downplayed. “She wasn’t there to be liked or ogled, but she was central, and the audience loved her by the end of the film,” he said about Hamilton. Cameron continued: “So as much as I applaud Patty directing the film and Hollywood, uh, ‘letting’ a woman direct a major action franchise, I didn’t think there was anything groundbreaking in Wonder Woman.” The director added that the issue with female action stars is that they’re still marketed to teenage boys. “I just think Hollywood doesn’t get it about women in commercial franchises,” he said. “Drama, they’ve got that cracked, but the second they start to make a big commercial action film, they think they have to appeal to 18-year-old males or 14-year-old males, whatever it is.” Cameron did note that his remark was “probably a little bit simplistic,” but added, “I like the fact that, sexually, she had the upper hand with the male character, which I thought was fun.” Cameron is currently directing two Avatar sequels simultaneously and is in pre-production on a reboot of the Terminator franchise. In his original interview with the Guardian, Cameron also remarked on the difficulties he has faced in his relationships with “strong independent women”. “Being attracted to strong independent women has the downside that they’re strong independent women – they inherently don’t need you!” he said. “Fortunately, I’m married now to a strong independent woman who does believe she needs me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/27/cska-moscow-manchester-united-champions-league-group-a-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T20:48:47Z","webTitle":"Romelu Lukaku strikes twice more as Manchester United thrash CSKA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/cska-moscow-manchester-united-champions-league-group-a-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/27/cska-moscow-manchester-united-champions-league-group-a-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Romelu Lukaku strikes twice more as Manchester United thrash CSKA","bodyText":"Manchester United have maximum points from their two Champions League outings and return home from Moscow in buoyant mood. From the first to last whistle they coasted to a win that means José Mourinho’s side have now scored 28 goals in nine outings this season. United owed this victory to the superb Anthony Martial, who created both of Romelu Lukaku’s goals, scored a penalty and generally terrorised CSKA Moscow whenever he took possession. Mourinho called this the “strongest” display from teams he has managed against CSKA, having done so with Chelsea, Internazionale and Real Madrid. “That was my best team. It is true,” Mourinho said. “I came here and faced very good teams but I think this was the strongest performance. Today we were really strong and it was my strongest performance here.” Mourinho had made five changes from the 1-0 win at Southampton on Saturday. Marouane Fellaini, Phil Jones and Antonio Valencia did not travel because of injury and Marcus Rashford and Juan Mata were dropped to the bench. In came Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof to a three‑man defence. Mourinho also drafted in Daley Blind as left wing-back, Ander Herrera into midfield, and Martial to attack. United’s opening goal arrived on four minutes and was started and finished by Lukaku. The No9 spun a pass out to the left that was perfectly weighted into Martial’s path. The Frenchman cut inside and dropped the ball on to the head of Lukaku, who beat Igor Akinfeev to his left from a few yards out. David de Gea ensured the lead was not conceded within a few seconds. CSKA attacked and an Aleksandr Golovin miskick became a pass that rolled to Alan Dzagoev. The No10 pulled the trigger but De Gea dived to his right to steer the ball out for a corner. CSKA gained nothing from this and soon United were 2-0 up. Henrikh Mkhitaryan was upended by Georgi Schennikov in the area and Jonas Eriksson pointed to the spot. The referee was booed and so was Martial but the Frenchman coolly rolled the ball to Akinfeev’s left as he dived right. The home crowd continued to roar their team on though they were quietened by United’s third. Again, CSKA succumbed to the Martial-Lukaku combination. The No11 bounced a cross in, Vasili Berezutski air-kicked and there was Lukaku for a 14th goal in 11 appearances this season, his 10th in nine for United. He was close to a first United hat-trick when later taking aim from 25 yards, Akinfeev scrambling to his left to beat the ball out. Of Lukaku, Mourinho said: “It is a great achievement but it is only possible with a good team. Without a good team it is not possible and the team is playing well. They are amazing numbers for Romelu. He is humble and wants to learn and improve all the time. I think ambition is there and I don’t think he is going to be very impressed with your great words because I think he knows when things aren’t going well your [media] words are also strong in a negative way. I trust he can keep performing for us.” De Gea’s class is such that when called upon after United’s flurry of goals he could still react expertly to keep out a Fedor Chalov effort and at the interval it remained 3-0, with the contest surely over. CSKA’s sole hope appeared to be to try to get one back early in the second half and see where this might take them. They swept forward in a move that ended with Golovin firing over De Gea’s bar from outside United’s area. Yet this was a brief respite as the Martial‑Lukaku axis came close to breaching CSKA once more when some razor‑sharp play ended with the former snapping a pass to the latter right in front of Akinfeev and the Belgian should have hit the net rather than the goalkeeper. Next up Ashley Young, the right wing-back and United’s captain for the night, swung a rare cross in from his side and Blind rose, though he failed to direct his header. When Mkhitaryan smashed home United’s fourth after Martial’s attempt was repelled by Akinfeev the match became the proverbial stroll for United. This proved the Armenian’s last act as Jesse Lingard replaced him. From here United toyed with Russia’s second-placed side of last year, though Konstantin Kuchaev scored with a low shot from a narrow angle near the close."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/27/chelsea-antonio-conte-manchester-city-atletico-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T23:34:03Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte rages at scheduling of Chelsea’s Manchester City showdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/chelsea-antonio-conte-manchester-city-atletico-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/27/chelsea-antonio-conte-manchester-city-atletico-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte rages at scheduling of Chelsea’s Manchester City showdown","bodyText":"Antonio Conte has expressed dismay at the decision to stage Chelsea’s much anticipated game against Manchester City on Saturday, claiming he will only be able to select his team “one or two hours before we play” as he gauges his squad’s recovery from the eye-catching if draining win at Atlético Madrid. Chelsea became the first English team to win at the Spanish club courtesy of the substitute Michy Batshuayi’s stoppage‑time goal, with the result strengthening the Premier League side’s position at the top of the fledgling Group C. Yet, rather than basking in the success, Conte instead made clear his frustration at the scheduling of the visit of City, the early leaders, on Saturday teatime for the televised fixture and expressed disbelief that the option to play on Sunday had not been explored given next week is an international window. “Now, for us, it’s important to rest and try and recover very well but we don’t have a lot of time,” he said. “Honestly, in this case we are a bit penalised and I think it’s very important before taking a decision like this to analyse the different situations of the teams. Don’t forget, Manchester City played yesterday at home [against Shakhtar Donetsk]. We played tonight, away. For sure, we will return to London around 4am. To have only one day to prepare for this type of game is not right. Above all because, now, it’s an international break. There aren’t other fixtures. Honestly, I’m very surprised to see that this game we have to play on Saturday, not on Sunday. I don’t understand why. Honestly, it’s very tough to know [who will have recovered in time]. For sure, after this type of performance … I want to wait. Don’t forget: Saturday is a big game. To play a big game is better because we can keep that concentration very high. But I want to wait and check. “Maybe I’ll wait until the end, one or two hours before we play. I need to speak to my players to understand very well their physical condition. In this type of game you lose a lot of physical and mental energy. For this reason, I want to speak with everyone and then make the best decision.” Conte heaped praise on his players’ performance at the Wanda Metropolitano where Álvaro Morata, who limped away from the arena with a slight knock, scored his seventh goal in as many games for his new club, Eden Hazard was outstanding and Batshuayi secured the late win the visitors deserved. “They deserved to play this type of game, but above all to play in this way: with personality,” Conte said. “You can win, but if you win only by defending and go on the counterattack, I think the result doesn’t bring the right satisfaction. Instead, to come here and show we are ready to play, and that we want to understand where we are, that’s very important. The answer tonight was very positive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/28/eden-hazard-another-level-chelsea-atletico-madrid-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T07:55:50Z","webTitle":"Eden Hazard takes himself and Chelsea to another level with dazzling display | Dominic Fifield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/28/eden-hazard-another-level-chelsea-atletico-madrid-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/28/eden-hazard-another-level-chelsea-atletico-madrid-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Eden Hazard takes himself and Chelsea to another level with dazzling display","bodyText":"It was about two minutes after the final whistle, while Antonio Conte and his victorious players were still massing to acknowledge their fans’ delirious celebrations up in the gods, when the television cameras focused in upon their man. Diego Costa was sitting among the Atlético Madrid dignitaries, initially wearing the same haggard, disbelieving look as those immediately around him, before sinking his head into his hands. It was an image to sum up the locals’ dismal night but, deep inside, even the departed striker must have admired everything his former team‑mates had done here. Conte had always seen this contest as a means of gauging Chelsea’s real capabilities back in the elite, concerned as he was that even a year-long absence might have blunted their pedigree. In inflicting Atletico’s first home defeat to English opposition – and their first reverse in their new arena – the Premier League side have laid down a marker. The last time they travelled here, in the first leg of the 2014 semi-final, they had attempted merely to suffocate, eventually squeezing out a goalless draw. It is a reflection of Conte’s enterprise, and the confidence he has imbued, that they sought and managed to outplay the Spanish this time round. Had they been slightly more ruthless their winner would not have been as late as the third minute of stoppage time. This is the kind of result to alarm the other contenders, a victory crammed with positive performances: from N’Golo Kanté stamping authority all over a game at the higher level, to the effervescence going forward and the resilience and collective refusal to wilt once behind. There were other aspects that will trouble the perfectionist in Conte, though it would be hard to criticise his players for profligacy when the substitute, flung on late, goes on to score with the last kick of the contest. Most promising of all was the instant telepathy struck up by Eden Hazard and Álvaro Morata, a partnership that seemed revelatory in its productivity all evening. Manchester City, watching on from afar, will fear the damage that pair could inflict on Saturday at Stamford Bridge if both have recovered physically. Costa must have drooled at the familiar quality of the supply-line. “Eden’s performance was amazing,” said Conte. “It was the first big game for him after the bad injury and his answer was fantastic, positive.” There was reassurance to be had in Hazard’s brilliance. Conte had extended a challenge on the eve of this fixture, urging the Belgian to hoist his game to another level by dazzling in the Champions League. His response was emphatic, even if he had departed before his compatriot’s late winner. Hazard’s own moment had come just before the hour mark, collecting David Luiz’s cross-field pass on the chest, teasing space from Juanfran before whipping a glorious cross into the six-yard box. There pounced Morata, darting ahead of Lucas Hernández, to guide a header down and beyond Jan Oblak. The pair had threatened to prosper all night, clicking early into each other’s wavelength with Atlético powerless in response. Twice in the opening eight minutes Hazard had found the Spaniard in space only for Morata, his every touch jeered on his return to Madrid, to drag shots wide of the far post. This was Hazard uncoiled, a playmaker who has been patient as Chelsea understandably dealt carefully with his rehabilitation from summer ankle surgery, tearing back into the fray with relish on his second start of term. The scuttling runs, all low centre of gravity with ball glued to his instep, were incisive. The vision of his pass, and speed of thought, disconcerted Atletico’s experienced back-line. Juanfran and Godín heaved to contain him. Saúl Ñíguez and Koke sought to track him, but the Belgian merely scurried into areas neither was comfortable occupying. Diego Simeone had been so alarmed by the visitors’ start that he tweaked his formation in a bid to close the space between rigid lines of four where the elusive Hazard was revelling, though Antoine Griezmann still felt compelled to hack him down to quell the threat. The 26-year-old had been asked to play in a freer, more central role, flitting forward from the tip of the diamond. His goals will come. A tally of five in 32 games for Chelsea in this competition represents a meagre tally for a player of his pedigree and he found side-netting and, via a deflection, the woodwork from distance. Regardless, his delivery was always menacing. Marcos Alonso air-kicked from his centre, Cesc Fàbregas poked wide from a ball slid along the six-yard box and Morata, liberated into enemy territory beyond a labouring Lucas, merely managed a heavy touch and a shot that squirted wide of the far post. For a while it seemed Chelsea might end up cursing those misses but as it was, Conte’s bold substitutions – removing Hazard and Morata seemed surprising – yielded the rewards his side’s play merited. It is hard to recall a more impressive away display in this competition by an English team over recent years. As Costa might have acknowledged in his post-match gloom, a standard has been set in this section."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/28/build-it-and-theyll-come-public-infrastructure-is-no-panacea","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T01:33:40Z","webTitle":"Build it and they'll come?

Public infrastructure is no panacea","bodyText":"One of the biggest lies in politics spread by the free-market-loving conservatives is that governments don’t create jobs, businesses do. You only need to then ask about infrastructure to see them working hard to explain how, yes, it does create jobs but that somehow it is really about the private sector. At the moment, it is lucky we have governments that favour public spending because it is about all that is holding up infrastructure investment. In the June quarter, for the first time since 2013, the volume of engineering construction work increased in trend terms: It was a rise of just 0.8% but it was a rise nonetheless. But it was due to an increase in private-sector work – engineering construction for the private sector fell for the 14th consecutive quarter, down 1.4%. The good news is the decline in private-sector work looks to be coming to an end – the fall was the smallest for two years. But the reason for the increase was construction work done for the public sector. In the past year, engineering construction work done for the public sector rose 15% – the strongest growth since 2009 and the financial crisis stimulus spending: But even this was not enough to totally counter the collapse of infrastructure work done by the private sector on a yearly basis – total engineering construction fell by 4.2% over the past year. That’s because while public-sector construction might be ramping up, it remains well below the levels achieved by the private sector with its mining-industry-driven spending of 2012 and 2013: So while the public sector is kicking things along, there is only so much that can be done to balance the overall collapse in construction spending. But good news as well is that the collapse in private-sector construction work was mostly confined to the mining states – with Queensland’s collapse now at an end, and that of Western Australia nearing its end: And public spending clearly has had an impact because, despite the overall collapse of private-sector-driven infrastructure, construction has become the boom industry for jobs. In the past year, the construction industry added 83,300 jobs – worth a full quarter of all jobs, a major effort given only 9% of all employees work in that industry. Only the healthcare and social-assistance sector contributed more to employment: Cleary these jobs, while within the private sector, are not being driven only by private-sector work. A big reason for the work is public-sector investment. In 2016-17 the value of engineering construction work done was 1.8% of GDP – the highest since 2012-13, and the value of work yet to be done was worth a record 5.4% of GDP: One big reason for the public-sector growth of construction has been the NBN. After the final sale of Telstra, the public sector looked to be totally out of the telecommunications construction game but the NBN has seen it come roaring back – and 30% of the increase in public-sector construction is due to work in that sector: But there have also been large increases in the more traditional areas of roads and rail. And while the construction as a percentage of GDP remains below the levels of 2008 to 2013, there has been a significant jump from where it was two years ago: But where we really see the big increase is when we look ahead at the value of work yet to be done: Yet we should not fall into the trap of thinking just because there is expected to be a surge of public infrastructure there will also be a surge in jobs and economic growth. Take for example the $8.4bn planned to be spent on inland rail. This project is notionally “off budget” because the money is being treated as an investment expected to generate a return. Except no one really thinks it will generate a return. In 2015, a report undertaken by former deputy prime minister John Anderson found that “while the economic analysis indicates that inland rail will deliver a net economic benefit to Australia, the expected operating revenue over 50 years will not cover the initial capital investment required to build the railway”. That is, even after 50 years, the cost of building the rail will not be met by the expected revenue. The report thus noted “a substantial public funding contribution is required”. That contribution of $8.4bn certainly is substantial. But as Crikey’s Bernard Keane noted at the time, in the May budget Treasury cautioned that “the project is sensitive to increases in project cost and lower revenues from users, and these risks could decrease the returns on the government’s investment in the project”. That reflected the view of Infrastructure Australia, which last year noted that while the business cost ratio found it would generate a positive economic return, at a ratio of 1.1 (in effect a $1.10 return per $1 spent) things needed to go right for that to happen. It noted “given the marginal nature of the business cost ratio, an increase in project cost could have a significant impact on the final ratio”. That’s a polite way of saying if costs overrun, the economic return will be less than the cost of the project. And it will almost certainly overrun. The Grattan Institute recently found that “over the past 15 years, Australian governments have spent $28bn more on transport infrastructure than they told taxpayers they would” – an amount worth nearly a quarter of the total project budgets. Governments love to break out the hi-vis vests and talk about the greatness of infrastructure – even when at the same time they are saying governments don’t create jobs. But while the level of public construction work certainly has helped boost work in the past year, we should always be wary of praising any public infrastructure just because the money is being spent. The point of public spending is to create greater economic return not a photo op."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/27/anderlecht-celtic-champions-league-group-b-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T20:53:53Z","webTitle":"Scott Sinclair completes Celtic’s perfect night against Anderlecht","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/anderlecht-celtic-champions-league-group-b-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/27/anderlecht-celtic-champions-league-group-b-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Scott Sinclair completes Celtic’s perfect night against Anderlecht","bodyText":"Celtic have sampled so few successes in Champions League away matches that they are entitled to cherish this one. The perfect response to a mauling at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain was supplied on a comfortable evening in Brussels. This marked Celtic’s second win in 28 attempts on the road in the competition. It also marks the first time in the Champions League they have kept a clean sheet away from home. Wider context is positive for a team who enjoy such dominance in Scotland that ability is often underplayed. On this evidence Celtic are vastly superior to Anderlecht in all departments. Another away trip, to Bayern Munich next month, suddenly carries heavy significance. “It was an outstanding performance and result,” said the Hoops manager, Brendan Rodgers. “Everyone had built the game up before; it was a real pressure game for us. For a Scottish team to come away, win 3-0 and keep a clean sheet at this level, is a big achievement.” Anderlecht’s dismal opening to the season has left them sitting seventh in their top flight and without a permanent manager. Unsurprisingly, Rodgers stressed before kick-off that they remained formidable as Celtic sought to kickstart their season away from the domestic scene. The deployment of such an attacking XI – Scott Sinclair, Tom Rogic and Patrick Roberts all started in support of Leigh Griffiths – suggested the manager quietly sensed Anderlecht’s vulnerability. After a turgid opening spell, it took 31 minutes for either goalkeeper to be called into action, Anderlecht’s Frank Boeckx saving a long-range drive from Olivier Ntcham comfortably. Celtic alleviated the tedium with a fine move that deserved its reward of the opening goal. Ntcham played a terrific pass to the marauding Kieran Tierney. The left-back’s low cross found Griffiths at the back post, and the striker took a single touch to convert. Anderlecht could have restored parity within a minute, Craig Gordon instead holding an attempt from Sofiane Hanni. The captain really should have done better having permitted himself space and time. The home side duly opened the second period with a brief vigour not witnessed in the first. A dipping, swerving shot from Hanni caused Gordon problems before Celtic produced a response sufficient to settle any nerves. Dreadful defending played a key part in that goal, Olivier Deschacht miscontrolling a pass from Leander Dendoncker to the point where Roberts could pinch possession. The Manchester City loanee lashed a shot that bounded past Boeckx via a deflection off Serigne Mbodji. There was little doubt as to where the Anderlecht blame lay; Deschacht was replaced minutes later. Anderlecht huffed and puffed in search of salvation that never really looked like arriving. The perfect night for Rodgers was completed by Sinclair, who clipped the ball home in stoppage time. “I believe we can be better than we were tonight,” the manager added. Maybe even Bayern will take note. Celtic’s travel sickness has been cured."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/27/lindsey-vonns-race-against-men-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T20:38:42Z","webTitle":"Skier Lindsey Vonn makes bid to race against men in World Cup downhill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/27/lindsey-vonns-race-against-men-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/27/lindsey-vonns-race-against-men-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Skier Lindsey Vonn makes bid to race against men in World Cup downhill","bodyText":"The US Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA) will put forth a formal proposal to the International Ski Federation (FIS) next week for Lindsey Vonn to participate in a men’s World Cup downhill race next year. The bid would pitch Vonn, the most decorated skier in American history with 77 wins and 130 podiums, opposite men over the last weekend of November 2018 at Lake Louise, the lone Canadian stop on the circuit where she’s notched 14 of her record 39 World Cup downhill wins. The USSA will make the proposal at the worldwide governing body’s pre-season meetings next week in Zurich. “Further details are still unknown, but this is certainly an anticipated topic that divides the FIS officials,” the governing body said in a statement on Wednesday. It’s not the first time Vonn has made the case to race alongside men. Five years ago, the governing body rejected a similar proposal citing rules barring mixed-gender races. FIS women’s race director Atle Skaardal expressed further hesitation this summer, saying it would be a “very difficult challenge” to organize. “It will be a very difficult challenge to find a reasonable way of doing this because one point that everyone is underestimating is that we need to have equal rights for everyone,” Skaardal said in a June statement. “So if the ladies are allowed to race with the men, then also the men need to be authorized to ski with the ladies, and I’m not sure this is a direction we want to go. I see it as a very difficult topic. … I’m confident that everyone will think this through.” Vonn, who turns 33 in October, said last year that she’d like to “beat some boys and then call it a day” during her final season before retiring from competitive skiing. “I know I’m not going to win, but I would like to at least have the opportunity to try,” Vonn told the Denver Post earlier this year. “I think I’ve won enough World Cups where I should have enough respect within the industry to be able to have that opportunity.” Vonn, currently in training for the Pyeongchang Olympics after suffering a fractured humerus in November, has said she plans to retire after the 2018-19 season. She is one of six women to have won World Cup races in all five disciplines of alpine skiing: downhill, super-G, giant slalom, slalom, and super combined."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/27/grenfell-tower-council-terminate-contract-property-managers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T21:45:18Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower: council to terminate contract with property managers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/27/grenfell-tower-council-terminate-contract-property-managers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/27/grenfell-tower-council-terminate-contract-property-managers","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower: council to terminate contract with property managers","bodyText":"Kensington and Chelsea council has voted to terminate its contract with the body responsible for managing Grenfell Tower and find new management for its housing stock. The Conservative-led authority in west London passed the motion to end the arrangement with Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (TMO) unanimously at a meeting on Wednesday evening. It had faced accusations that it breached its duty of care by ignoring residents’ complaints and failing to carry out repairs, and over its response to the fire in June. Theresa May announced in August that it would be stripped of responsibility for the estate surrounding the tower. The deputy council leader Kim Taylor-Smith told the meeting: “The TMO no longer has the trust of residents.” He added that the council was working with the TMO to bring its contract to a close, citing lack of confidence in its fire safety record and a unanimous vote of no confidence from 25 residents’ associations. But Taylor-Smith said the council was “drawing the contract to a close in an organised fashion”, adding: “We are listening to residents and consulting on how they want their homes and neighbourhoods to be managed in the future.” The meeting also heard that just 20 families from Grenfell Tower have been moved into permanent new accommodation. About 180 households still need to be resettled. The council leader, Elizabeth Campbell, said 52 of the families still in temporary accommodation had accepted offers of new homes, but were yet to move. Another 150 households living in low-rise blocks surrounding the tower have been given the option of moving to a new home. The council has bought about 120 homes since the fire destroyed Grenfell Tower on 14 June, with another 40 in the process of acquisition, said Campbell, adding that the authority hoped to buy another 100 homes by Christmas. Addressing the three-hour meeting, Campbell said: “Everyone is frustrated at the pace,” but she was “confident the number of people moving into new homes will increase dramatically in the coming months”. “This is not a time for haste, this is a time for getting it right,” she said. Members of the North Kensington community also addressed the council meeting, the second since the fire, although the atmosphere was markedly more orderly than the previous one in July, at which survivors made angry and emotional contributions and heckled throughout the proceedings. There were few survivors at the meeting, largely because it clashed with a meeting of Grenfell United, the main support group for victims and relatives. Volunteer Loubna Aghzafi, one of those organising the relief effort from the community, was in attendance. She brought a bottle of milk with her dated 16 August which she said was recently placed in a box of supplies by council workers. She said the milk had been given by a mother to her nine-week-old baby before she realised her mistake, and that the child was ill as a result. Aghzafi claimed all the council staff who were “solution minded” had been sidelined, while those bent on protecting themselves had taken over. She said: “You are desperate to safeguard each other’s rank and most importantly to further their careers on the back of this tragedy.” Isis Amlak, a member of the Grenfell Action Group, attacked the council for its “bullying” culture. She said: “Think of all those people that you have employed in the past that have a history of bullying, a history of making cuts, destroying the services that, had they been there, could have averted so much of this.” Campbell’s assertion that the council was “doing the best we can” was dismissed by the Labour group leader, Robert Atkinson, who condemned the slow rate of progress. “The council needs to be doing more and needs to be doing it faster,” he said. He repeated a call to the government to offer a permanent amnesty for any undocumented migrants affected by the fire. A council spokesman said it was “urgently investigating” the allegation about out-of-date baby milk, saying the meeting was the first they had heard about it. He added: “We are on it right now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/28/morning-mail-how-pokies-take-australias-money","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T21:01:19Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: how pokies take Australia's money","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/28/morning-mail-how-pokies-take-australias-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/28/morning-mail-how-pokies-take-australias-money","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: how pokies take Australia's money","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 28 September. Top stories Poker machines are big business in Australia, with players losing $11bn on them every year. A special Guardian interactive shows how they use a range of design features that leverage psychology to keep people playing. In an accompanying investigation, Melissa Davey dives into the opaque science and emotional pull of pokies. “One time late at night at a bar in regional Victoria, I saw a lady who was hugging the machine in a very affectionate manner,” Charles Livingstone, an expert on pokies, tells her. “Research has shown there are some people who tend to anthropomorphise poker machines.” Poker machines are in the spotlight in a a landmark court case in Melbourne against Aristocrat Technologies (the makers of the Dolphin Treasure pokies) and Crown Casino. Former gambler Shonica Guy’s lawyers argue that Aristocrat Technologies and Crown are engaging in deceptive, misleading and unconscionable conduct by providing Dolphin Treasure pokies to the public. Crown Casino told the court they were doing nothing more than making authorised machines available; Aristocrat Technologies said it has “followed the [industry] standards to the tee” and the way the machines worked was not a secret. More than 92% of voters in Iraqi Kurdistan have voted for independence from Baghdad. Euphoria on the streets of Erbil in recent days is likely to be short-lived as a landmark moment in a centuries-old push for self-determination has been met with the threat of air and land blockades from the Iraqi prime minister. Masoud Barzani, the de facto president of the region’s Kurds, had hoped to use the poll as political leverage that could help negotiate independence from Iraq. But his moves have been met with increasing hostility from the region, as well as the US and Britain, raising the prospect of isolation and blockade. A week on from Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s hospitals are at breaking point. Donald Trump has repeatedly praised his administration’s relief efforts but the situation on the ground is growing dire as millions of Americans trapped in the disaster zone. The island’s few functioning hospitals are at capacity and have scant electricity of fuel. Downed power lines rest in fetid floodwaters that stink of sewage and 44% of residents don’t have clean drinking water. Puerto Rico’s health infrastructure was already fragile before Maria struck, described by the Urban Institute as “financially unstable”. Now it can cope no more. “This has been building up, we’ve had health issues for years,” said Lourdes Inoa Monegro, a community health activist. “This is the outburst.” The results of the 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey are in and they reveal a mismatch between the way respondents think money should be spent tackling drug abuse and how the government is spending it. Participants nominated education, treatment and harm reduction as the areas that should have most invested in them, but governments continue to spend an estimated 64% of their drug budgets on law enforcement. “What you’ve got is a situation where the number of drug deaths in Australia is 10 times higher than it is in Portugal,” says Associate Prof David Caldicott from the Australian National University. “And this is the case because Portugal have reallocated money from law enforcement to health and, lo and behold, people have stopped dying. This is widely known but it doesn’t seem to be leading to policy changing in Australia.” Japanese scientists claim to have found evidence of life from 4bn years ago, with fragments of carbon in rocks from Canada the remnants of ancient organisms, they say. The claim suggests the first organisms to emerge on Earth did so during a violent period of history, when asteroids and comets pounded the planet. Yuji Sano, a senior researcher at the University of Tokyo, said prior to his team’s discovery, life was thought to have emerged around 3.8bn years ago. Sport How does a player, especially a debutant, cope with the pressure, anxiety, intensity and scrutiny of an AFL grand final? Craig Little speaks to Glenn Archer, the 1996 Norm Smith medallist. “When it’s your turn to go, you go,” he says. “If you prepare for that, the rest will fall into place.” Ben Stokes has retained his place as England vice-captain for the Ashes as the squad was announced last night – despite his arrest on suspicion of actual bodily harm and nursing a broken finger. Both, writes the Guardian’s Ali Martin, are subject to change. Elsewhere Vic Marks says the selection of batsmen Gary Ballance and James Vince, both with mixed Test records, smacks of a “pick your mates” strategy. Thinking time Acclaimed fantasy novelist Isobelle Carmody’s celebrates the writing of her new favourite up-and-coming Australian author, Daniel Findlay. Findlay’s debut novel Year of the Orphan tells of a post-apocalyptic Australia, where scavengers roam and a young woman seeks answers in the ravaged desert. “But above the drama of the narrative, the brilliantly detailed landscape and the world-building employed, Findlay’s novel finds its greatest power in the broken and degraded language in which it is told,” says Carmody. Days away from Stoptober and SoberOctober the Guardian asked readers for advice on how they broke their worst habits, including drinking, smoking and nail-biting. Self-help books (the good ones) were a common route, and incremental changes seemed to have staying power rather than going cold turkey. “I had brought a boyfriend back to my flat and he accidentally opened the door to my hoarding cupboard and got a shock.” says Lauren. “ I realised if I wanted to really let anybody in emotionally, I’d have to kick the hoarding”. Can we save the world’s coral with “assisted evolution”, “assisted gene flow” and synthetic biology? Or is it just an expensive and futile exercise in scientists “playing God”? Planet Oz columnist Graham Readfearn looks at the science on this contentious solution to the harm warming sea waters are having on precious reef biodiversity. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has a new enemy – and its one of America’s greatest tech success stories. “Facebook was always anti-Trump. The networks were always anti-Trump hence, Fake News, @nytimes (apologized) &amp; @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?” suggested the president overnight. “But the people were Pro-Trump! Virtually no president has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months – and economy roaring.” Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald splashes with a report that Nine and Fox Sports have told the NRL and the government they want smaller stadiums because screening rows of empty seats on their rugby league broadcasts are “a bad look”. The Hobart Mercury reports that the Tasmanian premier Will Hodgman has denied claims of a government cover-up over the death of a baby last week who was the focus of two child safety investigations. Labor says child protection services are in crisis, with chronic staff shortages reported. A deradicalisation helpline set up by the government has received five calls in two months, the ABC reports, with the $3.9m service failing to gain traction. “It costs millions, but only a few people have called it,” a source told the ABC. “One call was a wrong number, the other was a parent worried their kid was dating a Muslim.” Coming up A legal challenge to the Fair Work Commission’s decision to cut Sunday penalty rates will be heard in the federal court in Melbourne. The appeal brought by unions representing hospitality and retail workers is set for three days of hearings. The high court is due to publish reasons for its decision in the failed legal challenge to the same-sex marriage postal survey.

Even if you lose. Jeremy Corbyn delivered his third – and best – speech as Labour leader to a party giddy with optimism. By reducing the Tories to minority government and increasing Labour’s vote by the biggest amount since 1945, Mr Corbyn has transformed gloom to cheer. That the Labour leader has done so from the left is a vindication of his brand of “modern, progressive socialist” politics. Mr Corbyn’s attachment to socialism is important: since the 1990s Labour leaders have avoided mentioning the word, which they viewed as being synonymous with the then unpopular notions of state control and higher taxes. They preferred instead to declare their loyalty to democratic socialist “values”. Values are less controversial than policies. Values can be shared, whereas policies divide. However, Mr Corbyn’s speech was peppered with plans to intervene in markets where vested interests, represented by the Conservative party, have conspired against the multitude. The Labour leader wants to distinguish his party from the thinking of the last four decades, arguing for a “new model of economic management to replace the failed dogmas of neoliberalism”. His contention is that the party is now electable because of socialism, not despite it. This is stirring stuff. There’s little doubt that Mr Corbyn spoke to the passions of the party, but did he speak to the preoccupations of the wider electorate? His diagnosis is founded on unquestionable truths: that an era of deregulation, privatisation and low taxes for the wealthy came tumbling down with the global financial crisis. Bankers played a leading role in the crisis, but it’s the rest of society that has paid for the crash. This has had profound consequences: most notably class divisions have been politically revived. “Them and us” economics is rooted in the fact the top 1% of society has recovered all the ground it lost while the average worker faces the longest period of falling real-terms pay since the Napoleonic wars. It’s difficult to sell capitalism to those with no capital. The symptoms of the malaise are clear and Mr Corbyn’s bold claim is to have the cure. The medicine prescribed by the Labour leader is uncontroversial elsewhere. Rent controls for housing are coming into force in Scotland to deflate ballooning rents. Public ownership of utilities is a mainstream view in western Europe. Labour’s reversal of corporation tax cuts would merely return the rate to its 2011 level and still leave companies shouldering a lighter burden than they do in bigger European economies. The party should be congratulated for debunking the idea that decreasing corporate taxes is the only way to increase investment. What is fascinating about Mr Corbyn’s speech is its hidden depths, most notably on possible “alternative models” to capitalism. The Labour party sees in the future not just the rise of robots, which might entrench economic feudalism, but also the worry that too many people will remain trapped in drudgery-filled, low-productivity jobs. Although Mr Corbyn did not spell this out, he referenced a little-publicised party report that fleshes out Labour’s view of the new economy. This states that accelerating automation is a key political project. Labour’s goal, the report argued, should be to accelerate into this more automated future “while building new institutions where technological change is shaped by the common good”. Mr Corbyn’s socialism is evidently more intellectually bracing than previously countenanced. Oratory is not shallow or frivolous – it is at the centre of our political process. Mr Corbyn has inspired the faithful by telling party members what they want to hear. His plans are premised on the idea that “there is a new common sense emerging about how the country should be run”. This “common sense”, a phrase significant in any attempt at political and social transformation, challenges the idea that the truths of society can be found only in markets. In proving electorally successful, Mr Corbyn can lay claim to have expanded the epistemic range of public debate. Ideas once thought unsayable have become acceptable. This year was when the crisis in economics caught up with the crisis in politics. But the future contains the biggest issue to face Britain since the end of the second world war. Mr Corbyn’s gnomic utterances on Britain’s long-term relationship with Europe were telling. Labour’s muddled thinking is obscured by the shambolic approach of a ruling Tory party fractured over Brexit. The Labour leader has proved he can lead a congregation. But he will need a broader message to convert the masses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/29/jostling-for-position-who-to-watch-at-tory-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Jostling for position: who to watch at Tory conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/29/jostling-for-position-who-to-watch-at-tory-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/29/jostling-for-position-who-to-watch-at-tory-conference","fields":{"headline":"Jostling for position: who to watch at Tory conference","bodyText":"The party conference is where Conservative leadership speculation runs wild year after year, as senior politicians who fancy the top job seek to show that they can impress the membership. Here are the cabinet ministers and senior politicians limbering up for a week of showing off to the party faithful: Boris Johnson Surrounded by gaggles of selfie-seeking members and pursued by photographers, Johnson is likely to attract attention wherever he goes in Manchester, although he is keeping a relatively low profile. He will speak at one event on “Global Britain”, though, which could give him the opportunity to go off message on Brexit. Watch out for: Johnson strayed beyond his brief with his personal Brexit blueprint in the Telegraph, so watch out to see whether he tries to use the conference platform to diverge from Theresa May’s plan for leaving the EU. Troublemaking potential: There is always the threat of disobedience from Johnson, who could throw the whole conference into chaos if he chooses to undermine the prime minister in public or even resign his post. Ruth Davidson The Scottish Tory leader is a favourite with the membership and a potential party leader, despite not having a seat in Westminster. She is clearly using conference this year to boost her profile even further, appearing at two events “in conversation” with prominent journalists, which is a way to give wide-ranging and personal interviews in a relaxed public setting. Watch out for: A politician’s leadership prospects can be made in the conference hall, so her speech to members on Sunday will be a must-see. Troublemaking potential: She is unlikely to destabilise May’s leadership in the way Johnson has, but could make punchy interventions on the EU and immigration that place her firmly on the liberal, modernising wing of the party. Philip Hammond The chancellor has clashed with Johnson in recent weeks over the need to make sure that the economy and businesses are protected during Brexit, which is expected to feature heavily in his Monday morning speech to the conference hall. His two fringe appearances appear designed to hammer home the same point as he speaks on delivering growth in a new era and at a CBI event on how businesses and government can work together through Brexit. Watch out for: Any awkward interactions with Johnson in the corridors, after their tug-of-war over the prime minister’s Brexit policy. Troublemaking potential: Hammond is unlikely to cause problems for May unless riled by his Brexiter colleagues. David Davis Davis has pitched himself as the pragmatic peacemaker on Brexit in the runup to the conference, despite talk before recess that his supporters were gathering names for a challenge to May’s leadership. He is appearing only at one fringe event, on trade policy – treading on the turf of the international trade secretary, Liam Fox – but has found time to cosy up to May’s coalition partners in the DUP by appearing as an honorary Tory at their annual reception. Watch out for: No one would be surprised to see Davis being extra friendly to his Tory MP colleagues on the late-night party circuit just in case the top job were to become vacant in the next couple of years. Troublemaking potential: Davis is still acting the loyal lieutenant to May, so there is little chance he will depart from her Brexit script. Amber Rudd The home secretary is another senior cabinet minister who thought about a leadership bid after the election. She will appear at a reception for One Nation Conservatives during conference, nailing her colours to the mast as a modernising heir to Cameron, like Davidson, and her speech on Tuesday afternoon will come in the session on “fighting injustices”. Watch out for: Digs at Johnson are her speciality; she has already accused him of “backseat driving” on Brexit last week and likened him during the referendum campaign to a boyfriend you would not want to drive you home. Troublemaking potential: Rudd is also loyal to May for the moment, but firmly on the soft-Brexit wing of the party alongside Hammond. Jacob Rees-Mogg The darling of the rightwing membership is the most prolific speaker at fringe events during conference, despite his protestations that he does not fancy himself as party leader. The backbench arch-Eurosceptic is clearly building his profile with the activists by speaking at no less than seven Brexit-themed gatherings. Watch out for: Take your pick from “The Threat to Brexit”, “Brexit: With Jacob-Rees-Mogg”and a fully fledged conference rally on “Making a Success of Brexit”.

In a speech entitled Central bank independence in retrospect, he said the Reserve Banks of Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Europe, had generally performed well since they were given independence in the 1980s and 1990s to pursue inflation targeting goals, solving the problem of high inflation. But he said the legitimacy and effectiveness of central bank independence was now under scrutiny, because people were increasingly blaming central banks for their economies’ woes. He said growth had been unsatisfactory since the global financial crisis, nominal wages had been stagnant and governments had been unwilling to use fiscal policy to boost growth substantially, and this could also be contributing to the public’s scepticism in central bank independence. He warned the current focus on the distributional consequences of monetary policy, in this weak growth environment, posed a “new threat” to central bank independence. “My view is that inflation targeting and central bank independence are being blamed for economic outcomes that are not a consequence of either of them, but rather of our understanding of the way the economy operates,” Debelle said. “The concerns around income distribution are much starker ... when nominal wages are stagnant for a significant share of the population. “Another possible explanation is that if a primary transmission channel of unconventional monetary policy is through asset prices (including house prices), then the wealth channel may be playing a disproportionately larger role than in the past. “The distributional impact of the wealth channel may well be larger than that of other channels of monetary policy transmission. “If the distributional impact of monetary policy channels is larger now than it was in the past, this can compromise the legitimacy of instrument independence,” he said. Debelle said another complicating factor for central banks was their increasing pursuit of financial stability goals since the GFC. He said their pursuit of financial stability goals raised serious questions about how those goals were interacting with inflation targets. If central banks were going to keep pursuing financial stability goals, he said, they ought to consider if they will need independence to define those goals, or instrument independence to pursue those goals. “The goal of financial stability has generally been left vague,” Debelle said. “It is much harder to get agreement on what are the important elements of financial stability and how central banks should go about achieving them. “Does the goal of financial stability need to be better defined than it is at the moment? If so, by whom? Should the central bank have complete independence to pursue its goal of financial stability with whatever instruments it so chooses, including when the distributional implications of some of those instruments are much starker? “The questions do not have a straightforward answer. I would hope they would be a hot topic for PhD students today in the way that central bank independence was when Adam Posen and I were PhD students,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/29/young-people-more-anxious-than-ever-due-to-brexit-and-rising-debt","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T23:01:09Z","webTitle":"Young people 'more anxious than ever' due to Brexit and rising debt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/29/young-people-more-anxious-than-ever-due-to-brexit-and-rising-debt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/29/young-people-more-anxious-than-ever-due-to-brexit-and-rising-debt","fields":{"headline":"Young people 'more anxious than ever' due to Brexit and rising debt","bodyText":"A third of young people feel more anxious now than this time last year, according to a study that found the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union, money worries and the cost of housing have magnified doubts about future prospects. The rise in anxiety sits alongside figures showing that around half of young people are struggling to make ends meet, including 10% of young people who are facing dire financial problems as stagnating wages and rising inflation hit their incomes. Coming only a week after senior MPs called for an independent review of the UK’s rising debt levels, the Young Women’s Trust said many of the 4,000 young people aged 16 to 30 it surveyed for its annual report, Worrying Times, battled to make it to the end of the month without borrowing money from friends, family or commercial lenders. The report found that 41% of young women and 28% of young men said it was “a real struggle to make their cash last until the end of the month”, compared with 39% and 27% respectively in 2016. The report’s authors said: “Our findings show young women are consistently more likely than young men to encounter money problems, workplace discrimination, health problems, worries about the future and low confidence. “And women from the lowest socio-economic groups are faring worse still, with their situation also deteriorating in the last 12 months.” The Young Women’s Trust said some measures of financial anxiety and wellbeing among the under-30s had recovered slightly since last year, when the poll registered a severe slump in financial confidence. But in July, when the poll was carried out, almost half of young people (47%) still said they were worried for the future. When asked what, if anything, made them feel anxious, the most commonly cited reasons chosen from a range of options were the UK leaving the European Union (42%), the ability to afford a home in the future (41%), their current financial position (37%), not earning enough to live on (35%) and finding a job (34%). The Princes Trust youth charity said the survey showed practical and financial pressures were piling up on young people. “This is clearly taking a significant toll on their hopes and aspirations for the future, particularly among young women,” it said. Last week the chair of the business select committee, Rachel Reeves, and Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, urged the government to set up an independent public inquiry into the £200bn of debt amassed by households. The prominent Labour MPs said they were shocked at rising levels of debt, especially among the young, while the Conservative chair of the treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan, said she wanted her colleagues to examine “what it is about our households that accumulate debt”. Concerns about rising debts levels were underscored by reports from the debt charities Citizens Advice and StepChange, which recorded a jump in the number of young people seeking help with bad debts. Citizens Advice said the failure to cope with payday loans and other forms of high-cost credit was one of the main reasons for the influx of distressed young people seeking advice. StepChange reported that in the first six months of 2017 almost two-thirds (64%) of all clients who sought advice were under 40. In 2013 only 53% were aged between 18 and 40. The chief executive of the Young Women’s Trust, Carole Easton, said: “The traditional stereotype of youthful swagger and optimism seems to have been replaced by worry and anxiety. Perhaps this is not surprising given that young people are facing serious financial troubles and uncertainty about their future.” Lindsay Owen, the director of policy and evaluation at The Prince’s Trust, said: “It is vital that these young people are empowered to develop the confidence and coping skills they need to thrive, and one way we can do this is by supporting them into jobs, education or training.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/28/caa-legal-action-ryanair-nicola-sturgeon-flight-cancellations","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T23:13:24Z","webTitle":"Ryanair ordered to tell passengers of options after flights cancelled","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/28/caa-legal-action-ryanair-nicola-sturgeon-flight-cancellations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/28/caa-legal-action-ryanair-nicola-sturgeon-flight-cancellations","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair ordered to tell passengers of options after flights cancelled","bodyText":"Ryanair has been ordered to tell hundreds of thousands of passengers how it proposes to provide alternatives to cancelled flights by 5pm on Friday. As criticism of the Ryanair’s treatment of affected passengers intensified, the aviation regulator told the Irish airline to explain how it will reroute passengers and email all those affected by Wednesday to explain their options. In a strongly worded letter, the CAA’s chief executive, Andrew Haines, told Ryanair: “This issue is urgent, as passengers may already have been disadvantaged by taking a decision based on misleading information provided by Ryanair.” Ryanair responded, saying it had reminded its customer service agents on Wednesday “of the refund and re-accommodation entitlements of customers in cases of flight cancellations”. But a Ryanair memo, seen by the Guardian, appears to instruct call centre staff that if offering flights with other carriers to do so provided the price “does not exceed three times the value of the original Ryanair fare”. The document was criticised by consumer group, Which? – its managing director Alex Neill said: “Ryanair appears to be plucking figures out of thin air as there is no legal basis for the arbitrary figure they’ve set. “The law says passengers must be rerouted and there’s no specified limit on cost. This yet again highlights the importance of the action which the Civil Aviation Authority has started.” The CAA had said earlier that Ryanair had wrongly claimed it was not obliged to arrange new flights for passengers on rival airlines, and in his letter Haines spelt out that emails previously sent to passengers had “omitted material information” about their rights. Ryanair came under scrutiny after announcing earlier this week that it would scrap 18,000 flights on 34 routes between November 2017 and March 2018, affecting nearly 400,000 passengers. The statement came a week after a first wave of cancellations was announced. Haines called on Ryanair to issue a press release explaining how it would reroute passengers, including a commitment to assist passengers who had already chosen an option that was not suitable for them as a result of being misled by the airline, and a promise to reimburse those affected. The latest intervention by the CAA – which has launched enforcement action against the Dublin-based carrier – came after criticism from Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister. She lamented Ryanair’s “deeply regrettable” decision to cancel scores of flights from Scotland, and backed the CAA’s legal warnings to the airline over misleading passengers. “I have serious concerns about the decisions taken by Ryanair in the past couple of days. These will cause disruption to many passengers travelling to and from Scotland to London, and indeed to other destinations in Europe,” she told MSPs. “We fully support the CAA’s launch of enforcement action because it is vital at the time of disruption that airlines provide full and accurate information about the rights that they [passengers] have.” The Scottish transport minister, Humza Yousaf, was writing to the airline to protest against the cancellations, she said. Haines had earlier told the BBC he doubted that the dispute would end up in court, but said it was unacceptable that Ryanair was disregarding the law and customers’ rights. “These are simple things to fix and they’re choosing not to fix them,” he said. “People shouldn’t have to choose between low fares and legal rights.” In his letter, sent to Ryanair’s chief legal officer, Juliusz Komorek, Haines said there would be a conference call with the airline on Monday to discuss why it was taking so long to respond to the regulator’s requests. Ryanair’s share price had lost little ground until Thursday, when it fell by more than 4% to €16.41 (£14.39), leaving its stock market value nearly £1.7bn lower than before the cancellations. In a brief statement issued before the CAA letter, Ryanair said it would cooperate with the regulator: “We are meeting with the CAA and will comply fully with whatever requirements they ask us to.” The CAA’s intervention means the company is now fending off the displeasure of investors, regulators, politicians, passengers, pilots and cabin crew, despite its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, attempting to bring the rostering problem under control. According to EU regulations, airlines that cancel flights are obliged to offer a refund or reroute passengers under “comparable transport conditions”. Guidelines state that this should be done as soon as possible, even if it has to be with another airline. Affected services include routes from Edinburgh and Glasgow to London Stansted, and from the Scottish airports to Poland, Spain and Germany. The disruption began the previous week, when Ryanair said it would scrap up to 50 flights a day until 31 October, citing a “mess-up” in how it schedules time off for pilots. The airline said it had emailed affected customers to offer a refund or an alternative flight. Passengers will also receive a travel voucher for a £40 one-way or £80 return journey that can be used to book a Ryanair flight for travel between October 2017 and March 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/29/things-know-be-true-wayne-mcgregor-best-uk-theatre-dance","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T09:30:21Z","webTitle":"Things I Know to Be True and Wayne McGregor: this week’s best UK theatre and dance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/29/things-know-be-true-wayne-mcgregor-best-uk-theatre-dance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/29/things-know-be-true-wayne-mcgregor-best-uk-theatre-dance","fields":{"headline":"Things I Know to Be True and Wayne McGregor: this week’s best UK theatre and dance","bodyText":"Theatre 1 Things I Know to Be True This collaboration between physical theatre company Frantic Assembly and the State Theatre Company of South Australia is a delicate look at family dynamics and how even apparently golden families have their problems.

The easiest place to start, however, is with this abridged version providing highlights from his schooldays in the 1940s through to Margaret Thatcher’s defenestration in 1990. It’s all here, from fierce intellectual battles over union power or the devaluation of the pound to the bitter personal feuds convulsing the left in the 70s and 80s, interspersed with rather sweet vignettes from Benn family life. Read it alongside Barbara Castle’s diaries of the Wilson years for an occasionally exasperated perspective on it all. DIARIES: IN POWER (1993) ALAN CLARK For all his flaws – vanity, lechery, flirtation with the far right, crashing snobbery – Alan Clark was a born writer with a rare gift for bringing politics to life. There are more reliable guides to the Thatcher years than this, the first of his three volumes, covering the second period of his career, while Gyles Brandreth’s Breaking the Code is arguably better on the Major era. But few can match the waspish elegance of Clark’s writing or the depths of his cynicism. Treat it as a period piece, from the distant days when politicians were actually allowed to behave this badly. A VIEW FROM THE FOOTHILLS (2009) CHRIS MULLIN The humble chalk to Alan Clark’s big cheese. Mullin never ceases to remind the reader of his own insignificance, whether as an obscure junior minister under Tony Blair (charged with waging war on leylandii hedges, of all things) or an even more obscure ex-minister. But don’t be fooled by the wry self-deprecation. Mullin is a former investigative journalist who turns a beady eye on his own party, exploring the hidden limitations of what looks, from the outside, like power. DIARIES, VOLUMES ONE TO SIX (2010 TO 2017) ALASTAIR CAMPBELL Love or loathe him, Campbell remains the master of the inside story, and not just because of his unusually intimate perspective on the relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Soap opera aside, this is an incredibly detailed primer on what it’s like to live inside No. 10: the sheer relentless pace of events; the constant friction with the media; the intense camaraderie; and the furious resentments that build up under pressure. HOUSE MUSIC (2007) OONA KING “I look through my diary for this week, and decide to cancel whatever meetings I can, so that I don’t resign.” So begins King’s entry for January 2001, when she is not waving but drowning. Her career looks great from the outside but her deprived London constituency is a bottomless pit of need, her marriage is imploding because she’s never home, she’s getting death threats from the far right and all the while she’s undergoing a heartbreaking private battle with infertility. King’s diary is an easy and often ruefully funny read, but not a flippant one. It sheds much-needed light on a hidden part of politics, the work done in constituencies rather than at Westminster, but it’s also a timely reminder that behind every public figure is a private human being, often with secret problems of their own. No wonder so many end up keeping diaries. MARGARET THATCHER (2013) CHARLES MOORE Before Moore published the first volume of his authorised biography there had already been a mountain of books on Thatcher. Most struggled to get much beyond the caricature. Although an admirer, Moore’s account is more nuanced. He shows that far from being fearless, she could often be fearful without cause and, at times, could be stubbornly foolish in her policymaking even if, from the author’s point of view, she was heading heroically in the right direction. The final volume will include her Shakespearean fall from power. HAROLD WILSON (1992) BEN PIMLOTT Harold Wilson had become a ghostly figure when this book was published in 1992. The absence heightened a sense of mystery. Who was he? How to explain his seemingly contradictory characteristics: decent, devious, loyal? Pimlott solves some of the mysteries, showing why Wilson had no choice at times other than to be expedient and dissembling to keep a divided party together. Revealingly, the book is thorough and detailed until Wilson’s final phase as prime minister in 1974, when events are narrated more briefly. Yet, in his final two years, Wilson turned a minority government in to one that secured a small majority and he won a referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU. In the light of recent events, his final phase deserves more attention. CHURCHILL (2001) ROY JENKINS Towards the end of his life, Jenkins published two weighty biographies: one on Gladstone and the other on Churchill. Both are epic achievements, chronicling lives of length, depth and multi-layered complexity. After he published the Churchill biography, I asked him who he admired most out of his two subjects. To my surprise, he told me that although his political sympathies were closer to Gladstone’s, he admired Churchill more. Jenkins writes as a politician as well as a historian, analysing Churchill’s historic moves from the perspective of one who had also spoken in the Commons at moments of high political drama, who had resigned from elevated positions in battles over policy, and as one who changed parties, though not as frequently as Churchill did. ROY JENKINS (2014) JOHN CAMPBELL Jenkins’s life was as complicated and gripping as his biographical subjects. Campbell calmly narrates the many political and personal dramas. Some of the personal episodes are revelatory, including Jenkins’ intense relationship with Anthony Crosland when they were both students at Oxford. Campbell also addresses Jenkins’ various affairs with women. How did he find the time to cram so much hedonistic pleasure into a career that spanned being a reforming home secretary of historic significance, a formidable chancellor and the first leader of the SDP? Like Jenkins’s political heroes, he led many lives. Campbell is perceptively sharp in describing each of them. ANEURIN BEVAN (1962, 1973) MICHAEL FOOT In what was once a competitive field, Foot is the most elegant stylist of the author-politicians. Foot also tended to write about his heroes, of which he had many, and Bevan was also a close friend. Unsurprisingly, the two-volume biography is both beautifully written and close to a hagiography. Foot portrays Bevan as a political giant, but has a fair amount of ammunition to put his case. Inevitably, Bevan’s titanic battles to launch the NHS are centre stage, but Foot also vividly and subjectively narrates the internal battles in the 1950s that followed the defeat of the post-45 Labour government and evokes beautifully the great man’s early years in south Wales. TEAM OF RIVALS (2005) DOROTHY KEARNS GOODWIN As well as reading like a political thriller, this is partly a book on the art of leadership. Kearns Goodwin shows how Lincoln flourished by appointing his fiercest rivals to key cabinet positions, leading them subtly to help achieve his ambitious objectives in a country torn apart by civil war. After Alastair Campbell had read Team of Rivals he sent a copy to his friend Alex Ferguson who was facing some internal problems with his Manchester United squad at the time. Ferguson loved the book. There are lessons for leaders in many fields in the way Lincoln managed his team. LYNDON JOHNSON (1982-2001) ROBERT CARO Never has a leader been more extensively chronicled. If Johnson has a cup of coffee while waiting for the outcome of a close vote in the senate, Caro can turn the scene into a nerve-shredding chapter. Caro is both a stylish writer and a master of detail, a fact borne out by his four-volume biography with another in the pipeline. In some respects, the contradictions that define Johnson deepen as Caro sheds unyielding light on the humane progressive, the amoral wheeler-dealer, the indefatigable campaigner who will pull any trick to win. The tireless wilfulness is the constant factor. Each volume is a political epic and there is more to come. DISRAELI (1966) ROBERT BLAKE Blake had some of Caro’s qualities as a biographer, although he managed to write Disraeli’s life in a single volume. He was an elegant writer who conjured up the twists and turns of Disraeli’s extraordinary career in highly readable style. Blake was a patrician Tory historian making sense of the vivacious “one-nation Tory”, the author of largely well-received novels, and an erratically reforming prime minister. He is especially sharp on the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, two contrasting political leaders whose clashes defined a political era. CITIZEN CLEM (2016) JOHN BEW British Pprime Mministers are usually good actors, artists fascinated by their own role on the political stage. Macmillan, Wilson, Thatcher, Blair and Cameron were all actors in their different ways. Attlee is the leader that breaks the pattern, wholly indifferent to the public stage. Arguably, he achieved more by getting on with the job of governing and being judged by the implementation of policy alone. Bew shows that Attlee was a key figure in the war-time coalition, a genuine deputy to Churchill. He won the landslide in 1945, not as a novice but as a leader immersed in the workings of government. The reforms that followed were transformative, shifting the consensus about the role of the state to the left. Most of the time, though with some big lapses, Attlee was a subtle leader of more ebullient colleagues. In this widely acclaimed biography, Bew shows that Attlee was daringly radical almost in spite of himself. JEREMY THORPE (2014) MICHAEL BLOCH The rise and fall of Jeremy Thorpe is one of the wackiest, saddest and most gripping stories in modern British politics. Fleetingly, Thorpe was a political star lighting up the dark 1970s, witty, charming and optimistic. In the hung parliament that followed the February 1974 election, he was a key player as leader of the Liberals. At the same time, Thorpe was being blackmailed by his former lover, Norman Scottcorrect, with bizarre and bleak consequences for all involved. In this account, Bloch cites many other risk-taking gay flings. Anyone who believes politics is boring will change their minds if they read about Thorpe’s farcical and tragic life of Jeremy Thorpe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/28/fresh-concerns-over-cumbrian-south-lakes-safari-zoo-where-500-animals-died","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T14:42:23Z","webTitle":"Fresh concerns over Cumbrian zoo where 500 animals died","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/28/fresh-concerns-over-cumbrian-south-lakes-safari-zoo-where-500-animals-died","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/28/fresh-concerns-over-cumbrian-south-lakes-safari-zoo-where-500-animals-died","fields":{"headline":"Fresh concerns over Cumbrian zoo where 500 animals died","bodyText":"Inspectors have identified a number of welfare concerns at a Cumbrian zoo where nearly 500 animals died in less than four years. The latest findings on South Lakes Safari zoo, which include a lemur climbing into a baby’s pram, squirrel monkeys jumping on to members of the public and prairie dogs digging holes next to the fence, come as a council committee is due to meet to decide whether it is complying with its licensing conditions. Additionally, the animal director, Andreas Kaufmann, earlier this week told the council there had been a diagnosis of chlamydia among the zoo’s peacock population. The attraction is in the hands of new owners – Cumbria Zoo Company Ltd – after the zoo’s founder David Gill was refused a licence to run the facility, in March. The previous month, a damning report said 486 animals died of causes including emaciation and hypothermia between December 2013 and September 2016. Council inspectors who carried out a fresh two-week inspection last month concluded that there were too many “contact incidents” between animals and visitors. Seven incidents involving contact between animals and visitors were reported within a 14-day period. The inspectors saw a lemur climb into a baby’s pram before it was removed by two zookeepers. Another lemur pulled off a visitor’s glove during a feeding session while trying to snatch a grape, while a third jumped on to a member of the public. An ageing nyala – a spiral-horned antelope – which was completely blind and had been separated from its herd, had deteriorated and was euthanised the day after the inspection. Despite the concerns flagged up by the inspection team, licensing officers have recommended that, when it meets next week, the council’s licensing regulatory committee acknowledges that the requirements of the licence are being complied with. They praised zookeepers for doing a “good job” in educating the public about safety. The inspection report states that since being granted the licence, Kaufmann has been appointed by the zoo and that the areas of the attraction where animals could come into contact with members of the public have been reduced. In June last year, the zoo was fined £255,000 for health and safety breaches after the death of keeper Sarah McClay, 24. Concerns about the lack of security between Gill’s neighbouring home and the zoo enclosure mean the attraction is not allowed to import or export any animals under the Animal and Plant Health Agency’s regulatory Balai directive.

Fairhead will replace Mark Price, the former Waitrose managing director who quit after a year as trade policy minister. The MP Greg Hands has taken over the policy role, and Fairhead’s title will be minister for trade and export promotion. Fairhead was the chief executive of the Financial Times Group before taking on the BBC role, from which she resigned after Theresa May indicated that she would have to reapply for the job to which she had been appointed by David Cameron. Fairhead was the chair of HSBC’s audit committee when the bank admitted to “past compliance and control failures” in the group, after it was mired in a tax avoidance row uncovered by the Guardian’s HSBC files investigation. Under questions from the culture, media and sport select committee, Fairhead defended her role at HSBC, but admitted to failings related to the record-breaking $1.9bn (£1.4bn) fine levied on the bank by US authorities in relation to money laundering in its Mexican branch. The Labour MP Margaret Hodge, the then chair of the public accounts committee, said Fairhead should resign from her BBC post after the HSBC revelations. On Thursday, Hodge said it was “outrageous” that Fairhead had been given a ministerial role, telling the Guardian it was “not down to her capabilities”. Hodge said Fairhead had a good relationship with senior Tories, including Alan Duncan and Michael Portillo, who had defended her while she was under scrutiny for her role at HSBC. “It shows it is all about who you know, rather than what you know. It is all about being a member of the establishment,” she said. Fairhead’s appointment to the ministerial role by Downing Street will come as a surprise to many, after she was effectively forced out by May after the latter became prime minister last summer. Cameron’s decision to ask Fairhead to stay on as BBC Trust chair during the corporation’s transition to being governed by a single, powerful board was criticised by some, who thought its governance needed a fresh start. Her short tenure drew disapproval from within the BBC for reportedly failing to effectively defend the broadcaster during the negotiations leading up to the white paper on BBC charter renewal. In particular, she was criticised for agreeing to an 11th-hour financial settlement in July 2015 that forced the BBC to shoulder the cost of supplying free TV licences to people over 75, which was previously funded by the taxpayer. She was replaced by Sir David Clementi as BBC chair under a new governance structure in which the trust was replaced by a unitary board. Fairhead will replace Price in the department of the international trade secretary, Liam Fox. Price quit in early September, voicing doubts about the government’s direction on Brexit. He said voting to leave the EU had been “a symptom of people’s concerns about their day-to-day problems. Brexit will not solve those problems.” Announcing Fairhead’s appointment, Fox said: “As we forge closer trading links with new markets and respond to the massive appetite for British goods and services across different sectors, Baroness Fairhead’s focus and wealth of business experience will help us get more UK companies exporting.” Fairhead said Brexit was “a time of unprecedented new opportunities for UK trade … I am keen to help ever more UK businesses capture the global demand for their goods and their services. I look forward to working with companies across the UK to forge a culture of success in exports in businesses large and small.” No 10 also announced that Theodore Agnew, the businessman and Tory donor who was the sponsor of the Inspiration Trust academy chain, will become a minister in the Department for Education (DfE) and get a life peerage. Both posts will be unpaid. Agnew was a key ally of the then education secretary Michael Gove during his time in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Inspiration Trust has announced that he will stand down as its chairman following his appointment. Agnew has donated more than £100,000 to the Tories and served as a non-executive director at the DfE during the coalition, as chair of its academies board."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/04/yodel-delivery-missing-phone","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T05:59:21Z","webTitle":"Yodel claims it delivered my £400 phone, but it wasn’t to me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/04/yodel-delivery-missing-phone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/04/yodel-delivery-missing-phone","fields":{"headline":"Yodel claims it delivered my £400 phone, but it wasn’t to me","bodyText":"I recently ordered a £400 phone from online company Gearbest and it was dispatched using Yodel’s insured delivery service.

The London-based company said 144,000 bikes made between April 2014 and May 2017 were affected by the voluntary recall. The company said the German part had failed on one in 5,000 bikes, which would leave the rider unable to pedal, and that in one case a cyclist had been hurt. The company is asking owners to take their bikes to a certified Brompton dealer where the bracket will be replaced free of charge. Will Butler-Adams, Brompton’s chief executive, said the manufacturer was potentially “going overboard” with the recall but wanted to protect its reputation for high quality engineering. Its folding bikes start at about £900. “We have had an increased number of failures,” he said. “It’s not particularly high but sufficient to give concern. We have had a small number on cases where the metal has cracked and broken.” Although the part, officially described as a bottom bracket cartridge, complies with international safety standards, the company’s criteria are stricter. “This is a hassle, a pain [for riders], and we are really sorry about that and potentially we’re going overboard but it is critical to us to protect the experience of our customers,” said Butler-Adams in a video posted on the company’s website. “We are founded on quality … founded on really good quality engineering. So if we have the slightest concern we have to act.” The company is named after the Brompton Oratory in South Kensington, which the company’s founder, Andrew Ritchie, could see from the window of his flat as he worked on a prototype in the early 1980s. Ritchie is still the company’s biggest shareholder but no longer sits on the board. In 2015 the company sold a 5% stake to the Pizza Express entrepreneur Luke Johnson. The recall comes at a critical time for the high-end manufacturer, which is gearing up for the launch of an electric model. Last year underlying profits at Brompton Bicycle fell 40% to £1.3m on sales of £28.4m as it invested in, among other things, the electric project with the Formula One group Williams. In 2015 the company moved to new premises in west London with a target to produce 100,000 bikes a year by 2020. Asked if the recall would be expensive, Butler-Adams said: “Oh God yes. When you take a recall it costs money.” However, he said the supplier would bear the lion’s share of the cost, adding: “I think if we didn’t do something that would affect confidence in us – the fact we are doing something should build confidence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2017/sep/30/secret-teacher-muslim-students-support-guidance-negative-media","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"Secret Teacher: we must play our part in giving Muslim students a voice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/sep/30/secret-teacher-muslim-students-support-guidance-negative-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2017/sep/30/secret-teacher-muslim-students-support-guidance-negative-media","fields":{"headline":"Secret Teacher: we must play our part in giving Muslim students a voice","bodyText":"Each time I turn on the news and see another Islamist terrorist attack being reported, I worry for my students. Not for their physical safety but for their sense of identity and belonging as British schoolchildren. Like many schools in east London, the majority of my students are Muslim. The school is home to many different cultures and religions, and students unconsciously demonstrate a level of tolerance that rivals any adult organisation I know of. Yet this is put at risk because of the intolerant values held by some parts of society and spread by certain elements of the media. With the rise of Islamic State over the past few years, the word terrorism has become almost synonymous with Islam for some people. And this has presented a real existential problem for a number of our students. On the one hand they identify as being British – they were born here, as were their parents; they have British passports; they speak English as their first language; they read Harry Potter; they watch superhero movies and play football on the weekends. On the other hand, they identify as being Muslim – they attend mosque on a Friday; they go to Islamic school in the evenings; they can recite verses of the Qur’an; they wear headscarves; and they visit the prayer room during lunchtime. They live happily in balance with these two identities, until the next terrorist attack. And suddenly, yet again, they see part of their identity thrust negatively into the media spotlight. It’s confusing for them. Teenagers have, historically, always struggled to find their place in society, to carve out an identity for themselves. They crave the feeling of belonging. So what happens when they see their religion being hijacked by terrorists and represented in a way that is unrecognisable to them? It’s up to us, as educators, to help them feel confident in their identity and their sense of belonging. What does that look like in reality? In my school, we are taught how to have direct and challenging conversations with students – Muslim and non-Muslim – on the religious and political aspects of terrorist attacks. After each major terrorist attack in the UK, the safeguarding officer at our school meets with safeguarding leaders at the other local schools as well as the police and local religious leaders. They then brief us on the facts of the attack and talk us through the key messages that we are to share with the students. Namely: how the attacks are, actually, un-Islamic, sometimes with specific reference to parts of the Qur’an to demonstrate how the attackers have directly contravened the peaceful message of Islam. It’s important that students receive this alternative message. Of course, issues around terrorism need to be handled with sensitivity by schools. The government’s Prevent strategy recently drew fresh criticism for stigmatising Muslim pupils – in particular due to concerns that promoting “fundamental British values” undermines efforts to promote shared values. But if the topic is approached with care, I believe teachers can play an important role and be proactive in addressing prejudice and misunderstandings. Students need to understand that it’s safe to explore these links between their faith and the attacks. It’s also important for them to see us – whether we are Muslim ourselves or otherwise – stand up in front of them and openly discuss and condemn the terrorist attacks through the lens of Islam rather than side-stepping the subject, which is what many non-Muslim colleagues have openly admitted to doing previously. One of the most important strands of our work has been building ties with the local community. The fear of radicalisation is a very real issue for many of the parents at our school. Those airport security images of the three girls from Bethnal Green in London who went to Syria in 2015 still trouble parents and we are often asked how they can stop it happening to their own children. It’s a community effort – teachers, parents, police and religious leaders – and it’s working because the children are receiving the same message wherever they go. Beyond the immediate community, we’ve seen that humour is also having an interesting impact. There’s obviously nothing funny about terrorist attacks but Muslim comedians and satirical memes and blogs are opening up another avenue of response for the students – suddenly the enemy doesn’t seem so scary any more. Over time, I’ve seen my students become much more well-informed and at ease discussing the issues. Now when there’s a terrorist attack, it’s the Muslim children in our classes who are the first to speak out, condemning the attacks (rather receiving their opinions from the teachers). And the non-Muslim students are right by their side, confident in articulating their support with the Muslim community and aware of the negative impact such attacks can have on social perceptions of Islam.More broadly, it’s no coincidence that social media campaigns such as #NotInMyName and ‘You ain’t no Muslim, bruv’ have gone global; young British Muslims are looking for ways to find their voice and are speak out together, promoting the alternative but accurate message of what being a British Muslim really means. As educators, we’re in a position to help them do that.

In a chapter released ahead of the publication of next month’s World Economic Outlook, the Washington-based IMF said low-income countries had contributed little to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and could not afford to tackle the problem from their own meagre resources. “Rising temperatures would have vastly unequal effects across the world, with the brunt of adverse consequences borne by those who can least afford it,” the IMF said. “The international community will have a key role to play in fostering and coordinating financial and other types of support for affected low-income countries. With advanced and emerging market economies contributing the lion’s share to the warming that has occurred so far and is projected to continue, helping low-income countries cope with its consequences is a humanitarian imperative and sound global economic policy.” Using conservative assumptions, the IMF said that by 2100 income per head in a typical low-income country would be 9% lower than it would be in the absence of temperature increases. It added that the present value of these losses would amount to the loss of an entire year of current economic output for a poor nation. The adverse impact of climate change would be long-lasting and would be felt through lower agricultural output, reduced productivity in sectors exposed to the weather, weaker investment and poor health. Higher temperatures constrained growth in the hot regions of emerging and developing economies significantly more than in hot regions of rich nations, underlying the importance of development in reducing vulnerability, the IMF said. The chapter noted that low-income countries had “huge spending needs and scarce resources to undertake the investments necessary to cope with climate change.” The United Nations has agreed a set of sustainable development goals to be met by 2030, but achieving them would require poor countries to increase public spending by up to 30% of gross domestic product. This would not be possible for most countries, the IMF said. “Moreover, domestic policies alone cannot fully insulate low-income countries from the consequences of climate change as higher temperatures push the biophysical limits of these countries’ ecosystems, potentially triggering more frequent epidemics, famines, and other natural disasters, at the same time fuelling migration pressure and conflict risk,” the chapter said. It warned that “substantial migration flows, potentially spilling across country borders, could arise if climate change leads to a significant rise in sea levels.” On current global warming projections, hundreds of millions of people in low-lying areas could become vulnerable to flooding, forcing them to abandon their homes. The international spillovers from the most vulnerable countries, through depressed economic activity and potentially higher conflict and migration flows, could be considerable, the IMF said. “Going forward, only a global effort to contain carbon emissions to levels consistent with an acceptable increase in temperature can limit the long-term risk of climate change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/27/london-issues-red-alert-for-extremely-high-air-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T10:29:16Z","webTitle":"Sadiq Khan triggers alert for high air pollution in London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/27/london-issues-red-alert-for-extremely-high-air-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/27/london-issues-red-alert-for-extremely-high-air-pollution","fields":{"headline":"Sadiq Khan triggers alert for high air pollution in London","bodyText":"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has triggered the capital’s emergency air quality alert as polluted air from the continent combines with toxic air in London to create dangerous levels of pollution. The alerts will see warnings displayed at bus stops, road signs and on the underground. Khan has also asked TV and radio stations across the capital to warn their viewers and listeners in news bulletins. Anyone with lung or heart problems is advised to reduce strenuous exercise, especially outside. The young and elderly are particularly vulnerable. Today’s alert has been triggered by “high” levels of air pollution. It is the seventh time in 13 months that the mayor has used the alert system. One instance was because the level of pollution was deemed “very high”, and on six occasions because it was “high”. Khan said: “The shocking and illegal state of London’s filthy air means once again I am triggering a high air pollution alert today under my new comprehensive alert system.” The government’s committee on the medical effects of air pollutants advises adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, to reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors, and particularly if they experience symptoms. People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often. Older people should also reduce physical exertion. Khan is implementing a range of measures to try to tackle the air pollution crisis in the capital, and he called on the government to do more. “I am doing everything with the powers I have at City Hall and it’s now time for the government to step up by introducing a national diesel scrappage fund to rid our streets of dirty diesels, and to give me the powers I need to tackle non-transport sources of pollution.” Responding to the news that the capital’s air quality emergency alert had been triggered, Prof Jonathan Grigg from Doctors Against Diesel said “dirty air is seriously damaging Londoners’ health and wellbeing.” Grigg called on Khan to do more to tackle it. “Vulnerable people shouldn’t have to restrict their activities to stay safe,” he said. “Sadiq Khan must bring London’s air pollution down to legal levels as soon as possible, and commit to phase out diesel vehicles by 2025 to protect Londoners’ lungs.” The government has come under increasing pressure over the UK’s air quality. It has suffered a string of humiliating defeats in the courts over its failure to clean up the nation’s air. Its latest proposal, released in July, was met with widespread criticism from clean air campaigners and regional politicians. The latest episode of dangerously polluted air has been caused by mist, low cloud, fog and slow wind speed in London that has lead to a build up of pollution. This has combined with air arriving from the continent that has travelled slowly over industrial polluted areas giving it time to pick up emissions on the way. Experts say this is likely to produce high levels of PM2.5 and moderate levels of PM10 particulate pollution across areas of London and the south-east."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/sep/28/bring-your-law-studies-to-life-with-pro-bono-work","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T07:08:07Z","webTitle":"Bring your law studies to life with pro bono work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/28/bring-your-law-studies-to-life-with-pro-bono-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/sep/28/bring-your-law-studies-to-life-with-pro-bono-work","fields":{"headline":"Bring your law studies to life with pro bono work","bodyText":"If you’re tired of your law studies existing mostly on the pages of textbooks, pro bono work could be for you. By getting involved in voluntary law clinics, you can gain practical experience of live cases, boost your CV and make a difference by helping people who could not otherwise afford legal advice. You may already be aware of the impact student law clinics can have. In 2014, the Cardiff University’s law school innocence project famously overturned the murder conviction of Dwaine George, while legal aid cuts mean many law schools are stepping up to fill the growing gaps in legal public services. What’s in it for you? “Pro bono helps students understand more deeply how the law works – and its ambiguity, through interviewing, negotiating and advocating live cases,” says Richard Moorhead, professor of law and professional ethics at the University College London law school. It also adds real-world achievements to students’ portfolios. “Pro bono work has helped me enormously with applications, both to demonstrate my commitment to a career in law and to answer competency related questions,” says Nathan Samuel, who has just graduated from Cardiff University. Finding pro bono work Students can get involved by volunteering, through elective course options, or by choosing a course that includes mandatory pro bono modules (in law schools which also offer the Legal Practice Course (LPC) or Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC)). Cardiff University’s six voluntary pro bono schemes are run in partnership with external organisations. As places are competitive, students have to apply for their chosen scheme through a rigorous application process, which includes a CV and competency based questions. “Our projects are prestigious,” says professor Julie Price, director of the project and head of the pro bono unit. “Although there are no academic requirements, we try to choose the most suitable people and find something for all students who apply, but we cannot offer everyone client-facing work.” Cardiff has about 1,500 students (1,000 undergraduates) and about 150 are involved in the pro bono work, so the selection process goes some way towards replicating the competitive graduate jobs market. What to expect Hannah Camplin, who runs the law clinic at the University of Westminster, says the modules offer a useful mix of doing real work and being evaluated: “Students interview clients, and give advice in the form of a letter which is supervised by qualified solicitors. Combining on-the-job learning with assessment teaches transferrable skills, and forces them to reflect on what they have learned.” Juwayriyah Budrudin, a third-year law student, says: “The fact that [the pro bono] module formed part of my degree and was assessed made me perform better than is required in a real professional setting in order to get good marks. “My clinical experience developed my understanding of legal practice and utilise the skills I learned in a professional setting.” Other pro bono paths Not all pro bono work is based at university clinics. For example, housing and welfare charity Zacchaeus 200 Trust (Z2K) uses student volunteers to help people fill in benefit forms. “The [z2k] student law clinic offers invaluable practical experience; from training in client confidentiality to experiencing real client contact,” says Maddison Redgwell, who is in her final year at the University of Westminster. “The best thing about the work is knowing that we are assisting real clients that need our help,” she says. “My pro bono experience does not simply add skills to my CV, it has opened my eyes to real issues within the community and has shaped me as a person.” Pro bono can also be a career catalyst. Shiva Riahi, manager and research associate at the Centre for Access to Justice, was inspired by her final-year module placement and decided to join the faculty. “It is a transformational experience,” she says. “For the first time, I truly understood the structural problems that people face with the system, even basic things like filling in forms. “We run reflective sessions for students to understand the wider context, and the implications of people not having access to justice. Students are the next generation of lawyers and judges, so if we can expose them to these issues early on, hopefully things will change.” Whether it is compulsory, elective or voluntary, pro bono work can boost your chances of getting work when you graduate, and help you to do some real-world good in the meantime.

McManus, seeing him off after dinner, said: “Don’t be intimidated, man! Remember – you’re Martin fucking Amis!” Being Martin fucking Amis: as a few of these pieces make clear, it’s a burden and an exaltation. Reading the very entertaining poker piece, for instance, you note that the author quotes the compliment, but also that he spends the rest of the article (which describes the swagger of his ambition and its abrupt deflation when, with Amis all-in, his opponent rivers a better set than his fives) undermining it. He’s Martin fucking Amis; also, fucking Martin Amis. The Rub of Time is arranged thematically: sections of political commentary; sections of essays on other writers (most of them ones he’s known); reported pieces for magazines; odds and ends of memoir; an unexpectedly well-stocked and very enjoyable section on sport (wonderful riff on assembling a Frankenstein’s tennis player); and a few squibs that maybe needn’t have made the cut. (The squibs include his peevish responses to the Guardian’s readers’ questions, where the questioner’s name indicates the peevometer nudging into the red: “Yes, Jonathan…” “Well, John…” “Also, Oksana…”) The reportage is some of the best stuff here. For someone who often doesn’t much seem to care for journalists, Amis is a very good journalist indeed. If anyone has written a better, more penetrating, more open-minded interview with John Travolta, for example, I’d like to see it (the description of Rambo as “that lethal trapezium of organ meat”, perhaps with apologies to Clive James, is an incidental gem). Sending a literary writer to report on the porn industry is by now an old joke – but Amis (reprising his horror-day riff from London Fields to describe “stepping out of the porno home – on to the porno patio with its porno pool”, etc, and ending on a note of muted gallantry) does it well. And The Crippled Murderers of Cali, Colombia is a compressed and properly reported piece from South American gangland where moral seriousness (just) eclipses linguistic virtuosity. Like poles holding up the washing line on which these gaudy items are pegged are three sections – one at the beginning, one in the middle and one at the end – all called Twin Peaks. The Twin Peaks are Bellow and Nabokov: each “Twin Peaks” gives you an essay on each. All good writers are reading writers and Amis is a rereading writer. On rereading, he still doesn’t think Ada is up to much, for the same reason Finnegans Wake isn’t up to much. He says so twice. He’s bothered by all the underage girls. He says so twice, too. But, to his credit, he’s still rereading. In the two years between the first essay on Nabokov (2009) and the second (2011), he’s gone back and noticed that Nabokov mentions the Holocaust three times rather than, as originally stated, twice, finding a paragraph in a 1943 short story. A postscript to an essay in which he dismisses the “multitudinous facetiousness of Melville” in passing sees him admit that “after an interval of half a century” he has reread Moby-Dick with “gratitude and awe” and that his dismissal was “gravely inadequate”. That’s conscientious. When he puts his nose to a text, close up, there are few readers like him. An essay (out of courtesy, posthumously published) about very late Updike charts, with unanswerably persuasive quotation, the way Updike was “in the process of losing his ear”. A semi-offhand piece about screen adaptations of Jane Austen is, in its attention to the nuances of her language and its flattening in the screenplay, very far from offhand. And he is superbly good at capturing the nub of what’s so interesting in DeLillo, deftly sectioning the phases of JG Ballard’s career, tracing the weirdly wonky process of Philip Roth finding his voice or summing up a mood in a glancing phrase: the “dank crew of self-righteous anarchists” in The Secret Agent, for example. But there’s also, sometimes, a slightly bullying tone to his literary pieces. He seldom sneaks up on a thing or allows himself to be tentative. He writes on page 54 that “evaluative criticism is rhetorical criticism: it adds nothing to knowledge; it simply adds to the history of taste”. He doesn’t half go in for it himself, though: “[It] is at the highest table that Vladimir Nabokov coolly takes his place”; “[Bellow’s] was and is a pre-eminence that rests […] on incontestable legitimacy. To hold otherwise is to waste your breath”; “In quality, Larkin’s four volumes of verse are logarithmic, like the Richter scale: they get stronger and stronger by a factor of 10”; “There can be no argument about the depth, the complexity, and indeed the beauty of [Iris] Murdoch’s mind”; “George Eliot gave us one readable book”; “Milton consists of Paradise Lost”. Professorial flourishes – “we may reflect”; “read it with attention”; “we will return to…” – enter the prose. Here is something between the querulous monologue of a Leavis in the lecture hall and a dressing-down in a provincial cop shop. “Are you taking notes?” he seems to be saying, or rather: “You will be taking notes.” There’s a rhetorical voltage (as he notes on page 54) to that maximalism, that unwaveringly indicative mood – but you weary of it too, a bit. The same certainty, not always a virtue, is present in his political pronouncements. He obviously knows an awful lot – a surprising lot – about post-revolutionary Iran, for instance. But you wonder: can he really know as much as it sounds like he knows? Perhaps he does. He’s Martin fucking Amis.

I’d just taken up the role of headteacher, and there was some derelict land on the school site. I’d seen the news reports about children lacking knowledge of where their food came from and felt that we as a society had become very detached about food. The reason for this was clear to me: we were no longer educating our children about food in schools. So I saw a garden as an opportunity for the children to learn in a real way, in an outdoor context, while also instilling an understanding of where their food came from and the importance of eating fruit and vegetables. But I also wanted to use it to cover other topics: life cycles, flowering plants, pollination, adaptation, creative writing and report writing. I believed that plenty of subjects could be well taught in a garden, while increasing pupils’ activity levels and encouraging teamwork. There was a behavioural element, too. With many teachers facing comments from children such as “It wasn’t my fault” and “It wasn’t only me”, here was our chance to develop a sense of responsibility. We took the pupils out to local gardens and allotments to give them inspiration for what they might want from a school garden, and asked them to play a practical role. From this, their ideas included areas to grow fruit and vegetables, a wildlife pond complete with bridge for viewing, a hide to observe wildlife and a greenhouse set within a maze so that the garden didn’t reveal all of its secrets straight away. Four years on, gardening has become a central part of the curriculum. A recent creative writing task on buried treasure took on a whole new meaning with the garden as the backdrop, as pupils used the sights and sounds as inspiration. In maths measurement classes, children have mapped out flower beds rather than relying on small-scale drawings in textbooks. We’ve produced charts and graphs by measuring sprouting sunflowers, and recorded weather information from the weather station and charted its effects. It hasn’t all been plain sailing though. At the beginning, we struggled to get some of the staff on board, due to concerns that behavioural issues would worsen – because if they couldn’t trust the children in the classroom, wouldn’t they be worse outside? But once those teachers started making use of the garden there was recognisable behaviour change in those pupils. The children worked as a team, were engaged in their tasks, and took responsibility for nurturing the plants. We needed to think about funding, too. We’ve had to find money from the school fund for a full-time gardener – paid at the support staff rate, he’s employed all year round to plan and deliver lessons with the teachers. We also decided to enlist the help of a landscape architect, and we were lucky enough to have a school fundraiser to make this happen. Of course, there are other ways of doing it. I know other schools that have taken different routes to support such projects – identifying parent and grandparent volunteers, teaching assistants or premises managers with a knowledge of gardening who are willing to share their expertise and support teachers. Others have opted to build their gardens in local allotments and tap into the talents of the dedicated, local community. Community, in its various guises, is a big thing for us. Produce from the garden is sold in the school shop, run by the children on weekdays. We’ve also begun selling produce, such as tomatoes, potatoes, eggs and honey (from our chickens and beehives) to parents and others, and radishes, mint, honey and green salad to a local restaurant and via a stall at Borough Market in central London, helping us to channel funds back into the garden. The extra funding has helped us to buy resources such as garden tools, bigger, costlier plants such as fruit trees and other basic materials to create things like raised beds. The Food Growing in Schools Taskforce makes clear the wide ranging benefits of school gardens: learning, increased wellbeing and understanding of the natural environment. Its research suggests that schools and pupils are enriched by growing food and the behaviours acquired through such work. Researchers have also shown that outdoor learning can add value to everyday experiences in the classroom. I’d agree. The garden has transformed the school and provided wonderful learning opportunities for the children. It has brought the community together in a huge way and continues to develop. That’s why for me, a garden in whatever guise – from wooded plot to a handful of makeshift containers, hanging baskets or a window sill – should be viewed as an essential learning tool for all schools.

Women contacted by the Guardian responded with jubilation to the law change, which activists and senior Saudi officials claim marks a watershed in the country. “The mindset has shifted,” said Sultana al-Saud, 26, from Riyadh. “We weren’t waiting for our families to accept, we were waiting for something larger to back us up, a backbone, which is the government. “This is a huge step for women, it’s nice to see women behind the wheel metaphorically I believe it’s like her leading her life now. The patriarchy is slowly but surely turning to land of equality. This is amazing. It’s the first few steps of freedom, we didn’t even reach 2030 yet,” she said in reference to a government plan to transform Saudi society. “We are part of this big vision. We women are now taken into consideration.” Under the new law, women can legally obtain a driving licence without asking a male guardian for permission, despite “guardianship” laws that grant Saudi men power over female relatives. Less than a day after the royal decree was issued, Saudi women said the shock was still being absorbed across the kingdom, where societal rules are often governed by an inflexible reading of Islamic teachings. Senior Saudi clerics appeared to be onside, responding with an apparently coordinated series of public statements, aimed at shifting a widely expected conservative pushback. The commission of top Islamic clerics tweeted: “May God bless the king who looks out for the interest of his people and his country in accordance with sharia law.” Dr Abdel-Latif al Sheikh, the former head of the religious police, tweeted: “Women driving is not against sharia and women will choose what best suits them.” Sheikh Khaled al Mosleh, a professor of religion in Saudi Arabia, also tweeted that “allowing women to drive answered the needs of a big portion of the population”, and added a lengthy justification for the move under Islamic law. “There’s still a lot of rumours going on,” said Saud. “Sharia law can still play a large role in this. There are rumours about women not being able to drive (in parts of) Saudi, that you have to be above a certain age, that there might be a curfew.” Sana Kayali, 21, a university student in the Saudi capital, said: “This is a very good beginning. Who would’ve thought we are starting to become modern. I believe change will take place gradually.” Saudi leaders have longed pledged to overturn the driving ban, which had meant that the country’s female citizens were the only women in the world legally forbidden from sitting behind the wheel. They had couched the delay as necessary to condition deeply conservative sections of Saudi society to a change that has broad implications for women’s roles. Amal al Dayyem, 23, another university student in Riyadh, described the announcement as “real beginning”. “Most families will be on board with this simply because people no longer want to spend a huge chunk of their salaries on drivers and transportation. We can do this on our own,” she said. “Women all over the Gulf can drive, it was about time we Saudi women get the right to as well. Society will be accepting once they see how easier matters and everyday chores will be once this is implemented.” Madawi al Blehid, 36, a personal trainer, said: “This is something huge for us, women and girls. It’s not just about driving per se, this is about the fact that it is now our right and we have the freedom of choice. We’re no longer under the mercy of drivers and siblings. “The fact that we need approval of family and society is normal. This is the first time so … we can’t just explode on the scene it will cause a lot of problems. Even in taking it slowly, there will be problems but we should be able to overcome. Women are overjoyed. We woke up happy.” Maysoon Sleiman, 55, a doctor from Riyadh, said: “The thing is, a house cannot function properly without a driver and a lot of families cannot afford to hire one. “This has nothing to do with religion, it’s our customs. Which is why I expect backlash and disapproval from a lot of women not just men. A long time ago, they used to shoot at satellite dishes because they were dubbed haram [forbidden], now they sell them. It’s going to be the same in this I believe. At least mothers can now safely drop their kids to school.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/27/chelsea-antonio-conte-diego-costa-atletico-reunion-tunnel","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T11:18:00Z","webTitle":"Chelsea’s Antonio Conte set for uneasy tunnel reunion with Diego Costa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/chelsea-antonio-conte-diego-costa-atletico-reunion-tunnel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/27/chelsea-antonio-conte-diego-costa-atletico-reunion-tunnel","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea’s Antonio Conte set for uneasy tunnel reunion with Diego Costa","bodyText":"Antonio Conte will come face to face with Diego Costa on Wednesday evening as the Spain forward, who completed his move to Atlético Madrid on Tuesday, is intending to bid farewell to his former Chelsea team-mates and staff in the tunnel at the Wanda Metropolitano ahead of the Champions League Group C game between the clubs. The striker’s £57m return to Spain was only formalised on Tuesday evening ahead of the fixture at Atlético’s new home and, while Costa will not be presented to the home support on the pitch prior to kick-off, Chelsea have been led to believe he will be in the tunnel area before the game. Conte’s last contact with the 28-year-old was to send him a text message earlier this summer informing Costa that he had no future at Chelsea, with the player subsequently refusing to return from his home in Brazil and accusing the Premier League champions of treating him like a “criminal”. The Chelsea head coach has never really elaborated on why the forward was surplus to requirements, other than to indicate a decision had been made in January around the time interest emerged from Chinese Super League clubs in the player, and has consistently sought to avoid the subject in his media briefings this term. But he was asked by Spanish journalists on Tuesday whether he would be willing to shake Costa’s hand if the pair come into contact at the stadium. “Yes, as I said before, I have no problem with Diego Costa,” he said. “I said that we wish, for him, the best for the future. We want to thank him for the last season. But, I repeat, I have no problem with him.” Costa, Chelsea’s top scorer in each of his three seasons in south-west London and a two-time Premier League winner, took to Instagram on Tuesday to thank the Chelsea supporters and his former team-mates. “Some cycles begin while others end,” wrote Atlético’s new No18. “My cycle began at Chelsea three years ago – three remarkable years in all aspects – and I will never forget it. Two championship titles, a Community Shield, 120 matches, 59 goals and 24 assists later this cycle has ended. Not the way I would have wanted – far from it – but the best way possible. “The wonderful fans of such equally admirable club and all team mates, as well as clinical, administrative and logistics staff will remain forever in my mind and in my heart. Will bring them with me in the certainty that I will always be by their side as well and I’m sure they will understand the reason why this cycle of mine has now ended – because I could not lose faith in myself. Thank you Chelsea for everything.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-key-points","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T11:43:50Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn's speech to Labour conference: key points","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-key-points","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-key-points","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn's speech to Labour conference: key points","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn spoke for 75 minutes in a speech that promised Labour would be an “antidote to apathy and despair”, with better housing at the heart of its reforms. These are the key points: Labour is on the threshold of power and has become the government in waiting. Labour only won 262 MPs out of 650 but made a significant gain in vote share and added seats in unexpected areas. Corbyn is also sounding much more confident as a potential future prime minister, declaring: “Labour is ready.” The Tories are definitely not strong or stable but relying on the magic money tree. The Labour leader is turning the Conservatives’ rhetoric on themselves, saying Theresa May has a “coalition of chaos around her own cabinet table”. This is a rare attack on individual Tories such as Boris Johnson and Philip Hammond over their squabbling over Brexit. Labour is the “party of unity”, bringing young and old together. It is remarkable the Labour leader can make this claim after talk of a split at last year’s conference. It is not yet quite true that young and old are united in support of Labour though – the young overwhelmingly opted for Labour while older people voted for the Tories in their droves. Corbyn puts the Grenfell fire tragedy at the heart of his speech, saying housing will be a Labour priority. This is the Labour leader’s most powerful passage, arguing Tory deregulation and austerity contributed to the fire. “That degraded regime has a tragic monument: the chilling wreckage of Grenfell Tower,” he says. A Labour government will bring in rent controls and ensure tenants are rehoused locally when estates are regenerated. This is the new policy in Corbyn’s speech. He says regeneration schemes will have to benefit existing communities, as tenants must still get a home on the same site and will get a ballot on whether the project should go ahead. That will be a blow to developers who often try to limit affordable housing. Rent controls would allow cities potentially to go as far as controlling prices, not just the rate of increases. Labour wants more workplace democracy. Corbyn only hints at possible reforms but this is likely to please the unions and put businesses on their guard. He talks of “new participatory forms of management” and employees “given their voice at work, with unions able to represent them properly, freed of undemocratic fetters on their right to organise”. Corbyn attacks the traditional media and its tax exile owners who “trash Labour at every turn”, especially the Daily Mail. Corbyn makes a joke that he wishes the Mail would extend its coverage because it was counterproductive but he makes a serious point that hostile media reports fuelled abuse online against Diane Abbott. His attack on powerful newspapers suggests Labour is feeling emboldened. Labour is the only party that can unite those who want to leave and those who want to remain in the EU. That is a big promise and very difficult to achieve given the strong feelings on both sides. But Corbyn says this is possible if Labour is allowed to run the economy, boost wages, improve employment laws and make people’s living standards better. “We will never follow the Tories into the gutter of blaming migrants for the ills of society,” he says. The economy is at risk under the Tories regardless of Brexit. This is the overarching narrative of the speech, arguing Conservative deregulation caused the the economic crash and austerity worsened subsequent wage depression, which people are still feeling almost a decade later. He is trying to rewrite the script set by David Cameron in 2010 that Labour crashed the economy. Corbyn recommits to taking back utilities into public ownership. This was a manifesto policy but he singles out the water companies for particular criticism for high pay and dividends to foreign owners. Businesses will have to pay a bit more tax. Labour says it is focusing its tax-raising plans on businesses and higher earners, while promising low and middle earners will not be affected. Labour would scrap the public sector pay cap. This is no surprise as the trade unions have long fought against the 1% cap and Corbyn has repeatedly spoken against it. Labour would change the law on organ donation so people are presumed to consent to donation unless they have opted out. This has been a big campaign by the Mirror, and would mean families no longer have to take difficult decisions at the bedsides of dying relatives. Tuition fees would be abolished for both university and further education students. The Labour leader stresses that people will be funded through vocational qualifications as well, taking the emphasis off the free university education that became a focal point during the election. Democracy is under threat from both authoritarianism and political elites. This is a new version of the attacks on the the political establishment, comparing authoritarianism with “equally insidious” democracies where governments ignore their voters. He says democracy must mean “listening to people outside of election time”. Corbyn dismisses those who still want to “do politics the old way”. That appears to be a mildly worded warning to the Labour MPs and officials who still pine after the Blair and Brown era. Bombing campaigns must not be the kneejerk response to the five awful acts of terrorism the UK has suffered. This is a repeat of the Labour leader’s argument during the election campaign that foreign wars have exacerbated the terror threat, which appeared to be well received by the public. Perhaps the biggest cheers of the whole speech go to his plea for an end to the oppression of the Palestinian people. Corbyn ends with a rousing promise to offer “an antidote to apathy and despair”. The crowd was delighted with Corbyn’s speech, which ran through the party’s election manifesto and contained little new policy. He finished to a transitional rendition of the Red Flag, followed by Jerusalem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/27/uber-uk-chairman-london-licence-transport-for-london","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T09:55:19Z","webTitle":"Uber seeks UK chairman as it battles to keep London licence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/27/uber-uk-chairman-london-licence-transport-for-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/27/uber-uk-chairman-london-licence-transport-for-london","fields":{"headline":"Uber seeks UK chairman as it battles to keep London licence","bodyText":"Uber has hired a headhunter to fill a new position of UK chairman as it battles to stay operational in London. The ride-hailing app said the search began weeks before the shock decision by Transport for London (TfL) last week to deny Uber a new licence to operate in the capital, on the grounds that it was “not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence”. The new non-executive chairman is likely to play a crucial role as Uber fights to renew its London licence and repair its reputation. Uber’s existing licence expires on 30 September, but the company will be able to operate in the capital as long as the appeal process lasts, which could be up to a year. TfL said the company had failed to meet the required standards in a number of areas, including its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and how medical certificates were obtained. On Monday, Uber’s chief executive apologised for its mistakes in London and promised to change. Dara Khosrowshahi, who succeeded the Uber founder, Travis Kalanick, as CEO a month ago, wrote in an open letter: “While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it’s equally true that we’ve got things wrong along the way. On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we’ve made. “We will appeal [against] the decision on behalf of millions of Londoners, but we do so with the knowledge that we must also change.” The company is appearing at a UK employment appeal tribunal on Wednesday to argue that its workers are self-employed, and not entitled to a range of worker benefits. It is seeking to overturn a landmark ruling last year, which found that its UK drivers should be treated as employed workers with rights to the minimum wage and sick pay. An Uber spokesman said before the hearing: “Almost all taxi and private-hire drivers have been self-employed for decades before our app existed. “Uber drivers have more control and are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive, with no shifts or minimum hours.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/28/nintendo-classic-mini-snes-review-fun-sized-reboot-of-greatest-ever-console-mario-yoshi-zelda","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Nintendo Classic Mini: SNES review – fun-sized reboot of greatest ever console","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/28/nintendo-classic-mini-snes-review-fun-sized-reboot-of-greatest-ever-console-mario-yoshi-zelda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/28/nintendo-classic-mini-snes-review-fun-sized-reboot-of-greatest-ever-console-mario-yoshi-zelda","fields":{"headline":"Nintendo Classic Mini: SNES review – fun-sized reboot of greatest ever console","bodyText":"Over the last decade we have become used to seeing Nintendo written off, then returning to the fray with an astonishing piece of hardware. The chunky Game Cube failed in the PlayStation era and everyone thought that was it – until the Wii came out and revitalised casual gaming. The Wii U was a sales disaster, its Toy Town tablet controller failing to entice developers or consumers – but now the Switch is killing it with a much better implementation of the same concept. This boom and bust model goes back further, though – it began with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The SNES got off to a slow start against the scorchingly confident Mega Drive. Sega’s machine, designed with a powerful 16-bit processor capable of handling the company’s brilliant late-80s arcade titles, was marketed with verve and aplomb, lighting up the teen demographic with coin-op hits like Golden Axe and Altered Beast. With a two-year head start, the machine greedily chomped into Nintendo’s 95% market share, then augmented its supremacy with the launch of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991. Industry watchers were panicking while then Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi kept his cards close to his chest. But finally when the SNES launched in 1990, it was clear this was a technical marvel, with a rich colour palette, sophisticated audio and upgradeable graphics processor. After a thundering start in Japan (the initial shipment of 300,000 units sold out in a matter of hours), it took a while for the console to gain ground elsewhere in the world, but slowly, steadily the mega hits kept coming. While the Mega Drive traded on its attitude, the SNES competed on the sheer epic scope and quality of its software. It was a golden era. The great artists and designers of the veteran Japanese video game houses – Nintendo, Capcom, Konami, Square Soft – reached the peak of their powers with sprite-based graphics, while in the west, developers such as Rare and Argonaut helped push the limits of the hardware via technical powerhouses such as Donkey Kong Country and StarFox. Now many of these seminal titles can be easily rediscovered in one sublime package. The Nintendo Classic Mini SNES is a charming little relic of a distant time – with the emphasis on little. This perfectly scaled-down replica gets all the details right, yet fits snugly in your hand. The cartridge slot and eject button are just for show, and the original joypad ports simply flip open to allow you to connect the perfectly recreated controllers, but this is a lovely, convincing reproduction, its diminutive size neatly augmenting the nostalgia factor. As with the Mini NES, the Mini SNES connects to your modern TV screen via HDMI. There are three graphics modes to play games in: CRT filter, 4:3 and Pixel Perfect, allowing you to replicate the screen resolution and aspect ratio of an old display or to modernise the look and feel. Some games are better with one mode rather than another, so some experimentation is required. With its colourful verdant landscapes Yoshi’s Island looks quaint and painterly with the CRT Filter, but the flat-shaded polygons of StarFox arguably benefit from a sharper display – as do the titles with lots of text. But it’s mostly personal preference. The controller leads are longer than those supplied with the NES, yet still probably not long enough to reach from your TV to the sofa. Some have complained that it means you have to sit on the floor, huddled at the television to play – but then, that’s what we did in the early 1990s so you could say its another authentic touch. Or you could just buy a really long HDMI cable. The key factor here is that you get a couple of pads in the box rather than just one, so you’re instantly able to enjoy the two-player thrills afforded by, among others, Contra III, Kirby’s Dream Course and Final Fantasy III, as well as the all-time legendary duo of Super Mario Kart and Street Fighter 2. The 21 games do a good job of conveying the console’s greatest titles, as well as the wide range of experiences they offered. The popular platforming adventure genre is amply represented with Yoshi, Super Mario, Castlevania IV, Super Metroid and one of the toughest titles of all time, Super Ghouls ’n Ghosts. The decent RPG list combines outright classics Zelda: A Link to the Past and Secret of Mana, with more divisive fare such as Super Mario RPG and the eccentric parody Earthbound with its modern-day setting and playful humour. Of course there are near-incredible omissions: the much discussed Chrono Trigger, but also Breath of Fire, Illusion of Gaia and Dragon Quest – though in a limited collection this is to be expected. A major draw will be Star Fox 2, which was due to be released in 1996, but never made it to market due to Nintendo’s shift in focus to the N64. It’s a fascinating relic, and a very decent space combat simulation, introducing the free-roaming “all round” gameplay that would feature in the N64 instalments, as well as some strategy elements and a neat wing-man mechanic that lets you switch to another character after death. To play a “new” SNES game that hasn’t been endlessly discussed and revisited over the years is a genuine treat. The Mini SNES also adds a suspend feature, allowing you to stop a game mid-level and save it to the console memory so you can pick up your progress later. This is accompanied by a rewind mechanic, allowing you to whizz back through a level after you’ve made a mistake – which is invaluable for the aforementioned Super Ghouls N Ghosts. It’s another facet of the hardware designed to make these old games more accessible and enjoyable both to newcomers and to veterans who no longer have time to play through hours of a game without saving. Even with these additional features in mind, familiar complaints will no doubt surface once again. The Roms to all of these games can be found illegally online and run in emulators for nothing. You could also bag an original SNES on eBay for the same price (though it’s likely to be horribly discoloured thanks to the plastic Nintendo used, and you’re stuck if there’s a problem with the cartridge slot at any point). However, for £70, this replica gives you easy compatibility with your TV, two pads, all the cables you need and 21 great games, backed with modern day rewind and save features. As a piece of nostalgic product design it excels. Indeed, playing around with the Mini SNES is a genuine pleasure. For those who were there at the time, who remember furiously biking round to friends’ houses with a backpack full of carts and a head full of Zelda moments, it will get those memories flooding back. Additionally, as a historical artefact, Nintendo’s little box offers some serious lessons. This was the era in which modern game design was forged; the era of vast landscapes, emergent polygonal visuals, complex narratives and compelling characters. It was the era of discovery and obsession, the era of grey imports and hastily translated menu screens, the era in which fandom was expressed through specialist magazines, message boards and forums. It was a time in the industry that today’s “real gamers” often hark back to with little knowledge or appreciation for what drove those early console enthusiasts – it wasn’t elitism or gatekeeping. It was love, joy and the desire to share their experiences. The greatest thing about the Mini SNES is that it will allow the original purchasers to quickly and easily share these memories with their children, their siblings or their old friends once again. There is very little about the beauty, joy and creative brilliance of video games that you cannot learn from these 21 titles. Literature has the great Victorian novels, music has the swinging sixties, Hollywood has the auteur cinema of the 1970s; games have the SNES. We will never escape its influence and we would never want to."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/27/policing-of-nsw-water-licences-slowed-to-trickle-over-12-months","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T18:00:16Z","webTitle":"Policing of NSW water licences slowed to trickle over 12 months","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/policing-of-nsw-water-licences-slowed-to-trickle-over-12-months","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/policing-of-nsw-water-licences-slowed-to-trickle-over-12-months","fields":{"headline":"Policing of NSW water licences slowed to trickle over 12 months","bodyText":"The policing of water licences in New South Wales slowed to a trickle over the 12 months to June 2017, reinforcing allegations on the ABC’s Four Corners that on-the-ground investigations officers have been discouraged from dealing with water theft in the Murray-Darling basin. Four Corners revealed in July serious allegations of water theft by two major irrigators in the Barwon-Darling river catchment. Whistleblowers who appeared on the program told how they had been stymied in their attempts to bring their concerns to the attention of the Department of Primary Industries and WaterNSW, the agency that took over enforcement in July 2016. Now new figures tabled in NSW parliament show just how dramatic the fall in the number of prosecutions and fines issued during 2016-17 has been. The number of penalty notices issued fell to just 14 in 2016-17, compared with 70 the previous year and 98 in 2014-15. There were no prosecutions initiated during the period, whereas in most years previously there were four or five. There were also dramatic falls in the number of stop work orders issued. These are used to prevent land owners building illegal water infrastructure, such as drains, pumps, or levies to divert water. Only three were issued, compared with 22 in 2015-16 and 76 in 2014-15. The dramatic fall-off in prosecutions, penalty notices and even warning letters has corresponded with the government’s decision to move the strategic investigations unit from the Department of Primary Industries’ water division to the agency, WaterNSW. WaterNSW is responsible for administering water licences, which means its major clients are irrigators. The opposition’s spokesman on water, Chris Minns, said the information essentially confirmed people’s worst fears as to what the transfer of responsibility would do to prosecutions for water theft and other breaches of water licences. “The fears were that the conflict of interest between having irrigators as clients and policing the licences would lead to this sort of result,” he said. As Four Corners reported, enforcement staff have also been reduced since the transfer of responsibility to WaterNSW. Only four of six staff in the strategic investigations unit were transferred to WaterNSW. At the same time commonwealth funding for some additional positions ran out. The fall-off in prosecutions is not explained by a change of tactics by the new agency. It appears the vast bulk of breach notifications were closed without any action being taken at all. In the period since WaterNSW took over, there were 600 breach reports received, down slightly on the 635 the year previously, yet every category of action fell sharply, even warning letters, the most benign sanction. Only 46 such letters were issued in 2016-17, compared with 217 in the previous year. The NSW government has ordered an urgent review of water policy by the water expert Ken Matthews. In his interim report in August, he warned he shared Four Corners’ concerns about enforcement and doubts about the even-handedness of the department’s consultation arrangements with different groups of stakeholders about water management throughout the state. A spokesman for WaterNSW declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/head-quarters/2017/oct/31/the-reminiscence-bump-why-americas-greatest-year-was-probably-when-you-were-young","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-31T12:00:25Z","webTitle":"The reminiscence bump: why America’s greatest year was probably when you were young","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/oct/31/the-reminiscence-bump-why-americas-greatest-year-was-probably-when-you-were-young","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/head-quarters/2017/oct/31/the-reminiscence-bump-why-americas-greatest-year-was-probably-when-you-were-young","fields":{"headline":"The reminiscence bump: why America’s greatest year was probably when you were young","bodyText":"In 2016, as Donald Trump was busy securing the Republican nomination by promising to “Make America Great Again”, a survey of Americans asked a seemingly simple question: in which year was the country great in the first place? Unfortunately, the results were not so straightforward and instead of a consensus, respondents’ choices were spread out across the last 70 years. But an analysis by the Atlantic found one factor that seemed to influence people’s responses: their age. The younger a participant was, the more recent the year they tended to choose. This correlation was fairly weak, and it would be easy to dismiss it as a fluke. Yet recent research published in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition has found that age is important. In this study, Americans disproportionately chose the years of their own youth as the country’s greatest years – no matter how old they were now. This finding is the latest involving a phenomenon known as the reminiscence bump. The reminiscence bump One of the most robust findings in memory research is that people recall more memories from young adulthood compared to other periods of their life. For example, if you ask a group of people to list important events from their lives, you see a bump corresponding to a greater number of memories for events that occurred between the ages of 10 and 30. Researchers have found this reminiscence bump in a number of different memory experiments. For instance when people are asked to provide a memory in response to a cue word, or when they report the years they encountered their favourite books and movies, they disproportionately recount memories from young adulthood. And it doesn’t just occur for personal memories. When people list important public events – deaths of well-known people, sporting events, terrorist attacks and so on – they also show a reminiscence bump. Interestingly, people even predict that the most important public events will occur when a fictional person is between 11 and 30 years old, even though someone’s age should not have any effect on these kinds of events. America’s greatest year Intuitively, it seems like a person’s age should also be independent of their country’s greatness, over which they presumably have very little personal control. But Professor Maryanne Garry, a memory researcher at the University of Waikato who is well-versed in the reminiscence bump, thought otherwise. Every time Trump said that he was going to “Make America Great Again”, Garry says she suspected that he was “taking Americans to a place that would be different for every one of them”. In the recent study, Garry’s team first asked a group of 100 Americans to list the key events that they consider to have shaped the country’s identity. From this data they produced a “top ten” list of the most commonly reported events, for example the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Second World War. The researchers then asked a separate group of 496 people which year they would describe as America’s greatest, and why they chose that particular year. Less than 40% of people chose a year related to one of the top ten events from the previous study - for example, 1776 because it was the year the Declaration of Independence was signed. The interesting findings came from the remaining participants who did not pick a “top ten” year. When the researchers examined how old these people were in the year they chose, they found that the majority picked a year from their youth, with 60% selecting a date between their birth and their 20th birthday. In comparison, relatively few chose a year in the 100 years leading up to their birth, or after they were 30 years old. The same pattern of responses was then also found in a second group. And importantly, participants ranged in age from 19 to 84, so each person’s period of youth corresponded to a different era in American history. In other words, people’s choice of great year produced a distribution that looked very much like a reminiscence bump. Why do we have a reminiscence bump? Many researchers believe that the reminiscence bump reflects the strategies we use to retrieve key memories from our life. As Garry puts it: “I have a vast soup of experiences in my life - how do I wade through to try and find the most important ones?” One theory is that that our culture provides a sort of blueprint that we use to determine which memories are important. We will tend to better recall experiences that are culturally-valued, and a lot of those events occur when we are children and young adults. This is the period when we graduate from school or university, work in our first jobs, and have our first romantic partners. A slightly different idea suggests that we have more autobiographical memories from our youth because it is when we are forming our identity, and we tend to access memories from this period more because they define who we are as adults. Similarly, we have more memories for public events from our younger days because this is also when we are forming a generational identity. This most recent study doesn’t clearly favour any particular theory. But it does have something to say about political rhetoric. Although a large group of people named America’s greatest year at a point in their youth, for some this meant the 1950s, for others the 2010s – quite different decades of American history. Garry suggests that this could be where slogans like “Make America Great Again” get their power. For each of us, they invoke a time in our own lives where we had our first love, saw our favourite movies, experienced key life events. “They’re really effective messages”, she says. “We think we are on the same page, but we are actually on separate pages.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/11/top-10-modern-nordic-books","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T09:37:06Z","webTitle":"Top 10 modern Nordic books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/11/top-10-modern-nordic-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/11/top-10-modern-nordic-books","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 modern Nordic books","bodyText":"With the cold wave of Nordic literature crashing on UK shores over recent years and Danish, Swedish, Greenlandic, Finnish, Norwegian and Icelandic authors coming to the Southbank Centre in London this month for talks and readings, I am glad to suggest 10 books for those who want to prepare themselves. Some of the authors I choose here will be appearing at the Southbank Centre and some are featured in the anthology that I have edited with Ted Hodgkinson, The Dark Blue Winter Overcoat and Other Stories from the North. Others are to be found at all hours of day and night in their books. Never in history have so many diverse books from the north been translated, and in the last five years in the UK and the USA the list has been growing. This can be seen in the success of contemporary authors such as Karl Ove Knausgaard and Sofi Oksanen, of crime novelists such as Arnaldur Indriðason and Henning Mankell. And then we have the old guard: Strindberg, Ibsen, Hamsun, Lagerlöf, Blixen/Dinesen and the Sagas, to provide us with an impeccable pedigree. While working on the the anthology, I was more than ever convinced that the literatures of the region have more in common that not. The dry wit, the willingness to dwell in melancholia and look at the world through its blue-tinted glasses, the social criticism that comes with bringing to light the stories of the marginalised, the exploration of style and form as integral part of diving into any given theme, the deep-felt belief in literature’s role in keeping our societies humane. The books I’ve chosen here have all been recently published in English or are about to be. There should be something here for every boreal-minded reader to cherish in the coming winter. 1. Tómas Jónsson, Bestseller by Guðbergur Bergsson (translated by Lytton Smith) Bergsson is the grand old man of Icelandic literature and this is the novel every Icelandic author must love and resist. Written in 1966, when biographies of turn-of-the-century greats were dominating the bestseller lists in Iceland, the novel pretends to be the autobiographical musings of its ageing protagonist. Having nothing to his name but the fact that he is descended from Vikings, and the small flat where he lives in one room, renting the rest out to lodgers, Tómas does his best to prove worthy of a book of his own. Only recently translated into English, it is a fabulous feast of wilting light, with a whiff of Beckett’s Unnamable’s underpants. 2. Novel 11, Book 18 by Dag Solstad (translated by Sverre Lyngstad) If there is a motto to the books I have read by Solstad, it is: “We are born to embarrass ourselves before our destruction.” Here we follow the slow but sure decline of one Bjørn Hansen who leaves his wife and infant son for life in a small town where he becomes involved in amateur theatre, with all its petty in-fighting and jealousy. When his son turns up 18 years later, things take a darker turn. 3. The Endless Summer by Madame Nielsen (translated by Gaye Kynoch) At once the foremost stylist of contemporary Danish literature and the most provocative one, Nielsen shocked readers with the sudden beauty and tenderness of this novel. The reader is swept away by the flow of the narrative, the warmth and wit of a storyteller who presents modern tales of destiny with a fearless presentation of the bittersweet melancholy of existence. 4. Not Before Sundown by Johanna Sinisalo (translated by Herbert Lomas) This is a beautifully constructed fable for our times, where Sinisalo addresses humanity’s changing relationship with nature. So, if you have been waiting to discover a novel about a young and lovesick photographer named Angel who finds and takes in a catlike, feral troll kid, this is your book. But it is far from whimsical, and a subplot about a Filipino mail-order bride kept locked up in one of the flats of Angel’s building poses questions about our human to human relationships as well. 5. New Collected Poems by Tomas Tranströmer (translated by Robin Fulton) A collective cheer could be heard from the north when this Swedish poet was awarded the Nobel prize in 2011. He was the first Nordic laureate in decades and the one we all hoped for. His poems are never sentimental but always full of emotion, never sweet but always beautiful — always rich in images while appearing minimal, always of their time while speaking to all times and the people at their mercy. 6. Crimson by Niviaq Korneliussen (translated by Anna Halager) Korneliussen’s novel tells the story of a group of friends living in modern-day Nuuk, Greenland’s capital city of 18,000 inhabitants. Like young people anywhere, they are grappling with coming of age in world they never made, discovering their sexual identities and futures. Told in emails, messages, journals, short stories, it transports us to a cold homeland where the blood runs hot. 7. Mirror, Shoulder, Signal by Dorthe Nors (translated by Misha Hoekstra) Nors’s minimalist, experimental stories read as if they were thorough reports on the complexity behind the everyday situations men and especially women find themselves in. She is a master of the undercurrent, and the simplicity of her sentences makes them magnets for the reader’s own contribution to the reading experience. We can’t help mirroring ourselves in the characters, matching our own attempts at making sense of what has brought us to the moment of truth in similar situations. 8. The Tower at the Edge of the World by William Heinesen (translated by W Glyn Jones) Heinesen is the last of the 20th-century masters of Nordic letters still to be discovered by a global readership. A match with Iceland’s Halldór Laxness, Denmark’s Karen Blixen and Norway’s Knut Hamsun, he was the one who wrote from the smallest of the northern worlds, the tiny community of Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands. I use every opportunity I get to bang the drum for his books. Now his poetic evocation of life on an island that to the vast ocean is “just about the same as a grain of sand to the floor of a dance hall” is being published in a new English translation. I hope some readers of these words will follow him there. 9. The Gravity of Love by Sara Stridsberg (translated by Deborah Bragan-Turner) This novel’s protagonist is the daughter of a suicidal alcoholic living in a deteriorating mental hospital. If one believes, as I do, that investigating the harshest things in life through the literary use of language – where vulnerability and cruelty, confusion and determination, are described with equal precision – is one of our main tools to keep ourselves grounded and humane, then Stridsberg’s story is vital reading. 10. Inside Voices, Outside Light by Sigurður Pálsson (translated by Martin Regal) Inspired by the dark surrealism of the Atom Poets – the group of modernists who broke Icelandic literature out of the confines of tradition in the years after the second world war – Pálsson’s poetic world is at once highly lyrical and playful. Everyday life inspires contemplations of the tragic optimism of the human being; for at the core of man’s many balancing acts – dancing, slapstick routines, staying in love, keeping the head high – there is always the threat of destruction, and the only antidote to our awareness of our fatality is poetry as it was practised by Pálsson. The Dark Blue Winter Overcoat and Other Stories from the North, introduced and edited by Sjón and Ted Hodgkinson, is published by Pushkin Press, priced £9.99. (Available from the Guardian Bookshop for £8.49.) Its publication is part of the Southbank Centre’s year-long programme Nordic Matters and the London Literature festival which runs until 1 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/02/si-newhouse-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T15:21:10Z","webTitle":"Si Newhouse obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/02/si-newhouse-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/02/si-newhouse-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Si Newhouse obituary","bodyText":"Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr, known as Si, was the elder, less favoured son of tough old Sam Newhouse Sr, who built an American press empire one local paper at a time and whose wife, Mitzi, loved Condé Nast’s Vogue magazine so much that he bought her the company as an anniversary present. Sam prepped his younger, more streetwise son, Donald, to take over the newsprint and inserted shy Si in the high-shine Condé Nast magazine company. Si Newhouse, who has died aged 89, took the china-clay-surfaced, ad-magnet pages and its few publications and turned them into a shelf of global magazines all his own. He launched, revived or shut them, and took the decisions to hire and fire their editors. You may not have heard of the family business, Advance Publications, its solid papers and TV stations that were for decades a licence to print money; but you will know Vogue, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, GQ and Wired. Newhouse personally read those magazines right down to the text on their spines and queried the typography of the captions. He even knew how many readers renewed subscriptions, which allowed him patience with magazines in turmoil. That knowledge took time to accrue. He was born in Staten Island, New York, and attended the Horace Mann school. He was no scholar, dropping out of Syracuse University and quietly joining the family firm in the early 1950s. Newhouse Sr bought Condé Nast in 1959 and with it came Alexander Liberman, its editorial director. As well as taking to the glossies, Newhouse Jr took to Liberman, bonding over art. Liberman painted and had access to the art scene; Newhouse collected at the highest modern level, always prepared to pay for the best. Liberman demanded extravagant talent for Condé Nast and Newhouse said yes, which is how Vogue acquired Diana Vreeland as editor in 1962, and Richard Avedon as star photographer. Vreeland’s astounding, outstanding Vogue was both a last gasp of old-style magazines produced for the movers and shapers of fashionable society and an intimation of Newhouse’s new world of buzz, glitz, heat, celebs, self. Her Vogue was flagrantly successful in its extreme dreams until, with a loss of cultural exuberance around 1970, it wasn’t. Vreeland was dismissed peremptorily in 1971 in what came to be Newhouse’s signature mode – indirect communication (so indirect that the victim might hear their fate first on television news), with calm negotiators handling the severance package. Newhouse took over as chairman of Condé Nast formally in 1975, and with his brother inherited Advance Publications on their father’s death in 1979. He launched Self in 1979 for a new market that believed health, fitness and beauty to be purchasable commodities and backed the reworking of GQ from a camp publication into something more blokey in 1980. He hankered for that marker of Manhattan sophistication, the New Yorker, but, since it was not then for sale, settled for resurrecting Vanity Fair. It was in panic and limbo for a while, then, after two outmoded editors had met their severances, Tina Brown was flown in from London in 1984. Her Vanity Fair was the very brightest glow of Newhouse’s gilded age, based around moneyed and powerful players in politics, arts and entertainment. It treated the 20th century as if it were the 18th, when only a very few people were thought to matter, yet it did so with the attitude and skill of the great Georgian caricaturists. Eventually, it even made a profit. Newhouse finally bought the New Yorker in 1985 for the unreasonable price of $200m, and dispatched its venerable editor William Shawn with the usual ruthlessness. (Brown was forwarded to it in 1992, to heat it up.) Another London import, Anna Wintour, landed at US Vogue in 1988, her mission, well-executed over decades, to integrate Vogue in Newhouse’s universe, supplying fashion as Architectural Digest and World of Interiors did shelter, Bon Appétit and Gourmet food, Condé Nast Traveller destinations, and Wired IT updates. The publishers Random House, bought by Advance Publications in 1980, supplied extracts, authors, publicity and readers. Newhouse’s editors were magnificently wasteful, with millions of unused but paid-for pictures and copy thrown away by fresh regimes, and reshoots upon reshoots. He loaned staff his absolute power over creative decisions: there were no board meetings to convince or stockholders to please. Newhouse was equally munificent with million-dollar-plus salaries for his editors, clothes allowances and limousines, and interest-free loans to buy appropriate homes. Brown, finding Newhouse impenetrable, brought in a big league agent to negotiate a salary, only for Newhouse to offer to pay her ageing parents’ medical bills for life to ease her worries. Advance Publications was a family business, without need to disclose earnings or expenditure, and so implacable over taxes it fought the IRS. Newhouse’s universe developed a black hole in the mid-90s when more than half of Condé Nast’s publications were revealed to be millions in deficit. He retrenched, with losers shut, Random House sold and costs cut, and then had to shrink again after 2008, when all magazines mutated and diminished because of the global financial crash and the intervention of the internet. Brown thought Newhouse ultimately unknowable. The designer Lucy Sisman, working for him in his peak years, remembered a “short, scruffy billionaire who was often mistaken for a janitor by an unsuspecting employee who didn’t think their boss might sport a sweatshirt with dribble down the front”, albeit one who had Piet Mondrian’s Victory Boogie Woogie among the many masterpieces on his walls. Newhouse maintained two Manhattan homes – one as a home, and a second for entertaining. Not that he was likely to be in either of them, since he arrived early at Condé Nast’s Times Square HQ, available on the phone to mumble about work before the city was awake. He was happier lunching in its Frank Gehry-designed cafeteria than at the Four Seasons. Newhouse’s family life was as discreet as the business. There was a youthful marriage to Jane Franke, with children Sam, Wynn and Pamela, which ended in 1959, and in 1973 a second, to Victoria Carrington Benedict de Ramel. Wynn died in 2010. Newhouse is survived by Victoria, Sam, Pamela and Donald. • Samuel Irving Newhouse, publisher, born 8 November 1927; died 1 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/02/nobel-prizes-2017-everything-you-need-to-know-about-circadian-rhythms","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T14:55:18Z","webTitle":"Nobel prizes 2017: everything you need to know about circadian rhythms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/02/nobel-prizes-2017-everything-you-need-to-know-about-circadian-rhythms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/02/nobel-prizes-2017-everything-you-need-to-know-about-circadian-rhythms","fields":{"headline":"Nobel prizes 2017: everything you need to know about circadian rhythms","bodyText":"In the age of international travel, shift work and personal gadgets that stave off sleep, the award of the Nobel prize for research on the body’s clock, or circadian rhythms, could hardly be more timely. First identified in fruit flies, the tiny molecular components of the clock are at work in all multicellular life, humans included. The internal clock is now regarded as a key feature of life on Earth, one that wired the rotation of the planet into the fabric of our cells over millions of years of evolution. The beauty of the body’s clock is that it allows an organism to anticipate the rising and setting of the sun, rather than simply reacting to it. There is no single body clock that bangs out the hour. Instead, molecular timepieces are dotted through the different cell types, like watches in a jeweller’s, where they control great swaths of physiology from sleep patterns and body temperature to blood pressure, metabolism and the release of hormones. Scientists knew that living organisms had internal clocks centuries before they understood what made them tick. It is hard to find a plant, bug, or animal, that does not change its behaviour in some way as day gives way to night, and night becomes day. The grandly-named French astronomer Jean-Jacques d’Ortous de Mairan performed some of the most convincing early experiments that pointed to the existence of an internal clock. In 1729, he showed that mimosa plants opened their leaves in the daytime and closed them again at night, even if they were kept in total darkness. The observation suggested the plants weren’t so much reacting to light, but somehow in tune with the day-night cycle. Two hundred years after the death of d’Ortous de Mairan, modern scientists took their first major step towards understanding internal clocks. In 1971, the US neuroscientist Seymour Benzer and his student Ronald Konopka noticed that a batch of mutant fruit flies seemed to have faulty internal clocks. The dodgy timekeeping was traced back to mutations in a gene that was later given the name “period”. Enter the Nobel prize winners. In 1984, Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, studied the period gene and the protein the body makes from it. They showed that the protein, named PER, built up in cells overnight before being broken down in the daytime. It meant that levels of PER rose and fell over the 24-hour daily cycle. It was far from clear what made PER go up and down like clockwork. The two scientists proposed that it was the build-up of the PER protein itself that stopped cells making more, just as wolfing down too many doughnuts dampens the desire to eat them. In 1994, Michael Young at Rockefeller University showed that this kind of feedback loop was indeed at work. He discovered a second body clock gene that is used to make a protein called TIM. When TIM proteins come across PER proteins in cells, the two stick together, move into the nucleus, and shut the period gene down. In the late 1990s, other scientists helped piece together more genes in the clock’s mechanism, including those that help cells set the time by the light the body receives. The body clock is more than a biological curiosity. Studies by health researchers have found evidence that disrupting circadian rhythms by doing shift work can raise the risk of cancer. It is not well understood why shift work has such health risks, but one hypothesis is that exposure to light at night suppresses levels of melatonin, a hormone that might mop up particles known as “reactive oxygen species” which cause damage to cells. In 2014, scientists found shift work and jet lag disrupt the rhythms of hundreds of genes that are normally drawn on to maintain, repair and protect the body. Research on the body clock has helped scientists improve health. Many drugs now on the market work best when taken at the right time. The cholesterol-cutting drug Mevacor, for example, is taken at night because levels of the enzyme it targets are highest then. The same is true for low-dose aspirin used to reduce blood pressure. Rosbash heard he had won the prize when the Nobel committee chair called about 5am local time. “I am very pleased for the fruit fly,” he said. “When the landline rings at that hour, normally it is because someone died.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/02/catalonia-important-spain-economy-greater-role-size","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T14:55:48Z","webTitle":"How important is Catalonia to Spain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/02/catalonia-important-spain-economy-greater-role-size","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/02/catalonia-important-spain-economy-greater-role-size","fields":{"headline":"How important is Catalonia to Spain?","bodyText":"Catalonia occupies just over 6.3% (32,114 sq km) of Spain’s territory, but its importance is not proportionate to its size.

A slim majority (53%) of counties has no official or preferred religion, and 10 (5%) are hostile to religion, according to a report by the Washington-based Pew Research Center. Most of the 43 countries with state religions are in the Middle East and North Africa, with a cluster in northern Europe. Islam is the official religion in 27 countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa as well North Africa and the Middle East. Thirteen countries – including nine in Europe – are officially Christian, two (Bhutan and Cambodia) have Buddhism as their state religion, and one (Israel) is officially a Jewish state. No country has Hinduism as its state religion. The Pew report says: “In some cases, state religions have roles that are largely ceremonial. But often the distinction comes with tangible advantages in terms of legal or tax status, ownership of real estate or other property, and access to financial support from the state. In addition, countries with state-endorsed (or ‘established’) faiths tend to more severely regulate religious practice, including placing restrictions or bans on minority religious groups.” The report adds: “In a few cases, a country’s official religion is primarily a legacy of its history and now involves few, if any, privileges conferred by the state. And a few other countries fall at the other end of the spectrum, making their official religion mandatory for all citizens.” Christianity is the favoured faith in 28 of the 40 countries with a preferred religion. More than half of the total provide funds or resources for religious education programmes that largely benefit the preferred religion, and a third provide funding or resources for religious buildings. In 10 countries, the state either tightly regulates religious institutions or is actively hostile to religion. They include China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam and several former Soviet republics. According to Pew, these are “places where government officials seek to control worship practices, public expressions of religion and political activity by religious groups”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/02/max-verstappen-malaysian-grand-prix-win-testament-determination-formula-one-motor-sport","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T13:12:24Z","webTitle":"Max Verstappen’s Malaysian Grand Prix win testament to his determination | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/02/max-verstappen-malaysian-grand-prix-win-testament-determination-formula-one-motor-sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/02/max-verstappen-malaysian-grand-prix-win-testament-determination-formula-one-motor-sport","fields":{"headline":"Max Verstappen’s Malaysian Grand Prix win testament to his determination","bodyText":"Positivity pays for Verstappen It has been a torrid year for Max Verstappen, who, following pre-season hopes that he would be in a championship fight, were swiftly dashed after seven DNFs. Taking the much-deserved win in Malaysia was a testament to how, despite his sometimes obvious frustration, he has kept his mind on the game. He had said at the Hungarian Grand Prix that he was focusing on making the best of every weekend regardless of the setbacks and when he finally had an opportunity to do so he made it count. He drove a skilful and mature race that belies the fact he has just turned 20. He controlled his pace out front, able to match Lewis Hamilton whenever the British driver upped the ante, and showed why he is such a prodigious talent with a properly competitive car. His relief and joy were palpable and rightly so, as Christian Horner, the Red Bull principal, acknowledged. “It’s great for Max, he has endured so much bad luck,” he said. “But he has never let his head drop too much. I am so pleased for him. Last time he was on the podium was in April. This is just the injection that he needed.” Mercedes must work fast After a weekend that left Mercedes once again scratching their heads as to why they could not extract the performance they needed, they must address it quickly. Suzuka is next weekend, leaving them little time to ascertain how they can adapt to what Hamilton called a “fundamental issue” with their car. The British driver was positive after the post-race debrief but strongly believes that the “diva”‑like characteristics of his ride are inherent to this year’s design. So there will be no straightforward fix for Japan. But the upgrades they brought to Malaysia clearly made the situation worse at this track and they must now consider how best to use them for the next round. The team’s executive director, Toto Wolff, admitted that they were at best P5 on pace, behind both Red Bull and Ferrari and that tyres and temperatures were yet again integral to why their machinery presents such a conundrum. Ferrari take heart from difficult days By any usual standards this was a shocking weekend for Ferrari. They had installed a new, upgraded engine but suffered two hugely costly failures. Sebastian Vettel’s turbo problem put him to the back of the grid, and what is believed to be a similar issue prevented Kimi Raikkonen from even starting the race. Having recovered to fourth, and with Hamilton only second, Vettel had succeeded in minimising his losses as far as might have been expected. However, his collision with Lance Stroll at turn five on the slowing down lap may diminish much of the impressive efforts he had made during the race. He took major damage and will face a grid penalty if a new gearbox is required for Suzuka. Yet Vettel and the Ferrari principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, remain upbeat. Their engine showed great promise and the race pace was hugely impressive on a track expected to favour Mercedes. Without their problems their form had the potential for a one-two in Malaysia. They remain up against it in the championship battle but have at least suggested they are able to make a fight of it in the remaining five races. Young guns firing A performance that justifies McLaren’s faith and confidence in Stoffel Vandoorne will have been hugely pleasing to the team and driver. He out-qualified his team-mate Fernando Alonso, in seventh to the Spaniard’s ninth and beat him on the track. The Belgian ran as high as fifth before closing out a classy display with seventh place in the race. The 25-year-old has always had strong ability, he won the GP2 championship in 2015 by a 108-point margin over Alexander Rossi, but has struggled to show it in his first full season in F1. The McLaren has very much been built around Alonso and beginning his career with the lack of power and reliability problems of its Honda power unit was a baptism of fire for Vandoorne. He has struggled but in Malaysia proved his mettle and outraced his team-mate, who could manage only 11th. Credit, too, to Pierre Gasly, who made a strong F1 debut for Toro Rosso. He finished in 14th despite enduring back pain throughout the race because of an uncomfortable seating position. He will drive again for Toro Rosso at Suzuka before returning to the same track two weeks later, where he has a chance to win the Japanese Super Formula series. Racing matters most It may have been a fairly long-winded way to state the obvious but when, over the weekend, F1’s owners revealed the results of a major survey of fans it turned out that racing was the most important aspect of the sport. Their survey – conducted across 14,000 people from the UK, US, Germany, Italy, Brazil, China and Russia – concluded that for 55% it was the racing that appealed most. A third of those polled also wanted to better understand the technology behind the cars, which displays a singular failure of the sport to properly promote the hugely complex and technologically advanced power units of the turbo-hybird era. It also focused on “segmentation”, dividing fans according to responses with the two most engaged groups dubbed “excitables” and “purists”, sobriquets which would doubtless cause most horror. Perhaps most interesting, however, was that a significant proportion of those two groups were from the US and China – both areas where the sport has always felt it needed to make more of an impression. Certainly it is a strong indicator at least that the Formula One Group’s intention to increase the number of GPs in the US has some numbers to back it up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/07/a-letter-to-my-father-who-has-stopped-drinking","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T05:45:13Z","webTitle":"A letter to ... my father, who I can’t stand to be around when he’s drunk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/07/a-letter-to-my-father-who-has-stopped-drinking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/07/a-letter-to-my-father-who-has-stopped-drinking","fields":{"headline":"A letter to ... my father, who I can’t stand to be around when he’s drunk","bodyText":"I always felt foolish saying the words: “My father is an alcoholic.” You really weren’t drinking that much, but when you were drunk and started ranting – at society and incompetent politicians, at everything that annoyed you – my skin prickled with fear and all I wanted was to run away: from you, from a home that felt unsafe, from the verbal abuse and the threat of physical violence that never broke out, but which filled our flat like a vile smell. A little later, your marriage breaks down, and I leave for university. Over the course of almost eight years, our relationship changes. You visit every so often, but I still hate to be around you when you get drunk. My boyfriend watches you drink two litres of beer with a single meal, then drive a car. He’s incredulous. I’m glad you’re part of my life, but I worry about you almost non-stop. You get diagnosed with diabetes; patches of your skin turn black. One morning not so very long ago, I stand at a bus stop and listen to some music. My phone picks a shanty-song about a bunch of Vikings attending the funeral of a friend, a sad song that you like a lot. Without warning, a brutal thought cracks into my head: if you keep going the way you are, I will have to play this song for your funeral in a few years. Then, one lazy Saturday morning just before I was due to go away for a few weeks, the phone rings – it’s you. You’re very composed and tell me: “I’m at the hospital. Please don’t worry.” I sit bold upright, thinking: “What has the alcohol done to you now?” My heart beats like a drum, but I manage to understand what you tell me. You have decided to stop drinking. A few days ago, you admitted yourself to a detox programme. I’m dumbstruck. A few minutes later, my boyfriend finds me crying uncontrollably with relief and the bottled-up pain of being the daughter of an alcoholic for many years. Two days later, I visit you in the clinic. I need to see you before I leave for my trip and tell you that I will support you. Since then, our relationship has healed. I got to know the man you really are: kind and considerate, intelligent, a joy to talk to, a rock to turn to when life gets tumultuous. We became friends. You rekindled your relationship with your first daughter, and recently, I met my half-sister and her family for the first time. I can hardly believe how well things have turned out. Sometimes, that makes me sad. I wonder what my life could have been like, growing up with you for a father, instead of with the man that let alcohol strip away all the goodness from him. It has been over a year since you stopped drinking, and I am proud of you beyond words. And yet, there are moments when I feel as if I am living in a dream. A part of me still mistrusts our newfound happiness and wonders, what if it doesn’t last? What if, some day, I call you and the old aggressiveness is back, the old impatience to find something to drink, the old dismissiveness of almost everyone but you? I’m scared of that day. How I would cope with the pain of losing you, I cannot tell. Please don’t take yourself away from me again. Yours, loving, your daughter.

It has gained unique notoriety not simply because the figure was demonstrably false, or even because Brexit will shrink the economy rather than free up vital funds, but rather because of its calculated emotional manipulation. We value the NHS more than any other institution. As the defining icon of the post-war consensus and intrinsic component of our national story, it unites Britons across political, geographical and class divides. Crippled by austerity, staff shortages and low morale, our NHS is also on its knees. But far from offering a helping hand, Brexit threatens to bring it down altogether. A report in the Lancet offers a comprehensive – and bleak – analysis of the dangers. Brexit stands to damage staffing, funding, access to new products and technology, and standards of public health. The softer the Brexit, the lower the harm – but as Theresa May’s speech in Florence made clear, the government still plans to leave the single market, customs union and other EU bodies after a transition ends in 2021, no matter the cost. The key area of risk is also the central plank of Brexit: restrictions on free movement of people. This is no coincidence. While millions of leave voters expressed the concern that immigration was posing an intolerable burden on public services, studies have repeatedly indicated that it in fact keeps them afloat. The NHS and adult social care employs 150,000 EU nationals; 10% of our doctors graduated in EEA countries. The government continually promises that the “brightest and best” will always be welcome, but this elitist and divisive slogan fails even on its own terms. Britain’s most vulnerable patients do not simply depend on EU surgeons, GPs and nurses, but on an army of notionally “unskilled” carers, porters and cleaners who help to keep people alive. Even if the government prioritises NHS workers in its post-Brexit immigration strategy, grave damage has already been done. This week, a molecular biologist in Madrid told me that London was his favourite city, but its political climate now too hostile to consider returning. The figures bear out the anecdote: while 40,000 nursing positions currently lie vacant, the number of EU nurses registering to work here has dropped by a staggering 96%. While fewer arrive, more depart. About 10,000 EU nationals have left the NHS in the past year. Britain no longer feels like a welcoming place for foreigners. Let alone the shame, we should also feel profound alarm. We do not have the doctors and nurses that we need as it is; and even if the government was adequately investing in training – which it isn’t – we would still have no time to replace those Europeans who either intend to leave or never even come. To add idiocy to injury, the recently leaked government proposals on immigration specified time-limited work permits, with permanent residency a possibility only for the most highly skilled. Telling NHS workers that they can help us for a few years, but probably forget about ever settling or becoming British, may not prove an attractive offer. The problem for the NHS is that unlike, say, the single market or Irish border issue, it is not in itself an EU competence and will not be negotiated at the Brexit table. What we do with our healthcare has always been a matter for us alone. But as with so much else in Brexit, problems both predictable and previously unforeseen are threatening key aspects of our national infrastructure. While remain campaigners stressed the risks to the NHS of reduced immigration and a diminished economy, few mentioned the €3.5bn supplied by the European Investment Bank to the NHS since 2001, or publicised the dangers to cancer patients of leaving the European Atomic Energy Community or the European Medicines Agency. The government, for its part, is so consumed with fire-fighting that it is neglecting to recognise the NHS for what it is: one of Brexit’s key issues, and potentially its most high-profile piece of collateral damage. Like the ravens at the Tower of London whose departure, in legend, presages the nation’s fall, the NHS’s success – or collapse – is also Britain’s. Brexit’s architects knew that people would respond to appeals to help it; faced with a false prospectus, the public duly chose British hospitals over Brussels bureaucrats. Those same voters may yet punish Brexit’s leaders, but the national consequences will profoundly eclipse any political ones. After all, the risk of deploying your most treasured family heirloom as a political football is not just that it could ultimately land in your own goal – but that in your recklessness, you may irreparably smash it. • Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/02/hammond-calls-corbyn-clear-and-present-danger-conservative-conference-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T17:56:08Z","webTitle":"Business leaders give lukewarm response to Hammond's speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/02/hammond-calls-corbyn-clear-and-present-danger-conservative-conference-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/02/hammond-calls-corbyn-clear-and-present-danger-conservative-conference-speech","fields":{"headline":"Business leaders give lukewarm response to Hammond's speech","bodyText":"Business groups have given a lukewarm reception to Philip Hammond’s main speech to the Conservative party conference in which he announced no new policies and spent much of the address attacking Jeremy Corbyn. In a speech with an unusually strong focus on the opposition, the chancellor called the Labour leader “a clear and present danger” to prosperity and likened his economic policies to those in Cuba, Zimbabwe and Venezuela. Referring repeatedly to Labour’s record in the late 1970s, he singled out Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, as “dinosaurs”, saying the party’s conference last week showed they would “wreak havoc” on the UK. “It’s a wicked and cynical business offering superficially simple solutions to complex challenges,” Hammond said in his speech in Manchester that contained relatively few positive offerings from his party beyond a general commitment to market economics. There were no new announcements, though the chancellor did confirm £300m in new investment for railways in northern England and £10bn extra for the government’s help-to-buy housing scheme. Business groups welcomed Hammond’s affirmation of free markets, but said they had hoped for more substance. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI’s director general, said the address showed “a government strong on diagnosis, but weak on action”. She added: “The UK is facing a generation-defining challenge. A potent cocktail of Brexit uncertainty and dogma-driven politics on both left and right threatens jobs, investment and living standards. Now is not the time for half-measures.” Stephen Martin, the head of the Institute of Directors, said Hammond had been right to praise the market-based economy. “Actions speak louder than words, however, and he must back up his support for business in the upcoming budget,” he said. The speech brought a robust response from McDonnell, who accused the chancellor of having no ideas to offer. “It was a speech that contained more baseless smears on Labour than Tory policy announcements,” the shadow chancellor said. “But it betrays how fearful the Tories are of the challenge posed by Jeremy Corbyn. “There was nothing of real substance on infrastructure, on tackling the housing crisis, the funding shortfall in our NHS and care system, and nothing at all for hardworking families who are struggling to keep up with rising prices.” Amid wider government worries that they are in danger of losing the public battle over the economy to Labour, Hammond strengthened his attack further at a fringe meeting later on Monday. He argued that big businesses should be duty-bound to oppose what he called Labour’s “existential challenge to our economic model”. “It has to be responded to by all those who believe in the market, and all those who live by the market. It cannot be left to one political party to make the case for the market economy,” Hammond said at a CBI-sponsored event. “We do not expect big business, PLC business, to engage in party political debate, we do not expect PLCs to support political parties. But I do expect them to support the case for the market, and I do not expect business to pull its punches in making the case for the market economy.” A long section of Hammond’s main speech was devoted to what he called a “history lesson” into the Labour record before Margaret Thatcher took power in 1979. The chancellor began: “Now I can almost hear the warning bells going off in conference control centre: ‘Don’t talk about the 70s!’ Recounting the then Labour government’s recourse to the IMF, amid rising inflation and high tax rates, Hammond said Corbyn and McDonnell wanted to lead the UK back to that era. “A new generation is being tempted down a dangerous path,” he told the arena. “We have to explain why and how the market economy works and the role of competition as the consumer’s friend. “I think we owe it to the next generation to show how Corbyn’s Marxist policies will inevitably lead us back to where Britain was in the late 1970s.” Hammond compared Labour’s policies with those used in Cuba, Zimbabwe and Venezuela, calling the latter a country “tragically impoverished” by policies supported by Corbyn. Hammond said of Corbyn: “He is a clear and present danger to our prosperity, damaging our economy. Even in opposition his loose talk already deterring the entrepreneurs and the investors we need for our future success.” He did acknowledge that the Conservatives needed to listen to the “fears and concerns” of voters over areas such as living standards, and “the frustration among the young who fear that the combination of student debt and sky-high rents and house prices will condemn them never to access the opportunities of property ownership their parents enjoyed”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/02/talking-horses-monday-2-october-best-bets-bath-stratford-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T11:01:36Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Monday’s best bets at Bath and Stratford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/02/talking-horses-monday-2-october-best-bets-bath-stratford-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/02/talking-horses-monday-2-october-best-bets-bath-stratford-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Monday’s best bets at Bath and Stratford","bodyText":"After nine Group One races in the space of two days in Britain and France, the British cards on the first Monday in October are always going to struggle to compete, but a handful of horses have fair credentials at the likely odds, including Bahuta Acha (3.10) in the nursery handicap at Bath. David Loughnane’s gelding struggled to build on a solid debut earlier in the season, when he failed to make the frame in three starts after finishing a close second first time up. But he showed significant improvement to record his first win at Catterick last month, finishing nearly three lengths clear in a good time, and he will be hard to beat if he turns up in the same form. Bellevarde (2.40) is impressively consistent and that could count for a lot in a weak race earlier on the card, while at Stratford Astrum (3.00) could follow up his latest success in selling company. He won with plenty in hand and though consistency is not his strong suit, that is priced in at around 10-1. The National Hunt Flat race on the same card is as competitive at the meeting but Rococo Style (5.00), who is bred to be useful on the Flat, was a ready winner first time up and worth backing to go in again. Matorico (3.20) could also offer some value against the favourite in the two-mile handicap chase at Stratford. The other jumps meeting on Monday at Newton Abbot goes ahead as planned after the track was declared fit for action. Officials had called a 7am precautionary check after significant rain through the week had turned the ground heavy, with the prospect of further rain overnight.

I cannot fathom a world without a search engine at my fingertips. How did we cope before them? Sometimes, I remember I completed university without the distracting diversions of YouTube, and marvel silently. When I realise neither Tumblr nor Twitter were around to derail my academic career, I thank my lucky stars. In 2017, aka the hyperbolic age, we get to receive (perceived) threats of nuclear war issued via 140 characters (or, as of last month, 280), and people with strange avatars can threaten you with bodily harm.

CaShawn Thompson’s inadvertent #BlackGirlMagic movement has weathered all sorts since its inception, from applause to cries of “reverse racism” (no such thing exists, friends). The concept is simple: it’s a celebration of black girls and women in a world all too happy to make them small, and to discard their contributions. At its best, it creates a waterfall effect of good news, of black women living life on their terms, succeeding beyond every expectation. It exists for the parade-worthy achievements, but also for the little victories and innovations that move us as individuals and as a collective, across social platforms. If you’re a sentimental fool like me, it might have helped make the internet a little less bleak on the roughest of days.

Fishwick put millions of pounds of his own money behind the belief that there’s a demand for ethical banking now more than ever and opened Burnley Savings &amp; Loans in Burnley town centre in 2011. Fishwick’s model aims to link local savers with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in need of finance, run by a locally based bank manager who makes lending decisions based on deep personal knowledge, rather than an algorithm that spits out an automatic “no” without any personal understanding of the business involved. Burnley Savings &amp; Loans trades under its advertising slogan “Bank on Dave” and while the business is currently only authorised to lend, he is hoping to get a banking licence from City regulators next year. “We’ve been badly served by the banks in the past and we need change. We need ethical banks – small, simple, honest banks run by the community to serve the community – that see the people they’re serving,” he says. His business will, he believes, challenge a banking sector that “lost its way and started buying financial weapons of mass destruction,” instead of supporting the small businesses that drive the economy. The banking sector is slowly starting to shrug off practices that have brought the established financial services industry into disrepute. But Fishwick is not the only entrant to offer customers a different, more sustainable and ethical approach. When former financial services PR Lisa Stanley set up Good with Money – a review website comparing sustainable financial products – it was obvious to her that her own business banking would need strong ethical credentials. Stanley looked into banking with a large building society but discovered that “it was owned by a bigger bank we weren’t keen on”. She also explored the offer from Triodos Bank, which claims to make “ethical and sustainable” decisions when investing its customers’ money – and to be totally transparent about it. You can, for example, visit Triodos’ website and see the full list of who the bank lends to, mainly in sectors such as environment, culture, and social projects. But Triodos didn’t offer free business banking – and, crucially, provides no debit or credit card. For Stanley, that was a deal breaker. She ended up with the ethically concerned customer’s standby: the Co-operative Bank. It offered 18 months free banking for new business customers, plus a debit card. But she felt it was “clunky” to set up, and although it “did the job,” it was perhaps not exactly what she wanted. Many customers have opted to bank with the Co-op because of its ethical investment policy, which has prevented it from investing in industries like tobacco and weapons. Whether that commitment will survive long-term, after the selling off by the Co-operative Group of its final 1% share, is yet to be seen. The need for new approaches addressing SME banking has been recognised by innovation group Nesta’s Open Up prize, which challenges people to come up with new apps and services that improve banking for small businesses. The project aims to shake up traditional retail banking by promoting financial products that offer “greater transparency, choice, quality and innovation” to small businesses desperate for services that understand their requirements. But while SMEs often can’t get loans from major banks, Conrad Ford, chief executive of Funding Options – which matches small businesses with socially interested lenders – notes that a wave of challenger banks are offering more than just a ray of hope. “If you open up a small lean bank then you want to target a niche, so that will hopefully mean that more SMEs will be better served,” he says. Challenger banks aim to operate differently and are often founded on principles of integration with a defined community or locality. Ford cites Metro Bank which, he says, “is trying to reinvent banking, collecting money from local people as savings, which then get lent out in their community”. He also mentions Civilised Bank, where employees can be seen online making a pledge called the “Banker’s Oath” committing each employee to conduct their business relationships with integrity and “in a manner that impacts positively on the wellbeing of people both inside and outside my enterprise”. Another financial operator vaunting its principles is the Greater London Mutual, which claims to be “working for, controlled by and answerable exclusively to London and Londoners”. Not that having a commitment to customer service with integrity is new – Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which has operated in the UK for the last decade, offers retail and business banking with an emphasis on “trust and respect”. Banks that promise integrity in their dealings, via initiatives like the Bankers Oath, widen the scope of ethical banking to include not just where your money is invested but how a bank behaves – towards both you the customer and the community you live in. Stanley believes there’s a growing appetite for ethical business banking, but says the industry must change in how it communicates with customers. “The reason ethical finance hasn’t grown as much as it might have is because it’s been a bit niche and a bit preachy,” she says. “And there’s this whole issue about the ‘ethical premium’, that [ethical banking] is costing you more money: well actually, it doesn’t cost you more money, but explaining how that works needs some investment from the banking industry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/02/philip-hammond-speech-what-we-learned","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T12:29:55Z","webTitle":"Philip Hammond's speech: what we learned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/02/philip-hammond-speech-what-we-learned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/02/philip-hammond-speech-what-we-learned","fields":{"headline":"Philip Hammond's speech: what we learned","bodyText":"The chancellor pledged new investment in help-to-buy and the “northern powerhouse”, but much of Philip Hammond’s speech to the Conservative conference in Manchester was dedicated to a full-scale attack on Labour and the party’s economic policies. The Conservatives are very worried about Labour Hammond’s speech was striking in how much was dedicated to attacking Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell – calling them “dinosaurs who had broken out of their cases”. He spent most of the first half of his speech talking about the 1970s and Britain as “the sick man of Europe”, as well as the political regimes of Cuba, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Hammond said the party’s popularity was based on “preying on people’s worries, manipulating their fears, luring them with false promises … It’s a wicked and cynical business offering superficially simple solutions to complex challenges”. However, he said the Tories must “acknowledge the weariness at the long slog back from Labour’s recession” without specifically mentioning austerity. Conservatives must re-make the arguments for capitalism and free trade Hammond made a similar argument that the prime minister made in her speech to the Bank of England last week, that the Conservatives needed to restore people’s faith in capitalism. He said Conservatives had to “step forward and make those arguments again because a new generation is being tempted down a dangerous path”. He said the Tories needed to show that Britain’s economy was working – to counter McDonnell’s claim that the economy is “fundamentally broken”. Extra investment for the north of England Hammond’s main announcement was an additional £300m “to future-proof the railway network in the north” and ensure HS2 infrastructure can link up with future rail projects. The pledge will be aimed to counter the fury after plans for rail electrification in the Lake District and the Midlands were scrapped in July along with the modernisation of the Cardiff-Swansea line after massive budget overruns. The announcement, which came at the same time as Crossrail 2 in London was given the green light, led to accusations that the Conservatives had ditched their commitment to the northern powerhouse. Economic, but not political, closeness to the EU Hammond drew a clear distinction between Britain’s economy, which he said would “remain closely linked with the EU for many good reasons”, and its politics, saying the UK’s “political future will be our own”. His speech was light on Brexit policy detail, but he also warned the government must be “clear-eyed about the challenges” of leaving the EU, just as his cabinet colleague Liam Fox called for an end to “a damaging, pessimistic view of our future” at a fringe meeting, and blamed the Financial Times and the BBC for a lack of optimism. Home ownership is the way to win over young people Hammond made a staunch defence of help-to-buy, despite warnings that the policy is inflating house prices. He and Theresa May visited two new homeowners in Salford on Monday morning, he said, “hearing first-hand how help-to-buy made their dream of home ownership come true”. He said young people saw the market as “rigged” in favour of those already way up the ladder. The chancellor announced an extra £10bn in funding to provide loans under the scheme through to 2021, which was briefed to newspapers over the weekend. The speech contained no new announcements beyond that, but there were re-commitments to manifesto pledges including the national retraining scheme to help people whose jobs are threatened by technological change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/03/weatherwatch-hearts-at-risk-during-anticyclones","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T20:30:09Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: hearts at risk during anticyclones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/03/weatherwatch-hearts-at-risk-during-anticyclones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/03/weatherwatch-hearts-at-risk-during-anticyclones","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: hearts at risk during anticyclones","bodyText":"It is well known that exposure to heat waves and cold spells can cause serious health problems for older people. And fog and air pollution affect the vulnerable of all ages. New research shows that stable weather conditions can increase hospital admissions and the number of deaths among older people, particularly during prolonged high pressure. The scientists say that doctors and hospital admission planners should take weather forecasts into account when treating or making recommendations to patients with heart failure. More than 100,000 people with heart conditions were monitored over a two-year period, during all weathers. For these people the risk of death or needing hospital treatment for heart failure increased with every 1C drop in temperature, especially in winter. If the temperature dropped 10C in a week, a frequent occurrence in northern climes, there was a 7% rise in admissions of these patients. But when the pressure was high for a period of seven days the risk of heart failure increased by 4.5% for every extra 10 millibars in atmospheric pressure. This does not mean the high pressure alone was to blame, rather the weather conditions the pressure caused. The longer the high pressure lasted the greater the risk. In high summer, still, dry, weather creates conditions for a heat wave that will be dangerous for some people, especially if combined with air pollution. But it is the winter systems, often known as blocking highs, that are most deadly. These allow fog to form that over time becomes laden with pollutants. In addition, these are often periods when the temperatures drop steeply, a dangerous combination."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/10/raqqa-a-journey-into-the-destroyed-heart-of-the-islamic-state-capital","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T04:00:38Z","webTitle":"Raqqa: a journey into the destroyed heart of the Islamic State capital","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/raqqa-a-journey-into-the-destroyed-heart-of-the-islamic-state-capital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/10/raqqa-a-journey-into-the-destroyed-heart-of-the-islamic-state-capital","fields":{"headline":"Raqqa: a journey into the destroyed heart of the Islamic State capital","bodyText":"After months of brutal fighting, the battle to retake Raqqa, the self-declared capital of the Islamic State caliphate, is almost over. Scroll down to follow photographer Achilleas Zavallis and reporter Martin Chulov as they journey from the Iraqi border to the wasteland of the frontline of the ancient Syrian city where the few remaining Isis fighters are making their last stand. Crossing the Syrian border Bobbing rhythmically over barren hills, the donkey heads of Rojava’s oil trade draw crude from the ground, sending it down thin pipes to a refinery nearby. These basic black pumps are the linchpin of the region’s economy, and are central to what happens after Isis is finally pushed from Raqqa and its surrounds. Oil could galvanise Kurdish claims on autonomy. The subterranean riches here are also tempting for forces fighting to the south, Russian, Iranian, American and Syrian. Driving between Kobani and Ain Issa Syria’s newest refugees arrive most days here, on a dusty outpost near a teeming refugee camp. They tumble exhausted from clapped out lorries and cars that have barely made the journey. Their faces swathed in scarves to avoid the dust and flies, they settle into makeshift tents, and wait. Many come from Raqqa. Others from towns and villages close to Deir ez-Zor, where Isis is fighting yet another last stand. Their fate, like that of the millions of others who have fled five years of war and insurgency, is uncertain. Visiting the Ain Issa IDP camp Refugees from Syria and Iraq are crammed into this camp, one of the biggest in the Raqqa hinterland. Some had been displaced more than three times before arriving here. “Everywhere we go, the airstrikes follow,” said Abu Jassem, originally from Falluja in Iraq. In one corner are the widows and orphans of foreign fighters. Blond and red-headed children frolic in a small courtyard. Their mothers hide behind curtains, many wearing chadors. They are stigmatised by their captors and by other refugees. East Raqqa YPG base In this half-finished concrete building, fighters in the war with Isis rest and recuperate, before heading to the frontline a mile away. Their dead and wounded are brought here. They sleep, eat and plan the war in the room upstairs, from where they can see smoke rising from the battle. Here, Hazam, a Kurd from Kobani, who lost a hand in the battle for his home town, oversees a fighting force of mostly Arab youths from Raqqa. Hazam is supervised by a Kurd from the Turkish mountains. Fighting nearby Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters help a shellshocked comrade to his feet. The fighter and his team were hit by an RPG round, fired by Isis militants, while trying to assist cut-off members of their unit on the east Raqqa front line. Approaching the frontline Less than half a mile from the Raqqa clock tower, anti-Isis fighters are dug into the ruins of several buildings. Some use holes in a wall to scope for extremists further on. Their foes, like them, move through holes they have smashed through walls. The enemy is often less than two buildings away, hidden in the remnants of a ruined city that was once the heart of their so-called caliphate, but volunteers fighting with the Kurds say they have never seen a live Isis member. Burnt-out cars are used as a temporary road blockade near a SDF base as a precautionary measure against Isis suicide car bombs. Near Clock Tower Square Beyond the jagged wasteland there is a prize that all those fighting Isis are aiming for: a clock tower that stands on a small roundabout. Public executions were routinely performed there, and some of the group’s most infamous members lived nearby."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/02/childrens-authors-slam-celebrity-heavy-world-book-day-lineup","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T12:28:05Z","webTitle":"Children's authors slam celebrity-heavy World Book Day lineup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/02/childrens-authors-slam-celebrity-heavy-world-book-day-lineup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/02/childrens-authors-slam-celebrity-heavy-world-book-day-lineup","fields":{"headline":"Children's authors slam celebrity-heavy World Book Day lineup","bodyText":"Top children’s authors including David Almond and Anthony McGowan have criticised a celebrity-heavy lineup of titles for next year’s World Book Day, describing the choice of books by famous names including Julian Clary and Clare Balding as patronising and demeaning. Billed as “the world’s biggest celebration of reading”, more than 1m books by authors including Jacqueline Wilson, Francesca Simon and Julia Donaldson were given away to children for this year’s World Book Day. But when the featured authors at next year’s event were announced on Friday, including Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain and the musician Tom Fletcher as well as Clary and Balding, the Carnegie medal-winning writer Almond led a volley of criticism against organisers for overlooking children’s authors in favour of celebrity names. Almond, who wrote the novel Island for this year’s event, took to Facebook this weekend to ask “how it is that books by a clutch of celebrities could possibly be better than those by some of the wonderful children’s authors at work today? … I guess some folk might say I’m just being elitist or something if I start going on about the choices for next year, if I allow myself to think that the nation’s children are being short-changed by this and that the nation’s authors and illustrators are being scorned, if I wonder whether the choices show a lack of true seriousness and a narrow understanding of the importance of children’s literary culture … But what the hell. That’s what I wonder, that’s what I think.” Almond said on Monday that he was supported in his views by many of his fellow authors. “I think World Book Day is a fantastic venture so this is baffling, really. On the one hand I am angry, but on the other – what were they thinking? It’s demeaning to children, because it is assuming that children don’t read properly.” Almond was supported by authors including Joanne Harris, who wrote on her blog that she felt “the current spate of celebrity children’s books is having a detrimental effect, not just on children’s publishing, but on the reputation of children’s writing, and even on literacy in general”. McGowan, the author of novels including the award-winning Henry Tumour, said he had always “tried to remain sanguine” about celebrities writing children’s books. “But the decision to load the 2018 World Book Day promotion with celebrities seems to be a disaster – a step change that signals something rotten in the system. “This year, they could have scattered gold dust over the whole operation by headlining with well-known children’s writers, and used the rest of the list to promote diversity. Instead they decided to promote not books, but the grasping celebrities – comedians and TV personalities, a decommissioned pop star … It’s a cheap and tawdry (or rather, I suppose, expensive and flashy) way of saying that fame matters more than writing talent. Next year I expect to see Kim Kardashian and whoever gets the smirk-and-sympathy vote on Strictly headlining the celebrations.” Booksellers also reacted with dismay. Tamsin Rosewell at Kenilworth Books said that during the period that World Book Day books are sold, the bookshop would donate £1 to the Society of Authors for every customer who allowed it to recommend a favourite writer, or show them the work of the authors who have ghostwritten the celebrity books. She highlighted work by writers including Malorie Blackman, Chris Priestley, SF Said, Julian Sedgwick and Eloise Williams. “To give children and families the impression that books with a celebrity name attached to them have been chosen above all others sends a very damaging message: to be a successful writer you need to be famous or pretty,” she added. “Not only is this sending the wrong message entirely, but is also enormously depressing for booksellers, who work hard to introduce new readers to work by excellent writers – both new and established – and it is also singularly disheartening to authors who have a lifetime of experience and skill that adds real value to our cultural canon. It is important that children understand that the celebrity names attached to these books are not the names of the people who actually wrote them.” In response to the criticism, World Book Day director Kirsten Grant said that the list features “a mix of names that children will already know and love, as well as those that we hope they will discover for the first time”, and that each of the fiction titles will also “contain an extract by an up-and-coming author, to enable children to continue their reading journey and discover great new authors. Yes, there are celebrity writers on the list (who have written their own books), but if they are the catalyst to encouraging a non-reader to pick up a book and start a nationwide conversation about reading, then everyone will be better off,” said Grant. She added that World Book Day would be announcing news about its young adult list in the coming weeks.

The Civil Aviation Authority said 300,000 Monarch bookings had been cancelled and it has hired 34 charter planes to get 110,000 people back to the UK, after the airline’s administrators, KPMG, stopped all flights from 4am on Monday. At Gatwick on Monday, a bride and groom found their flight to their wedding destination had been cancelled five minutes before they were due to board. Alan Jee, 42, from Bournemouth, said their week had been plunged into chaos after flights for 30 of his friends and family were also affected. He said calls to find replacement transport proved fruitless and he was facing the prospect of sleeping at Gatwick until it was sorted – or even missing Saturday’s £20,000 wedding in Gran Canaria altogether. “We went past passport control, then five minutes before we were due to go on the plane they just put an announcement out saying everything’s been cancelled and if we want to get flights anywhere else we have to pay for them ourselves,” Jee told PA. “My missus just burst straight into tears, and my mother-in-law and my mum.” He added: “[Monarch] are doing absolutely nothing about it whatsoever, they’ve palmed us off. No one’s told us anything about it, we’ve tried speaking to Monarch but they’ve gone into liquidation. They can’t get any more flights and we can’t get a hotel out here until this is sorted.” At Luton a small sign saying “Information for passengers” had been placed at the entrance to the airport’s departure area. “All Monarch airlines flights from 2 October 2017 are cancelled as the airline has ceased trading,” it said. Inside the dim, under-refurbishment departures area, Hazel Henson and Ann Johnson sat by Starbucks, waiting for flights rebooked with other operators. “We arrived this morning just before four o’clock,” said Henson, 47, who had left home at 2am to catch a Monarch flight with her husband. She said that when they arrived there was no warning that their trip would not go ahead and the Monarch information desk was closed. “We checked in yesterday and when we got here this morning, just after four o’clock, my husband got an email saying thank you for checking in.” Henson said her husband had paid about £270 for replacement flights with easyJet after airport staff initially told them to go home. They are due to fly at 5pm, 11 hours after arriving at the airport. “We didn’t want to ruin our holiday, and that’s why my husband has paid for more flights.” Johnson, 75, from Luton, and her husband spent £450 buying new tickets to Faro with Ryanair. “I’m angry with Luton airport because there was no information from them. They just left us. No tannoy; nothing,” she said. Cabin crew attended a meeting about the collapse of their former employer on Monday morning at the airline’s training centre, close to the Monarch head office near Luton airport. After the meeting Natasha Slessor, five months’ pregnant and wondering how she will support her baby, said she and colleagues heard the news in an email sent at about 3.30am. “I woke up devastated, reading the emails, came to work this morning and we all met in the crew room and just waited to find out what’s going on,” she said. The collapse had been unexpected for most Monarch workers, Slessor said. “We’ve been kept in the dark for a long time. We had emails about speculation: one moment we were going long haul, we were flying to New York, we were going to be OK. “They didn’t tell us anything, they kept us in the dark. We’ve been working all this time and put in overtime, and now we haven’t got a job.” Another crew member, who preferred not to give her name, said workers were devastated: “It’s absolutely the end of an era. It’s like losing family, everybody knows everybody at Luton. It’s a nightmare. What are we going to do now?” Jayne Deacon, 29, from Manchester, booked flights to Barcelona with Monarch for the end of October as a birthday treat for her partner after her original booking with Ryanair was cancelled due to pilot rostering issues. Deacon, who works for a travel company, only booked her flights with Monarch five days ago: “We’ve ended up cancelling the birthday trip as the cost to fly with other airlines is too much. “My partner also experienced the same bad luck when her Christmas flights back to Spain were cancelled with Ryanair and rebooked with Monarch. “It’s potentially put me off low-cost airlines, and next time I book anything I’ll put it on a credit card.” Doug and Lynne Webster from Derbyshire flew out to Italy on Saturday only to read about Monarch’s troubles the next day. Doug said: “I can’t believe we were allowed to get on the plane. The pilots and crew must have known about this before the flight took off.” Doug Webster, who works as an IT engineer and is in Lake Garda on holiday, said: “It’s ruined our week. We’re both unwell and had we known we wouldn’t have travelled. Our booking is Atol-protected, but we booked a private transfer to Verona airport for our return flight on Saturday and we don’t know what will happen yet. “We have had no communication from or with Monarch. It’s disgraceful. It’s not about money but trust and honesty. Someone must have known there were some serious issues prior to our departure given that one day later they tanked.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/03/build-for-the-future-tech-enhanced-toys-for-all-ages","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T11:32:44Z","webTitle":"Build for the future: tech-enhanced toys for all ages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/03/build-for-the-future-tech-enhanced-toys-for-all-ages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/03/build-for-the-future-tech-enhanced-toys-for-all-ages","fields":{"headline":"Build for the future: tech-enhanced toys for all ages","bodyText":"Barely a week goes by now without some dire prophetic warning about how all our jobs will be replaced by robots and how none of the jobs our children will do even exist yet. But, given coding is now part of the curriculum for children as young as five, it’s surely about time they started inventing their own livelihoods, the young slackers. Fortunately, toys and games that encourage and develop coding skills for kids are seeing something of an explosion, with even the big brands getting in on the act, such as Lego with its new build-and-code Wall-E-esque robot. However, plenty of parents still fret about “screen time”– as if all screen time is equal, just passive activity akin to lying semi-comatose on the sofa mainlining a Netflix boxset (something reserved for us grownups, clearly). Yet a search of any toy store, game-reviews site or Amazon’s Shop the Future toy section reveals coding apps, games and physical toys can all help develop skills that children will almost certainly spend their rest of their lives using. So why not give them a head start, especially when many of the newest games are fun, absorbing and considerably more educational than Paw Patrol on repeat. These games now start with a very young demographic – from Fisher Price’s pre-school Code-a-Pillar to Learning Resources’ Code and Go robot mouse, ideal for the first years of primary school. Then there are Dot and Dash (programmable robots) and the Kano sets, which allow children to build their own computers and then program them to do anything from turning the lights off to reinventing Pong. Or Sam Labs’ Curious Cars, which let you build vehicles (the set is compatible with Lego, so you can soup them up good ’n’ proper) and program them to race. Some of these games can be on the pricey side, but plenty combine stealth Stem-learning with a lot of fun for a good birthday- or Christmas-present price – such as the K’nex fairground-ride building set (£39.99). The pictures on the box look dauntingly complex, but the instructions are simple and straightforward and, as with Lego, children as young as seven should be able to assemble it with minimal help. In place of plastic bricks, you have rods, connectors and spacers – and a battery-powered motor – but the same pieces can be used to create different models (three, in this set). The idea is to get kids to grips with the technology and engineering that would go into building real fairground rides. This means that once the model is assembled, there is still more to learn – about speed, space, time and the relationship between them when it comes to whizzing around a fairground ride screaming your lungs out. K’nex systems exist purely in the real world, but plenty of games now use a hybrid of app and physical interaction. Beasts of Balance (£69) is a combination of board game and app. The purpose is to build a tower of the (physical) animal pieces as high as possible, on top of the battery-powered base. That base is a reader that scans for the pieces and feeds back to the app via Bluetooth, bringing them to life on the screen. As you play on, you can combine or crossbreed these animals into new, ever more fantastical creatures. The game is designed to encourage cooperative play, although children (or is that just mine?) seem to have an uncanny ability to turn it into a competition, no matter how many times you utter the words: “Teamwork, kids!” It’s hard to say which appeals more to parents or kids – adding a social element to an app, or adding technology to a board game – but the result is hugely enjoyable and absorbing, one of those rare games that is genuinely enjoyable for all ages. Osmo (£89.99 for all three games) has a more straightforwardly “educational” slant. It comes with a few different games but all work in the same way: you set up your tablet on the base provided. Configuration is easy and quick. Clipping a small mirror over the camera at the top allows the game to magically (well, it’s magic if you are five) see what you are doing with the physical pieces. In the Tangram game, you have a variety of simple shape pieces that you must put together to match the one on the screen. Once you are successful, the app moves on to the next. There are varying levels of difficulty, encouraging dexterity, hand-eye coordination and spacial awareness. Numbers adds a more straightforward, or recognisable, gameplay element to the learning. Again, the kids arrange physical tiles – in this case, dots and digits – to make numbers, pop the bubbles on screen and explore the app’s underwater world. It gives maths the kind of creativity and fun that I wish my own lessons had had. Words is a spelling and vocabulary game, essentially hangman with a picture clue and without any jeopardy. It is ideal for the early primary school years – you need some grasp of spelling after all . Another “enhanced” app/gadget for younger children getting to grips with their letters is the nicely designed Marbotic. There’s a nod towards traditionalism with the wooden letters, but it all interacts with the app to encourage greater attention span in those easily distracted small fry. If you want to encourage an interest in the natural world, yet know all too well that a butterfly net and a kids gardening set just isn’t going to impress under the Christmas tree, then consider a microscope. The heavy, black, impossible-to-focus apparatus from biology lessons of yore has been updated, thank goodness. Learning Resources’ handheld microscope (£50) is a brilliantly designed, robust piece of kit. It’s as simple as it sounds: you plug it into a computer via USB and just hold it over the object, and the image appears. 54x magnification is more than enough to amaze kids with the details of their lunch/a bug/a leaf/their own fingers. Of course, nothing is more appealing to children than the gadget that really isn’t designed for them, or has a screen you have given them strict instructions not to get their grubby little fingers all over. By far the most entranced my own kids have been with anything technology-related recently is watching the seeds in our Miracle Gro garden (from £69.95 to £269.95) emerge. These indoor garden devices allow you to grow your own herbs, tomatoes, salad leaves and more in a tiny, soil-free garden. The integrated lights mean it doesn’t matter how cold or damp or dark the corner you can find for it is, and it all happens so quickly you can almost see the plants growing. The screen gives tips on whether you need to add water or plant food, and where in the life cycle of the plant you are. Other than that, you need do very little – except watch, amazed at the speed of growth. Never mind boring old cress, for kids to be able to see basil go from microscopic seeds to pesto on their pasta in two weeks is pretty magical. This is one gadget that proves technology can foster growth both physical and developmental."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/02/b-review-royal-court-london-guillermo-calderon","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T22:50:08Z","webTitle":"B review – Guillermo Calderón unmasks the motives behind political protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/02/b-review-royal-court-london-guillermo-calderon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/02/b-review-royal-court-london-guillermo-calderon","fields":{"headline":"B review – Guillermo Calderón unmasks the motives behind political protest","bodyText":"The Royal Court’s international programme, long supervised by Elyse Dodgson, gets little publicity. It is good, therefore, to find Guillermo Calderón, a Chilean dramatist nurtured by the programme, making his main stage debut with a 90-minute play about people we loosely dub “terrorists”. But, while his work initially generates a Pinteresque tension, it becomes over-explanatory. One of Calderón’s aims is to explore the mixed motives behind political protest. He introduces us to two young, hapless female anarchists, Marcela and Alejandra, who can’t even lie convincingly to their neighbour, Carmen, and who seem nervous about undertaking their first disruptive mission. But the stakes are raised with the arrival of the veteran José Miguel, who not only supplies the women with the vital bomb but who also exposes their essential naivety. For much of the action, all three characters are hooded, but once they abandon their disguise we quickly grasp that they are driven by contradictory purposes. Despite the horrendous urban violence of recent times – for which a French philosopher coined the term “metrocide” – Calderón manages successfully to convey the self-aggrandising absurdity that often lies behind terrorist acts. The three activists here speak in code so that the four-letter word “bomb” is either known as “B” or “the cheese”. One of the women is even asked to defecate into a can to make the nails surrounding the bomb lethally infectious. This, in turn, reveals the gulf between the two women who want to make a non-violent, anti-capitalist protest and José Miguel who seeks to perpetuate his longstanding war on society. The problem is that, having revealed his characters’ muddled intentions through action and dialogue, Calderón suddenly gives them long, explicatory monologues resembling confessional arias. Calderón’s text indicates a simple staging with no more than four chairs and a table. Sam Pritchard’s production, however, comes equipped with a realistically dilapidated set by Chloe Lamford of depressing ugliness. Aimee-Ffion Edwards and Danusia Samal clearly establish the strange innocence of the self-styled anarchists in contrast to the destructive fury of Paul Kaye as the bomb-maker, and Sarah Niles is suitably ambivalent as the intrusive neighbour. But while Calderón’s play, translated by William Gregory, is enlightening about the varied impulses behind urban violence, it spells out its intentions too vociferously. • At Royal Court, London, until 21 October.

Broadly speaking, it describes openness to the immense human diversity of the world. But the concept is supple. The word combines the ancient Greek “xenos” — meaning “alien” — with the word for “attraction”.” Last year in my exhibition “Nachbarn” (Neighbours), I plowed into the tangled territory of intercultural relations. The works I made for the St Annen Museum in the German city of Lübeck revisited the town’s Nazi past. I actively engaged its Christian, Turkish Muslim and Russian Jewish communities. To my surprise, the story that I told turned out to be more about affection and kindness than fear and hatred. Before Nazi hatred destroyed it, a Jewish community thrived in Lübeck, living comfortably alongside Christian neighbours. As do Turkish Muslims today. The St Annen Museum came to me because of my history working with museum painting collections and my interest in Jewish identity. As it happens, the museum is right next door to one of the rare 19th century synagogues that wasn’t destroyed during Kristallnacht on 9 November, 1938. The museum’s director, Dr Thorsten Rodiek, thought I might have ideas about the odd situation of this Jewish religious building right next door to a 16th century former convent that one hundred years ago became a museum of medieval Christian altarpieces. Not to mention the three mosques now located close by. Among the art I view as exemplifying xenophilia, I’d include Picasso’s African sculpture-infused painting, Valerie Jaudon’s Islamic-inspired minimalist abstraction, Pieter Hugo’s photographs of South Africans with albinism, Joyce Kozloff’s sinophile series, China is Near. But what does xenophilia look like to you? Is it thrilling to encounter someone whose life is unknown to you? Does it tickle your imagination, set your fantasies whirring? Or are you so ashamed of or worried about your own culture’s dominance that you lurch toward the so-called Other to calm yourself?

The sight of Barley, hungry and struggling to keep warm, stopped her in her tracks and she decided to try to help. Her husband, Peter Wilkinson, said: “My wife was a very compassionate woman. “She did voluntary work helping old people. She was very chatty and made people feel at ease. She wouldn’t see harm come to anybody; she liked to help people.” Tracey Wilkinson, a full-time mother, drove Barley to the offices of the council and helped him secure a place in a hostel. “Things developed from there,” said Peter Wilkinson, a 47-year-old businessman. “He had no money and food, so Tracey would organise breakfast and dinner for him every day, be it at our house or somewhere else.” He recalled how, over dinner one night at the Wilkinsons’ home, Barley told the family about his aspirations. “I can remember quite vividly him saying to me: ‘I just need somebody to give me a chance, I need somebody to give me a lucky break.’” Peter Wilkinson gave Barley labouring work at one of his businesses in Newport, south Wales, and it went well for five months. “But in September 2016 he went off the rails. He started taking drugs and, as a business, we had to let him go. It was very amicable. He said at the time that he had started taking drugs because his mother had died,” he said. This was not true; Barley’s parents had died when he was a boy. He was brought up by foster families and prompted a police appeal when he went missing aged 13. After leaving school, he drifted from address to address in the West Midlands, and from job to job, until he became homeless. The Wilkinsons lost contact with Barley after he was sacked. But early one morning in late October or early November 2016, Peter Wilkinson found Barley sleeping in the corner of their driveway. “I got him up and made him some tea. I believe he’d been on the streets and had been badly beaten. He was covered in bruises and my wife decided that as a family, we should help him again,” he said. They managed to find him council accommodation and he did odd jobs for the family to earn cash. He spent Christmas Day with the family. “He wrote my wife a card saying ‘To the mother that I never had’. He treated her a bit like a second mother,” Peter Wilkinson said. In the new year, Barley secured full-time work and a new flat. He would come for dinner once or twice a week. In March, he shared a curry and a couple of bottles of beer with Peter Wilkinson. “I dropped him off back at his flat that night. And that was it for about three weeks: the next time I saw him he was sticking a knife into my shoulder,” he said. On the day of the attacks, 30 March, Peter Wilkinson had taken the dog for a walk and was surprised to find no sign of life on his return home. “I can remember looking through the window thinking that everybody must have overslept,” he said. In fact, Tracey Wilkinson was dead upstairs, and the couple’s 13-year-old son, Pierce, was fatally wounded. “I opened the back door and as I did it, [Barley] jumped out, all dressed in black, with a big knife held over his head, and started stabbing me,” Peter Wilkinson said. “I grappled with him and he stabbed me six times – twice in the face, twice in the abdomen and twice in the back. “He said ‘Die, you bastard’ as he stuck the knife into me. I said to him after he’d stabbed me, ‘Aaron we tried to help you’, and he stuck the knife into my stomach and said ‘Die, you bastard’.” The attack stopped and Peter Wilkinson heard the sound of his car being driven off. He dialled 999 and staggered into the garden, collapsing into a patio chair. “I remember talking to the person on the other end of the phone and realising that I was actually dying. The next thing I remember is ambulances turning up and hearing helicopters overhead, and the police arrived,” he said. “I told the other ambulance men to go into the house. I remember one coming out behind me and saying ‘One deceased and one in cardiac arrest’. I knew at that point that I had most likely lost Tracey and Pierce. Then I was taken to the QE [Queen Elizabeth hospital Birmingham]. I thought I was going to die.” The couple’s daughter, Lydia, now 19, was away studying at Bristol University. After hearing there had been a stabbing in Stourbridge, she searched online for news of the incident and saw an image of her house surrounded by police tape. Police officers broke the news to her that her mother and brother were dead, and her father was seriously injured. As she was driven to Birmingham, Lydia said she began to think about planning a triple funeral. “They took me to critical care. I saw my dad with countless machines hooked up to him, a lot of doctors around his bed. I remember thinking I was going to lose him as well, because nobody could survive that,” she said. “I held his hand, much like I am doing now, and said that I was there, and he opened his eyes and looked at me, and then went back unconscious. I thought that was going to be the last time I saw my dad alive.” Lydia had to identify the bodies of her mother and brother. “I went in and I just stayed with my mum and brother for a while, and said that I was sorry I couldn’t protect them, and I stroked their hair. I just stayed there because I knew that was going to be the last time I saw them in my life. From that point on, it was a case of I lived every day for dad,” she said. Peter Wilkinson spent 11 nights in hospital and the news of his loved ones’ deaths was broken to him. “The physical scars will heal; the mental scars never will,” he said. Paying tribute to her mother, a former champion ballroom dancer, and brother, Lydia said: “My mum was stunning. She had a beautiful personality. She was just very caring and helpful. “I was due to come home the day after and pick out a dress for my university ball. To have my best friend taken from me at such a young age is a hardship I would never wish on anyone. “Pierce was just handsome, funny, clever. He was very personable, everybody made friends with Pierce. He could make friends in an empty room. “They loved to watch films. Their favourite pastime was on a cold winter’s day to get under a blanket together and watch films such as Star Trek or Star Wars. They both shared a passion for the Carry On films.” Lydia and her father have moved back to the family home. Peter Wilkinson said: “It’s our home and, after taking so much from us, we couldn’t possibly have it that he would take anything else. We love the house. It was very much a family home that we had built and renovated ourselves, and we like being there.” Lydia has resumed her studies in biology. “We are determined to not let this take away any more of our life,” she said. “I’d like to be a researcher and do medical research, to continue the help and support that my mum would give to people. By researching things like cancer and Parkinson’s disease, I hope to give back to people and continue her legacy,” she said. Her father said: “My wife cared for others and it’s just so tragic that after trying to help people and to help Aaron, that he should turn on us in this way for no apparent reason.” During police interviews, Barley, 23 at the time, refused to say why he had attacked the family. “There’s no motive, there is no explanation,” said Peter Wilkinson. “My personal feeling is that he’d lost his job, he lost his flat. And he decided that because his life was going bad ways, he was going to take it out on the people that had cared and looked after him. I wish we had never met him – I wish my wife had never set eyes on him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/oct/05/uber-tfl-black-cabs-whats-missing-from-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T06:23:25Z","webTitle":"It’s not about the black cabs: what’s been missing from the TfL v Uber debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/05/uber-tfl-black-cabs-whats-missing-from-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/oct/05/uber-tfl-black-cabs-whats-missing-from-debate","fields":{"headline":"It’s not about the black cabs: what’s been missing from the TfL v Uber debate","bodyText":"In the immediate aftermath of Transport for London’s decision not to renew its licence to operate in London, it must have seemed to Uber that events were going its way. Not for the first time, a regulator had attempted to stand in its way, and the company had turned to its tried-and-tested playbook. Uber deployed representatives in the media to say London was “closed to innovative companies”. It briefed newspapers that Khan had rejected multiple requests to meet. It submitted a public petition with more than 500,000 signatures to the mayor; another 20,000 emails from Uber drivers were sent to him directly. Uber thought it was locked in a popularity contest – but TfL doesn’t care about being popular. Now Sadiq Khan has backed TfL, and Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has publicly apologised for the company’s mistakes and flown to London for a private meeting with the TfL commissioner, Mike Brown. It is shaping up to be a real test of Uber’s tendency to push the boundaries of regulation. In the course of its aggressive worldwide expansion, the company has become astute at leveraging public opinion, controlling the narrative, and driving wedges between transit regulators and the political bodies, or individuals, they report to. In part, this strategy works because politicians are naturally more susceptible to the pressure of negative publicity than regulators – but as with everything at Uber, it serves a narrative purpose as well. A meeting with the person in charge tells the public that you are special. Once that precedent has been set, it is hard for a regulator to reassert the status quo. Therein lies Uber’s problem in London, where TfL runs something of a dictatorship. While it regularly meets with the London Assembly, TfL is not accountable to it, answering only to one person: the mayor. Sadiq Khan’s swift confirmation of support for TfL not only robbed Uber of the opportunity to drive a wedge between politician and regulator, it left the company with few other political options. The last time its right to operate in the city came under serious threat was in 2015, when then-mayor Boris Johnson proposed tighter regulations against private hire. Earlier this year it was revealed that David Cameron and George Osborne had both lobbied on Uber’s behalf, and the mayor had backed down. Though there is no evidence that it was directly sought by Uber, Theresa May’s condemnation of TfL’s decision suggested a similar intervention from above. She said Khan had “damaged the lives of those 3.5 million Uber users” and put tens of thousands of jobs at risk with his “disproportionate” response. “Yes, there are safety concerns and issues for Uber to address,” she said. “But what I want to see is a level playing field between the private firms and our wonderful London taxis, our black cabs, our great national institution.” The prime minister’s words were hardly likely to sway Khan given the political gulf between them. But they also exposed that May didn’t really understand the position he and TfL were setting up to defend. As the #boycottblackcabs backlash to TfL’s decision went to show, neither did many others. TfL’s battle against Uber has never been about sticking up for black cabs, no matter how it has been framed. The industry certainly does not like Uber for skirting too close to the “ply for hire” (respond to hailing in the street) regulations that distinguish between taxis and private hire operators. It had been lobbying TfL to not renew Uber’s licence for months. Although TfL has regulated the taxi trade since 2000, it has never been its defender. In fact, its perceived ambivalence and unwillingness to do so has long been a point of frustration among London cabbies. What TfL cares about is keeping London well-regulated, moving and safe. Critically, that desire extends beyond cabs; it covers buses as well. Addison Lee, the last major minicab firm to make waves in the capital, learned the perils of interfering with the bus network. London taxi drivers had long alleged that Addison Lee was skirting the boundaries between private hire and taxi operation when in 2012, the company’s then-chairman John Griffin instructed his drivers to defy the law and drive in bus lanes. TfL leaped into action. An injunction was issued. The firm appealed, the case went to the European Court of Justice, and TfL prevailed. Addison Lee had been reminded that it wasn’t special – and it could indicate how TfL’s battle against Uber might develop as it appeals the decision in court. The stakes are high, as are the number of lawyers involved. But TfL has an excellent record and will go into this well prepared. If anything, the size of the legal and public challenge suggests that perhaps TfL believes its case to be even stronger than it is letting on. As the outstanding £95m of congestion charge penalties from London’s foreign embassies goes to show, TfL doesn’t fight legal battles it’s not sure it can win. The mayor – a lawyer himself – is also unlikely to have hitched his star to TfL’s unless he expects it to rise. Being prepared to make unpopular decisions and stand up to multinationals says “statesman” rather than “politician” – but only if you can pull it off. In reality, this conflict is exactly as it’s been billed: TfL is concerned that Uber has broken regulations in a city where roads are already under pressure, where private hire driver numbers have almost doubled since 2014. But it’s bad news for those who see TfL’s decision as a triumph for black cabs, or even as a victory over the gig economy. Uber may have had its knuckles rapped, but Lyft or any number of competitors who behave more subserviently could step into the gap – and there are no signs of a crackdown on other giants of the gig economy such as Deliveroo. In some ways it augurs well for Uber’s own future in London, too. TfL’s issues aren’t ideological, they’re pragmatic. If Uber is smart enough to realise this and find a way to make concessions, then a new licence will follow. TfL isn’t asking Uber not to be a bully – it just wants it to acknowledge that TfL is a bigger one.

The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 29.27 points or 0.39% at 7468.11, helped by a weaker pound in the wake of disappointing construction figures France’s Cac closed up 0.32% at 5367.41 Germany’s Dax was closed for the Unity day holiday Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.02% at 10,257.5 But Italy’s FTSE MIB slipped 0.12% to 22,784.82 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.8% to 752.44 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 69 points or 0.31%. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Some breaking UK news, and the Royal Mail is facing a strike threat, its first since it was privatised. Workers voted emphatically in favour of industrial action over pensions, pay and jobs. The Press Association reports: Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) backed walkouts by 89% on a turnout of 73% of the 110,000 balloted. It passed the threshold in the Government’s controversial Trade Union Act, under which ballots need a 50% turnout for industrial action to go ahead. The CWU believes it is a “watershed” moment for unions as well as the Royal Mail, which it has accused of following a “relentless” programme of cost-cutting to maximise short-term profits and shareholder returns. The union accused the company of “unilaterally” closing its defined benefit, or final salary, pension scheme, with new entrants going into an “inferior” scheme which will leave them in “pensioner poverty”. The union is also in dispute over pay and issues such as delivery office closures... The CWU Postal Executive will meet later this week to determine the next steps in this campaign and any potential strike dates. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, is also contemplating a weaker pound: The Dow has punched to new all-time highs today, as the optimism sparked by last week’s Trump tax plans continue to drive outperformance in US markets. On a day devoid of any major economic data points from the eurozone and US, the focus has been on the UK in the wake of this morning’s construction PMI which plummeted into contraction territory. With London house prices shrinking, and business confidence suffering, it comes as no surprise that completed construction jobs are failing to be replaced with new orders as investment dries up. Tomorrow’s services PMI should give us a good idea of how the fourth quarter could shape up, and if the manufacturing and construction readings are anything to go by, we are likely to see further deterioration in both economic data, and in turn, the pound. As Wall Street hits new highs, the UK market is edging higher, mainly due to weakness in the pound. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says sterling weakness could continue: Despite having little to push it higher beyond its own momentum, a 50 point rise saw the Dow cross 22600 for the first time in its history. The FTSE, on the other hand, was at a rather less impressive on month high, climbing past 7450 – a repeated ceiling for the index in the past couple of months – thanks to a sterling-inspired 0.4% increase. Talking of the pound, its miserable, manufacturing and construction PMI-dampened start to October continued this Tuesday. Cable fell 0.2%, taking sterling below $1.327 for the first time in almost 3 weeks. Against the euro the currency’s losses were even greater, the pound dropping 0.4% to a 2 week, sub €1.127 nadir after the European Parliament claimed that ‘sufficient progress has not yet been made’ on the EU divorce bill, preventing progress to the next round of negotiations. Whether or not the pound can find a tourniquet for its losses may be dependent on Wednesday’s services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to nudge higher, from 53.2 in August to 53.3 in September; however, as we have seen twice already this week, those estimates have a tendency to be off the mark. If the services sector – the main fuel for the UK’s growth – shows the same signs of slowdown as the manufacturing and construction PMIs, then the pound may be in line for another pummelling. Some disappointing data from the US. The Institute for Supply Management’s current business conditions index for New York fell to 49.7 in September, down from 56.6 in August. A reading below 50 signals contraction. And if you think you’ve heard the words “record US stock market highs” many times before in the past few months, well, you have: DING DING! The US stock market has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading in New York. Today’s report also highlights how Canada has gone on a household debt spree since the financial crisis, while American families have managed to cut their borrowing burden. Canada’s economy has posted sparkling growth earlier this year, while house prices have also soared. If the IMF are right, there could be a reckoning at some stage.... The IMF also warns that the least wealthy are being dragged deeper into debt, and will suffer the most if there is an economic crisis. Today’s report says: Lower-income groups tend to be more vulnerable. Household surveys confirm that, within countries, the share of lower-income households in total debt has grown. These households typically have higher debt-to-income, higher debt-service-to-income, and higher debt-to-assets ratios, which makes them more vulnerable to adverse shocks than higher-income households. This chart shows how a build-up of household debt can create a vicious circle: As you can see....once banks cut back on lending, asset prices fall, households default on their debt, hitting bank capital reserves, leading them to cut back on their lending etc etc. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the rise in consumer debt risks destabilising the global economy. In a new report, the IMF flags up that increased borrowing can stimulate short-term growth, but it also creates financial instability. The Fund says: On average, an increase in household debt boosts growth in the short term but may give rise to macroeconomic and financial stability risks in the medium term. Real GDP initially reacts positively to increases in household debt, as do consumption, employment, and house and bank equity prices. However, after one or two years, the dynamic relationship between debt, GDP, consumption, employment, housing, and bank equity prices turns negative. Higher household debt is associated with a greater probability of a banking crisis, especially when debt is already high, and with greater risk of declines in bank equity prices. The warning comes in the analytical chapters of the Fund’s Global Financial Stability Report, which have just been published. In an accompanying blog post, senior IMF Nico Valckx spells out that increasing the ratio of household debt actually leads to lower growth, over say five years. The effect is particularly stark for advanced economies, as this chart shows: Valckz says that debt “greases the wheels of the economy”, letting people make an important big purchase and finance it over time. But too much grease ends up bunging the wheels of growth, he explains: At first, households take on more debt to buy things like new homes and cars. That gives the economy a short-term boost as automakers and home builders hire more workers. But later, highly indebted households may need to cut back on spending to repay their loans. That’s a drag on growth. And as the 2008 crisis demonstrated, a sudden economic shock – such as a decline in home prices – can trigger a spiral of credit defaults that shakes the foundations of the financial system. More here: UK readers will be well aware that the cost of living in Britain has risen sharply in the last year, following the slump in the pound after the EU referendum. Now, a new report has highlighted that inflation in the UK is outpacing other advanced nations, including Germany, the US and France. My colleague Richard Partington explains: The UK has the highest inflation rate among the world’s top economies, in the latest sign the Brexit vote is contributing to a squeeze on living standards. The increased cost of importing food and fuel is pushing prices to rise at a faster rate than anywhere in the G7 group of leading global economies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The UK is only behind Turkey, Mexico and the eastern European states of Latvia and Estonia in the club of 35 developed nations. The annual growth in prices in the UK jumped to 2.9% in August from 2.6% in July, equalling a four-year high in the consumer price index (CPI) reached in May earlier this year. That outstrips the average 2.2% growth in prices across the OECD for the same month. Britain’s construction woes haven’t dampened the mood in the financial markets. World stock markets remain at record highs today, following last night’s rally on Wall Street. In London, the FTSE 100 has hit a one-month high, up 9 points at 7448. Big exporters are benefitting from the drop in the pound this morning. Hundreds of workers in Norwich face an uncertain future after drinks company Britvic announced plans to shut its factory in the city. The group is planning to move production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot drinks from the Norwich factory to sites in east London, Leeds and Rugby by 2019. The 242 people who work there will be offered “redeployment opportunities at other sites”, says Britvic, or support to find a new job elsewhere. The site is co-owned with consumer goods giant Unilever, which makes Coleman’s Mustard there. Unilever says it is now reviewing its own options; that could mean that production of the fiery condiment ends after two hundred years. Local MPs and business leaders are rallying around, according to the local Eastern Daily Press. Labour’s Clive Lewis tweets: Chloe Smith, MP for Norwich North, says: “This is very sad news and many constituents will be very anxious about this possible closure. At this stage, I am urging the company to make every support available to those workers.” David Montague, chief executive of London housing association L&amp;Q, is urging the government to help British construction and provide some Brexit certainty. He fears that building firms will struggle badly if they lose access to workers from overseas. “Today’s figures are worrying for the construction sector and at a time when more housebuilding is needed than ever before. “We need assurance that an appropriate immigration policy will keep the doors open to skilled overseas talent and that there will suitable investment in training at home. Without this, the figures we are seeing today - will undoubtedly worsen. “L&amp;Q and many others in the sector have skilled workforces, strong partnerships, access to land and the financial strength to deliver very ambitious plans. What we need now is political and economic certainty.” Britain’s builders aren’t the only people worrying about Brexit. The Bank of England has flagged up another concern this morning; that UK businesses could struggle to borrow after Britain leaves the EU. That’s because European banks who currently operate branches in Britain may have to upgrade to fully fledged subsidiaries after Brexit. If they don’t, they might not be allowed to operate. That would cut the amount of lending offer, the BoE fears. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: Companies from European Economic Area countries – EU member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway – provide about 10% of lending to UK businesses and would need to reapply for authorisation to operate in Britain after it leaves the EU. In its latest update on potential risks to financial stability, the Bank of England said: “The risk of disruption to wholesale UK banking services appeared to be slightly higher than previously thought, given that a number of EEA firms branching into the UK were not sufficiently focused on addressing this issue. More here: Richard Threlfall, head of infrastructure, building and construction at KPMG has a very gloomy take on today’s construction PMI: “This reading is significantly worse than expected and shows that economic uncertainty continues to have a serious impact on the construction industry. Construction is an economic bellwether, so the concern will spread well beyond the sector. “There is a clear downturn in commercial construction, which is likely to continue. This is because new orders are dropping off, hitting pipelines. Infrastructure output also appears to be in decline and contractors will be concerned about a lack of new projects. “The one relative bright spot in the data was housebuilding, but even this lost momentum and there are fears that demand will drop off if interest rates rise.” The pound has dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar in over two weeks, down 0.2% at $1.325. Sterling has also shed 0.3% against the euro, to €1.128. The fall in UK construction activity last month has come as a nasty shock to the City. Traders are concerned that the British economy may be weakening, in the face of Brexit worries and tensions at the heart of the UK government. Earlier today, a senior German MEP actually urged Theresa May to sack foreign secretary Boris Johnson following his comments about Brexit. Manuel Ortiz-Olave, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, says this political tension is not good for sterling. “Today UK construction sector survey data fell into negative territory for the first time in more than a year. The data comes at a terrible time considering how poorly the latest rounds of macro data have performed, and also now that a potential political crisis is brewing in the Tory party. A combination of last Friday’s downward revisions of GDP data, the increase in trade deficit and consumer debt, coupled with yesterday’s poor manufacturing survey data are now followed by construction pessimism across the board. Today’s PMI report also shows that British builders are suffering from the weak pound. Input cost inflation hit a seven-month high in September, meaning construction firms were forced to pay more for raw materials. Jason Robinson of trade credit insurer Euler Hermes fears that British building companies could suffer a “domino effect” of failures in the months ahead. “Access to skilled labour is among the chief concerns within the construction industry. Without clarity on Brexit negotiations and in particularly EU workers’ rights, uncertainty will weigh on contractors’ pipelines because of the lack of concrete details over the future economic landscape. “While the performance of housebuilders has been positive in 2017, an increase in failures across construction appears unavoidable as contracts become more difficult to get over the line and tendering becomes keener. High profile profit warnings continue as legacy contracts take their toll on margins.” “Payment delays from large contractors could have a significant impact down the supply chain, and firms will need to be vigilant to avoid being caught in a ‘domino effect’ of failures.” Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says the government could help the building sector. “In infrastructure, contractors are hoping for further positive news in November’s Budget following this week’s announcement of more funding for the north of England’s rail network. Despite uncertainty, the UK is still on the whole viewed by overseas funders as a good place in which to invest their capital. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, agrees that Brexit is hurting builders: “This contraction in the construction sector wasn’t welcomed by the market, and certainly won’t be welcomed by the Brexit negotiating team and those at the Conservative Party conference. Brexit uncertainty has returned to the fore and is back to weighing down on sterling, as a weak pound increases the cost of imported materials. The fall in commercial construction activity last month suggests companies are stopping investing in new shops, offices and factories. That’s a worrying sign for economic growth, says Chris Williamson of Markit. The tumble in the UK construction PMI last month shows that anxiety over Britain’s exit from the EU is hitting the economy. So argues Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. Brock said: “A dismal picture of construction emerged this month as the sector showed signs of worsening business conditions across the board. With the biggest contraction in overall activity since July 2016, and a drop in new orders, optimism was in short supply. “Respondents pointed to obstructive economic conditions and the Brexit blight of uncertainty, freezing clients into indecision over new projects. Even housing, the stalwart of the construction sector stuttered with a dwindling performance, but civil engineering was the biggest victim falling to its weakest level for four and a half years. UK housebuilding growth slowed to a six-month low, while civil engineering and construction both shrank in September. Tim Moore of Markit, who produced today’s report, explains why activity hit a 14-month low of 48.1 last month: Commercial development has been the worst performing category in recent months. Construction firms attributed falling volumes of commercial work to subdued business investment and reduced risk appetite among clients, linked to heightened economic and political uncertainty. “Civil engineering work decreased at its fastest pace since April 2013, which prompted concerns from survey respondents about a near-term lack of new infrastructure projects. “House building slipped down a gear in September, which highlighted that fragile confidence has spread across all three key market segments. Some firms suggested that the loss of momentum for residential construction reflected worries about the outlook for ultra-low mortgage rates and less upbeat demand expectations.” Breaking! Britain’s construction sector is contracting, fuelling fears that the UK economy is slowing. The Markit construction PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, fell to just 48.1 in September. That’s down from 51.1 in August. Crucially, it is below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. In other words, activity across the building sector is shrinking, for the first time in 13 months (just after the Brexit vote). This is much worse than anyone in the City expected (economists predicted a reading of around 50.0) Builders interviewed by Markit say they suffered a drop in workloads due to “fragile confidence and subdued risk appetite” among clients, especially in the commercial building sector. Brexit uncertainty appears to be a big factor. Markit says: Survey respondents widely commented on a headwind from political and economic uncertainty, alongside extended lead times for budget approvals among clients More to follow.... Greggs is hoping that a new ‘all day breakfast’ wrap, and a Thai chicken soup offering, will lure customers into its shops this autumn. The bakers chain reports that its breakfast sales have “grown strongly” in the last three months, helping total takings to rise by 8.6%. Gregs is also cracking on with its expansion programme; planning to open up to 150 stores this year, and close 50. It’s already opened 98 since the start of January. Shares have risen by 1% so far today. Shares are nudging higher in Europe, with the Stoxx 600 index up 0.1%. Spanish shares are also up slightly, following yesterday’s selloff after the Catalan referendum. In London, the FTSE 100 is flat. Ferguson is leading the risers, though, up 3.6% after announcing a £500m share buyback alongside a sharp rise in profits. Ferguson (previously called Wolseley) has been benefitting from a tighter focus on the US housing market. World stock markets have hit a new peak, following yesterday’s rally on Wall Street. The MSCI All-Country World Share Index has nudged 488.33 points, indicating that equities have never been more expensive. This rally was led by America, where the New York stock market hit fresh record highs last night. The Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices all began October with new gains. Investors were cheered by the news that US factory growth hit a 13-year high last month, indicating that the US economy is expanding at a solid pace. Investors are also clinging to optimism that Donald Trump might push some growth-friendly measures though, as Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, explained (via CNBC): The economy is doing well despite the storms. A lot of folks don’t think there will be tax reform but the market thinks there will be. If that happens, it will be a big boost to the economy.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We’ll be taking the health of the UK building sector this morning, when Markit releases its latest Construction PMI report, for September. Britain’s builders aren’t having a great time right now, with Brexit uncertainty deterring some clients from committing to new projects. In August, the construction PMI fell to a one-year low of 51.1 (50 = stagnation). And there are fears that growth hasn’t picked up yet. The City consensus is that September’s construction PMI dipped, to 51.0. Anything lower than that would indicate that builders are struggling. That would be a concern, after Monday’s manufacturing PMI showed a factory slowdown. Royal Bank of Canada expect a weak construction report.... Our expectation is for a dip to 50.3 from 51.1 which would come on the back of an undershoot of expectations in the manufacturing PMI yesterday. However, what really matters is tomorrow’s services PMI as that will give us more of a sense of where the risks lie with our 0.2% q/q growth forecast for Q3. We’ll also be tracking the latest development around Monarch Airlines, following its collapse yesterday. Uber could also be in the news; its chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has flown to London for talks with the transport authority over the loss of its licence in the capital. Plus, we have results from baking firm Greggs (which has posted a 5% rise in like-for-like sales this summer), and heating supply firm Ferguson (whose profits are up 25% over the last year).

A quick recap before I go. The Jets romped home 4-1 against the Mariners on the back of a hat-trick from Roy O’Donovan (playing against his old team). As we’ve just seen, Sydney just edged Victory who, of course, they beat in last season’s grand final. Sydney are now undefeated against Victory in their past six fixtures. Have a good night. See you next time. As Big Blues go, this wasn’t up there with anything that might star Jean Reno. Understandably, perhaps, both teams looked rusty and many final touches were heavy - though man-of-the-match Ninkovic was an exception. Though their match-winning goal relied on a little luck, Sydney edged the affair and had they been more clinical they would surely have won with more comfort. Victory could never quite fashion a clear-cut chance, partly because Berisha was kept quiet. Victory missed their big three absentees but Muscat will have seen plenty to keep him encouraged. It’s all over. Sydney win back to back ‘Big Blues’ in Melbourne for the first time and get their premiership defence off to a good start. 90 min + 5: Victory continuing to press but they don’t need this surely: Donachie picks up the ball 30m out and seeing the defence holding off he puts his head over it and blasts it goalwards. But it’s high and wide. That should be it. 90 mins + 2: Victory pouring forward... and here’s Geria getting to the byline and cutting the ball back to Williams on the penalty spot! He chests it down for a shot but his touch is too heavy and the ball is booted clear before Williams he can strike. He holds his head in his hands in frustration. 90 mins + 1: There will be five minutes of added time. Still time for Victory to get something from this. 90 min: Berisha attempts a spectacular scissor kick inside the box but it hits Buijs and there are claims for a penalty. Was it hand ball? Replays suggest not. It hit Buijs square in the face. 89 min: Carney tries to hold the ball but he’s surrounded by four Victory players, with no teammate in sight. Sydney are understandably not pushing many men forward. 88 min: Sydney slow things down with another sub: Bobo is off, Seb Ryall comes on. 87 min: The crowd tonight is 24,804. Good numbers but they are lost within Etihad. 86 min: Victory’s corner is cleared but it drops to Deng who attempts to hammer an equaliser from 20m out but there’s too much traffic in the way. 85 min: Victory holding possession but it’s deep in their own half. But here’s the young bloke, burning Retre on his outside before his attempted cross is cleared for a corner by Brillante. 83 min: O’Neill’s studs stick in the turf and he goes down very awkwardly. The Victory fans boo him figuring he’s wasting time. 81 min: Into the last nine minutes, Muscat makes a bold change bringing on a 17-year-old, winger Christian Theoharous for Mitch Austin. 80 min: Sydney have had their chances to wrap this one up. 78 min: A bottler of a ball from Ninkovic splits two defenders and finds Carney is acres on the right but his cross into the middle doesn’t have enough pace on it allowing Williams to take it off Bobo’s toes. 77 min: Ingham scoots down the right wing and looks for Berisha in the box but Wilkinson intervenes like a teacher snaffling a message smuggled between two students. 75 min: Another change for Sydney, Adrian off for Carney. He had his moments, Adrian, but he was well handled by Victory. 73 min: Sydney press down Melbourne’s left flank with Simon looking to get on the end of a through ball. But with his lolloping running style he can’t haul it in. 70 min: End to end now. This time it’s Berisha in space after a toed ball ahead almost surprises him. On the edge of the Sydney D, his first touch lets him down and Redmayne cleans up. Had Berisha controlled that he would have had time to measure a shot. 69 min: After withstanding a Victory push, Sydney get numbers forward and Bobo, in space, squares to Matt Simon who should have shot but instead cuts inside on his right. By the time he does that the chance has gone. 65 min: Changes from both coaches. For Victory, George is replaced by Josh Hope. Sydney then make a change of their own with Brosque replaced by Matt Simon. 62 min: Ingham lets a firmly struck through ball to pass between his legs which allows Geria to race ahead and get a cross in. After a rebound it falls to Berisha who spins on a dime but his left-foot shot from close range is blocked. 60 min: It’s all Sydney and they really should be two up... but here’s Ingham attacking the Sydney goal. From a George corner Ingham leans back to get a head on it and he does well to steer it goalwards, but it’s just over the bar! This is more like it. 57 min: Two great chances for Sydney! First Adrian sends in a wicked ball with the outside of his left boot that Bobo only needs to touch to head home, but the attention of Deng saves the day. Moments later, a canny Ninkovic flicks the ball into the box and into the path of Wilkshire. His first-time left foot shot looks bound for the bottom right corner but for the diving save of Thomas! A breakthrough but, in fitting with the match, one lacking polish. Not that Sydney will give a hoot! The goal was made by Wilkshire who exchanged a one-two with Bobo before scooting free down the left. Looking up he swung in a perfect cross that found the head of Brosque who was just six-yards out with only Redmayne to beat. But Brosque made a hash of it and could only get a fleeting touch but that sent it onto the boot of an unsuspecting Deng who saw the rebounding ball trickle over the goal line! 52 min: It’s very tight in midfield, a scrum of sorts, and here’s Donachie grabbing Bobo by the shirt and flinging him to the ground. 50 min: Bobo skips inside his man and, from outside the box, tries to curl one into the top right corner. He can’t keep it down, however. 49 min: Adrian, in the Victory box, tries to square a ball but Williams blocks it, giving away a corner that amounts to very little. 46 min: The Victory v Sydney FC game has recommenced. An early second half goal would do wonders for this game which has yet to drag fans to the edge of their seat. Basketball: In Sydney, meantime, the Kings have been defeated 105-96 by the Adelaide 36ers in their NBL season opener. After a strong first two quarters Sydney faded down the stretch, perhaps a consequence of playing an exhibition game against the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City six days ago. Supercars: This from AAP: McLaughlin claims Bathurst record, pole The “Lap of the Gods” officially has a new owner at Mount Panorama. Fourteen years after Greg Murphy entered Supercars folklore on the mountain, fellow flying New Zealander Scott McLaughlin has created his own legend by setting an astonishing lap record to claim pole position for Sunday’s Bathurst 1000. The Supercars series leader clocked a stunning two minutes, 03.83 seconds in Saturday’s top-10 qualifying shootout, eclipsing his own mark set in Friday’s practice by 0.31 of a second. The Ford gun became the first driver to crack the 2min:04sec barrier on the unforgiving mountain. And the 24-year-old was the first to break the Mount Panorama lap record in a top-10 shootout since Murphy’s famous “Lap of the Gods” in 2003. As Victory and Sydney let the words of Kevin Muscat and Graham Arnold wash over them like a bucket of Gatorade I shall take the time to update you on some of the day’s other action. Cricket: News just in that Aussie skipper Steve Smith has had to leave the tour of India with a shoulder problem. Before you get your knickers in the kind of knot you need the prongs of a fork to untangle, serious injury has apparently been ruled out and he is expected to be fit for the approaching Ashes series. Closer to home, AAP report that “Queensland cricket captain Usman Khawaja has scored his first half-century since January as he tries to reclaim his Australian Test spot for the Ashes.” “The left-hander top scored with 85 off 97 balls as the Bulls amassed 6-309 in their one-dayer against Victoria at North Sydney. “Khawaja was dropped after Australia’s first Test loss in Bangladesh last month, the sixth time that has happened to him in his 24-Test career. “Saturday’s knock was his highest score at interstate or international level since he made 79no at the start of the year in the third Test win over Pakistan at the SCG. “He and Test opener Matt Renshaw set up the Queensland innings with a stand of 149 after Victoria won the toss.” All square at the break. Both teams have enjoyed good periods but clear chances have been few and far between. It hasn’t been one of the best halves of Big Blue football I’ve seen but here’s hoping it picks up. 45 min + 1: Ninkovic knocks over Broxham inside the right wing giving Victory a chance in the shadows of halftime. Although George’s free kick finds a teammate he can’t direct his header on the Sydney goal. And that will be that. 44 min: Any chance of a goal before the break? This game could do with one. 42 min: Ninkovic rises for a defensive header and Geria comes through his back of him to head the ball forward. Free kick Sydney, says the ref, as Ninkovic lies on the grass rubbing the small of his back. 40 min: Brosque (I think it was) rises to meet a George corner. He does well to get a head on it but he can’t keep his attempt down. 39 min: After a nice build up, Retre should have had a shot from the right edge of the Victory box but he decides to square the ball instead and turns it over. That was Leckie-like in that Socceroos game v Thailand. Shoot farken! 37 min: George takes a corner for Victory after another Austin run was cleared but Sydney make easy work of dealing with it. Moments later Valeri finds the ball rolling nicely into his path and he figures ‘Why not have a crack from distance?’ So he has a crack from distance and you’d swear the ball was a helium balloon the way it shoots up up up into the air. He smiles wryly, as well he should. 35 min: Ninkovic on the left wing back heels to Wilkshire overlapping. He crosses into the box but Deng heads clear. 33 min: Brosque, 25 metres out, allows a ball to bounce over his shoulder and he attempts a bold first time shot, not unlike Tim Cahill’s debut A-League goal last year. He got hold of it okay but sends it wide of the Victory goal. 30 min: After some nice one-touch football from both teams, Adrian sends a long curling cross into the path of Wilkshire, but he’s met on the byline by Geria and the Victory man causes Wilkshire to send his first time shot from a tight angle out for a goalkick. 28 min: Sydney enjoying a spell of possession in good territory, one that ends when Brosque’s attempt at a shot is cleared and the Victory counter down Geria’s wing. 26 min: From deep Ninkovic threads a pearl of a ball through the heart of Victory’s defence and into the path of Adrian who beats the offside trap. Adrian takes a touch which takes him wider than he would have liked and his shot is blocked on the near post by Thomas. In hindsight he may have decided to hit that before taking a touch. 23 min: Sydney push deep into Melbourne’s half before Victory win the ball back and, despite enormous pressure, play out from the back with a series of one-touch passing. one mistake could have let Sydney in. That made me think of a man walking a tight rope. 21 min: Donachie faffs about and Brosque dispossess him, toeing the ball forward to Bobo who has only the keeper to beat. But before he has a chance to raise a boot in anger the whistle goes for offside. Fair call too. 19 min: Under pressure from Berisha, Redmayne clears to the left wing where Geria beats Wilkshire to the ball. Wilkshire’s follow-through upends Geria and it’s a free kick but no yellow. George, who seems to be the designated dead-ball kicker, curls an in-swinger into the box but he has too much on it and Redmayne makes an easy catch. 17 min: Sydney have shown very little so far. Perhaps they are deliberately easing into this one, trying to draw Victory out with the intention of hitting them on the break. 15 min: The stats say that Victory have had 27% of possession in Sydney’s final third. By comparison, Sydney have spent just 10% of the game in Victory’s final third. 13 min: Berisha slides a lovely pass into the path of a speedy Austin. He runs towards the Sydney box but by the time he raises his left boot for the shot Buijs nips in to knock the ball away. He really should have powered off a shot, Austin. 11 min: Buijs knocks over George from behind but he’s not called for a foul. Muscat stands on the sidelines with his arms raised and his mouth open like the Luna Park clown after he’s had his balls pinched. Juggling balls, that is. 10 min: Bobo shows his skills, juggling the ball over the head of a defender to get himself into space. Retre then shows his skills whipping in a cross from the right and finding the advertising hoardings behind the goal. Not his best work. 8 min: Sydney’s O’Neill passes the ball straight into the path of Mitch Austin who has time but can’t steer the ball into the path of Berisha, who had a clear run to goal. A let off for O’Neill and Sydney. 7 min: Nice close up of Berisha who has that customary intense look in his eyes. It’s a little helter skelter but mostly he looks like someone who’s trying to focus on something far off in the distance. 5 min: Early days, of course, but Victory dominating possession and field position so far. But here’s Sydney journeying into Victory territory... until Buijs overhits a wide pass into touch, Retre unable to haul it in. 4 min: Leroy George takes the corner and Redmayne punches clear, though not convincingly. Victory recycle and George crosses nicely to Rhys Williams who heads wide in traffic. 3 min: Victory skip down the right flank but Ingham finds Wilkinson in his way and the Sydney left back boots it to row Z. Corner. 1 min: Berisha kicks off the 2016-17 grand final rematch with Victory, in navy blue, running right to left on my screen. Sydney are, of course, in sky blue, their shirts looking resplendent without a big sponsor mucking up the aesthetics. Odd that the reigning double-winners have no major shirt sponsor but geez it’s nice seeing an unsullied kit. Both teams are out on the pitch, including Victory debutant Leroy George (formerly of PSV). For Sydney, Adrian Mierzejewski (herewith known as Adrian, for obvious reasons) makes his A-League debut. He had a great debut for Sydney against City in the FFA Cup so there are big hopes for the former Al Sharjah winger. Kick-off imminent... It’s a lovely evening in Melbourne so you’d expect the crowd to be good for this one, higher than the impressive 12,044 who turned up at Gosford this afternoon to watch the Mariners play the Jets. Victory v Sydney needs little promotion but the teams’ respective coaches did their bit this week, with Graham Arnold suggested Victory were a bit thick for signing players likely to be called up for international duty (in reference to Mark Milligan, James Troisi and Kosta Barbarouses who are all unavailable for Victory tonight). In reply, Kevin Muscat suggested Arnold was guilty of “archaic” thinking – the kind that was holding the A-League back. No matter who’s corner you’re in, I think we can all agree that it’s not ideal when the A-League schedules games during international week. Obviously the Socceroos being forced into a play-off caught them off guard but it does seem rough on Victory tonight that they’ll be missing three key players. Evening folks, Paul Connolly here, following on from Jonathan Howcroft who, as always, has made a minute-by-minute report look easy. I’ll be taking you through to stumps, or at least the conclusion of the imminent Melbourne Victory v Sydney FC match from Docklands in Bleak City. To that end, here are the teams for tonight’s big clash, which will be the fifth time the clubs have faced off in the opening round (four draws so far). Victory Sydney FC Blimey, what a rollicking match that was. The final scoreline is harsh on the Mariners who played their part in a terrific contest but the Jets were too deadly in the final third and romped home convincingly. Asdrubal opened the scoring early and the home side looked tidy with their revamped line up but very quickly defensive frailties became exposed. After a debatable O’Donovan penalty got Newcastle back in the game the floodgates opened with the Irishman completing his hat-trick before halftime and the best two goals of the night arriving after the break. There was a lot to like from Ernie Merrick’s first match in charge. O’Donovan, Petratos and Vargas all looked dangerous while the partnership of Topor-Stanley and Boogaard clicked from the off. For Paul Okon there can be optimism in his his team attacked, especially the form of Daniel De Silva, but they were a shambles at the back and will need to improve rapidly on that showing if they’re to honour the preseason cheer. That’s all from me for now. I’ll hand you over to Paul Connolly to take care of the evening’s blockbuster. The Jets have lift-off. The Mariners keep pushing but the Jets have defended their box admirably and somehow keep finding body parts to stick in the way of crosses and through-balls. A long clearance to O’Donovan sees the Irishman torn between going for goal and wasting time by the corner flag. Eventually he passes inside to Petratos who arrows a bullet across his body and across the diving Glover into the far corner from 12 yards out. An emphatic full stop to this engrossing fixture. 88 min: Bingham with a good chance but his header from Josh Rose’s cross slides wide. 87 min: De Silva, who has looked sharp all night without a standout moment to cap it all, shoot from range that Duncan does well to claim low to his right. 85 min: The home fans are starting to make their way home, presumably wondering how they have found their team three goals adrift of their local rivals. Plenty of attacking possession just hasn’t been converted into chances whereas the Jets have been incisive going the other way. Final change of the night has Kantarovski replaced by Cowburn. You guessed it - another corner for CCM. Poor delivery though and Duncan collects easily. From the eventual clearance O’Donovan flings a wicked crossfield pass that gives the debutant Champness space to run at the Mariners defence. Leading one way then the other he jinks his way into the penalty area and fires unerringly beyond Glover for a miraculous introduction to the A-League. Take a bow. 80 min: Deflected strike from Hiariej gives the Mariners yet another corner but they can’t capitalise and the Jets take their time clearing their lines. Asdrubal, now subbed, looked tidy on debut. There was lots of nice interplay leading up to the penalty box, but for that final pass he was not on the same wavelength as his teammates. He still poached an early goal though, and there’ll surely be more to come. Joey Champness comes on for the Jets, replacing Nabbout. 77 min: Petratos - who has been excellent for the Jets - tricks his way past Rose, stands up the cross but the offside O’Donovan heads over when Nabbout was better placed behind him. Curious double sub from Paul Okon as Liam Rose and Josh Bingham come on for Central Coast in place of Asdrubal and Anthony Golec. 74 min: Asdrubal earns another free-kick - it appears to be one of his core skills, as does going down theatrically - but the shot from the edge of the box clips the wall and away to safety. 73 min: It’s still helter-skelter out there, but at a slightly lower tempo. Both sides are playing with such width and the surface is so poor there is space everywhere and one-on-one contests with players so unsure of their first touch. Very decent crowd here in Gosford, and they’ve been treated to an enjoyable contest. 70 min: Chaos in the Mariners defence. Brama’s robbed by Ugarkovic in midfield and his delightful crossfield pass is contested by Glover and Golec before it’s eventually forced clear. Typically, the clearance ends with the Mariners creating a couple of half-chances, such is the openness of the game. For all their neat interplay the Mariners haven’t really created many clear cut chances. 67 min: Georgievski has been excellent for the Jets, getting forward often and taking the game on. His persistence sets up a good spell of attacking pressure for Newcastle, including a free-kick from just outside the box on the left hand side that Petratos swings in dangerously and it only just evades the far post and the head of Topor-Stanley. Appiah has been replaced by Buhagiar. Speed for speed down the attacking right. 64 min: This game remains relentlessly open. Both sides continue trading attacking blows, largely down the flanks, with moves only breaking down with toe-poked clearances or smuggled interceptions. Hardly any play has been at walking pace or lateral. 62 min: Vargas’ A-League debut lasts 60-minutes as the Venezuelan makes way for Wayne Brown. Nabbout is the latest Jet into the referee’s notebook after leading with his arm in a heading contest. 59 min: The Mariners are probing, dominating possession and now starting to force the Jets back into defensive territory. Hiariej has a strike from range that Duncan deals with without fuss but the Jets keep giving the ball away cheaply, inviting more pressure. That is until Petratos shows superb skill and vision to set Newcastle going the other way and earning his defence some respite. 56 min: Connor Pain’s grown into this game after a quiet start but the Jets look well organised defensively. His cross from the left is well claimed from Duncan to deny the onrushing De Silva. 53 min: The Mariners have enjoyed plenty of possession since half time, and again De Silva is at the heart of it. Some lovely interplay with Asdrubal earns a free-kick on the edge of the box that’s played quickly and ends with Pain blasting a cross that evades allcomers. Going forward Central Coast are very pretty to watch. 50 min: The Jets have another goal chalked out with a late flag from the linesman ruling out a tidy Nabbout finish. Newcastle aren’t attacking relentlessly but whenever they go forward they look like scoring. 48 min: Central Coast have the first attack of the half and it ends with their ninth corner (the Jets have yet to be awarded one) but Baro’s header flies over the bar. The pitch now entirely in shadow at Central Coast Stadium, highlighting the bare patches and sandy areas, that is simply unacceptable at the start of a new season. The message from the Jets at half-time was not to rest on their laurels, from the Mariners to push even higher up the field. Unlikely to end at this scoreline, you’d think. 46 min: Second half underway in Gosford. No changes at the break. HarryofOz is right. Entertaining first half between the Mariners and the Jets, far better than the fare that Citeh and the Roar dished up last night. That was terrific fun. After Asdrubal opened his account early for the Mariners, Roy O’Donovan took over, bagging a hat-trick to send the Jets in front at half-time. The first was a dodgy penalty, the next two both against the run of play, but Newcastle won’t care. Excellent entertainment, and hopefully more to come after the interval. 45+1 min: Into injury time at the end of the first half and Ugarkovic is the second Jets player in the book for over-committing to a challenge on Josh Rose. For some reason Rose is also booked a short while later. No idea why, but nobody minds some spice in a local derby. 43 min: Better from the Mariners who earn their eighth corner of the half. Before it’s taken Georgievski becomes the first player into the book for the afternoon as a few players come together inside the Newcastle box. 41 min: For all the praise I’ve given Central Coast going forward, defensively they have been abysmal. There are gaps all over the place for Newcastle to exploit and individuals are losing on-on-ones in midfield and defence. O’Donovan roasted Golec for the third goal but there are culpable Mariners everywhere for the ease of the Jets’ direct incursions. There is the hat-trick! Brilliant cross from Nabbout down the left, O’Donovan finds space and glances the header beyond Glover into the corner. What a half. First-half hat-trick from the player who’s moved to his former club’s bitter rivals. 35 min: Hat-trick! No! O’Donovan offside - actually it was Nabbout in the build up before the Irishman’s finish. Very similar move to the second goal, deep cross, played back across the face of goal and O’Donovan on the spot to tap in. It won’t count though. The Jets are growing into this game and they’re doing it by playing with extreme width in possession, stretching the game and exploiting the quality of Petratos and Vargas. Georgievski was also part of the last attack, bursting forward from defence. 32 min: Football’s great sometimes. The Mariners have looked the more impressive of the two sides but the Jets lead. The visitors are starting to enjoy some possession now too, Petratos and Vargas linking up well in attacking transition. The latter cutting in from the left menacingly but his shot is blocked off the boot. O’Donovan at the double! The Jets break, the Mariners don’t defend in numbers and a good crossfield ball to Nabbout at the back post is fed back to O’Donovan and his shot on the turn is a scruffy, bobbling, mongrel of a shot, and a bounces into the empty net. 26 min: Brama is running the midfield, just in front of the Central Coast back four, spreading passes left and right. The Mariners can sense Appiah is hot down the right and they’re looking to feed him whenever they can. His pace earns another corner but the visitors defend it, and a succession of crosses, well. I undersold Tom Glover during that previous Jets attack. He did splendidly to keep Newcastle at bay. 22 min: HOW DID NEWCASTLE NOT SCORE!? Newcastle have hardly had any meaningful possession - and that includes their dubious goal - but they should be ahead. Superb inswinging free-kick from the left by Petratos is headed from point-blank range against the post and then butchered by Boogaard who fluffs his line five-yards out with the goal gaping. 19 min: Another Mariners chance, and again created by De Silva. Excellent movement off the ball and shifting passes nimbly from the youngster ends with Asdrubal in space on the edge of the box and his shot is only half-saved by Duncan before eventually being pushed out for a corner following a scramble. Asdrubal has started well too. Along with his fortunate goal he’s presented exactly as you would expect a number 9 to, and whenever he moves towards the ball the three nippy forwards around him shape to get in behind. Very nice to watch. 17 min: De Silva has started superbly, which bodes well for the season ahead, and the Socceroos. His involvement in rapid ball movement is eye-catching, as his turn of pace and willingness to run at the Jets defence. He has license to attack knowing the Dutch pair of Brama and Hiareij are minding shop behind him. 15 min: What’s immediately evident is the efforts of both sides in attacking transition to move the ball quickly and commit bodies in support. It means turnovers invite the opposition to attack through a vacant midfield, making for a helter-skelter afternoon. 12 min: This is ace. The Mariners haven’t dropped their heads, racing straight back at the Jets. The pace of De Silva and Appiah is giving the Jets nightmares and they force more corners, from one of which Baro forces Duncan into a smart save at his near post. My madcap 3-3 prediction is well on its way. The Mariners have deserved their early lead after flying out of the blocks but Newcastle reply almost immediately. O’Donovan’s first involvement in a Jets jersey is to cut in from the left, invite contact from Baro, and hit the deck theatrically. Think Fabio Grosso and Lucas Neil. The ref points to the spot, VAR isn’t interested, and O’Donovan smashes the ball high to the left of Glover to open his account against his former club! More tidy play from the Mariners, who have settled the better of the two sides. Appiah’s pace down the right gets in behind the Jets and his cross is a tester that’s put behind for a corner. De Silva then makes good ground, bursting down the left, forcing another corner. Lovely delivery from Hiariej, defended abysmally and it hits Asdrubal on his thigh and dribbles over the line for the opening goal. No idea why, but the pitch looks very ropey. Bobbly, sandy, and not at all what you’d expect from the opening game of the season. 2 min: Ooof! Welcome to the A-League Asdrubal! From the kick-off the Spaniard tries to dribble the length of the field trick but Kantarovski isn’t having any of it, upending him unceremoniously. From the free-kick Alan Baro wins the header and forces Jack Duncan into a flying save. Offside though, so it wouldn’t have counted. Bright start from the home side though. Underway in the F3 derby! Both sides are lining up in very similar 4-2-3-1 formations, by the way. Solid spines, lively front lines, should lead to plenty of open football. The teams are out. The home side in yellow and blue striped shirts, blue shorts and socks. The visitors are in their away strip of all white with slashes of blue and red. Decent crowd building in Gosford, which is nice to see. Obviously a local rivalry helps and there’s a fair smattering of Jets blue among the Mariners yellow. Kick off just a couple of minutes away now. I’m surprisingly excited about this one. Lots of newbies to get to know, two upwardly mobile teams with plenty to prove, and two coaches committed to attacking football. No idea who’s going to win, and I hate predictions, but if you’re forcing me I’ll go for a madcap 3-3 draw. Some match facts, courtesy of Opta: The Mariners ran out to a 2-0 victory when these teams met last, snapping a seven-game winless streak against the Newcastle Jets. This will be the third time in A-League history that a season has opened with an F3 Derby in the opening round, with the Mariners undefeated across those fixtures (W1, D1). Indeed, the Mariners are undefeated in their last five season openers (W2, D3), and have only opened two A-League campaigns with a loss in the competition’s history (2006/07, 2011/12). Newcastle have failed to find the back of the net in each of their last five games played away from home, conceding a total of 14 goals across that span. The Mariners blasted 10 goals in the 15-minute period immediately after half-time last season, the third most of any team in the competition behind Sydney FC (12) and Perth Glory (11). Only Sydney FC (2) conceded fewer goals in the final 15 minutes of games last season than Newcastle Jets (6). Central Coast Mariners (336) and Newcastle Jets (377) conceded fewer fouls than any other teams in the competition last season. Andrew Nabbout lead the Newcastle Jets in goals scored (8), assists (4), and touches in the opposition box (89) last season. Last night was a bit of a lacklustre opening to the season featuring two sides still trying to figure themselves out. Melbourne City will be delighted with the three points, after not playing anywhere near their best. Brisbane Roar showed some brightness but, as expected, there was a disjointed look to an XI that has been gutted in the offseason. I didn’t foresee either seriously challenging Victory or Sydney this season, and nothing I saw last night changes that. Perfect conditions for football in Gosford. There’s a light southerly, it’s cool, around 18C, and Central Coast Stadium is as pretty as ever. Plenty of new Jets on display also with Georgevski, Topor-Stanley, Vargas, Petratos and O’Donovan all stepping out in Newcastle blue for the first time in the A-League today. Expect the latter of that quintet to receive a pretty tasty reception. Although, the hostility of anything shouted down from the stands in Gosford is undercut by the giant sauce bottles, palm trees, and general air of living in the most comfortable of environs, so I wouldn’t expect O’Donovan to bat an eyelid. Plenty of new faces in the Mariners line-up with Glover, Golec, Hiariej, Asdrubal, De Silva, Baro and Brama all making their A-League debuts, along with the returning Josh Rose slipping back into place like a pair of favourite old Ugg boots. Time to focus on football for the time being though, and the team sheets are through for the day’s first fixture. It’s shootout time at Bathurst. We’ll bring you updates from the mountain at half-time and full-time of the F3 Derby. Oh, in case you were wondering, Winx made it 21 in a row - without trying. A bit of cricket news coming through with Australian skipper Steve Smith returning home early from the T20 series in India with a sore shoulder. It’s not considered serious and should not hamper his Ashes preparations. On that subject, the ECB has announced Ben Stokes will not travel to Australia with the rest of the England squad following a police investigation into a late night incident in Bristol. Paceman Steve Finn has been added to the touring party. It promises to be a fascinating season ahead. Plenty of optimism on-field, plenty of distractions off it. As always, get in touch if you have anything you want to contribute. We can make this an A-League Q&amp;A if you like, look ahead to the new season, laugh at everyone’s predictions, look back at last night’s opening match, shred some nerves considering the Socceroos... Email me at jonathan.howcroft.freelance@guardian.co.uk or tweet me via @JPHowcroft. Good afternoon and welcome to another Saturday sportwatch. The A-League is taking centre stage today, beginning with the second match of season 13 - Central Coast Mariners hosting Newcastle Jets from 5.35pm. It promises to be an intriguing F3 derby between these local rivals with both undergoing serious squad rebuilds over the offseason. Both look to have recruited well and both can be expected to perform better than in recent campaigns. You can read more about what’s gone on at both clubs since last season here: Later this evening a repeat of last year’s thrilling grand final takes centre stage when Sydney FC journey to Melbourne Victory. Kick off there is around 7.50pm. Both those sides again look to be title challengers and with plenty of needle between the coaches in recent days expect the blue touch paper to be lit on the latest A-League campaign tonight. You can read my thoughts on the best two clubs in the competition here: We’ll also keep you up to date with anything else going on in the world of sport with the annual pilgrimage to Bathurst dominating Australian motorsport and some significant races early in the spring carnival. Jonathan will be here shortly.

The answer, quite simply, is nothing. Kenneth Cook’s lean and muscular 143-page novel still packs a hell of a punch. And like Ted Kotcheff’s masterful 1971 adaptation – Australian cinema’s pièce de résistance of small-town outback films – it has aged only in the manner of fine wine. The core themes are perhaps more relevant than ever – from small-town parochialism, to the city-versus-rural divide and Australia’s heavy drinking, heavy gambling culture. In their attempts to find a reason (other than the obvious cash/ratings grab) to readapt Cook’s page-turner when Kotcheff’s film did the job so brilliantly, director Kriv Stenders and screenwriter Stephen M Irwin switch the timeline to the present day for Network Ten’s new two-part miniseries. In the process they demonstrate how little contemporisation means for this particular text. How different does a debilitated, single room school in the middle of dirt-clogged nowhere look now compared with one in the 60s or 70s? How different does a shabby, rundown small-town pub look? Or a country road? Or a stretch of sun-parched Australian desert? The answer, of course, is little or nothing at all. In other words: the themes of Wake in Fright don’t need to be updated as they are still achingly relevant. And much of the visual environment cannot be updated because key settings are more or less timeless. Therefore Stenders and Irwin (who recently collaborated on the ambitious but oversauced multicultural drama Australia Day) resolve to tinker around the edges. This is why the school teacher protagonist John Grant (Sean Keenan from Glitch) suddenly finds himself in a brand new, swanky modern house owned by Tim Hynes (Gary Sweet). As Hynes drives Grant through the streets of Bundanyabba (aka “the Yabba”) where Grant is marooned after losing all his money playing two-up, he ruefully explains that the mine has shut down. Though “things will pick up, mark my words”. One of the core questions in Cook’s book concerns why residents of the Yabba are so proud of their backwater, middle-of-nowhere locale, which city slickers regard as a shithole. This new adaptation fails to even propose an interesting answer. One was given by Cook himself who, curiously, wrote that the local people “are saved from stark insanity” by a shared belief that cold beer is a sign of progress. Another is explored in director Stephan Elliott’s underrated 1997 satire Welcome to Woop Woop. The ringleader of Elliott’s arid, titular town, Daddy-O (Rod Taylor) goes on a jingoistic rant in order to quell an attempt at uprising from a John Grant-esque outsider (protagonist Teddy, played by Johnathon Schaech). Daddy-O chastises the pollies and “wretched craniums” in Sydney’s Martin Place. By contrast, he describes the community’s far-flung desert home as: “Too fuckin’ dry. Too fuckin’ hot. Too many bloody flies. But it’s ours.” In Stenders’ new Wake in Fright, John Grant now encounters cartoonish drug dealers and lowlifes (Anna Samson and Lee Jones). These characters are underwritten and overacted and play a part in shifting the focus from cold beer as a sign of progress to a general thirst for mind-altering drugs. The ever-bankable David Wenham is police sergeant Jock Crawford (played in the film by Chips Rafferty, in his final performance). Caren Pistorius is the Yabba’s troubled nurse (and Grant’s sort-of love interest) Janette Hynes. Alex Dimitriades plays the Yabba’s fallen-from-grace, once resident doctor, Doc Tydon. When Doc, dressed only in an apron outside his caravan home, hands Grant a beer and some pills, describing them as “basically aspirin”, there is a hint that perhaps Tydon has been reimagined as a kind of Dr Gonzo Down Under. Dimitriades understands the necessary layers of his character: wearied, misanthropical and carnal, both sexually menacing and, in a bestial sort of way, enticing. The actor gets that difficult mixture right. But his rejigged Tydon belongs to an uninspiring digression from the original story, in which Grant’s interaction with the aforementioned lowlifes results in standard issue crime story plotting, a la on-the-run parties and menacing druggies. This reduces the impact of Grant’s downward spiralling trajectory, placing more emphasis on external forces. En route to Grant’s inevitable self-demolition, Stenders’ version crowbars in a traumatic backstory – as if acknowledging the psychological burn of the protagonist’s journey lacks a little heat this time around. Part of Wake in Fright’s brilliance is the posing of an almost Twilight Zone-esque mystery, about the menacing combination of forces that make the schoolteacher go loco. There’s the alcohol, the lack of money, the festering sense of desperation, the feeling of not belonging. And of course, the heat. In Cook’s novel, suicidal ideation and the taste of gun metal become an appealing thought because “there was nothing else to do, tomorrow offered no hope”. To get the fatalistic grimness of a line like that across, without wallowing in despair, is no easy task. A homicidally hot, stinky, sunbaked colour scheme would surely have helped. Alas, Stenders and cinematographer Geoffrey Hall (who recently shot Red Dog: True Blue) opt for a much cleaner palette. The new version looks bright rather than burnt, and lacks visual flavour. Some of that is made up for with a strong, supercilious, stiff-lipped performance from Sean Keenan in the lead role, whose casting was clearly influenced by Gary Bond in the original film (one can only imagine what a wilder choice, such as Aaron Pedersen, would have brought to the role). Keenan doesn’t reinvent or reinterpret the character, that’s for sure, though he was obviously never intended to. • Wake in Fright is showing on Ten from Sunday 8 October at 8.30pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/09/five-years-all-conquering-xi-jinping-china-heralds-its-leader-in-ecstatic-beijing-exhibition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T00:34:16Z","webTitle":"All-conquering Xi: China hails its leader in ecstatic Beijing exhibition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/five-years-all-conquering-xi-jinping-china-heralds-its-leader-in-ecstatic-beijing-exhibition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/09/five-years-all-conquering-xi-jinping-china-heralds-its-leader-in-ecstatic-beijing-exhibition","fields":{"headline":"All-conquering Xi: China hails its leader in ecstatic Beijing exhibition","bodyText":"When Soviet architect Sergei Andreyev designed the Beijing Exhibition Centre more than six decades ago, it symbolised the awkward alliance between Chairman Mao’s China and the USSR. In the autumn of 2017 it has become a monument to just one man. “Maybe he’s our idol,” grins Huang Xingchen, a 28-year-old policeman and one of thousands of Xi Jinping fans to stream into the 1950s expo hall since a show trumpeting the feats of China’s current leader opened there last week. Officially, the Five Years On exhibit – timed to mark the end of Xi’s first term in power – is a celebration of the advances China as a whole has made in that time. But Xi, whose supremacy will take centre stage when a key Communist party congress kicks off in Beijing on 18 October, is the undoubted star of the show. Scores of photographs of the 64-year-old strongman adorn the walls of the retrospective, split by Communist party curators into 10 thematic “zones” touting Xi’s purported triumphs in areas such as foreign policy, the environment and the war on corruption. Exhibition guides in burgundy flight attendant uniforms proffer anecdotes about the travails of a leader party officials now hail as their “core”. “I bet Theresa May would like to have an exhibition like that in five years time,” joked Roderick MacFarquhar, a Harvard University professor and former British MP who specialises in the nebulous world of elite Chinese politics. The Xi on show in the Beijing exhibition is a man of many friends and many talents. In one room, visitors find an image of Xi the international statesman rubbing shoulders with the Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip on Horse Guards Parade. In another, field commander Xi brandishes a Chinese assault rifle while touring a People’s Liberation Army garrison in Macau. Visitors also encounter Xi the conservationist: he caresses a baby elephant at a Zimbabwean wildlife sanctuary; he is applauded by environmental officials on the Tibetan plateau; he appears at the 2015 Paris climate conference, quoting Victor Hugo as he commits to fighting global warming: “Les ressources suprêmes sortent des résolutions extrêmes,” China’s green supremo declares. Xi’s conquests are also remembered in cross-stitch form. An embroidery entitled “The One Who Cares the Most” hangs from one wall, memorialising the day Xi dropped in on villagers in Hunan province to advance his crusade against poverty. Xi the wordsmith is also honoured. A towering bookshelf is stacked with copies of his tome on governance in Russian, Portuguese and Hungarian. “We all support him,” beams Xu Fangchao, 29, an HR worker who was admiring the collection with friends. Where there are no images of Xi, glass cabinets contain tributes to his reign. One features a bright yellow jersey sent to him by Pelé, Brazil’s footballing king. Another holds an American football shirt gifted by high schoolers during a US tour: the number “1” is written on its back next to Xi’s name in mustard lettering. Visitors to the exhibit – many bureaucrats attending at the behest of their Communist party work units – voiced support for their ruler. “He’s the best [ambassador for China] in history,” declared family planning official Hu Tongyu, 37, as he studied a portrait of Xi with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Lü Chunyan, 40, gave Xi’s war on pollution the thumbs-up. “The number of blue-sky days has been going up … [he] must be playing a leading role.” Chinese officials bristle at the suggestion Beijing is seeking to build a Mao-style cult of personality around Xi. But the exhibition’s relentless focus on the president only reinforces that impression. In the military section no fewer than 24 photographs of Xi are on display, as well as two large screens on which his image repeatedly appears. Xi’s words of wisdom also enjoy pride of place. “The party must ... unswervingly push forward the great project of Party building, making it stronger and more powerful – Xi Jinping,” reads one installation. MacFarquhar, the author of a seminal work on Mao Zedong, said the Xi showcase highlighted his determination to establish himself as a similarly transformative figure. “There can never be another Mao, but there could never be another Lenin. That doesn’t mean to say there can’t be another Stalin or a Xi. I’m not suggesting Xi will be a brutal murderer like Stalin. But that there can be a second great leader after the founding father, we have seen proof of that ... No leader in China since Mao has had the kind of treatment that Xi Jinping has.” Such is the buzz now surrounding Xi that there is growing speculation he will seek to stay in power after his second, and supposedly last term, ends in 2022. No obvious successor has emerged while Xi is expected to use this month’s conclave to write his omnipotence into the party’s charter, adding a body of Xi-related ideology that puts him in the same political league as Mao and Deng Xiaoping. “Maybe history … will give him much more time, for example maybe a third term; maybe a fourth ... Who knows?” Wang Wen, a pro-party scholar from People’s University mused suggestively. “I think most of the Chinese hope ... he can stay in the position [for] much more time.” That prospect will alarm liberals who accuse Xi of waging the most severe crackdown on free speech in decades. MacFarquhar said he was convinced it was Xi’s plan. “My view has long been that he does not intend to retire, ever – not until God does it for him. So what they are doing at the moment with this enormous propaganda campaign is to say: ‘This man has got the secrets for a modern China: standing up for itself in the South China Sea and elsewhere, dominating the world, eventually. And in order to do that he needs to stick around. Not just for a quick five years or 10 years – he needs to be there forever, guarding it.’” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/04/australian-cities-to-have-50c-summer-days-by-2040-study-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T17:00:05Z","webTitle":"Australian cities to have 50C summer days by 2040, study says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/australian-cities-to-have-50c-summer-days-by-2040-study-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/australian-cities-to-have-50c-summer-days-by-2040-study-says","fields":{"headline":"Australian cities to have 50C summer days by 2040, study says","bodyText":"Even if the Paris agreement to limit the global temperature rise to below 2C is met, summer heatwaves in major Australian cities are likely to reach highs of 50C by 2040, a study published on Wednesday warns. Researchers led by the Australian National University in Canberra used observational data and simulated climate models to assess future extreme weather events in New South Wales and Victoria. They examined what these weather extremes might look like even if the Paris agreement target of limiting climate change to a 2C increase is met. The lead author of the study, the climate scientist Dr Sophie Lewis, said Sydney and Melbourne could expect unprecedented summer temperatures of 50C under two degrees of global warming. The researchers concluded this could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5C, the best-case scenario target set under the Paris agreement, though the researchers did not project what temperatures could be expected under this reduced global target. “What previous studies have done is look at changes in the frequency of record-breaking temperatures so, for example, how much more common 40-degree days might be in future,” Lewis said. “Our study wanted to look at what the maximum temperatures in an extreme summer of the future would be. That is what we need to know to plan for the future. We know that two degrees of global warming doesn’t sound like much of an increase but it in fact will lead to extreme weather events becoming more severe.” Governments needed to start thinking about how the public transport system would cope during peak hour in extreme temperatures, how emergency departments would respond to increased demand from elderly people and others vulnerable to heatstroke, and how energy requirements would be met during peak temperatures, she said. “The only thing we can do to prevent these extremes is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and deeply as we can, though some warming is already locked in the system so we will see some increase in the extremity of temperatures regardless,” Lewis said. The research was published in the science journal Geophysical Research Letters. The Environment Victoria chief executive, Mark Wakeham, described the findings as “alarming”. “It’s preposterous that in the face of these warnings and clear signals that we don’t have a plan to cut emissions,” he told Guardian Australia. “Beyond that we must dramatically improve our built environment to cope.” Housing standards needed to be improved, including retrofitting older homes to make them more energy efficient and cooler, and more shade needed to be incorporated into cities and towns, he said. “We also need updated emergency management plans for extreme heatwaves,” he said. “This study by respected researchers confirms that climate change is not just an environmental disaster but it presents an enormous challenge to human health and the economy. “I don’t think we have any plans in place that would be adequate to withstand days of 50 degrees and it is another urgent warning to our leaders and all levels of government that we need a strong plan to cut commissions and deal with climate change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/03/qbe-insurance-predicts-costliest-year-in-global-industrys-history","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T03:26:23Z","webTitle":"QBE Insurance predicts 'costliest year' in global industry's history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/03/qbe-insurance-predicts-costliest-year-in-global-industrys-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/03/qbe-insurance-predicts-costliest-year-in-global-industrys-history","fields":{"headline":"QBE Insurance predicts 'costliest year' in global industry's history","bodyText":"QBE Insurance, one of the world’s biggest insurance companies, has warned 2017 will likely be the “costliest year in the history of the global insurance industry” after a series of catastrophic hurricanes in recent months. The Sydney-based insurer told shareholders to brace for a multimillion-dollar hit to its pre-tax profits and has increased its 2017 large individual risk and catastrophe claims allowance to cope with the surge in claims. John Neal, QBE’s chief executive, told the Australian Stock Exchange on Tuesday that Australia’s Cyclone Debbie from March and April, and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which hit the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean and Florida, as well the recent earthquakes in Mexico, had all affected QBE’s businesses. He said the global group had been forced to increase its 2017 allowance for large individual risk and catastrophe claims to $1.75bn, leading to a pre-tax hit to profits worth $600m. “The catastrophic events over the past month have caused a tragic loss of life and substantial and widespread property and infrastructure damage,” Neal said on Tuesday. “Our thoughts are with those affected by these devastating events including our customers, businesses partners and employees. “Given catastrophe losses to date, 2017 will likely prove to be the costliest year in the history of the global insurance industry.” Neal’s note to shareholders follows a landmark statement from Australia’s financial regulator earlier this year warning that climate change posed a material risk to Australia’s entire financial system and urging companies to start adapting. Geoff Summerhayes, from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, a former CEO of Suncorp Life, delivered the warning at the Insurance Council of Australia’s annual forum in Sydney in February. Summerhayes said much of the early policy thinking about climate change had focused on the risks to insurance firms and their exposure to losses from increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters but other groups, such as banks, asset managers and superannuation funds, needed to start adapting too. In June the Senate passed a motion for an inquiry into the threats and long-term risks posed by climate change to national and international security, and Australia’s readiness to mitigate and respond to climate-related crises in the region. Neal said on Tuesday that this year’s natural disasters had pushed the target for QBE group’s 2017 combined underwriting ratio on its insurance business (which drives the group’s underwriting profit) to 100%-102%. That means QBE is sitting somewhere between breakeven and a 2% loss on its top line at the underwriting level. However, a spokesman said QBE was still on track to generate investment returns of roughly 3% this year and those investment returns would offset the group’s underwriting performance, so QBE would still record a pre-tax profit this year. Neal said it was too early to speculate how much reinsurance and primary insurance pricing would rise as a consequence of this year’s natural disasters. QBE would stand to benefit from the price rises because much of its reinsurance programs had already been purchased for 2018. QBE’s share price fell 3.73% by lunchtime on Tuesday. Australia’s 2016 defence white paper said climate change would contribute to state fragility, which it identified as one of the six key drivers that will “shape the development of Australia’s security environment to 2035”. Late last year, an analysis by a coalition of the world’s biggest insurers found that the insurance “protection gap” – the difference between the costs of natural disasters and the amount insured – had quadrupled to $100bn a year since the 1980s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/03/banks-to-switch-to-real-time-payments-from-australia-day","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T01:43:01Z","webTitle":"Banks to switch to real-time payments from Australia Day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/03/banks-to-switch-to-real-time-payments-from-australia-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/03/banks-to-switch-to-real-time-payments-from-australia-day","fields":{"headline":"Banks to switch to real-time payments from Australia Day","bodyText":"That annoying wait for a payment to transfer to or from your account will soon be a thing of the past, thanks to most banks moving to real-time payments from 26 January. A group of 13 banks and financial institutions are collaborating on a new $1bn platform, run by a company called the New Payments Platform Australia (NPP Australia), which will enable much simpler, real-time transfers between accounts. The full introduction of the new system is scheduled to start when people return from their summer holidays but in the meantime it will be road-tested by bank staff, who will be able to make real-time payments between each other and their bank. The main advantage for consumers will be that they will not need to wait for their money as they do now – sometimes for 24 hours. But it will also allow transfers using much simpler identifiers than a BSB and account number, such as a mobile phone number or email address. Customers will be able to set their own more memorable identifier that is attached to their bank account, thus avoiding the problem of payments going astray due to a mistyped account number. There will also be more scope to include longer messages with transfers, which are currently limited to 18 characters. It is anticipated most Australian bank accounts will have access to the new system as soon as the platform launches. The project was triggered by the Reserve Bank’s 2012 review of Australia’s payment infrastructure, which noted that similar innovations were being introduced overseas. “The industry recognised the need for a plan that would support the future of payments. Already the Australian public has embraced electronic payment methods – chip cards (particularly contactless or “wave and pay” technology), BPAY, and new technologies such as smartphones,” NPPA chief executive, Adrian Lovney said. “But for this evolution to continue, our basic payments infrastructure needed an upgrade to enable a shift from batch or overnight account-based payments to immediate payments, and this could only be done with a whole of industry approach.” However, the introduction of real-time payments overseas has also led to an increase in fraud, prompting experts to warn that financial institutions would need to exercise increased vigilance. Lovney said the banks would need to put in place systems to track unusual transactions. “With any new system that is introduced, you will see a spike in activity as people think about how they can take advantage of the change but banks will continue to put in place systems behind the scenes to try to protect customers from being tricked,” he said. “While consumers and businesses can be reassured by the platform’s high levels of security, they will need to remain alert to the possibility of cons and scams that will continue to happen outside the platform’s control – like the recent spate of scams involving people impersonating the ATO, for instance ,” he said. Tom Godfrey, head of media at Choice said the consumer organisation supported real-time payments. “Anecdotally, we’ve fielded plenty of complaints from consumers about direct deposits taking too long to process, as if the bank was waiting for a cheque to clear, Godfrey, said. He said Choice had been reassured these transactions would be safe and secure and that banks would implement safeguards. “Transactions will be settled through the “Fast Settlement Service” provided by the Reserve Bank, and we’re told the system has built-in security features that we have no reason to doubt at this early stage,” he added. “ While financial institutions that connect to the NPP will be able to offer real time payments, we’ve been informed that there will also be ways to slow or stop these payments if fraud is detected.” Banks will soon begin promoting the new system to customers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/03/freedom-is-not-free-you-have-to-pay-for-it-the-messenger-podcast","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T02:40:22Z","webTitle":"'Freedom is not free, you have to pay for it' – the Messenger podcast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/03/freedom-is-not-free-you-have-to-pay-for-it-the-messenger-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/03/freedom-is-not-free-you-have-to-pay-for-it-the-messenger-podcast","fields":{"headline":"'Freedom is not free, you have to pay for it' – the Messenger podcast","bodyText":"‘Freedom is not free.

The 17 point margin flattered the Wallabies, with many similarities to the reverse fixture in Canberra, but ultimately coach Michael Cheika will return to Australia pleased with a strong end to the four-nations tournament. Scrum-half Will Genia shone for the Wallabies, crossing for a try in the 60th minute and pulling the strings throughout the evening. Reece Hodge impressed on the wing, while Izack Rodda was indefatigable in the forward line. For Argentina, young star Tomas Lezana had an impressive night before being sent to the sin bin in the final 10 minutes for a questionable tackle. Neither side departs Mendoza happy with the performance of French referee Mathieu Raynal, who drew the ire of both sets of fans. The Wallabies finish the Rugby Championship with a truly mixed bag: two wins, two draws and two loses. The team now heads to Brisbane for a chance to redeem themselves against the all-mighty All Blacks in the final Bledisloe Cup match of the season. With a busy European tour ahead, a polished performance against New Zealand on Saturday week would be a huge boost for the Wallabies. That’s all from me for now - thanks for following along. Here’s the match report. I will have my closing thoughts for you shortly. In the meantime, here’s a nice photo of the Wallabies from earlier. 80 min: Referee Raynal wraps up proceedings, and Australia has triumphed in Mendoza! It was tight for most of the game, but two tries in the final 20 minutes lift the Wallabies to a comfortable victory over Argentina. 77 min: Reece Hodge and Samu Kerevi combine nicely on the left-hand flank, with Hodge finding space and running over for the try. A TMO review considers whether Kerevi put his foot in touch before the pass to Hodge, but the try is awarded. Foley converts a difficult opportunity from the far side. 76 min: It amounts to nothing, Argentina penalised immediately following the line-out and Australia kick up field. It’s all over. 75 min: The Pumas are awarded a penalty, and find touch barely five metres from the Australian line. Probably the final opportunity for Argentina to get back in the game. 73 min: Nick Phipps is brought on for Will Genia, who has had a tremendous night at scrum-half for the Wallabies. The Wallabies have certainly had the statistical advantage today. As of 72 minutes, Australia has made 511 metres to Argentina’s 286, 133 carries to 65 and 141 passes to 76. 70 min: The Pumas’ Marcos Kremer is sent to the sin bin for a high tackle, and Bernard Foley hits the resulting penalty to extend Australia’s advantage to 10 points. Argentina with only 14 men for the remainder of the game. A few hardy Australian fans did make the journey across the Pacific to Mendoza. This was the pass from Will Genia that put Reece Hodge in space for a try, only for an earier pass to be judged offside. 67 min: Argentina put a desperate kick forward following sustained pressure from the Wallabies, only to find space with no full-back in position. Australia just recover. Argentina then find a gap for a daring run to the try-line, but it’s pulled back for a forward pass. The crowd doesn’t realise and start celebrating... 64 min: Reece Hodge almost collects his second try of the night! Brilliant stuff again from Will Genia, and Hodge finds a perfectly-sized gap to cut through and dive over near the posts. Some discussion of an earlier suspect pass, and the TMO decides it was forward. Some nice snaps filtering through from Mendoza. 60 min: Reece Hodge! The Melbourne Rebels centre makes a busting run, before offloading to Will Genia for the try. Australia are back in the lead, and Bernard Foley converts. John McEnerney writes in on Twitter asking whether Krusty the Clown is Australia’s defensive coach. You tell us... 58 min: Tomas Lezana collects a kick and is immediately taken-out in a huge hit from Marika Koroibete. Excellent tackle, but the referee and his assistant spend about three minutes thinking about it. Lezana is stretchered off. Getting farcical here. Lezana could be a big absent in the final 20 minutes - he has played excellently all night. 56 min: The Australian scrum stays strong. Pumas spread it wide and late-inclusion Santiago Gonzalez Iglesias finds a gap. Try to Argentina. Nicolas Sanchez converts and we are level again. Again. 55 min: Argentina has a dangerous 5-metre scrum. This could be a crucial moment for the Pumas. A nice snap of the Wallabies’ opening try via rugby league convert Marika Koroibete. 52 min: Bernard Foley! After some strong Argentinian defence pushes the Wallabies back, Australia use the added space to shift left and Foley finds a gap. After a torrid night of kicking, he converts his own try. Advantage Australia. Indeed. 49 min: The Wallabies have wave after wave of attack on Argentina’s line, but they cannot break through. Another penalty to Australia, and the Wallabies ask for a scrum. 47 min: The Wallabies come very close to the Argentine try-line, following an excellent bust from Will Genia. Australia are held up on the line, and eventually the referee blows for a penalty. The Wallabies kick for touch. While the Rugby Championship wraps up today, Australia face New Zealand in game three of the Bledisloe Cup on October 21 at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. On this display, the All Black won’t have much trouble ending the series with a clean sweep. 45 min: Bernard Foley steps up for a penalty and skies it wide. A shocking night of kicking for Foley, who is normally very reliable for the Wallabies. Over on Twitter, Brett McKay isn’t happy with the performance of our referee. 42 min: Australia capitalise on a mistake from the Pumas. The Wallabies swing to the left, then to the right, then to the left again. But an error right on the try line alleviates the pressure on Argentina. 40 min: Whistleblower Raynal gets us back underway in Mendoza. Kurtley Beale immediately in action with a good clearance. Beale had a quiet first-half - can he come to live and lead the Wallabies to victory? Plenty of Argentinian fans in full cheer at the Estadio Malvinas Argentinas in Mendoza. Not too many Australian supporters in attendance... Only a short 11,486 kilometres from Sydney. Thoughts on that first-half display, dear reader? Send me your observations via email or Twitter. Wallabies boss Michael Cheika looks perplexed. We are too. 40 min: The Australian defensive line close out the half with a strong effort to resist the Pumas, and referee Raynal calls an end to proceedings. Are we heading for Australia’s third draw of the Rugby Championship? Some good humour on display over on Twitter, at the Wallabies’ expenses. 38 min: Argentina create an overlap on the left-hand side and cross the line, but the referee takes it upstairs for a review. The ruling is no-try: a knock-on from Agustin Creevy. Ball remains with the Pumas after Jack Dempsey is warned for an earlier high-tackle. 37 min: Argentina awarded a penalty, which Nicolas Sanchez converts without fuss. All square again. 34 min: Try! Reece Hodge collects a looping pass from Will Genia on the far right-hand side to run over untroubled. Perhaps a hint of forward in the pass but no review. Bernard Foley miscues the conversion, his third miss of the night. Australia retake the lead heading into half-time. 33 min: Australia building momentum going forward. The attack is looking flat, but still finding gaps in Argentina’s line. The Wallabies find touch and prepare for an attacking surge. Here’s the Marika Koroibete try from earlier. He only just stayed upright... 30 min: Nicolas Sanchez knocks it over from close range to give Argentina the lead. 29 min: Argentina are slicing holes through the Wallabies’ defence right now, clocking up the metres. Penalty awarded to the Pumas, and they elect to kick. How close?! 24 min: The Pumas search for the line, but Australia’s defence hold strong. Then Matias Alemanno finds a small gap in front of the post, and places the ball right on the line. Try! Argentina convert to narrow the gap to one point. 23 min: Argentina have an opportunity to respond, with a line-out 15 metres from the Australian line. Australia penalised, and the Pumas opt to kick for touch again. Driving maul time? 20 min: Try! Rugby league convert Marika Koroibete scores in the far left corner, after collecting on the fly and just staying upright on the final stretch to the line. Bernard Foley misses the conversion. 18 min: Bernard Foley misses the resulting penalty, and the scoreline remains 3-0 to the Wallabies. That is Foley’s first missed penalty in almost 20 attempts. 17 min: Argentine prop Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro is down in backplay and looks in trouble. After a stoppage, the Pumas take the scrum near the halfway line. Chaparro, back on his feet and in the scrum, is then penalised. 15 min: Australia are given the advantage as they search for a gap in the Pumas’ defensive line. It does not amount to anything, and the Wallabies elect to take the kick. Bernard Foley converts the penalty - first points of the game to Australia. 13 min: Australia drive towards the left-hand flank, with good movement from Bernard Foley and Tatafu Polota-Nau. Adam Coleman almost makes a break, but Australia are then awarded the penalty on the Argentinian 22-metre line. Promising signs for the Wallabies, although the Pumas’ defence is staying solid for now. Plenty of Australian fans enjoying the Sunday morning breakfast and rugby combination. 8 min: Jack Dempsey makes a run through the Pumas, gaining ground and bringing the Wallabies to the Argentinian 22 metre line. A handling error from Adam Coleman ends the momentum. 6 min: The Wallabies take a short line-out, but Argentina are awarded a penalty for obstruction. The Pumas move the ball wide but Santiago Gonzalez Iglesias fumbles the pass. Australian scrum. 4 min: Wallabies scrum on the halfway line collapses. Referee Raynal gives both teams a stern talking-to. It collapses again - Australia are awarded a penalty and kick for touch, giving them a strong attacking position. 2 min: Argentina collect from the kick-off and face immediate Australian pressure. The ball ends up downfield and Kurtley Beale takes a mark within the 22, but fails to find touch with his kick. 1 min: Peeep! French referee Mathieu Raynal commences proceedings and we are underway in Mendoza. Stay tuned for live minute-by-minute coverage. The Wallabies train ahead of today’s clash with Argentina in Mendoza. Wallabies: Scott Sio, Tatafu Polota-Nau, Sekope Kepu, Izack Rodda, Adam Coleman, Jack Dempsey, Michael Hooper (c), Sean McMahon, Will Genia, Bernard Foley, Reece Hodge, Kurtley Beale, Tevita Kuridrani, Marika Koroibete, Israel Folau Pumas: Lucas Noguera Paz, Agustin Creevy (c), Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro, Marcos Kremer, Matias Alemanno, Pablo Matera, Javier Ortega Desio, Tomas Lezana, Martin Landajo, Nicolas Sanchez, Emiliano Boffelli, Santiago Gonzalez Iglesias, Matias Orlando, Matias Moroni, Joaquin Tuculet Overnight the All Blacks narrowly beat South Africa in Cape Town. The upshot for the Wallabies is that a win over Argentina will elevate them into second on the final 2017 Rugby Championship ladder. A bonus point win (scoring three tries more than the Pumas) will send them into outright second, while an ordinary win will leave Australia level with the Springboks but ahead on point difference. The 2017 Rugby Championship, which concludes today with Australia facing Argentina from 9.40am (AEDT), has been a series of mixed fortunes for the Wallabies. It opened with a heavy loss at home to the All Blacks, before Australia improved to a valiant defeat in Dunedin. Consecutive draws with South Africa and a win over Argentina in chilly Canberra lifted spirits, but regardless of the result in Mendoza, few fans will look back happily on this series. Australian rugby remains light years away from the glory days of the late 1990s. Coach Michael Cheika has named a line-up identical to that which drew with the Springboks in Bloemfontein last week. This is a first - the only time during his three year tenure that Cheika has resisted the urge to tinker with selection between games - and the Wallabies will be hoping the added stability helps them end the Rugby Championship on a high. Last week’s debutant Marika Koroibete has been retained, the rugby league convert given another opportunity to stake his claim for a permanent position on the wing. For the Pumas, today’s clash at the Estadio Malvinas Argentinas offers one last chance to redeem an otherwise disappointing campaign. Argentina has not secured a single point over five Rugby Championship games, conceding 198 points to just 90 scored. With departing Brumbies scrum-half Tomas Cubelli sustaining a vertebrae fractured against New Zealand, replacement Martin Landajo will need to control proceedings for the Argentinians. Can the Pumas avoid their first winless tournament since 2013? Will the Wallabies leapfrog South Africa to end the Rugby Championship in second place? Which Australians will cement their places ahead of a busy spring schedule, including forthcoming encounters with New Zealand, Japan and the Home Nations? Plenty of questions, and 80 minutes of rugby to find out. Wherever you are in the world, do get in touch with your thoughts during the game via email or Twitter. Ta! Kieran will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a read of Bret Harris’s bold call for extra time to be used in drawn Test games and Paul Rees’s view that the ailing Rugby Championship shows the Test game needs a health check."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-weapons-guns-explosives","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T02:38:50Z","webTitle":"Las Vegas suspect had more than 40 firearms in hotel and home, police say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-weapons-guns-explosives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-weapons-guns-explosives","fields":{"headline":"Las Vegas suspect had more than 40 firearms in hotel and home, police say","bodyText":"The suspect in the Las Vegas shooting that has left at least 59 people dead had amassed an arsenal that included more than 40 firearms, police said on Monday night, as officials declared a state of emergency for the county encompassing the Las Vegas strip. Authorities found 23 guns, including a handgun, in the hotel room of the gunman, identified earlier by police as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock. At least some were equipped with scopes, devices that help the shooter identify targets at a range, police said. They also recovered 19 firearms plus explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition from Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nevada, a town near the border with Arizona, Joe Lombardo, the Las Vegas police sheriff, said. He also said police found “electronic devices” but would not describe them. Several pounds of ammonium nitrate, a material used to make explosives, were also found in Paddock’s car. Later on Monday, a Swat team searched a residence in northern Nevada believed to be associated with the gunman. At an afternoon news conference, officials also updated the latest casualty figures, saying that at least 59 people were dead and 527 more injured. The gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel on the thousands of concertgoers attending the Route 91 country music festival on Sunday night. Islamic State on Monday claimed that the gunman was “a soldier of the Islamic State”, but authorities have said that there was no evidence to substantiate that claim and that the group had falsified its role in attacks. The shooting turned an American city known for its nightclubs and casinos into a war zone as thousands of concertgoers ran for cover from the bullets pouring down on them. The attack was the latest in a grim list of mass shootings, and the carnage surpassed the death toll at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, when 49 people were killed. The first reports of the shooting came just after 10pm local time, as the country music star Jason Aldean, one of the festival’s final performers, played. As the bullets began to spray the crowd, Aldean stopped playing and ran off stage, prompting chaos in the crowd. “They’re thinking it’s fireworks or it’s part of the technology of the music being played. They were thinking it’s coming from different areas,” Carolyn Goodman, the mayor of Las Vegas, said at the press conference. At least 527 people were injured – some were wounded by gunshots and shrapnel while others were trampled or hurt trying to jump fences and flee the site, police said. In pursuit of the gunman, officers scoured the hotel floor by floor until arriving at Paddock’s suite, Lombardo said. Paddock engaged officers through his hotel room door, injuring a security guard in the leg, he said. The guard is expected to recover. Swat officers then broke down the door and swarmed the room, where they found Paddock dead. “We believe the individual killed himself prior to our entry,” the sheriff told reporters. In Washington, Donald Trump called the attack an “act of pure evil”. He said he planned to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday and ordered the flags to be lowered to half-mast. In a response that has become a ritual, Democrats demanded lawmakers take action on gun control measures they believe will prevent – or at least reduce the number of casualties – of a future mass shooting, while Republicans blamed them for politicizing the moment. In Clark County, the coroner’s office worked to identify the victims and notify families, as residents wound around blocks to donate blood for the survivors. A number of evening vigils were planned around the city as donations and well-wishes poured in from around the country in support of the victims and their families. By late Monday night, police said they still had no idea what motivated a retired accountant with no criminal history to carry out this attack. Lombardo said Paddock appeared “reclusive” but cautioned that authorities were still combing through his background. The sheriff said it was possible that the gunman had attended a three-day music festival called Life is Beautiful in downtown Las Vegas one week ago. He also said Marilou Danley, whom he described as Paddock’s girlfriend, was currently in Tokyo and that police intended to talk to her when she returns. A brother of the suspect living in central Florida, Eric Paddock, told CBS he was “dumbfounded”. He was “not an avid gun guy at all”, the brother said. “The fact that he had those kind of weapons is just … he has no military background or anything like that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/02/mark-sampson-greg-clarke-fa-should-have-been-sacked-four-years-ago-england-women","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T23:55:28Z","webTitle":"Mark Sampson should have been sacked four years ago, says FA’s Greg Clarke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/02/mark-sampson-greg-clarke-fa-should-have-been-sacked-four-years-ago-england-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/02/mark-sampson-greg-clarke-fa-should-have-been-sacked-four-years-ago-england-women","fields":{"headline":"Mark Sampson should have been sacked four years ago, says FA’s Greg Clarke","bodyText":"The chairman of the Football Association, Greg Clarke, has claimed Mark Sampson should have been sacked as manager of the England women’s team “three or four years ago” and defended the governing body’s handling of the controversy surrounding the 34-year-old. Sampson was dismissed last month over safeguarding allegations relating to his time as manager of Bristol Academy. The timing of the decision has been deemed convenient by some observers given the accusations of racism made against him by the former England striker Eni Aluko and her Chelsea team-mate Drew Spence and of a subsequent cover-up by those at the top of English football, with Clarke in the firing line alongside the FA’s chief executive, Martin Glenn, and technical director, Dan Ashworth. Their case is not helped by the fact the allegations regarding Sampson’s time at Bristol were first made in March 2014 and Glenn has admitted to being first told of the investigation in October 2015, but Clarke insists nothing untoward has occurred and that he for one would have acted sooner had he been in a position to do so. The former Football League chairman joined the FA 12 months ago. “When you get to the point where the new chairman and the new chief executive find out something that wasn’t shared with the board a long time ago, do you think, ‘That’s a shame, we’d have done something if we’d known’, or do you make a decision?” Clarke said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. “Martin [Glenn] said, ‘Look, I found this out yesterday.’ I said, ‘Right, what do you think?’ He told me, I agreed with him and we had a board conference call. “We asked some questions about legalities, facts, what happened when. And we made a decision. That’s the sort of decision that should have been made three or four years ago but you can’t use that as an excuse to duck the decision today.” Sampson was cleared by an internal FA investigation, as well as an independent inquiry, overseen by the barrister Katharine Newton, of bullying and harassment claims made against him by Aluko and during the China Cup in 2015 of asking a mixed-race player, subsequently revealed to be Spence, how many times she had been arrested. Sampson denies all accusations against him, including Aluko’s claim that the Welshman told the striker to make sure her family did not bring Ebola with them from Nigeria before England played Germany in November 2014. But the FA has now resumed its internal inquiry into the Aluko case and is also giving serious consideration to launching a fresh investigation into Sampson after Spence came forward. Clarke, who will face the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee on 18 October alongside Glenn and Ashworth to discuss the Sampson cases, is insistent that Aluko’s and Spence’s accusations have not been taken lightly by the FA, despite the criticism that has come the organisation’s way, with Aluko describing the initial inquiries as a farce and the PFA calling them “a sham ... intended to protect Mark Sampson”. Clarke said: “If there are issues, we want people to raise them. But there are the rights of the people who feel aggrieved and the rights of the people who’ve been accused. “We had an internal investigation, which came to a simple conclusion. Our barrister is now collecting more evidence. If the conclusions stay the same – fine. If they differ – fine. All we want is to get to the bottom of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/02/rock-star-tom-petty-dies-heart-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T15:00:52Z","webTitle":"Tom Petty: US rock musician dies aged 66","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/02/rock-star-tom-petty-dies-heart-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/02/rock-star-tom-petty-dies-heart-attack","fields":{"headline":"Tom Petty: US rock musician dies aged 66","bodyText":"Tom Petty, the rock musician whose hits included American Girl and I Won’t Back Down, has died in California aged 66 after suffering cardiac arrest. Petty was reportedly rushed to the UCLA Santa Monica hospital after being found unconscious in his Malibu home, but could not be revived. “We are devastated to announce the untimely death of our father, husband, brother, leader and friend Tom Petty,” his manager Tony Dimitriades said on behalf of the family. “He died peacefully at 8.40pm surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends.” The singer-songwriter and guitarist gained fame in the late 1970s with his band the Heartbreakers, who were seen as an integral part of the heartland rock movement. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in 2002, praised them as “durable, resourceful, hard-working, likeable and unpretentious”. Petty was originally part of country rock band Mudcrutch, which gained regional popularity in Florida but did not attract a mainstream audience. They split after Petty and other members joined the Heartbreakers, later reforming in 2007. In 1977 the new outfit gained success with the song Breakdown, but it was their second album You’re Gonna Get It! that became a Top 40 hit. Throughout the 80s, the band enjoyed major hits including You Got Lucky and Change of Heart, collaborating with Bob Dylan as well as Stevie Nicks. Petty continued to work with Dylan as part of the Traveling Wilburys, alongside Roy Orbison, George Harrison and Jeff Lynne. “It’s shocking, crushing news,” Bob Dylan told Rolling Stone in a statement. “I thought the world of Tom. He was great performer, full of the light, a friend, and I’ll never forget him.” Petty also enjoyed solo success but always returned to the Heartbreakers, releasing their final album in 2014. “I don’t see that I have anything to offer as a solo artist that I couldn’t do within the group better,” he told the Sun. “We get along so well it’s embarrassing really. It’s a love fest!” The band had been on a 40th anniversary tour since April that finished last week at the Hollywood Bowl. In an interview with Rolling Stone in December, he suggested it would probably be his last. “We’re all on the backside of our 60s,” he said. “I have a granddaughter now I’d like to see as much as I can. I don’t want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that’s a lot of time.” Petty was outspoken in his protection of the rights of artists, taking issue with record companies on a number of occasions about what he believed to be unjust practices. Earlier this year he was named MusiCares person of the year for his “career-long interest in defending artists’ rights” as well as for his charitable work with homeless people in Los Angeles. Throughout his career, he sold more than 80m records worldwide. Florida-born Petty caught the rock’n’roll bug after he was introduced by his uncle to Elvis Presley, who was shooting the picture Follow That Dream on location in Florida in 1960. He said he began working on music in earnest after seeing the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964. He would speak of being consumed by rock music since childhood, to the point where his father, whom Petty would later say beat him savagely, thought he was “mental”. Awed by the chiming guitars of the Byrds, the melodic genius of the Beatles and the snarling lyrics of Dylan, he was amazed to find that other kids were feeling the same way. “You’d go and see some other kid whose hair was long, this was around 65, and go, ‘Wow, there’s one like me,’” he said in 1989. “You’d go over and talk and he’d say, ‘I’ve got a drum set.’ ‘You do? Great!’ That was my whole life.” Amid his successes, Petty also suffered dark periods during a career spanning five decades. A 2015 biography of the singer, Petty: The Biography, revealed his heroin addiction in the 1990s. Author Warren Zanes said in an interview with the Washington Post Petty succumbed to the drug because he “had encounters with people who did heroin, and he hit a point in his life when he did not know what to do with the pain he was feeling”. Petty also suffered from depression, channelling his pain into 1999’s Echo, during which he was also dealing with a divorce. In 2002, he married Dana York and said he had been in therapy for six years to deal with depression. “It’s a funny disease because it takes you a long time to really come to terms with the fact that you’re sick – medically sick, you’re not just suddenly going out of your mind,” he said at the time. • An initial version of this story said Tom Petty had died, before this was officially confirmed.

At 19, Rashford is now one of the more recognisable faces of the Premier League and the rising star of a renascent United side. Yet it is not even two years ago that he could probably have walked along Deansgate without being recognised. “My mum used to work in a bookies,” he said, “and my brother used to be a personal trainer. But my brothers just look after me now.” And his mum? Rashford’s boyish smile was a brief reminder that this strapping six‑footer sitting is still, lest it be forgotten, a teenager for a few more weeks. “My mum relaxes now,” he said. He turns 20 on Halloween and has packed an awful lot into his short career bearing in mind he has already been to a European Championship with England, with the opportunity for Gareth Southgate’s team to book a place at the World Cup by beating Slovenia on Thursday. Rashford’s debut for United owed to a stroke of fortune before a Europa League tie against FC Midtjylland, courtesy of Anthony Martial sustaining a hamstring injury in the warm-up, and to put it into context the teenager’s name did not even appear in the club programme that night. Nineteen months on, a rare appearance in front of the England press corps included one question about what it felt like to belong to the small and exclusive club of the world’s best young footballers, alongside Kylian Mbappé and Neymar. Another player might allow it to go to his head. Yet an audience with Rashford is a reminder that he has managed to stay remarkably grounded. Indeed, time with the boy from Wythenshawe confirms that everything you might hear about him being an unpretentious and ordinary sort is probably true. He is what is known in the trade as a reluctant interviewee – or rather one who does not seem to understand why these strange journalists, with their tape recorders and inquisitive minds, keep banging on about him living the dream. One certainty: Rashford would much rather continue living it than having to discuss it with a bunch of strangers. That makes it a slightly unusual interview in one respect, not least because Rashford manages to go from start to finish without a single line that fits into the narrative of what an exhilarating story it has been. Yet that perhaps is how they are taught at United – never to get too far ahead of themselves – and Rashford has come all the way through the system, including the club-sponsored Ashton-on-Mersey School. “There’s loads of different examples I can give you of ways they keep us grounded,” he explained of his days in the club’s academy. “If you are winning a game by a ridiculous scoreline, obviously as an attacker you might start messing about if you’ve scored three goals or whatever. But the coaches will tell you: ‘You’re beating them but still show them respect.’ They drill that into you from a very young age. “Obviously the coaching is very good, but They also try to turn you into good people as well as good players. It’s about having respect for everyone, regardless of who they are or what they’re doing. That is probably the baseline at United, no matter what age you are. Just having that alone can get you a long way. It’s the main message they give you.” The result is there is no self‑congratulation from the player who scored on his Premier League, Champions League, League Cup and Europa League debuts, not to mention his first appearance for England, breaking Tommy Lawton’s 78-year record as the team’s youngest-ever debutant scorer. At the same time, it is not shyness that exudes from the 19-year-old. Rashford might have the superstar’s accessories now – the fast car, the expensive clothes, the big house – but he is from a streetwise part of south Manchester and perhaps, for someone in his position, that is not such a bad thing. Ask him about the biggest change in his life and his response makes it clear it has not all been a bed of roses. “Probably the way you have to look after yourself, and look out for yourself as well, because everyone is always trying to get something off the back of you. You have to take care of yourself. You just have to be smart and try not to put yourself in them situations as much as you can. But there are always people who are trying to build themselves up off the back of you. It can be your own friends, or even people’s family members. It’s difficult, but what are you to know? I have people around me that guide me and kind of keep me away from certain things. Sometimes as a young player, that’s what’s needed. I have friends. I just do normal stuff, to be honest. I play PlayStation and I take the dogs for a walk.” He has two – “a Cane Corso and a Frenchie [French bulldog]” – and is already thinking about who might be able to look after them in a World Cup summer. It is a reminder of Rashford’s tender years that the first tournament he can remember was South Africa in 2010, aged 12, and even then his memory was sketchy. “It’s going back,” he said. “Lampard and … Germany? That’s the one.” The impression he leaves is that he is not entirely satisfied operating as a left-sided attacker – “I’m a striker” – and his memories of Euro 2016 also offer an insight into his personality. Rashford was the youngest player at that tournament but he bristles when someone asks if he valued the experience. “I’ll be honest with you, it is difficult to see it as a positive. We went out before we’d expected to go out, and before we wanted to go out, so it was a disappointing end to the season for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/02/trial-ahmed-abu-khattala-benghazi-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T19:24:12Z","webTitle":"Trial opens of Ahmed Abu Khattala, alleged mastermind of Benghazi attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/trial-ahmed-abu-khattala-benghazi-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/trial-ahmed-abu-khattala-benghazi-attack","fields":{"headline":"Trial opens of Ahmed Abu Khattala, alleged mastermind of Benghazi attack","bodyText":"Prosecutors and defense lawyers have given starkly different portrayals of Ahmed Abu Khattala, the alleged mastermind of the 2012 attacks on US outposts in Benghazi, Libya, that killed ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Khatallah has been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of US military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a navy vessel. A government lawyer said on Monday that when Abu Khattala’s hatred of America boiled over, he orchestrated the attacks and then triumphantly strode around the attack site carrying an AK-47. The assistant US attorney John Crabb said that later, the defendant was heard at his apartment saying: “I attacked the American embassy” and would have killed more Americans that night if others had not intervened. A defense attorney, on the other hand, called Abu Khattala a “Libyan patriot”, who fought on the US side in the war against the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He said Abu Khattala did not mastermind the attack. The lawyer said the defendant simply went to the attack site because he heard there was a protest and wanted to see what was happening. “He didn’t shoot anyone. He didn’t set any fires. He did not participate in the attacks,” said Jeffrey Robinson, a lawyer for Abu Khattala. Twelve jurors and three alternates listened as opening statements unfolded in one of the most significant terrorism prosecutions in recent years. The trial is being held in US district court in Washington – a civilian federal court – at a time when the Trump administration has said terror suspects are better sent to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The Benghazi attack led to a political firestorm in Washington, where Republicans repeatedly accused the then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, of failing to adequately protect the diplomatic compound. Abu Khattala, sporting a long grayish-white beard, appeared in court wearing a white shirt and dark pants. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, including murder of an internationally protected person, providing material support to terrorists and destroying US property while causing death. When he entered the courtroom, he shook hands with members of his legal team. He monitored his trial with earphones offering him an Arabic interpreter. At times, he sipped water or swiveled in his chair at the defense table. An 18-count indictment against Abu Khattala arises from a burst of violence that began on the night of 11 September 2012, at a state department compound, a rampage prosecutors say was aimed at killing American personnel and plundering maps, documents and other property from the post. Stevens was killed in the first attack at the US mission, along with Sean Patrick Smith, a state department information management officer. Nearly eight hours later at a CIA complex nearby, two more Americans, the contract security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, died in a mortar attack. Stevens and Smith “choked to death by thick black smoke”, Crabb said. Woods and Doherty were “blown apart by mortar”, he said. He said Abu Khattala “hates America with a vengeance” and that his “hatred simmered until it boiled over”. “He killed Ambassador Stevens – a man of peace.” Crabb said the prosecution would show the jury videos of the attack site and Abu Khattala’s phone records, which he said showed a spike in activity during the attacks. He said witnesses would include weapons and fire experts and a man named Ali, who was paid $7m to befriend Abu Khattala and help US forces capture him in Libya. After he was captured, he was taken to a US navy ship that transported him to the United States. During the voyage, he was first interrogated by intelligence personnel and then by FBI agents. Crabb said Abu Khattala had told FBI agents that America was the “root of all the world’s problems”. Robinson said Abu Khattala cooperated aboard the ship and he “continued to deny, as he denies today, any participation in planning or masterminding the attack”. He alleged that the witness was one of Abu Khattala’s adversaries in Libya who would do anything to have him locked in prison. Robinson also said Abu Khattala was a deeply religious man who believed in conservative sharia law as outlined in the Qur’an, but reminded jurors that in America, people are not prosecuted because of their religious beliefs. The trial, which is expected to last for weeks, is likely to resurrect the political controversy over the attack. Republicans accused the Obama administration of intentionally misleading the public about what transpired at the US outposts and stonewalling congressional investigators."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/02/ronald-koeman-everton-vote-of-confidence-poor-start-wayne-rooney","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T18:23:48Z","webTitle":"Ronald Koeman given time to solve the Everton crisis he largely created","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/02/ronald-koeman-everton-vote-of-confidence-poor-start-wayne-rooney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/02/ronald-koeman-everton-vote-of-confidence-poor-start-wayne-rooney","fields":{"headline":"Ronald Koeman given time to solve the Everton crisis he largely created","bodyText":"From the biggest investment in Everton’s history to a vote of confidence in the manager by 2 October: this season was always liable to test Ronald Koeman’s managerial skills, given the number of new faces, the sale of Romelu Lukaku and a punishing schedule, but few would have anticipated him floundering so badly, so quickly. It is he, not Everton, who must implement change during the international break. The Dutchman retains the “total support” of Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, and the 54-year-old should have time to correct the malaise that has gripped Goodison Park when he is largely but not entirely responsible for the team’s regression. It is also important for Moshiri to demonstrate that faith and patience in a manager, a consistent theme of Bill Kenwright’s ownership, has not become prone to regular upheaval since he came on board. Not that the billionaire’s statement to Sky Sports’ Jim White was without flaws. Moshiri blamed injuries, European exertions, mental and physical fatigue plus a tough fixture list for a run of form that has left Everton two points above the relegation zone. Sunday brought a fifth defeat in eight matches as Burnley executed Sean Dyche’s game plan to perfection. The “only unexpected loss”, said Moshiri, leaving the unfortunate impression that defeats against Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United were not, despite having spent almost £140m on seven additions to the first-team squad this summer. It may have been diplomatically prudent for Moshiri but it would be inaccurate to exclude Koeman from the list of reasons for Everton’s toils. Stubborn, confusing team selections have produced consistently laboured and passive performances this season. A lack of pace, balance and threat has been a recurring theme of an Everton team who veer between defeated and dull. There was no width in the Europa League draw against Apollon Limassol last Thursday. Koeman had three wide players, Nikola Vlasic, Kevin Mirallas and Ademola Lookman, on the bench. Worryingly for the manager, when he tried to rectify the issues by starting Oumar Niasse and Vlasic against Burnley it yielded the same failing. Again, however, his decisions contributed to another subdued display and underlined his tendency to dispense with the easy option – young homegrown talents such as Tom Davies and Jonjoe Kenny – while favouring signings he pushed for. Morgan Schneiderlin, Ashley Williams and Gylfi Sigurdsson have struggled, although Everton’s £45m record signing has been isolated on the left after a pre-season spent pushing for a move from Swansea City. “Both of us like to play more centrally,” Sigurdsson told a Sunday newspaper before the Burnley game. The other player he was referring to was Wayne Rooney, who has also had limited opportunities in a central role and paid the price for the team’s failings with a substitute’s role on Sunday. Rooney contradicted Koeman last week when insisting a lack of confidence was not the root of Everton’s problems. The manager had claimed otherwise when accusing his players of being afraid to play football in the costly 2-2 draw against Apollon. His new-look team have certainly appeared inhibited as they attempt to gel, only for poor results to provoke a change in approach by the manager, who told Everton to play more direct on Sunday. Michael Keane, one of the players who has suffered a loss of confidence according to Koeman, said: “I think everyone expected more than we have given so far: the players and the staff, not just the fans. We know we have been disappointing as a team and need to improve. Expectations from fans are one thing but the main thing is what we expect of ourselves and in a few games this season we have fallen below those standards. “I did not think that was the case [against Burnley]. We just need to show that bit of quality and, hopefully, we will do that soon. I thought the game plan was good. We had them on the back foot, we just lacked that final bit of quality, that good cross or good finish. We have been 1-0 down previously and collapsed but I did not feel like we did that. We got back on the front foot.” Koeman does have solutions to Everton’s faults at his disposal with the exception of the most glaring of all – an adequate replacement for Lukaku, who has scored three more Premier League goals for Manchester United this season than his former club have managed collectively. Recognition of this error in the transfer market is arguably what protects the Everton manager from greater pressure from within. Kenwright, the Everton chairman, gave Steve Walsh a consoling pat on the back as the club’s director of football stared at the Goodison pitch on Sunday and absorbed another damaging defeat. The Everton hierarchy were well aware of Lukaku’s intentions to leave before the end of last season and had time to locate an alternative striker once Olivier Giroud, Koeman’s preferred target, decided to stay at Arsenal. Instead six weeks and £45m were spent on a deal for Sigurdsson, who may well justify Everton’s investment in the long term but was not a priority acquisition with Rooney and £23.6m Davy Klaassen in place. Any mention of Everton’s summer spending brings a dismissive retort from Koeman, who with some justification will respond with the net spend argument. After £140m and 14 games, however, he should be much closer to justifying Moshiri’s decision to lure him from Southampton on a £6m-a-year contract."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/03/problem-not-capitalism-tories-thatcher-treasury-cupboard-bare","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"The problem is not capitalism.

It’s that the Tories aren’t much cop at it","bodyText":"Damn the British people, for they have let down Theresa May again. The prime minister could once count on voters to back free markets. But, she sniffs to supporters in Manchester, “Jeremy Corbyn has changed that.” So goes the refrain of this Tory conference. “A new generation is being tempted down a dangerous path,” warns Philip Hammond: the feckless youth are seduced by visions of North Korea, Zimbabwe and Cuba. Nor is the chancellor alone. The bloviators in our thinktanks and media agree that British politics is suffering what Nick Robinson yesterday on BBC Radio 4 termed “a crisis of belief in capitalism”. Add it all up, and the Conservative frontbench and their interlocutors now have three propositions. First, the government of which they are either members or supporters is widely unpopular because the public have fallen out of love with capitalism. Second, this discontent can be localised to the young. And, finally, the alternative they prefer is the Venezuela-lite offered by Corbynism. This is the biggest load of tripe since … well, the last time the Westminster establishment agreed on all the same talking points. Each and every one of the above arguments – which will be spewed out of Manchester all week and dutifully repeated across the comment pages and studio sofas – is wrong. Let’s work backwards through those charges. A spectre is indeed haunting the Tory party, but it is the spectre of moderate social democracy. Labour went into the last election on a manifesto of a bigger public sector, higher taxes and a promise to borrow more to invest. That is capitalism, of a kind that Angela Merkel would know. If the Tories believe their problem lies with the young, they must have missed the YouGov finding that they are losing voters under 47 years old. Or the one about how they lag behind Labour among every segment of the workforce – unemployed, part-time, full-time. In the election in June, the Tories only came out ahead among retirees. The most important point, though, is this. It suits May to make out that a vote cast against her is a vote against capitalism, but the truth is modern-day Conservative leaders aren’t much cop at capitalism. Whether David Cameron or May, George Osborne or Hammond, they pursue policies almost guaranteed to make Britain’s market economy perform less well. The result is that we have suffered the most miserable recovery in well over a century, that the average British worker is still earning less than he or she was before the banking crash of 2008, and that the deficit reduction strategy that voters were assured would end in 2015 is now set to drag on until around 2025. The Britain that voted for Brexit last year, or which is signing petitions in defence of Uber this autumn, has not lurched towards socialism. Rather, voters have been failed by the form of capitalism offered to them – one that cannot provide them with wage rises, secure homes or decent care for their loved ones. If they are now rejecting that malfunctioning economic system and the party that is its chief vehicle, their response is not ideological but entirely pragmatic. You can pin a large part of the blame on the complete fiasco of austerity. That’s one reason why I’m confident Osborne will go down as the worst chancellor in postwar Britain, whatever fees he currently commands on the after-dinner circuit. But austerity grew out of the belief system that the Tories inherited from Margaret Thatcher. She championed the notion that assets should be handed to individuals rather than entrusted to society, and that the only tolerable benefit was a means-tested benefit. What we are witnessing now is the slow collapse of that system. For most of the 20th century, the Conservative party knew the best way to keep voters true to capitalism was to allow them some share in its dividends. It was in the name of a “property-owning democracy” that Thatcher privatised the utilities and encouraged council tenants to buy their own homes. The effect of her regime, as largely accepted by her successors Tony Blair and Cameron, was to concentrate wealth and assets in fewer hands. Look at the results. Thatcher’s capitalism has ended up breaking every one of its big promises. Home ownership in England has slumped to its lowest point since the mid-1980s. Share ownership among individuals is below where it was when Thatcher entered No 10. Thatcherism was meant to help those who wanted to get on in life; the Resolution Foundation now forecasts that those aged between 15 and 35 could earn less over their entire lifetimes than their parents. Yet even four decades on, the Conservatives remain entirely in Thatcher’s shadow. She could have written Cameron’s austerity programme, with its belief that the public sector crowds out the private sector. The same goes for Osborne’s plans to privatise whatever assets he possibly could – even down to old student loans. And she would certainly have recognised May’s stupid gambit this week that the best way to deal with a housing bubble is to underwrite it with more public money. All of this is Thatcherism redux, only this time the Treasury cupboard is bare, the ideas are old and the fireworks have gone damp. The big problem with Thatcherite economics is that it’s a trick you can only pull off once. To keep doing it 40 years on is to face an audience that has seen too many failures. Too many regions left for dead, even while the City of London booms. Too many promises of creating national champions, when now Beijing funds France to build Britons a nuclear power station. Too many failures of the private sector, from the operators of our trains to the boardrooms of our banks. All those 1980s jibes against supposedly incompetent public servants ring hollow in an era when Britons know the 11 most terrifying words in the English language are: “I’m from a Virgin call centre and I’m here to help.” The result, as the political economist Will Davies observes, is that the Conservatives have ended up defending capital rather than capitalism. They have championed finance and pretended it stands for all business. They have preached book-keeping when they needed to wield economics. The Tories can obviously reverse out of their current ideological dead end. But that would require them first to recognise Thatcherism as being a dead end, which they show little sign of doing. Yet it most certainly is. What Thatcher once said of socialism goes for her own brand of economics: you eventually run out of taxpayer money to give to the rich and public assets to privatise. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/03/nevada-gun-control-law-las-vegas-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T12:11:23Z","webTitle":"Nevada voters approved a new gun control law – so why was it not enforced?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/nevada-gun-control-law-las-vegas-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/nevada-gun-control-law-las-vegas-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Nevada voters approved a new gun control law – so why was it not enforced?","bodyText":"Last November, Nevada voters narrowly approved a new gun control law that would have required private sellers to conduct the same criminal background check on buyers that licensed gun dealers already use. Closing the loophole was one of the lone bright spots for gun control advocates in an election that put the National Rifle Association’s chosen candidate, Donald Trump, in the White House. But Nevada’s new gun law has never been enforced. Days before it was slated to go into effect, the state’s Republican attorney general released a legal opinion concluding that citizens were “excused from compliance”, calling the new law unenforceable. The attorney general who made the decision, Adam Paul Laxalt, spoke at the NRA’s annual meeting this year, where he was hailed by the NRA’s chief lobbyist for ensuring that Nevada’s new background check legislation for private sales was still not the law of the land. Laxalt had publicly opposed the background check measure before it passed, a mark of opposition the NRA had publicized in its fight against the measure. The legal opinion from Laxalt’s office blamed the FBI for refusing to conduct the new checks – and ruled the law could be enforced as soon as the FBI changed its mind. An FBI spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the continued legal standoff, which the director of Nevada’s department of public safety said had left them “frustrated” and “stuck”. “We want folks to have background checks,” the public safety director, James Wright, said. Enforcing Nevada’s new background check law might not have made any difference to how easily the perpetrator of Sunday’s attack on a country music concert – named by law enforcement officials as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock – was able to stockpile dozens of guns. The attack left least 59 people dead and more than 500 injured in the deadliest mass shooting in recent American history. Law enforcement officials have said Paddock had no serious criminal record, which would probably mean that a background check would not have flagged him as unfit to purchase a gun. At least one gun store in Mesquite, Nevada, where Paddock lived, confirmed that it had sold him several guns legally, and that he had passed a background check. But Nevada’s new law, if it had been enforced, might have provided another paper trail to help law enforcement track down the sources of some of Paddock’s other guns. The stalemate over Nevada’s new background check law highlights the many difficulties of passing stricter gun laws in the United States: the fierce opposition from Republican politicians, the challenges of building on a national background check system that is missing crucial records, and the missteps of gun control groups desperately trying to make new gun laws as inoffensive as possible, and sometimes a simple failure to coordinate. Wright, Nevada’s public safety director, said he was astonished that the gun control advocates who crafted the initiative had never talked to anyone from his department. “That’s why we’re so frustrated,” he said. “I just wish the measure people would have talked to us. I think if they would have talked to us we could have advised them on what to say. “I think we could have saved them a whole bunch of headaches.” Adam Skaggs, the chief counsel at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which supported the expanded background check law, said: “It’s a very unfortunate situation, that the will of the voters of Nevada has been thwarted. The attorney general has not made any effort to implement the law and indeed appears to be eager not to enforce the will of the voters.” State leaders have negotiated many different systems for sharing background check duties with the FBI, and he said, there’s no reason Nevada should not be able to do the same. Skaggs said: “Had there been more communication between all of the stakeholders before the drafting process it is possible this impasse could have been avoided.” On its website, the NRA has defended Laxalt from what it has called unfair attacks in the media over his background check decision. The gun rights group said the initiative “was poorly written by out-of-state gun control groups that clearly did not understand Nevada’s existing firearms background check system” and called it “doomed from the start”. By blaming the attorney general, gun control groups were attempting to “escape responsibility for their own failure”, a post on the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action argued. A spokesperson for Laxalt did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Laxalt is seen as a potential candidate in the state’s 2018 governor’s race, and the Nevada Independent reported in June that Laxalt’s campaign “has sent at least two emails linking to pieces defending his decision not to enforce the ballot question, including links to donate to his campaign account”. Wright said his impression was that the background check legislation had specified that the FBI would conduct the background checks as a cost-saving measure, since Nevada charged $25 for its state background checks, and the FBI’s instant background check system was free. The fee for background checks has been a source of grumbling for years, Wright said. But what might have been a political advantage in advocating for a new law came at a significant cost to public safety and the law’s potential effectiveness, Wright said. Nevada’s state background check records system, the “central repository”, has access to a much wider range of records that might disqualify someone from gun ownership, including domestic violence protection orders. “Female deaths by guns in Nevada is high and a lot of it is associated with domestic violence,” he said. In his view, the Nevada state system simply provides a better-quality background check. The FBI agreed with this assessment after the new law passed last year, arguing that Nevada could provide a “more comprehensive” background check with its own records, and concluding that the state, and not the FBI, should be responsible for conducting the new checks. Since America’s state lawmakers have also shown themselves unwilling to support gun control, advocates have begun pursuing a different tactic: asking voters themselves to approve new gun control measures directly, through state initiatives placed directly on the ballot. Nevada is one of a series of states that has seen gun control legislation make progress on the state level, even as Congress refused to pass new national gun control laws. National gun rights and gun control groups poured millions of dollars into the fight over Nevada’s initiative last year. On Monday, Elizabeth Becker, a volunteer with the Nevada chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America,said: “It’s a heartbreaking day here. It’s particularly tough because we took a big step as Nevadans last year to prevent tragedies like this. Our elected officials have an obligation to work to implement the law that voters passed, and now is the time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/sep/28/trump-claims-tax-plan-is-not-for-the-rich","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T21:45:09Z","webTitle":"Trump claims tax plan is not for the rich | The minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/28/trump-claims-tax-plan-is-not-for-the-rich","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/28/trump-claims-tax-plan-is-not-for-the-rich","fields":{"headline":"Trump claims tax plan is not for the rich","bodyText":"Donald Trump is charging hard to sell tax cuts he says are aimed at “everyday hardworking Americans”. Unsurprisingly, analysis shows those most likely to gain are wealthy folks like Trump himself and most of his cabinet. The bottom third of earners would see little to no relief or benefit. Get money The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the Trump plan will add between $3tn and $7tn to the $20tn national debt over the next decade. To offset that, the Trump administration has proposed $5tn in cuts to non-military spending, meaning things like schools, Medicaid, social security and disability insurance. Holy deflection, Batman! Representative Steve Scalise made his long awaited return to Capitol Hill Thursday, to raucous applause and a standing ovation. The congressman from Louisiana was shot and seriously wounded by a gunman in June on a DC ballfield. Trump has said he is “not happy” with the health and human services secretary, Tom Price, following reports that Price used a private plane for official business. Asked whether he was planning on firing Price, Trump responded: “We’ll see.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was also noncommittal on Price’s job security today. In a statement Thursday, Price said he would “write a personal check to the US Treasury today for the expenses of my travel on private charter planes”, and that it would never happen again, “no exceptions”. The White House on Thursday waived the law which requires goods sent between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by the US. The 1920 Jones Act was preventing foreign ships from delivering supplies to Puerto Rico, more than a week after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory.

Ashworth, one of the FA executives at the centre of the Sampson controversy, has been accused by the Professional Footballers’ Association of overseeing an inquiry that was “not a genuine search for the truth” and “designed to close down the complaint and absolve Mark Sampson”. It follows the revelations that Ashworth and the FA human resources director, Rachel Brace, held an internal review that cleared the now-deposed England Women’s manager of making an allegedly racial comment to Drew Spence at the 2015 China Cup without the two FA executives speaking to the player in question, or any of the potential witnesses, and without watching a video recording of the relevant meeting. The issues that have led to the PFA sending an official complaint to the FA, describing it as “a sham which was not designed to establish the truth but intended to protect Mark Sampson”, will form part of a parliamentary hearing on 18 October when the culture, media and sport select committee summons a number of senior FA officials, including the chief executive, Martin Glenn, for an explanation. Eni Aluko, the first player to make a complaint against Sampson, will be giving evidence along with another former England international, Lianne Sanderson. Ashworth’s conduct is bound to feature prominently and Southgate said he was willing to defend his colleague’s reputation. “My experience of the way he [Ashworth] wants to work, and the environment he has created for us coaches at St George’s Park, is that he would always want to work ethically and in the right way,” Southgate said. “I am certain of that and he wouldn’t take his responsibilities lightly. I think he’s very aware of the diversity of players in all of our teams. My view is that he is always very conscious of how we work in that field and would definitely be aware of the sensitivity of that subject. I don’t believe that he would want to cover something up.” Sampson was sacked last week after a flurry of publicity prompted the FA to look more closely into an old safeguarding report that showed he had “inappropriate and unacceptable” relationships with players when he was coaching at Bristol Academy, his previous job. Southgate, who said he did not know at the time that Sampson was the subject of a safeguarding investigation, was reminded that he had described his former colleague as an “excellent character” when the stories first emerged about allegedly racial comments. Aluko claims Sampson told her to be careful her Nigerian relatives did not bring Ebola to Wembley, whereas Spence, a mixed-raced player, has told the reopened independent inquiry that her former manager asked her how many times she had been arrested. Sampson denies the allegations. “I think you speak as you find with people, and my dealings with Mark have always been very good,” Southgate said. “Obviously I am dealing in coaching meetings and seminars and it is a different environment to the team. But I am not going to stand here and take back what I said. I found him to be a good character.” However, Southgate did add that Sampson ought to have known he was in “potential danger” when it comes to manager-player relationships in football. “If we are looking at safeguarding guidelines, everybody on their [coaching] qualifications [should know] that’s part of it. Every two or three years you have to keep that part of your qualification updated. There would be a section in there around the influence of a coach and what you have to watch out for.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/02/cost-of-gun-violence-hospital-expenses-johns-hopkins-study","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T20:00:05Z","webTitle":"Cost of gun violence: hospital charges for 100,000 shot annually reach $2.8bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/02/cost-of-gun-violence-hospital-expenses-johns-hopkins-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/02/cost-of-gun-violence-hospital-expenses-johns-hopkins-study","fields":{"headline":"Cost of gun violence: hospital charges for 100,000 shot annually reach $2.8bn","bodyText":"More than 100,000 people are shot each year in the US at a total cost of $2.8bn in hospital charges, a study published on Monday has found. If lost wages and hospital charges are considered together, the authors said, the annual cost of shootings in the US could be as high as $45bn. The study was published in the journal Health Affairs, hours after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, at a music festival in Las Vegas on Sunday. At least 58 people were killed and 515 wounded. Although mass shootings represent the most high-profile gun violence in the US, homicide, suicide and everyday violence kill many more. The study, which looked at more than 150,000 patients in a national database of emergency department visits between 2006 and 2014, is one of just a handful on American gun violence published each year, because of a lack of congressional funding. “The numbers are really, really startling,” said Faiz Gani, one of the authors of the study and a postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine department of surgery. “Previous studies just focused on the mortality, but ignored the larger chunk of people who don’t die but are affected by this issue. “That really struck me as something that was really alarming. There are 100,000 people who are affected and we’re not really doing anything.” In 2015, about 36,500 people died of firearms-related injuries. When that total was added to those injured, Gani and his co-authors found more than 100,000 people each year were shot, either as part of an assault, accidentally or while attempting to kill themselves. Dr Thomas Weiser, a trauma surgeon and associate professor at Stanford Medicine, called the mass shooting in Las Vegas “totally shocking, incredibly tragic and totally expected”. Recent research by Weiser estimated that victims of firearms injuries cost $700m in hospitalizations between 2006 and 2014. “It’s just a matter of time before this happens again,” said Weiser. “The truth is these tragedies – these mass shootings – attract tremendous headlines. The other truth is there is daily carnage throughout the United States in ones, twos and threes that don’t make headlines.” Patients pay a high price for being shot. On average, those treated in emergency departments incurred $5,254 in charges. If they stayed in hospital overnight, charges were far higher – $95,887 on average. Patients who stayed overnight in hospital were more likely to be discharged to expensive rehabilitation facilities. About a third of inpatient gunshot victims were discharged to another medical facility and incurred costs of $179,565 on average. Over the course of the study, 2006 to 2014, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated 970,622 people in the US were wounded or killed by a firearm. “A lot of these individuals tend to be from a lower socioeconomic background and tend to be uninsured,” Gani said. “They’re paying that out of pocket directly.” Firearms injuries are the third-leading injury-related cause of death in the US, behind drug overdoses and car crashes. Nevertheless, research on the causes and consequences of gun violence remains severely underfunded because of the “politicized environment” around guns and gun sales. One of the co-authors of the new research, Dr Joseph Sakran, is a professor and trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins, and was a shooting victim. When Sakran was 17, he was shot in the throat after a high school football game and nearly died, he said, an experience that inspired him to pursue medicine as a career. “I love what I do, and I love being able to take care of patients, but what I would love more is to not ever have to take care of such unnecessary violent crimes,” said Sakran. “This is a public health crisis we’re facing here in the US.” As many people die from gunshots every year as from sepsis. However, gun violence research receives only 0.7% of the funding given to research into sepsis. For every 100 studies published on sepsis, four are published on gun violence. The study was conducted by researchers based at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, a city that is experiencing one of the worst waves of gun-related homicide in its history. In late spring, the city’s mayor said “murder is out of control” and that there were “too many guns on the streets”. The study reflected that reality. Nearly half (49.5%) patients who arrived at the emergency department after being shot were victims of assault, accounting for 348,000 patients. Men between 15 and 24 had the highest incidences of gun wounds and were nine times more likely to be injured by guns than women. “There’s a lot of violent crime,” Gani said, “and I think really just being a citizen of the city it’s something that is pretty disconcerting, and you want to find a solution, and do something.” In the US, for every 100,000 people, 25.3 will visit an emergency department with a gunshot wound each year – a rate “disproportionately higher” than in other developed countries such as Germany, Japan and the UK. Some of the best international data compares homicide rates between countries. In the US, 27 people are killed by firearms for every 1 million people. In the UK, that rate is one per 1 million, according to the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey. “Although numerous studies have identified and proposed effective interventions to limit firearm-related violence, efforts to reduce firearm-related injuries have been limited as a result of the politicized environment surrounding gun violence and a lack of will to consistently implement proposed policies,” the Johns Hopkins researchers wrote. The authors suggested that “future policies must promote more effective ways of limiting firearms access” for the mentally ill and people with criminal records. Researchers drew data from the National Emergency Department Database, a record of 30m emergency department visits in 950 hospitals in the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/28/bate-borisov-arsenal-europa-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T19:15:07Z","webTitle":"Theo Walcott double sets Arsenal on way to victory at Bate Borisov","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/28/bate-borisov-arsenal-europa-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/28/bate-borisov-arsenal-europa-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Theo Walcott double sets Arsenal on way to victory at Bate Borisov","bodyText":"To butcher a phrase Arsène Wenger coined many years ago, if you eat caviar every day, sometimes it is not so bad to return to sausages. After all those seasons of Champions League, Arsenal have rather taken to life in the Europa League. It is not always easy to get the blend right with a reshuffled team, a mix of older pros who are perhaps not getting as much football as they want, and kids desperate for opportunities. But Arsenal got stuck into their sausages, established enough “cohesion” to please the manager, and ended up having the better of a rollicking, bundles of chances, blast in Belarus. There was always going to be a question of how seriously Arsenal take the group stage of this competition and it is to the credit of the senior players chosen for this trip, who did not take this game lightly, that they are coasting Group H without being wholly convincing. Jack Wilshere and Theo Walcott are two of the club’s longest-serving players and they created the platform to help Arsenal secure maximum points from their European outings so far. Olivier Giroud, another of the senior performers, slotted in his 100th goal for the club. Walcott was on a hat-trick when a penalty was awarded early in the second half but stood aside to let his team-mate join a grand list of centurions. The Frenchman coolly placed his shot and enjoyed the moment. Wenger went straight to Giroud after the game to congratulate him on his milestone. “It is a remarkable achievement,” he said. “He is in good company. When you play football the most difficult thing is to score goals and he scored 100 for us.” The Arsenal manager was also particularly complimentary about Wilshere, who continues to improve and catch the eye with each performance since his latest injury, bringing even greater authority. Playing a more advanced role than central midfield, he was influential. “He had an outstanding first half, did fight until the end, and is on a good way back to his best,” noted Wenger. “He is at an age where a player normally gets to the best of his career. He has only been stopped by a series of injuries. I just pray he is not hampered any more by any problems. He will get stronger and stronger. He has shown tonight he has not lost any football.” With a host of first-teamers left in London and spared the 2,500-mile trip, Arsenal’s team leaned on the knowhow of players with abundant experience. Across a starting XI that included three youngsters they still had a combined 400 international caps. With Wilshere excelling and Walcott darting around just behind Giroud, Arsenal created enough of a lead that even when Bate burst into life the result was not in serious danger. It was just as well Wenger’s front men produced as the defenders had numerous ragged moments of their own in a very open game. Part of the character of the Europa League experience is the chance to go off the beaten track and Arsenal’s first away trip took them to Borisov, the ninth-largest place in Belarus. Nestled in the woods just on the outskirts a spaceship stadium is parked, full of rainbow colour, which is home to its nation’s perennial champions. They were soon behind as Arsenal started sharply. Wilshere’s vision shone and when his creative finery picked out Walcott, the forward finished with a neat header. Arsenal added another couple in a three-minute burst midway through the first half. Bate’s last line of defence, Denis Scherbitski, dropped an exceptional clanger, popping the ball straight to Walcott who drilled in past the stricken keeper. Arsenal turned the screw and Rob Holding looked ecstatic to shin in the third from a corner. Leading with confidence made the occasion one to relish for the youngsters given a chance to pick up the experience of a European away match. Wenger’s faith in youth was interesting, especially as all three rookies played in midfield – the heartland packed in this case with inexperienced promise. At 18 years old, Joe Willock had presence in the centre alongside Mohammed Elneny, with the 17-year-old Reiss Nelson and 20-year-old Ainsley Maitland-Niles showing flashes of ability from the wider wing-back roles. Mirko Ivanic took advantage of some soft Arsenal defending to head in a goal acclaimed joyously by the home crowd. Bate scored another to cherish in the second half when Mikhail Gordeichuk rifled in from close range. Ospina had to be alert to punch away moments later. Somehow Arsenal were in danger of snatching anxiety from the jaws of a comfortable victory. They saw out the game, and headed home and back to the Premier League. A difficult week to manage has so far been handled well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/28/world-beard-moustache-competition-drug-dealer","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T20:14:46Z","webTitle":"Trip to world beard competition ends in arrest for alleged dark web drug dealer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/world-beard-moustache-competition-drug-dealer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/world-beard-moustache-competition-drug-dealer","fields":{"headline":"Trip to world beard competition ends in arrest for alleged dark web drug dealer","bodyText":"United States authorities arrested a suspected dark web drug dealer as he traveled into the country from his home in France to attend the World Beard and Moustache Championships. Gal Vallerius, a French 38-year-old with a magnificent red beard, is accused of being a drug kingpin on the dark web, acting as an administrator for Dream Market, a marketplace for illegal narcotics including cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines, counterfeit consumer goods and stolen data. Vallerius was arrested as he landed at Atlanta international airport on 31 August, and during a border search of his laptop confirmed his identity as “OxyMonster”, the username for a Dream Market account that was not only listed as an administrator for the site but also listed prescription drugs including OxyContin and Ritalin for sale. Officials also discovered about $500,000 in bitcoins, the currency used for anonymously trading on the marketplace. The arrest, first reported by the Miami Herald, was the culmination a multi-agency investigation that started in February 2016. As part of the investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration agents made undercover purchases of crystal meth, LSD and hydrocodone from a range of vendors on Dream Market and trawled the site to identify the usernames associated with the organising team. “OxyMonster knowingly participated in the Dream Market conspiracy not only as a vendor, but also in a leadership and organizational role as a senior moderator and administrator,” court documents state. Investigators tied the username to Vallerius’s real identity through his bitcoin transactions, some of which went to bitcoin wallets associated with his name. They then tracked down his Instagram and Twitter accounts to compare the writing style with that of OxyMonster and discovered “many similarities” including the use of the word “cheers”, frequent quotation marks and intermittent French posts, according to court documents filed in Florida. His trip to the beard contest was Vallerius’s first time in the United States. He had registered for the “full beard 30.1-45cm” category, one of 27 at this year’s event. Bryan Nelson, the co-founder of the Austin Facial Hair Club, which hosted this year’s championships, described the arrest as “pretty dramatic”. This year’s event had 738 competitors from 33 countries and, apart from Vallerius, the only contestants who weren’t able to attend were people from Nepal and the Middle East who had trouble getting their visas. Although Nelson had never met Vallerius in person, he immediately recognized him when he learned of the arrest from his involvement in an app called “Beard Wars”. Players of Beard Wars would bet chips on their own beard versus someone else’s beard and other people would vote for the best one. The person with the most votes would win the chips. Nelson and his friend MJ Johnson would consistently rank No 1 and No 2 within the app, until a user called “Barba” came out of nowhere and started amassing loads of chips. “You could see false accounts were getting created to make bets,” said Johnson, one of the winners at this year’s World Beard and Moustache Championships. Within weeks, Barba had more chips than Johnson and Nelson put together. Nelson and Johnson felt vindicated in the Beard Wars this week when they saw Vallerius’s photo in the news. It turns out that “Barba” was actually Gal Vallerius. “As soon as I saw the story and saw he was a computer guy it all made sense,” said Johnson. Johnson, who also met Vallerius at the 2015 championships in Austria, said that he “always seemed like a fun, carefree person”. Regardless of his alleged crimes, both Nelson and Johnson are impressed by Vallerius’s facial hair. “I don’t know anything about what other stuff he did, but as far as his beard goes, it’s really awesome, long and bright red,” said Johnson. Vallerius’s arrest is the latest episode in a broader crackdown on dark web marketplaces by the US government, which previously infiltrated and shut down AlphaBay and Hansa. Following the closure of AlphaBay and Hansa, many traders had flocked to Dream Market to continue their operations. At a court hearing in Atlanta, Vallerius did not contest his identity and detention. He is expected to be transferred to Miami, where the complaint was filed, where he faces another conspiracy indictment that carries up to a life sentence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/brexit-diplomacy-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"How to avoid a bad Brexit?

Rediscover the art of British diplomacy","bodyText":"Apart from the hard right political trajectory of the government’s Brexit stance, what worries me most is that Theresa May’s team appears to be ignoring almost every one of the rules of negotiation. These are in the DNA of the best British diplomats, who are famed across the world for their creative professionalism – as I witnessed at first hand as a minister. There was yet another warning from the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Thursday that there is still no clarity on the UK’s policy, and that the stalemate over the UK’s financial commitments could drag on for months. This shows just how precarious the position is. You don’t have to agree with Barnier’s negotiating hand to accept that he needs to understand what ours is. Worryingly, the government seems not to have grasped the first principle of negotiation: personal relationships. Although enormously time-consuming to develop, they pay massive dividends. And it’s elementary: you are more likely to get a sympathetic response from someone who is on friendly terms with you, who understands not just why you are adopting a policy position, but also what makes you tick: your family, hobbies, favourite football team. I’ve been in the middle of tense standoffs, trying to fathom what may be pure brinkmanship as against a genuine bottom line, when some humour – “come on X, give me a break, at least your football team won last night” – has led to a rapprochement. Personality clashes can otherwise lead to stubbornness, and block progress and cooperation. When I was a minister, I used the global enthusiasm for football continuously. Finding out that the vice president of Ghana (whom I had never met) was a Manchester United fan, and presenting him in Accra with an Alex Ferguson-signed team shirt, created an immediate bond between us. At a tricky time of transition from military coup to democracy, he was thrilled. The former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, I was astonished to glean from him in one of our early meetings in 2005, was an ardent England cricket fan. We often talked about the Ashes. Discovering what you have in common with someone helps ease the way to resolving differences. By contrast, May and David Davis, flying quickly in and out to deliver pre-scripted lines for the Brexiteer tabloids back home, appear friendless in Brussels – which is astonishing when they are confronting the biggest challenge for our country since the second world war. They don’t seem to have grasped that European leaders need to be negotiating partners, not enemies. And this is nothing to do with being “soft on Brussels”. The best way to get a good settlement is to have the other side want to help deliver it. And putting in the legwork really does pay dividends. After I’d had endless dinners, lunches, breakfasts and one-to-ones during European convention talks in Brussels in 2002-03, Germany suddenly replaced their lowly delegate with foreign minister Joschka Fischer. “I’m here because you are here!” he said to me cheerfully. The convention outcome was reported in the media across Europe as a British triumph. Rule number two is to be clear. Instead, the government position papers last month were oblique and opaque waffle. The paper on whether the Irish border can remain open – so critical to the peace process – was full of pious platitudes with a dogmatic objection to continued UK membership of the customs union and the single market, which provides the only obvious solution. The third rule is trust. You will never make friends with everyone. But you don’t have to agree with your opponents, or even like them, to build a relationship of mutual understanding – which takes time, empathy and patience. Tragically, trust and empathy between the principal figures in Brussels and London appears non-existent. Despite the ritual Barnier-Davis courtesies, to say their relationship appears frosty is to put it charitably. It is the absence of trust that has led to Northern Ireland’s suspension of self-government. May’s salvation deal with the DUP, coupled with her perplexing unwillingness to get personally involved, makes it almost impossible for the government to play the essential role of honest broker, trusted by both sides. That, plus Brexit, creates a real risk of the settlement falling apart. The fourth rule is to think creatively and laterally. The night before the announcement of the Northern Ireland deal in March 2007, it almost collapsed: not over the substance, but a table. As a matter of principle Ian Paisley would not face the world’s media on the same side as Gerry Adams who, as a matter of principle, insisted on doing so. I wanted them close for the historic photo of the bitter old enemies together. Impasse. Disaster. Finally, with the hours ticking by, we came up with a solution: building overnight a new triangular table. In the morning, Paisley sat on one side, Adams on the other, with honour satisfied and the world oblivious to the preceding drama. Anyone can see there will be similarly fraught moments ahead in Brussels – with 27 member states (not including the UK) it’s bound to be complicated. It’s time for May and Davis to read up on the arts of successful British negotiation. Otherwise there will be no deal – unless of course that is what they, and backseat driver Boris Johnson, really want. • Peter Hain was Labour MP for Neath from 1991 to 2015.

Ten years ago when I last met Jordan Belfort, convicted criminal, aspiring author and shortly to be a man at the center of a fierce bidding war for his biography, I suggested his hair was “the sort of dark brown that only passes for natural in LA”. Also his skin was a little too taut and maybe he wore lifts. A decade on the 55-year-old still looks 10 years younger than his age. And his hair is still a rich mahogany. But he’s keen to point out it’s all natural. “I swear to God,” he says. “Do I dye my hair?” he asks Anne Koppe, his partner, as they sit in their Manhattan hotel suite. Koppe – the sort of blonde who probably gets described as “willowy” and spends part of the interview curled round Belfort like a cat – points at his chest hair, peaking out from his polo shirt. That’s definitely brown. “It’s all an expensive dye job,” I say. The couple laugh. “You’re killing me,” he says. Back in his native New York for a family visit Belfort seems very happy. It’s over 11 years since he was released from jail having served four years for running a “pump and dump” share selling scheme at his broker, Stratton Oakmont, that prosecutors said led to losses of approximately $200m. Life has moved on for him, and how. His drug-fueled crime spree, in which he crashed a helicopter (while high on quaaludes), sank a yacht and arranged midget-tossing in his office, was turned into a film by Martin Scorsese starring Leonardo DiCaprio, that became an international box office hit. He remains friends with DiCaprio. He taught the actor, who has never done drugs, how to act when he was portraying the scenes of Belfort out of his mind on his usual cocktails of narcotics. It was: “Valium for breakfast, marijuana for lunch and quaaludes for dinner,” one of his associates said. Now he has another book out, Way of the Wolf, that promises to teach anyone how to be an ace – and ethical – salesman, and is in the early stages of turning his life story into a Broadway musical. Crime does pay! Belfort, 20 years sober, lives a charmed life. It took almost seven years for the film to be made after it was optioned and even that delay worked in his favor. The script originally ended with Belfort in jail. By the time it was made, Belfort had rebuilt his business, giving seminars about his “straight line” sales techniques and the film ended with him giving one of those talks. It was “amazing” he says. “In a way the fact it was so late really worked.” Now living in Los Angeles, Belfort says he leads a quiet life. “We are very boring,” he says. “All these delivery services, Doordash, Grubhub. They make it too easy to stay home and have bed picnics. That’s our favorite thing to do.” But the bizarro world of the Wolf continues. The US government now owns the TV rights to his story (but not the Broadway ones) after the film’s producers, Red Granite Pictures, reached an agreement with federal prosecutors looking to recoup some of the billions they claim were stolen from the Malaysian government and used, in part, to finance the film. Belfort says he had a strange feeling about those investors from the start. “The way they spent money, I have never seen anything like it,” he says. The Malaysian investors flew Kanye West out for the film’s launch party. When you steal money, he says, you just want to spend it. “It’s like a weird compulsion,” says a man who should know. For his own part, Belfort says the high-spending days are over. He wants to pay back Stratton’s investors (he’s already paid about $20m) and get on with his life. But his celebrity – and his past – do get in the way. All the harping on the past can be a bit annoying. “The movie came out a few years back but it depicts events from my life almost 30 years ago. I’m not the same Jordan Belfort. I continue to pay back money and I am hopeful that I will pay back all the money. It’s frustrating because you want to reinvent yourself and you feel you have. And he knows your past is always there.” The book, he says smoothly moving into sales pitch mode, is about that. “It’s really about a strategy for coming back from failure,” he says. “I should have written this book a long time ago,” he says. The problem is he hates writing. Anne shows me a video of him typing away in bed (they clearly spend a lot of time there). He holds the laptop in one hand and types one finger at a time. “Even better,” he says out loud in the video. “Better yet. Better though.” He pauses. “Once you’ve been. Once you HAVE been …” It goes on and on and looks excruciating. Anne says it helped him sleep. A lot. But the result is fun, with more insights from the world of Stratton Oakmont and allusions to The Italian Job and Forrest Gump. It’s the sort of easy read that will no doubt fly off the bookshelves at airports around the world. It’s not just for sales people, he says. Everyone is always selling themselves. “There are so many people out there who are brilliant, hardworking and industrious but lack the art of persuasion,” he says. “And because of that they end up dying with their music on their lips. It’s crazy.” If he wants to make the switch from villain to hero, there are others to take his place. In the pantheon of Wall Street villains Belfort has been eclipsed by Martin Shkreli, the “pharma bro” who hiked the price of a lifesaving drug 5,000% and is now in jail after calling on his Facebook fans to steal a lock of Hillary Clinton’s hair. “There has got to be something wrong with that guy,” says Belfort. “Is he crazy?” But it’s not the players, it’s the bigger picture on Wall Street that worries him these days. He says bitcoin is a bubble waiting to burst. “It’s artificially created scarcity,” he says. “The problem I have with bitcoin right now is that it’s very much like at the tail end of of 2007, 2008 right before the mortgage market blew up. You’d be getting your haircut and he’d be like: ‘Oh yeah I also do mortgages on the side.’ Everybody was a broker. Everyone’s flipping houses. Now everyone’s buying bitcoin. I promise you the end is near.” He also thinks that the stock markets – which seem to reach record highs on a daily basis – are in for a fall. “I think the lessons of the crash have been forgotten,” he says. “It feels like we are going back into a cycle of irrational exuberance. Like with Trump. How can the country be that unsure of him, how can we be that unsure of him and the markets be so high? If there is that much uncertainty then there is risk,” he says. “The market itself might not be linked to reality any more,” he says. “It’s the ‘greater fool theory’. If there is a greater fool that will buy it from me at a greater price then I did good.” Something is off and there is going to be a big correction, he says. “There is North Korea and yet … What are they going to do with the national debt? Something is going to happen.” Whatever it is, you get the feeling it’s going to work out just fine for the Wolf of Wall Street. • Way of the Wolf is out now through North Star Way in the US and released in Australia by Hachette on 10 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/29/aida-review-power-and-passion-marred-by-a-few-duff-notes","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T23:24:49Z","webTitle":"Aida review – power and passion marred by a few duff notes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/29/aida-review-power-and-passion-marred-by-a-few-duff-notes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/29/aida-review-power-and-passion-marred-by-a-few-duff-notes","fields":{"headline":"Aida review – power and passion marred by a few duff notes","bodyText":"English National Opera’s new production of Aida is the work of Phelim McDermott, whose previous stagings for the company include Philip Glass’s operas Satyagraha and Akhnaten, the latter, like Aida, set in ancient Egypt. McDermott’s intention is to preserve the essential air of mystery or otherness that surrounds Verdi’s tragedy while examining its seriousness of purpose and darker implications: the nature of theocracy; the relationship between desire and obsession; and the inevitability of betrayal when war forces its casualties to choose between lovers and family. He does so, however, in ways that don’t always ideally cohere. His Egypt is a decadent place that half hides its violence behind a veneer of civilised glamour. The columns and monoliths of Tom Pye’s set derive from hieroglyphs from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, but Kevin Pollard’s costumes range backwards and forwards between antiquity and the present day, allowing McDermott to draw continuous parallels between the ancient world and our own. The priests wear greatcoats and totemic animal headdresses. Gwyn Hughes Jones’s Radamès, looking like a Napoleonic general, is subjected to a primitive initiation ritual in the temple of Phta, before leading his troops off to a modern-day conflict. The triumph scene is a solemn procession of flag-draped coffins, observed by a smart-looking crowd in 1930s evening wear. All this leads to an occasionally bewildering first half, and it is not until after the interval that the production begins to settle. The third act has remarkable tautness and intensity, though McDermott weakens the tension of the judgment scene by having Hughes Jones tried in full view of Michelle DeYoung’s Amneris rather than offstage. There are some musical unevennesses as well, though the evening is blessed by a remarkable central performance from the American soprano Latonia Moore in the title role. This is a remarkable voice, wonderful in its amplitude at full throttle, yet also capable of sustaining beautiful, rapt pianissimos. She’s a superb actor, too, registering every shift of Aida’s torment as the conflicting demands of her father and lover, implacable enemies in war, tear her psychologically in two. This is one of the finest performances of the role to be heard in London for many years. Hughes Jones makes a strong Radamès, though it took a few minutes on opening night for his voice to settle. There was, however, some finely shaded singing in his duets with Moore, and a real edge of defiance in his confrontation with DeYoung. Her once beautiful mezzo sadly sounded frayed on opening night, and her singing undercharacterised, lacking the requisite menace and ire, though dramatically she wasn’t helped by a series of unflattering costumes that restricted her movements. Musa Ngqungwana’s sonorous-sounding Amonasro might have been a bit more threatening. Matthew Best’s King, presidential in McDermott’s concept, exuded hauteur. Robert Winslade Anderson was the sinister Ramfis. Canadian conductor Keri-Lynn Wilson propelled the score forward with considerable passion. There were a couple of awkward moments of stage-pit coordination on opening night, which should sort themselves during the run. •At London Coliseum until 2 December.

The prime minister has also reminded people that Village People performed the YMCA at the 1991 NRL grand final in Sydney. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, weighed into the bizarre controversy surrounding Macklemore’s right to sing his hit song Same Love, which promotes same-sex marriage, at the NRL grand final. Dutton said the National Rugby League was setting a worrying precedent by allowing an inherently political song to be played to the crowd this weekend, suggesting the NRL would only truly be supporting free speech if it allowed a song promoting the no campaign’s message to be played as well. “I am into free speech … presumably two songs should be played, one for gay marriage and one against gay marriage,’’ Dutton reportedly said in London this morning. Dutton’s intervention comes after Tony Abbott, Liberal senator Eric Abetz and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson all called for the NRL on Thursday to prevent Macklemore performing the song this weekend, saying sport and politics should never be mixed. Turnbull said on Friday that it was a question of respecting the artist. “What’s the problem?” he said. “Honestly, I don’t think trying to censor the playlist at halftime entertainment is – it’s certainly not my role. I look forward to it.” When asked by Channel 9’s Lisa Wilkinson if he was “sick of Tony Abbott chiming in,” he said he was “very patient”. “Everyone is entitled to have their say and if people want to express views on songs or anything else, they’re entitled to do so,” he said. “I’m for free speech and in this case for the artist’s right to sing his song. I mean, in 1991 at the NRL grand final the Village People did YMCA.” Before flying to Australia, Macklemore said he had been receiving “a lot of tweets from angry old white men” about his planned performance, and he was going to “go harder” amid the furore. Asked if Abbott, who has spoken about the politicising of sport, is one of those angry white men, Turnbull said: “he’s certainly a white dude and I guess it depends on his mood at the time”. Liberal senator George Brandis rebuked Abbott sharply on Thursday, telling ABC TV: “It is one of his most popular songs and for Mr Abbott and anyone else to say that it should be banned, I think is a bizarre thing to say. I thought Mr Abbott believed in freedom of speech.” Brandis pointed out that Macklemore would be singing a number of songs this weekend, not just Same Love, and he had been asked to perform at the grand final before the postal survey had been ruled lawful by the high court, and had been requested by an NRL fan focus group. John Howard has now formally joined the no campaign, and is using his title as “former prime minister of Australia” to add weight to the issue. He appeared in a newspaper advertisement on Friday, again criticising Turnbull’s claim that religious freedoms will be protected under law if same sex marriage goes ahead. “This issue must addressed before the survey is completed,” he says in the ad. “Leaving it as something to be taken up only in the event of a yes vote prevailing is the equivalent of saying that it does not matter very much.” He prosecuted the same argument earlier this month, and was dismissed by Brandis and Turnbull at the time. Turnbull, in an attempt to dilute the former prime minister’s attack, said Howard could help the government in “fine-tuning” the exposure draft for any same-sex marriage legislation if the postal survey returns a yes vote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/trump-doesnt-care-poor-taxes-puerto-rico","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T15:16:38Z","webTitle":"Trump is a puppet of the rich.

He made that clear this week","bodyText":"Our president is the puppet of his rich business friends. You don’t need a special counsel to find the evidence. Twice this week, when given the choice between his wealthy buddies and the working Americans he claims to care about, Trump has taken the gold-plated path. Take his big tax cut, the biggest ever in history (or so he says). When asked by the super-friendly Pete Hegseth (from the aptly named Fox &amp; Friends) about who his tax cuts were intended to help, our populist hero jumped right in. “Really, the working people. We say the working people, middle class, the people that really haven’t been treated right, Pete, and they haven’t been treated right, really, for a long time. They have not been treated right,” he began very earnestly. Then he switched gears. “Also, it’s going to be for businesses where they’re going to employ jobs, where they’re going to bring in jobs.” Let’s set aside about the whole idea of employing jobs. Let’s even pass over the royal “we” when we say the working people. Along with cutting his own taxes, Trump is also cutting his own grammar. But the businesses, people. Our great negotiator in chief was tipping his hand, so the fearsome interrogator known as Hegseth went in for the kill, asking if any of the tax brackets were non-negotiable. “Yes,” said Trump proudly, “the 20% is non-negotiable. I wanted to do it at 15%. This is for business. I wanted to do it at 15%. If you look at China, China is at 15% … In fact, I was going to start at 15 and maybe negotiate it up to 20. But the numbers really work at 20, so we’re putting it in at 20, but we’re not going to negotiate.” This is a particularly sad moment for the handful of people who still believe Donald J Trump knows how to negotiate; notably his blood relatives and paid help. He may have put his name to The Art of the Deal, but Trump knows less about negotiations than he knows about African geography. It’s also a sad moment for all those working people who really haven’t been treated right for a long time, and who may have believed that Trump was looking out for them. Because when pushed very gently into naming his priority tax rate, the populist rebel forgot all about them. This thinking is obvious in the proposed tax cuts themselves. Somehow Trump believes he can sell a tax hike for the lowest earners – from 10% to 12%– as a tax cut. This is apparently because he is promising to increase the standard tax-free deduction, but he is also declining to tell us what income levels apply to each tax bracket. As any self-respecting populist should know, if you’re explaining deductions and brackets, you’re losing. Meanwhile, those at the top will see their tax rate go down from 39.6% to 35%. Because they haven’t been treated right for a really long time either. Obviously. This follows a pattern by our presidential puppet. Faced with the humanitarian disaster in Puerto Rico, where about 1.5 million Americans are struggling to survive without drinking water, Trump somehow managed to side with the shipping industry. For several days, he resisted calls to lift the Jones Act restrictions on foreign-flagged ships bringing desperately needed supplies from the mainland to the stricken US territory. Why not relax those rules, as he did when helping Houston and Florida after their recent hurricane disasters? “Well, we’re thinking about that but we have a lot of shippers and a lot of people who work in the shipping industry that don’t want the Jones Act lifted,” he told reporters on the south lawn of the White House on Wednesday. After thinking some more, Trump reversed himself on Thursday, more than a week after Puerto Rico lost its power grid and struggled to secure anything like adequate fuel supplies. It is phenomenally hard to understand the thinking of a commander in chief who places the interests of shippers over his own citizens in dire need. Then again, it’s hard to understand someone who tries to shoo away the problems of helping Puerto Rico by saying to reporters on Tuesday: “It’s very tough because it’s an island,” he explained helpfully. “In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there. And you know, we’ve gotten A-pluses on Texas and on Florida, and we will also on Puerto Rico. But the difference is, this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean. And it’s a big ocean. It’s a very big ocean.” We can only look forward to the conversations between the president and his national security officials when they explain how far away North Korea is. There are also some very big oceans between Washington and Seoul, but somehow our military forces manage to cross them. Trump’s worldview is not shaped by a burning desire to help working people or even understand them. It’s shaped by his desire to help his business friends. So when Fox’s friendly Hegseth asked him why he was talking so much about the NFL players’ protests, Trump could only respond with what he knows best. “Well, I have so many friends that are owners,” he explained with what passes for honesty. “And they’re in a box. I mean I’ve spoken to a couple of them. They say, we’re in a situation where we have to do something … I think they’re afraid of their players. You want to know the truth? And I think it’s disgraceful. And they’ve got to be tough and they’ve got to be smart, because you look at the ratings.” Never mind that the ratings have gone up since the protests took hold. And never mind about the underlying reasons for the protests: police brutality and racial injustice. What really matters is the plight of the poor, scared owners. Because they haven’t been treated right for a really long time.

Price has come under pressure after it was revealed that he billed the US government $400,000 for private flights instead of commercial travel. The scandal, which has also seen the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, come under scrutiny, has raised the ire of Donald Trump. On Wednesday the president said he was “not happy” with Price regarding his private travel. Politico first reported that Price was using private charter airplanes instead of commercial flights. The health department’s inspector general is reviewing the issue. In a statement released on Thursday, Price said: “Today, I will write a personal check to the US treasury for the expenses of my travel on private charter planes. The taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes.” He added: “I will take no more private charter flights as secretary of HHS. No exceptions.” Price will only reimburse the government for his share of the private travel – $51,887.37 – not the full cost of the flights. In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said: “What the secretary has done is say that while all of this travel was approved by legal and HHS officials, the secretary has heard the taxpayers’ concerns and wants to be responsive to them. “That’s why he’s taking the unprecedented step of reimbursing the government for his share of the travel. Secretary Price will write a personal check to the US Treasury for $51,887.31. The taxpayers won’t pay a dime for his seats on charter planes.” In his statement, the former Georgia congressman said: “I regret the concerns this has raised regarding the use of taxpayer dollars. All of my political career I’ve fought for the taxpayers. It is clear to me that in this case, I was not sensitive enough to my concern for the taxpayer.” Price’s flights, which included two trips to locations where he owns property, became a political flashpoint on Capitol Hill. The Iowa Republican senator Charles Grassley sent a letter to the White House asking for information on the use of private airplanes by Price and several other cabinet members. The House oversight committee, meanwhile, sent a letter to 24 government agencies regarding the use of “private non-commercial travel for official reasons”. Before his appointment to Trump’s cabinet, Price served 12 years in Congress, representing suburban Atlanta. While on Capitol Hill, the former orthopedic surgeon was a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act and a leading Republican voice on health policy issues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/29/outside-in-america-newsletter-homeless-bus-rides","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T20:19:58Z","webTitle":"Chronicling homelessness: do 'homeward bound' bus programs work?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/29/outside-in-america-newsletter-homeless-bus-rides","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/29/outside-in-america-newsletter-homeless-bus-rides","fields":{"headline":"Chronicling homelessness: do 'homeward bound' bus programs work?","bodyText":"Stories about homeless people being put on buses and forcibly shipped out of cities are legend. One such rumor circulated last month, amid reports that Salt Lake City’s homeless people had been put in vans and driven 35 miles away, to some canyons near Tooele, and dumped there with nothing more than some bottles of water and food. We investigated these reports, and have found no evidence to substantiate them, although it does appear to be the case that hundreds of homeless people have disappeared in Salt Lake City, baffling police and local activists, as we revealed in this widely read investigation. That’s not to say there are no controversial examples of homeless people being encouraged to take buses, such as in the run-up to the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. And there are, of course, several examples of voluntary bus (and even flight) services for homeless people who want to voluntarily leave. Cities ranging from San Francisco and Denver to New York and Fort Lauderdale operate what are sometimes called “family reunification” or “homeward bound” projects. Homeless people are offered publicly funded bus tickets to their hometowns or places where they have personal connections, with the goal of helping them find stability and even resolving their homelessness. We’re examining programs like these across the country, and asking whether they work. We’ve spoken to homeless or formerly homeless people who have taken tickets – but we want to speak with more. Have you taken one of these bus tickets, or do you know someone who has? Do you have insights into a bus program in your community or elsewhere? If so, I’d love to hear from you.

What we published Some academics are so impoverished that they have turned to sex work or sleep in their cars. The deadliest US outbreak of hepatitis A in decades kills homeless people in San Diego. A California city confiscates porta-potties at a homeless camp, forcing them to use buckets. Silicon Valley residents chant “build a wall” in response to plans to build emergency housing. Behind the scenes I received the email in July. A college lecturer who lived near Miami named Mindy Percival wrote to tell me about the appalling conditions in which she and other adjunct professors lived. Mindy herself was on the edge of homelessness, a state, she wrote, that “is unacceptable for the highly educated, the uneducated, the mentally ill or the psychologically fit”. Speaking to Mindy was one of the sparks of yesterday’s story on poverty among college professors (the other inspiration was, strangely enough, a second message I received from different adjunct). In the piece, Mindy’s hardships – the “shack” in which she lives, lacking hot water, a shower or an oven – come through the strongest. But on the phone she is constantly cracking jokes, and I’ve come to think of her as a female Jackie Mason, though her humor is edged with tragedy. “I grew up in the lap of luxury, by the way, if you can’t tell by my voice,” she told me when first talked. But because she couldn’t afford dentistry, she once had to teach “with four teeth missing from my Jewish American princess mouth”. (When I asked her to send some photos of herself, she joked: ‘My mother used to say keep your chin up – both of them’.) Mindy was not bowed by her situation, she told me. “I love my work and care deeply for my students and subject matter. And I am well loved in return and a popular professor. Teaching is my ‘raison d’etre’ and gives my life meaning and purpose, and I consider myself lucky to do the work. All my education also helps me see things in a larger way, perhaps, and somehow … while it stinks, I am not really unhappy. Go figure.” Last but not least Bob Armstrong, living in the place he thought he would be happiest, never imagined it would come to this. Originally from Ohio, Armstrong, 56, has had a varied and illustrious career, from working as a local television anchor and station manager to heading a major marketing effort for an art and science museum. He was once a professor of communications in Singapore, and says he traveled everywhere in Asia except for North Korea and Myanmar. But in 2011, after the deaths of his brother and father, things started to come undone. Sorting out his dad’s finances, he realized: “You can spend your entire life working, saving, playing by the rules as politicians like to say, but the extra expenses at the end of life are not enough to insulate you from poverty. And here I am six or seven years later, and I have wiped out everything I’ve ever saved.” After that hard year, he moved to Hawaii, “the one place in the world that I think is extraordinary and truly paradise”. But well into middle age, it was hard to find full-time work and, therefore, pay for an apartment. He has a job in sales, but it’s not enough. On Monday, he was told by a court that he must vacate his current home by 15 October over late rent payments. “In two weeks, I’ll have to find somewhere to live,” Armstrong told me. “I am alone in the world and have no resources left except persistence, patience, a good pair of walking shoes and a deep belief in myself and my talents.” Do you have an experience of homelessness to share with the Guardian?

The Institute for Free Trade (IFT), set up and headed by the arch-Brexiter Daniel Hannan, held its first public meeting on Wednesday in the grand surroundings of the FCO’s Map Room, with guests including Johnson, Michael Gove and Liam Fox. Critics accused the foreign secretary of allowing public resources to be misused as Hannan called for the government to move towards a Singapore-style economy after Britain leaves the EU. Theresa May reassured EU leaders this week that Britain was not seeking to become an offshore tax haven like Singapore. Lord Falconer claimed the event was in breach of the ministerial code because the aims of the institute are not supported by the government. The former Labour lord chancellor wrote on Twitter: “Foreign Sec in breach of min code (7.12) in allowing FCO to be venue for launch of Institute of Free Trade which conflicts with govt policy.” The code says: “Ministers should take care to ensure that they do not become associated with non-public organisations whose objectives may in any degree conflict with government policy and thus give rise to a conflict of interest.” Questions have also been raised about why FCO staff appeared to be on hand to direct visitors to the event. Dave Penman, the head of the senior civil servants’ union, the FDA, said the event had placed his members, who are bound by rules on impartiality, in a difficult position. He said: “Civil service departments are not the personal plaything for ministers of state to promote their particular political beliefs – they are there to deliver public services to taxpayers. “Whether they have broken the ministerial code or not, the ministers involved have shown an astonishing lack of judgment in using official government buildings, departmental communication channels and civil servants’ time to help promote a thinktank which quite clearly represents a particular political view of Brexit.” The IFT “sees Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union as a unique opportunity to revitalise the world trading system”, according to its website. It is based near parliament at 57 Tufton Street, where it shares an office with the rightwing thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies. At the event, Johnson again called for a swift end to any transition phase of the UK’s exit from the European Union, in another move that could be provocative towards May. He told guests: “You can imagine what our brilliant companies are able to do … Let’s hope the date is soon upon us, without too long a transition period.” Hannan said: “I’m looking at [the] high commissioner of Singapore [in the front row].

Nazis old and new tried, but they faded away one by one. The centre held, with the moderate-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and the reformist-left Social Democrats (SPD) placidly alternating in power or sharing it. Germany has now gone mainstream. Like everybody else in Europe – from Portugal to Poland – Germans now live with a rightwing populist party. Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has barged into parliament as the third-largest force – two generations after the demise of the Third Reich. But the Nazi analogy is deceptive. Like its European counterparts, the AfD is an ideological hodge-podge, defying classic left-right categorisation. The revolt against politically correct speech and assertive minorities, shading off into racist shibboleths is rightwing. The clamour for social protection for the “little man” is left. Angst about immigration and globalisation, coupled with hostility to Brussels, is both left and right. The common denominator is resentment and protest. So think Marine Le Pen and her Front National, Geert Wilders and his Freedom party (PVV), Ukip, Donald Trump, and of course Hungary and Poland where authoritarian populists are running the governments. Anger beats agenda. Only 34% of people who voted for AfD did so with conviction. Twice as many voted that way because of their “disappointment” with the established parties. Elsewhere in Europe, this pattern applies. You can label it: “We feel betrayed and abandoned.” But these sentiments highlight a much bigger picture: the precipitous decline of those large centre-left and centre-right parties that have governed Germany and Europe since the second world war. Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU took the hardest hit. Compared with their last take in 2013, the German conservatives lost 8.5 points. The SPD shed only five, which is no consolation, though. The smaller loss merely masks the tragedy of the party of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt that once won 46% of the vote. It is now down to 20.5%. The SPD is battling long-term decay. Here, too, Germany is not alone; the signs of decline for social democracy stretch across Europe. In Italy, the once mighty Italian Socialist party (PSI) is no more. The Socialist party in France used to be strong enough to heft François Mitterrand and François Hollande into the Elysée Palace. In this year’s presidential race, they captured only 6.4% in the first round. In Scandinavia, the moderate left has taken a beating. Norway is ruled by conservatives and populists. Sweden by the centre-right. The Dutch Labour party (PvdA) has plunged from 19% to less than 6% in five years. A similar fate has befallen Greece’s Pasok. To take in the whole panorama, imagine a map of Europe. Twenty years ago, the map was mainly covered in red, the traditional colour of social democracy. Today, only five countries are inked in red. Then look farther afield. At first sight, Britain sticks out as the great exception because Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour almost edged out the Tories in the June election. Arguably, the verdict was more anti-May than pro-Labour. In the US, the Democrats seem to fare much better, given their majority of the popular vote in 2016. Now look again, at middle America. Since Barack Obama’s first victory, the Republicans have gained 1,000 additional seats in the state legislatures, and 34 out of 50 governors are Republicans. Trump, who has moved into the White House, would feel right at home with Le Pen, Wilders and the German AfD. Where once a proud Socialist International bestrode the global stage now it is the Populist International stretching from the Pacific to the Baltic Sea. What happened? Historically, social democrats rose to power in tandem with a rising working class. Now, this once mighty force is shrinking along with manufacturing as a share of GDP. In the past 50 years, that portion has roughly dropped from 35% to 15% throughout the west. To put it brutally, the reformist left is losing its customer base, and it shows in all recent elections. It is also losing its unique selling point, which is redistribution and the all-providing state. Take Martin Schulz, the SPD’s hapless candidate for chancellor. His message was “social justice” – taking from the rich to help the poor through taxes and benefits. But today’s German workers are middle class, and the highest tax bracket bites at €50,000 – the salary of an upper-level teacher or skilled worker. These folks do not look forward to more taxation – not in a country where the government takes in almost half of GDP. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini index, is lower than in France, Italy or Britain. So the SPD must find another selling point. Yet the SPD is trapped by its traditions. It cannot switch to Trumpist nationalism, protectionism and border closures, not when Germany lives off exports in a way no other western nation does. Nor can it drop gender and minority advocacy, which is part of its modern DNA. The same holds true for the SPD’s western counterparts. That said, do savour the upside. The AfD took 13% of the vote in the German elections. This means that 87% supported the established democratic parties. This is a lot more reassuring than the election outcomes in the US, Holland or France – not to speak of Poland and Hungary. • Josef Joffe publisher-editor of Die Zeit"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/29/morning-mail-twitter-called-to-capitol-hill-over-election","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T20:54:21Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Twitter called to Capitol Hill over election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/29/morning-mail-twitter-called-to-capitol-hill-over-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/29/morning-mail-twitter-called-to-capitol-hill-over-election","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Twitter called to Capitol Hill over election","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 29 September. Top stories Representatives of the social media giant Twitter have been summonsed to Washington to give evidence to congressional investigators about Russia’s use of their platform to attempt to influence the 2016 US presidential election. The closed-door hearing with House and Senate staff followed a similar briefing involving Facebook this month,which revealed that the tech giant sold more than 3,000 election ads linked to a Russian agency. The Capitol Hill investigation is trying to understand the degree to which Russia and groups allied with the Kremlin used social media to spread fake news stories and misinformation – and what the companies could have done to prevent and stem such attacks. Twitter has been under intense pressure to release everything it knows regarding alleged tampering in the election after Facebook revealed that hundreds of accounts and pages probably operated from Russia spent nearly $100,000 on ads. Twitter has been largely silent on its role, though in June its vice-president of public policy, Colin Crowell, said it was not Twitter’s responsibility to be “the arbiter of truth”. “Twitter’s open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote to the spreading of all types of false information,” Crowell wrote. “This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single tweet from every person is truthful or not.” Indigenous groups have renewed calls for the creation of an Indigenous incarceration reduction target after a leaked letter showed the government was just weeks away from going public with a refresh of its failing Closing the Gap strategy. So far Australia has largely failed to stay on track to meet the Closing the Gap targets, which measure efforts to reduce the entrenched inequality between Australia’s Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. This year just one of the seven targets was met. Targets to improve life expectancy and child mortality were not on track, nor was an aim to halve the gap in reading and numeracy for Indigenous students by 2018. Ignorance of dual citizenship is no excuse, say Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters, the two Greens senators who resigned and kicked off the high court case that has now engulfed another five parliamentarians. But those who haven’t resigned disagree, and maintain that ignorance of their dual citizenship is central to their case. The high court has released the submissions of Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash, Matt Canavan and Nick Xenophon, along with those of Waters and Ludlam. The three government members and Xenophon are arguing that no reasonable person in their position would have suspected they held dual citizenship and therefore they could not have been expected to check it. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the star of Seinfeld and Veep, has revealed she has breast cancer. The Emmy-winning actor shared a note on Twitter on Thursday to inform her followers, while also reminding them of the importance of universal healthcare. “The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends, and fantastic insurance through my union,” she wrote. “The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let’s fight all cancers and make universal health care a reality.” According to a statement from HBO, Louis-Dreyfus received the news the day after she won her record-breaking sixth Emmy for playing the lead in HBO’s hit comedy Veep. The head of the British spy agency MI6 has said George Smiley is a better fictional role model for recruits than James Bond. Sir Alex Younger, known in agency circles as C, says 007’s “brash antics” give a misleading portrayal of life in the service, and John le Carre’s fictional spymaster Smiley was a better fit for the serice with his “quiet courage and integrity”. Younger has long expressed ambivalence about Bond, seeing him as both a boon and a curse, lifting the service’s profile worldwide but also giving a seriously misleading portrayal of what intelligence officers do. Sport Ben Stokes is in danger of missing the Ashes as he and Alex Hales have been dropped by England until further notice after they were arrested following an altercation during a night out in Bristol on Monday. The England and Wales Cricket Board has reversed its decision from earlier in the week after a video purporting to be of the incident was published by the Sun newspaper, and now both players will now be unavailable for international selection pending further investigation. Meanwhile a David Warner century in his 100th match helped Australia to a 21-run win over India in Bangalore in the fourth one-day international. India have an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series. Considering Melbourne’s dominant NRL season thus far – and considering they’ve won their past five against Sunday’s grand final opponents, North Queensland – it would be no surprise to see the Storm win in a canter, writes Paul Connolly. Then again, sport is full of surprises – why else would we watch? Thinking time Was Hugh Hefner a pimp, a sexual revolutionist or an esteemed publisher? Hefner, aged 91, died yesterday and Suzanne Moore is angry he’s being remembered as a a liberator of women – because she remembers him as quite the opposite. “I don’t really know which women were liberated by Hefner’s fantasies. I guess if you aspired to be a living Barbie it was as fabulous as it is to be in Donald Trump’s entourage,” Moore writes. “The fantasy that Hefner sold was not a fantasy of freedom for women, but for men.” We didn’t want this same-sex marriage postal survey, writes Simon Copland, but now that we have it, let’s focus on the positives. “Last week I went around the offices at my university department, giving everyone a yes poster. Our corridor is now a big rainbow, showing support to every student who walks through in the coming months. While this gesture was small, I can’t help but think it would never have happened without the postal survey.” From Pulp Fiction to Magnolia, the Guardian’s film critics look back at the best films of the 90s just in time for a weekend binge. “For me, it’s still the most potent 1990s time capsule; from a time before Cool Britannia,” writes Peter Bradshaw of Pulp Fiction. “This touchstone of cool seemed to extend its influence everywhere in the 90s: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants. Everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but without Tarantino’s brilliance it just looked smug.” What’s he done now? After being admonished for failing to provide adequate assistance to Puerto Rico after the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria, Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to update his followers on the stricken country – but his tweet isn’t supported by accounts on the ground, who say clean water, food and fuel are all in short supply. “The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot,” Trump tweeted overnight. “Large numbers of generators are now on island. Food and water on site.” Media roundup The Daily Telegraph leads with details of Fadi Ibrahim’s home detention, saying the accused money launderer is awaiting trial from his $8m Dover Heights mansion, after being bailed out to the tune of $1m by his wife and associates. The NT News splashes with the story of a raucous CBD hostel that is causing a significant drain on police resources, with officers being called to attend incidents there 500 times in the past year. Interestingly, the emergency calls peaked in the middle of the wet season, with more than two a day recorded. The ABC wonders if the US has forgotten Australia, with the US embassy in Canberra without an ambassador for a year. Political analysts have said the situation is not ideal, and it is unusual for embassies to go without ambassadors for more than a few months. Coming up The Australian Electoral Commission will reveal its proposed changes to federal electorate boundaries for Queensland. One to watch will be Peter Dutton’s electorate of Dickson, which could be set for a significant shift.

But then a beady-eyed editor at Faber noticed Alan Bennett had praised it in his diary (“it alters the way one looks at the world”, he wrote in an entry on 24 August 2006), with the result that it has now been republished. Its author, Rosamund Young, who lives and works at Kite’s Nest, an organic farm on the edge of the Cotswold escarpment, must be thrilled – or maybe not. Having read her book, which is very sensible but also somewhat dreamy and a bit obsessive, she strikes me as the kind of woman who would rather be standing in a muddy field in her wellies than listening to some eager townie praise her for her wisdom. Young’s parents began farming in 1953, when she was 12 days old and her brother (with whom she and her husband still run Kite’s Nest) was nearly three; she continues their tradition of treating animals as individuals with varied personalities, rather than as identical members of herds. The Secret Life of Cows, then, is essentially a collection of anecdotes about the many beasts she has hand-reared down the years: bovines, mostly, though there are a few stories about sheep and chickens, too. In a way, it’s like a book for children. Every animal has a name – Araminta, Black Hat, Dorothy – not to mention parents, brothers and sisters. Most have adventures, albeit not massively exciting ones; Young refers casually to their “conversations”, as if cows chat just like humans. After a while, though, you get used to all this, and as a consequence the world does indeed tilt. Or bits of it, at least. This book will change forever the way you see a field of ayrshires or friesians. I said “obsessive”. At one point, Young insists of an “unusually delightful” calf called Amelia that she could write about “for a thousand pages, listing every detail of her life and I still would not have presented an even half-accurate picture of her” – at which point I did panic slightly. Thankfully, though, she limits herself to telling us that Amelia was always able to recognise a red car that belonged to Young’s brother, Richard – a detail that speaks to her main point, which is that cows (and sheep and chickens) are far more intelligent than people realise. Though this is relative, of course. As she also notes: “If a cow’s intelligence is sufficient to make her a success as a cow, what more could be wished?” However, they have other qualities, too, many of them contradictory. They are loyal, and have a tendency to hold grudges. But they are also apt to forget one another – even their poor, dead calves – within weeks. Some are vain, loving to be groomed and reluctant to go to bed at night with muddy ankles. Others are picky about food, showing a marked preference for, say, mouse-eared chickweed over other grasses. Young’s style, careful and straightforward, is extremely soothing; her book should be prescribed for anxiety. But it doesn’t, it must be said, answer all one’s cow questions. Bennett, in his diary, notes that he found himself wondering about their sex lives: are cows flirty? Young doesn’t tell us. Nor does she address the issue of their rage, which was, I must admit, the main reason I wanted to read The Secret Life of Cows. I am, you see, increasingly scared of strange cows, sometimes insisting to my husband that we detour on walks to avoid them; when they trot en masse towards you, as they seem to do more and more often, it is not un-frightening. I can’t help but think about the bit in Posy Simmonds’s graphic novel, Tamara Drewe, where the novelist Nicholas Hardiman meets his death in a field of cows: Simmonds grew up on a farm, and knows whereof she draws. Young, some of whose cows are (terrifyingly) able to cross cattle grids and perform all manner of other physical feats, tells us that when an animal shakes its head, it’s giving you a warning. The message is: keep away. But she does not expand on this, perhaps because, what with knowing her own beasts so very well, she has never been on the receiving end of cow rage. Apparently, she sometimes carries a large brush with her, the better to calm the curious and the cross with a few soothing strokes across the cliffs of their flanks – not something I’m likely to start doing any time soon. Still, one fact I do know now is that cows strongly object to perfume. This, I will remember. In the future, all walks will be strictly Mitsouko-free. • The Secret Life of Cows by Rosamund Young is published by Faber &amp; Faber (£9.99).

It’s small, blue and remarkably cute-looking for something that threatens one day to cost a lot of people their jobs. For what’s unusual about this car is that it wasn’t made in a distant Chinese factory before being shipped back to a warehouse here, then trucked to a shop, or dumped on a doorstep by an overworked Amazon driver with no time to ring the doorbell. This one came straight off a 3D printer, one of those faintly space age-sounding gizmos that works a bit like a normal printer except that you load it with plastic fibres instead of paper, and then programme it to “print” a solid object according to your preferred design. It’s slow and expensive now, which is why the car my son was given isn’t really a toy but a marketing gimmick. But it will get quicker and cheaper, maybe cheap enough that 3D printers will before long be as common (at least in better-off homes) as espresso machines are now. And when that happens, if you need to buy something new, smallish and plastic – a toy, a kitchen gadget, a spare part for something boring – you won’t have to go out and buy it. Just pay via an app for the appropriate design to be downloaded to your home printer, which could churn it out in the comfort of your kitchen. The virtues of no longer manufacturing and moving stuff great distances are obvious: not just convenience, but potentially huge environmental benefits. We’d need fewer polluting factories, fewer planes and ships and lorries clogging up the planet, and if we could figure out ways to recycle at home – melting down old plastic tat and using this raw material for printing out new plastic tat – infinitely less landfill. But the disadvantages are clear, too: vastly fewer jobs in factories, transport, warehousing and what’s left of retail, as what Amazon did to the high street eventually starts happening to middlemen like Amazon, too. And while there would be winners as well as losers, the losses would be dangerously unevenly spread. Women have been hardest hit by job losses in retail, but it’s men who would fare worse in this scenario. Consultancy firm PwC reckons 35% of men’s jobs are at high risk of automation versus only 26% of women’s, partly because women are more likely to work in human-facing, socially skilled professions such as teaching, which are harder for robots to master. The new jobs created by what is sometimes described as a fourth industrial revolution, meanwhile, are more likely to cluster in shiny Shoreditch than in the fading post-industrial towns where jobs would be lost. It’s not just a bomb ticking under employment and welfare policy, education and a system of taxation that currently relies heavily on real living humans having jobs on which to pay tax in the first place. It’s also a recipe for resentment, division and smouldering social unrest. All of which explains why Labour sidled closer this week to the idea of a robot tax – or, strictly speaking, taxing profits generated by automation, with the money perhaps used to retrain those whose working lives are disappearing or to forcibly spread the proceeds of new growth. True, Jeremy Corbyn promptly sidled away again in his keynote speech, delivering a somewhat watered-down version of what was briefed in advance. But if Labour is as yet maddeningly vague on the detail, it has at least put itself on the popular side of a big coming argument. The Tories have a lot of ground to make up when they meet in Manchester next week, and yesterday’s lecture from Theresa May about capitalism still being the engine of prosperity is an underwhelming start. Paradoxically, the hardest ideas for politicians to articulate convincingly can be the ones so obvious they’ve assumed it would always be taken as read. But accepted wisdom dissolves amazingly fast once enough people simply stop accepting that, say, Britain’s place is obviously in Europe, or that neither democracy nor capitalism is perfect but all the alternatives are worse. The biggest mistake in contemporary politics is failing to renew popular consent to things that seem obvious, but are no longer nearly so obvious to voters. The near-hysteria with which some Tories reacted to the mildest of interventions in Uber suggests that they still don’t understand how the climate has changed. Hostility towards tech moguls is building just as it once did towards bankers, and for much the same reasons: a wealthy elite threatening other people’s job security will eventually trigger a backlash, however much people like its products. Why else is Bill Gates backing a robot tax and Mark Zuckerberg a state-funded basic income for people who may lose out from automation? They are seeking to defuse that anger in advance, to preserve capitalism by offering reforms to it. May seemed to be attempting something similar when she first became leader, talking about standing up for those battered by the winds of change. But her Conservative party now looks woefully behind the curve of this argument, even though it, of all parties, should understand the instinct to conserve. The answer to renewing capitalism, by ensuring that the benefits of growth keep being shared as widely as possible even when working life is going through seismic changes, doesn’t necessarily have to be a robot tax. The idea still has holes in it that you could drive a truck through. How do you identify precisely which companies should pay? Would it only cover technologies invented in the future, and, if not, where’s the historical cut-off point? What if many of these companies are, like Google or Amazon, headquartered overseas? What if we’re wrong and this technological revolution ends up creating rather than destroying jobs? And what are the consequences if we do this and other countries don’t, given Brexit already makes us look like a reactionary backwater? (Why, it’s almost like we need to belong to some kind of pan-European union, through which countries could hammer out agreements on stuff like this.) But Conservatives shouldn’t mock the robot tax unless and until they’ve got something better to offer. Labour is on to something, even if it’s not yet quite sure what, and the Tories are running out of time to catch up. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist and former political editor of the Observer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/28/julia-louis-dreyfus-breast-cancer-diagnosis","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T18:03:37Z","webTitle":"Julia Louis-Dreyfus shares breast cancer diagnosis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/28/julia-louis-dreyfus-breast-cancer-diagnosis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/28/julia-louis-dreyfus-breast-cancer-diagnosis","fields":{"headline":"Julia Louis-Dreyfus shares breast cancer diagnosis","bodyText":"Julia Louis-Dreyfus has revealed that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer.

The brick-tastic brilliance of the new Lego House","bodyText":"Children are wrestling with the jaws of a shark in mid-attack, while others are trying their hand at surfing on wobbly boards, raised up on a bright blue platform overlooking the endless forest that stretches around the small Danish town of Billund. Elsewhere, yet more crowds of kids are leaping across rubber steps, shrieking with delight as they race to the swings on this multi-levelled, multi-coloured landscape. This gleaming ziggurat of fun is the new Lego House, a mind-blowing mecca for fans of the iconic construction toy, designed by BIG, the firm led by young Danish architect Bjarke Ingels. Now heading up a New York-based global empire, working on everything from Google’s new California campus to a Chinese energy firm’s HQ, Ingels sees the project as a homecoming. “We have finally graduated as Danish architects,” he says proudly. “We have made a brick building – without breaking the brick module in a single place.” Ingels is referring to the rule, particularly observed by meticulous Danes, that you should never cut a brick to fit with your design, but configure the design to fit the brick instead. For his first foray into bricks, Ingels couldn’t have landed a better commission – even if these are not actually bricks at all, but ceramic tiles clipped on to a steel frame. Rarely have architect and client been so well matched, given Ingels’ trademark brand of cartoonish quips, and his penchant for blocky forms. His buildings sometimes feel a little flat, more sheen than depth, but for a temple to Lego that couldn’t be more appropriate. The project is a triumph. This staggered pile of shiny white blocks, built just metres from the redbrick house and workshop where the family-owned company began in 1932, is the ultimate embodiment of the Lego brand. At two of its corners, the big blocks appear to melt, plunging down to form cascading steps, encouraging you to clamber up on to the colourful terraces that spiral up to the summit for views across the town. A row of skylights, resembling the circular studs of Lego bricks, allow you to peer down into the building at the marvels within – chiefly a row of three huge dinosaurs howling with rage because, as keen observers will notice, they’ve each trodden on a piece of Lego. “This had to be a place where even the most hardcore Lego fans would say, ‘Wow!’,” says Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, Lego CEO, who has been credited with turning the company around after it almost went bankrupt in 2004. “But it’s also about trying to revitalise the town centre, which has been left behind by all the development on the edge of the city, out near the airport. Visitors come to the Legoland and Lalandia theme parks, but they rarely venture into town.” As the employer of 4,500 of the 7,000 citizens of Billund, the company has an interest in the future of the place. It is fitting that the Lego House now stands on the site of the former town hall (which became redundant after municipal functions were recently consolidated), and Knudstorp says it is the centrepiece of a wider masterplan, on which BIG is also working, for Billund to become “the creative world capital of children”. It can sometimes be tricky to separate the company from the town: it was Lego that built the airport in the 1960s and it recently founded its own international school here, based on “playful pedagogy”. It is now busy building housing for its employees, as well as a vast new HQ, similarly envisioned as a stack of toy blocks. In an eerie touch, Lego security cars also glide around town, as if waiting for some spectacular cartoon crime scene from The Lego Movie to erupt. The opening of the Lego House comes at an awkward time for the brand. After years of untrammelled growth, the first half of 2017 saw revenue fall by 6%, leading to the announcement of 1,400 job losses earlier this month, 8% of the entire workforce. “We grew too quickly,” says Knudstorp, fiddling absentmindedly with a pile of bricks. “But I’m confident we’re back on track.” In the world of the Lego House, though, everything is awesome. First, you’re taken on a journey through 13 galleries, cleverly designed to appeal to kids and grown-ups, with just the right mix of interactive tech and traditional brick-based fun. Like everything Lego, it’s not cheap, with tickets costing 199 krone, or £24, for adults and children alike. You can try your hand at town-planning, Lego-style, with a digitised population of Lego mini-figures eagerly awaiting the arrival of housing, offices and green space, projected on to big model tables. The growing city adapts to whatever buildings visitors add, introducing young minds to such concepts as the logic of zoning. Elsewhere, guests are challenged to save a population of woolly mammoths stuck in the Arctic ice, using a fleet of Lego Mindstorms robots, or invited to create a school of colourful fish to be released into a digital aquarium. There are recording booths for making your own stop-motion animation, and racing car components waiting for you to click a vehicle together and hurtle it down a ramp. All of these virtual wonders can be uploaded and enjoyed later on an accompanying app. But other zones are dedicated to what Lego has always done best: bricks. Mountains of them are everywhere, with buckets built into every bench and huge troughs filled by gushing brick waterfalls, along with galleries dedicated to impossibly detailed fantasy worlds full of amusing scenes, many submitted by Lego fans themselves. “We thought, ‘If we gave a Lego superfan enough time and bricks, what would they make?’” says Stuart Harris, the man in charge of concocting these elaborate structures. The result is a robot smashing through the back of an opera house, U2 playing on the roof of an English pub, a streaker running across a football pitch, and many other surreal tableaux. For serious AFOLs (adult fans of Lego), though, the sepulchral basement will be the highlight. Here, the Lego story is told with precious early prototypes from the archive spotlit in glass cases and arranged around a hallowed central shrine, where the most popular lines throughout the ages are on display, along with a digitised table of every Lego set ever made. Just in case it was all getting too grown-up, there’s a family of Lego moles, burrowing through the floor. Museum cafes are seldom much to celebrate, but here again the brick brand has surpassed itself. “The mini-figures in the kitchen can’t understand us when we speak to them,” says an apologetic waitress, “so we have to give them your order in the form of Lego bricks.” Guests must then assemble their brick lunch, scan it in, then marvel as a Lego lunchbox trundles out of the kitchen, down a spiralling conveyor belt and into their hands, via a pair of humanoid robots. Visiting children were in raptures. In all of these jaw-dropping theatrics, the building fades into the background, a neutral setting of white volumes, gently tinted by the brightly coloured floors, always giving glimpses into other galleries. The designers have thankfully resisted the temptation to take the Lego theme too far – there are no oversized Lego doors, windows or light fittings. The simple Lego brick is the key: all of the furniture and exhibits are made from standard Lego pieces, enlarged to the same scale as the building, so you can go home and make a model of the entire thing yourself. Or buy the official version in the gift shop for £60. Finally, as you leave, you pass a rumbling machine that spurts out packets of six red bricks, which each visitor is given, along with a combination card suggesting one way to put them together. “Considering six bricks can be configured in over 915 million ways,” says Harris, “it should keep us going for at least the next 3,000 years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2017/oct/09/tensions-flare-as-food-rations-to-refugees-slashed-by-half-in-uganda","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T12:23:46Z","webTitle":"Tensions in Uganda after funding delays lead to reduced food rations for refugees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/09/tensions-flare-as-food-rations-to-refugees-slashed-by-half-in-uganda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/oct/09/tensions-flare-as-food-rations-to-refugees-slashed-by-half-in-uganda","fields":{"headline":"Tensions in Uganda after funding delays lead to reduced food rations for refugees","bodyText":"The flood of people fleeing South Sudan, coupled with delays and constraints on funding, has led to a shortfall in food rations to refugees. According to agencies working on the ground in Uganda, where most of the refugees have been arriving from the conflict across the border, food supply lines are being shut down and distribution of aid is becoming increasing irregular. The UN’s World Food Programme said it had been forced to cut the amount of grain handed out due to delayed funding, with cash transfers offered to refugees to make up the shortfall. “When the funding comes late it takes a bit longer to secure the cereals. It means that you have to go to the markets to procure, transport, store and distribute,” said El Khidir Daloum, WFP director for Uganda. In the past fortnight, South Sudanese refugees at Nyumanzi settlement in Adjumani, which hosts about 20,000 people, protested in front of officials from the prime minister’s office. Titus Jogo, refugee desk officer in Adjumani, said that they had to calm people down and explain that, while the WFP did not have enough cereal stocks this month, money would be provided instead so that people could buy food at the local market. Andie Lambe, executive director at International Refugee Rights Initiative, said: “Our understanding is that the ration cuts this month were as a result of a break in the food pipeline within WFP and that these cuts are both temporary and that the gap was substituted with a cash equivalent of the missing ration. In addition, WFP assured us that this would not be applied to recent arrivals and vulnerable households. “The refugees are dependent on handouts due to the lack of alternatives for them to support themselves. When rumours of rations being permanently cut or stopped altogether are combined with actual cuts and without clear explanation being given for this, tensions will increase and it is not unreasonable for refugees to voice their disquiet.” The sheer scale of the disaster, in which more than 86% of refugees are women and children, means that strains have been put on already scarce resources. “Uganda is dealing with a refugee crisis of historic proportions and the country and its humanitarian partners have not been able to meet the needs of one million South Sudanese who have sought protection from violence in a relatively short amount of time,” said Francisca Vigaud-Walsh of Refugees International. “Uganda has an exemplary refugee policy and has done what it can to provide safe harbour and land to refugees, but the needs of refugees outstrip the capacity of humanitarian responders, given that the funding simply isn’t there,” she said. In May this year, WFP was forced to cut food rations to refugees in the east African nation by 50% due to severe funding shortages. The agency need an estimated $167m (£126m) to provide aid through to the end of the year, but donors contributed only $30m as of September. WFP needs $58m to help scale up, sustain and expand life-saving assistance and protection for the next six months of more than 1.3 million refugees. “Every month we need $20m to feed the refugees in Uganda. For the next six months we have a shortage of $62m to $85m for refugees,” said Daloum. “We know what it takes to secure those resources, but at the same time, this is a life-saving issue.” The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, hosted a summit in June in Kampala to call for action for South Sudanese refugees, with $674m needed to support them in 2017. However by August, only 21% of that sum had been raised. • This article was amended on Thursday 12 October to clarify that South Sudanese refugees received money as well as food rations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/03/school-results-music-bradford","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"How to improve the school results: not extra maths but music, loads of it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/03/school-results-music-bradford","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/03/school-results-music-bradford","fields":{"headline":"How to improve the school results: not extra maths but music, loads of it","bodyText":"Abiha Nasir, aged nine, walks quietly into the small classroom, takes a seat, adjusts her hijab and picks up the drumsticks. A shy smile spreads across her face as she begins to play. She was just five when she turned up at Feversham primary academy’s after-school clubs, leaving teachers astounded by her musical ability and how her confidence grew with an instrument in hand. Last year, Abiha successfully auditioned for Bradford’s gifted and talented music programme for primary school children, the first Muslim girl to do so. The assessor recorded only one word in her notes: “Wow!” Abiha’s teachers say her talent might have gone unspotted in many schools, where subjects such as music and art are being squeezed out by pressure to reach Sats targets and climb league tables. But at Feversham, the headteacher, Naveed Idrees, has embedded music, drama and art into every part of the school day, with up to six hours of music a week for every child, and with remarkable results. Seven years ago Feversham was in special measures and making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Today it is rated “good” by Ofsted and is in the top 10% nationally for pupil progress in reading, writing and maths, according to the most recent data. In 2011, the school was 3.2 percentage points behind the national average in English. This year 74% of its pupils achieved the expected standard in reading, writing and maths, against a national average of 53%. It is 7.1 points above the average for reading and 3.4 above for writing. In maths, the school was 2.4 points behind the national average in 2011 and is now 6.5 above it. Its results for disadvantaged pupils are well above average. The turnaround is even more notable given the makeup of the school: 99% of its 510 children speak English as an additional language, and half arrive at school unable to speak a word of English. The area outside the school gates, Bradford Moor, is one of the city’s most deprived and densely populated neighbourhoods. Nearly three-quarters of the surrounding population are of Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Indian heritage, compared with just over a quarter in the city as a whole, according to the 2011 census. A recent influx of refugees and a longer-term increase in the number of eastern Europeans has added to community tensions in an area where the city council has noted that different ethnic groups “don’t necessarily get on well or treat each other with respect”. Inside the school gates, however, it’s a different story. Thirty different languages are spoken but the youngsters all learn happily alongside one another. The children practise Shakespeare and the Beatles as well as Muslim worship songs called Nasheeds. They learn Hi Low Chickalow, the playground clapping game, as well as studying the second world war and the songs of Ahmad Hussain, a Sheffield-born YouTube star who performs for the school every year. A “tiny percentage” of Muslim parents were concerned about their children listening to pop songs or Christian music, according to Jimmy Rotheram, the school’s energetic music coordinator, but he says those concerns disappeared when they saw the progress their children were making.Once the school’s end-of-year concert would be attended only by a handful of sceptical parents, now it sells out every year. The school’s attendance has increased to 98%, as the amount of music taught to each pupil has risen. Every child will get at least two hours of music a week. As a bare minimum, each child gets a 30-minute music lesson, a half-hour follow-up lesson, plus a one-hour music assembly with a guest musician and group singing. Songs are incorporated into other classes and pupils often sing about times tables, or history. Idrees, who became headteacher in 2013, admits the new approach was a “big risk” but he says he is now convinced it could transform other struggling schools. “We were in special measures. We had low staff morale, parents not happy with the school, results were poor and nobody wanted to come here, we had budget issues. It’s a downward spiral when you’re there. If you’re losing kids you’re losing money, then you can’t attract teachers, those you’ve got are depressed. You get monitored by Ofsted every term and it’s all about results, results, results,” he says. “We could have gone down the route where we said we need to get results up, we’re going to do more English, more maths, more booster classes, but we didn’t. You might hit the results but your staff morale is gone, the kids hate learning. We want kids to enjoy learning.” The school bases its method on the Kodály approach, which involves teaching children to learn, subconsciously at first, through playing musical games. Children learn rhythm, hand signs and movement, for example, in a way that will help their reading, writing and maths. Idrees says teachers have found that asking children to memorise passages of Shakespeare’s The Tempest, for example, improves reading and writing. Lost in the debate around Sats testing and league tables, Idrees says, is the importance of children’s mental and social development. This came to the fore in Bradford two years ago when an 11-year-old at a school on the other side of the city, Asad Khan, killed himself amid claims he had been bullied. Worried parents were knocking on headteachers’ doors across Bradford, Idrees says, concerned about their own children’s welfare. After Asad’s death, Feversham piloted a project to help children deal with failure, peer pressure and media influences. “A lot of these quiet kids, they don’t know how to deal with emotions, they don’t know how to deal with negativity,” Idrees says. At its most basic, the simple act of game-playing can help children learn social skills such as eye contact and taking turns, while listening to music in an hour-long assembly helps develop their concentration in an age dominated by smartphones and tablet computers. The focus on creativity has improved results across the school, not just among the musically gifted, Rotheram says, adding that it is “demonstrably more effective than drilling Sats papers”. “My hope is that headteachers and people holding purse strings, possibly even the people who make important decisions in the government, will read about our school and realise that creative subjects are not mere add-ons but essential for the progress of all pupils.” Back in class, Abiha bursts into another impressive drum solo – so loud it can be heard from the playground outside. She practises at home, she explains, but only on her dad’s PS3 drum kit and on a tablet computer. Soon she hopes to upgrade to the real thing: “Now he’s going to sell that [PS3] drum kit and buy a real one. He’s making a different room with noise-proofed walls because the neighbours might report us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/01/foodie-traveller-chinese-sichuan-hot-pot-pepper-chilli","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"Hotpot hotspot: the chilli-infused dish that fires up Chongqing, China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/01/foodie-traveller-chinese-sichuan-hot-pot-pepper-chilli","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/01/foodie-traveller-chinese-sichuan-hot-pot-pepper-chilli","fields":{"headline":"Hotpot hotspot: the chilli-infused dish that fires up Chongqing, China","bodyText":"“Hotpot is an institution. It’s about the atmosphere, not just the food,” says Jordan Porter of Chengdu Food Tours. The spiritual home of Sichuan mala (numblingly spicy) hotpot is Chongqing in south-west China – with 37 million people in its urban area it one of the world’s largest cities. The dish migrated south from Mongolia hundreds of years ago, and is now synonymous with this megacity. As Chongqing develops upwards and outwards, love of hotpot is about the only thing that has stood still. The more than 50,000 hotpot restaurants in Chongqing are almost impossible to rank, so the best advice is to look for a restaurant with a big atmosphere. Downtown Chongqing, near the Jiefangbei business district, is a good place to start. Lin Jiangmen (2 Zhonghua Alley) has a neon flame on the shopfront, a fridge stacked with Chongqing beer and a sack of dried chillies by the door. It’s also packed with families and groups of friends pulling tasty titbits from the steaming broth. The hotpot’s tongue-numbing sensation comes from the presence of the hydroxy alpha sanshool molecule in Sichuan peppercorns, which are added to a fiery mix of beef lard, chillies, cardamom and fennel. Into it goes anything you like: lotus root, bean sprouts, rare strips of beef, duck intestine ... but once it’s dropped into the oil, anything that comes out will be way up there on the Scoville scale. The best way to cool off is with glugs of weak Chongqing beer, served in shallow ceramic bowls. And most importantly, tuck in your napkin – hotpots are pretty splashy, too. • 3-4 hour walking tour around £45pp with Chengdu Food Tours"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/01/hsbc-app-all-bank-accounts-one-place","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"HSBC app will show all your bank accounts in one place","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/01/hsbc-app-all-bank-accounts-one-place","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/01/hsbc-app-all-bank-accounts-one-place","fields":{"headline":"HSBC app will show all your bank accounts in one place","bodyText":"Banking customers will soon be able to see all their accounts from different providers in one place, making it easier for them to manage their money, it is claimed. HSBC is trialling an app with 10,000 customers from the end of October, ahead of a general release to its UK customers in early 2018. It says the app will give people a “joined-up view of their financial life” and that it is a first for a major UK bank. Customers will be able to see all their accounts on one screen and add accounts from up to 21 providers including Santander, Lloyds and Barclays. The technology will let users see not only their current accounts, but also loans, mortgages and savings if they are visible via online banking. While it might sound whizzy and newfangled, people with long memories may feel a sense of deja vu. Back in 2002, internet bank Egg launched a service enabling customers to view and manage their bank, savings and credit card accounts, including those held with other banks and providers, on a single webpage. This one-click access to a person’s entire online account information, called “aggregation”, was controversial at the time, with some banks objecting to being named as being covered by the service. Citibank launched a similar service in the UK around that time. HSBC says its app builds on a previous trial that saw customers save £126 on average over two months. New features will be added over the next few months to help users take more control of their spending, borrowing and saving. These will include tools allowing people to save bit by bit as they spend, by rounding up amounts when they do spend, and sending the extra amounts into a savings account."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/28/newcastle-falcons-premiership-london-irish","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T15:50:02Z","webTitle":"Newcastle Falcons flying high in Premiership after years of turbulence | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/28/newcastle-falcons-premiership-london-irish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/28/newcastle-falcons-premiership-london-irish","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle Falcons flying high in Premiership after years of turbulence","bodyText":"Exactly 20 years ago Newcastle Falcons were in the process of revolutionising English rugby. No club was quicker – thanks to Sir John Hall’s chequebook – to embrace the possibilities of professionalism and no side had ever lifted the domestic title within a year of being promoted. It lingers all the more clearly in the memory because the Falcons have achieved nothing like it since. Fifteen long seasons have passed since they even finished in the top half of the Premiership table and much turbulent off-field water has passed beneath the Tyne Bridge in that period. It would, consequently, be a landmark of genuine local significance should Dean Richards’s side beat London Irish at Kingston Park on Friday and finish the weekend on top of the Premiership table, something they have done for only a solitary week this century, back in September 2004. As well as further underpinning Richards’s rebuilding job and the loyalty of the owner, Semore Kurdi, a fourth win in five games would also reward the input of several others who have grafted away without fanfare for years. Will Welch, for example, was only 22 when Richards made him club captain following the Falcons’ relegation to the Championship. Five years on, the durable Welch is still at the helm of a club that, aside from their transplanted fixture in Philadelphia, have beaten Worcester, Sale and Bath so far. Not that anyone involved with the Falcons is in any danger of getting carried away. There are no trophies for leading the Premiership in September and this week’s spike in media interest is attracting a good deal of scepticism. “Keeping a lid on all the hype is probably the next challenge, because we’ve won a few games and people are beginning to blow smoke up our backsides a little,” the forwards coach, John Wells, cautioned. The lock forward Calum Green feels similarly: “You can tell we’re doing well because all of a sudden a lot of cameras and journalists are turning up for our press conferences and TV stations are sniffing around.” Not everyone, it seems, has flown home from the United States with a keener evangelical grasp of what makes professional sport tick. The good news is that, inside the circled geordie wagons, morale is higher than in ages. There was a stage, with their England players filing out of Kingston Park and the club’s financial outlook a couple of Metro stops beyond grim, when even passionate locally born lads such as Welch wondered what the future might hold: “The years up to us being relegated were pretty tough because we were always down towards the bottom. Coming back up was hard, too, for a couple of seasons. You’re scrapping away and it’s quite hard to see when you’re going to get that bump up the table.” Welch, a back-row forward good enough in Richards’s expert opinion to have toured with England in Argentina alongside his consistently impressive team-mate Mark Wilson, looks around the dressing room these days and detects both more belief and quality. Tonga’s indomitable back-rower Nili Latu and his compatriot Sonatane Takulua at scrum-half bring both skill and presence, the backline is purring under Dave Walder’s tutelage and Green is snaffling a lot of lineout ball. Welch and Green also feature among the league’s top five tacklers so far, underlining the team’s more consistent work rate. Collectively there has also been an emphasis on better game awareness and discipline, looking to be more positive and training harder and smarter, with Walder’s elevation to head coach emphasising that mental shift. “Dave’s put a really good stamp on what we want to be about this year: going out to attack games, play what we see and hopefully get the rewards from that,” Welch said. “It’s about making sure that, day to day, we’re coming into training to make ourselves better. In our heavy session early in the week we’re not just going through the motions; it’s not just about ticking a box ahead of the weekend. Last year training would be a bit up and down and that followed through into games.” The thrilling 33-32 win at Bath last Saturday, having led 19-0 before a late rally snuffed out the home team’s own revival, was particularly satisfying given Newcastle conceded 50 points at the Recreation Ground last season. “There was a point in the game when you were thinking: ‘Oh no, not again,’” admitted Welch, who has overcome a midweek bug to lead his side out against Irish. “That could have happened again but we’ve developed a lot more resilience and understanding of what we’re trying to do. We now know that if we stick to what we say we’re going to do and keep hold of the ball we can score tries. The club’s definitely heading in the right direction. Top six would be a good goal for us ... that’s what we’re looking to strive for at the minute.” Life in this most unforgiving of leagues will inevitably grow harder, with Exeter away and Leicester at home next. But as Welch describes his pride at being a Falcon – “When you’re playing for a club that means a lot to you, you’re willing to go that extra mile; to have northern teams pushing up the table would be good for the Premiership and rugby as a whole” – there is no shortage of edge or will power. The north‑easterly winds of change are finally starting to freshen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/08/15-best-political-novels-and-plays-observer-supplement","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"From Middlemarch to King Richard III: 15 of the best political novels and plays","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/08/15-best-political-novels-and-plays-observer-supplement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/08/15-best-political-novels-and-plays-observer-supplement","fields":{"headline":"From Middlemarch to King Richard III: 15 of the best political novels and plays","bodyText":"Native Son by Richard Wright (1940) Richard Wright wrote to his friend William Faulkner that black and white Americans were engaged in a “war over the nature of reality”. The terms of Wright’s engagement in that ongoing war were set by his 1940 novel Native Son, which sold 250,000 copies in its first three weeks. The novel tells the story of Bigger Thomas, a native of the south side of Chicago in the 1930s, who murders two women, one white and one black. Its controversy was rooted in the case Bigger’s lawyer makes in mitigating his crimes in the context of racist oppression – that white society is also responsible. The book did much to politicise the civil rights generation and continues to be a key reference point for #BlackLivesMatter. The Good Soldier Švejk by Jaroslav Hašek (1923) Hašek’s furious and hilarious satire of the first world war remained unfinished at his death in 1923, but inspired every subsequent act of rebellion in eastern Europe and beyond. Based on his own experiences in the conflict, the grim adventures of Hašek’s indelible infantryman established the idea of war as the ultimate human absurdity. Joseph Heller often said Catch 22 could never have existed without it.The book was banned by Nazis and Soviet communists, but Švejk’s mixture of cunning and resilience had the last laugh among Czechoslavakia’s samizdat intellectuals who reflected its spirit, and cited its influence, in the 1989 revolution. Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand (1957) Rand’s final novel has, since its publication in 1957, been the bible of libertarians and neo-liberals, and is arguably the novel that most closely reflects the political spirit of the current “make America great again” movement. It describes the efforts of a family to keep open their railroad company in the face of an overbearing state. Set in a dystopian America, it imagines a nation brought to its knees by excessive regulation and attempts to show how great visionary individuals, “ethical egoists”, the prime movers of history and wealth creation, can be beaten down and destroyed by unchecked “socialist” politics. The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood (1985) Canadian writer and activist Margaret Atwood’s novel – recently a celebrated Channel 4 series – presents a very different kind of American dystopia, in which a warped and fundamentalist Christian dictatorship has taken control of the country. The book is told in the voice of Offred, a woman whom we discover to be among many held captive as “handmaids” to ensure reproduction to counter growing sterility in the population. The novel satirises the strain of evangelical puritanism in American culture and the objectification and control of women’s bodies. It is more broadly a contemporary myth of despotic power, and how such power deforms those who are subjected to it. The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists by Robert Tressell (1914) Robert Tressell was the pen name of Robert Noonan, an Irish painter and decorator who settled in Hastings in 1901. The novel is rooted in his own struggle to find work and raise his daughter as a single parent. The novel’s hero, Frank Owen, is a socialist at the time when the labour movement was first gaining ground in British politics. As Owen works on a house renovation, he rails against capitalism and the cast of corrupt politicians and hypocritical liberals who support it – and the workers who accept it. The book was widely rejected and remained unpublished at Noonan’s death, but was saved by his daughter and eventually championed by George Orwell, who called it the book “everyone should read”. What a Carve Up! by Jonathan Coe (1994) The excesses of Thatcherism were the inspiration for many telling satires – from Martin Amis’s Money to Alan Hollinghurst’s The Line of Beauty – but no book skewered the 1980s quite as effectively and entertainingly as Coe’s brief history of the fictitious Winshaw family. Between them, the heirs to Winshaw Towers cover most bases of that venal political decade: tabloid columnist, arms dealer, factory farmer, investment banker, gallerist and politician. Their apocalyptic rivalries and loyalties create an unforgettable vision of a society sold off to the highest bidder. Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe (1958) Chinua Achebe once observed that his mission as a writer was to show African readers that their home had not been a life of unstoried darkness before the arrival of western colonialism. His greatest book comprehensively dismantled the idea of Africa as presented in the western canon. The epic story of the wrestling champion and tribal leader Okonkwo is steeped in a sophisticated Nigerian, Igbo culture – a society undermined by colonial influence. Both a call to arms and a raising of consciousness, Achebe’s novel captured the growing spirit of self-determination on the continent and remains a defining political landmark. Middlemarch by George Eliot (1871) Set in the years of the Great Reform Act of 1832 and written just after its successor, the Reform Act of 1867, George Eliot’s masterpiece unpicks every nuance of the ethics and economics of Victorian progress. Its characters share a faith that they can make the world a better place; the novel quietly and inexorably proves a good deal of this faith a delusion or a vanity. Along the way, Eliot makes the world of Dorothea Brooke and Will Ladislaw, Tertius Lydgate and Rosamond Vincy, a tangible vision of provincial society – and a stage for the reality of liberal idealism. Midnight’s Children by Salman Rushdie (1981) Rushdie’s novel took a post-colonial “empire fights back” spirit, and a deep personal understanding of the politics of Indian partition, and exploded them into something teeming with imaginative life. Drawing inspiration from the magic realism of Gabriel García Márquez, his book found a voice, rooted in lived experience, to capture the sometimes brutal and often fantastical fallout of independence and its implications. Anglo-Indian narrator Saleem Sinai is “handcuffed to history” by the hour of his birth – at midnight on the day of India’s independence. He inhabits a hybrid consciousness, with a telepathic connection to the other children of midnight, and tells its stories for all he is worth. The Way We Live Now by Anthony Trollope (1875) The Way We Live Now was Trollope’s angriest novel, an 844-page destruction of the London society he returned to in the 1870s after a couple of years in the colonies. It begins as a satire on the literary establishment – the boudoir novelist Lady Carbury buying favours from malleable critics – but the book is soon hijacked by the grander corruption of city and state. The author of that corruption, Augustus Melmotte, sounds a clarion call for his own age (and plenty to follow): “I am proud to be an Englishman in these times! What is the engine of this world? Profit. Gentlemen, it is your duty to make yourself rich!” ROBERT MCCRUM’S PICK OF THE PLAYS King Richard III by William Shakespeare (1591) This tour-de-force by the young Shakespeare portrays Richard of Gloucester, “the bottled spider”, as ambitious, bloody and treacherous, a murderer and a ruthless usurper. Shakespeare’s account of Henry Richmond (later Henry VII) defeating Richard at Bosworth gave the Tudor dynasty a legitimacy it craved. The playwright’s demonisation of the Plantagenet king owes a lot to Sir Thomas More’s History of King Richard III, which is not as saintly as its author. Mother Courage and Her Children by Bertolt Brecht (1939) Sometimes said to be the greatest play of the 20th century, and perhaps also the greatest anti-war play of all time, Mother Courage was written in weeks in 1939 “in a white heat” by the German dramatist and poet, in response to the horrors of Nazism and the outbreak of the second world war. Brecht’s principles of political drama insisted that the play should not be set in modern times but during the Thirty Years’ War of 1618–1648, a bloody conflict involving all of central Europe. Brecht follows the fortunes of Anna Fierling, nicknamed “Mother Courage”, a cunning canteen worker with the Swedish army who is determined to make her living from the war. Over the course of the play, she loses all three of her children to the very war which she has tried to exploit for her own advantage. It became widely adopted for the international stage during the 1960s as a play of protest against America’s involvement in the Vietnam war. Soldiers by Rolf Hochhuth (1967) Subtitled “an obituary for Geneva”, this play became intensely controversial for its allegation that Winston Churchill had connived in the death of the Polish prime minister, General Wladyslaw Sikorski, in a 1943 air crash in order to appease Stalin. Writing around a century after the first Geneva Convention, Hochhuth, an excitable polemicist, also focused on Churchill’s support for the indiscriminate fire-bombing of German cities, such as Dresden. The play was scheduled to be premiered at the National Theatre in London, but this was cancelled after the row. It was subsequently produced in the West End, though its success was inhibited by a lawsuit that Hochhuth subsequently lost. Top Girls by Caryl Churchill (1982) An explosive examination of feminist ideals set in Thatcher’s Britain during the 1980s. Churchill considers what it means to be successful as a woman, dramatising her argument with historical characters. Churchill also contrasted American feminism and its celebration of money and power among successful women with the socialist ideals of British feminism, which was instead focused on collective action for the common good. Top Girls became famous for its assault on the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, emphatically not “a sister”, but a woman who celebrated personal achievement and believed in free-market capitalism. Marlene, the play’s tough career woman, is portrayed as soulless. Churchill questions whether it is possible for women to combine a successful career with a thriving family life. Mountain Language by Harold Pinter (1988) This late Pinter play was inspired, in part, by a visit the playwright made to Turkey with his friend Arthur Miller. Pinter became obsessed by the torture of ethnic minorities and, as a writer acutely attuned to the power of speech in relation to individual humanity, by the way in which oppressive governments in history have deprived minorities of self-expression. When the play’s origins became disputed, Pinter wrote that “throughout history, many languages have been banned – the Irish have suffered, the Welsh have suffered and the Urdu and the Estonians’ language banned”. It remains, fundamentally, a landmark protest on behalf of free speech. This is part of the Observer’s 100 political classics that shaped the modern era.

Haringey council in north London, which is carrying out a major regeneration project in association with the developer Lendlease, said it would resist the idea of a compulsory ballot. The Haringey Labour councillor Alan Strickland, who holds the housing and regeneration brief, said: “We will continue to put comprehensive and meaningful engagement with residents at the heart of our regeneration plans, but we do not expect to start using yes/no ballots.” The borough cited guidance from the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, which warns ballots “can risk turning a complex set of issues that affects different people in different ways over many years into a simple yes/no decision at a single point in time”. The ballot idea was among a cluster of housing policies outlined by Corbyn during his speech to the Labour party conference in Brighton on Wednesday. The leader said he believed too many council regeneration schemes amounted to “forced gentrification and social cleansing”, with social tenants pushed out by private developers. Corbyn said that under a Labour government, those who lived on an estate earmarked for redevelopment would have to be guaranteed a replacement home at the same site and on the same terms, and no work could take place unless approved by a ballot of existing tenants and leaseholders. The plans were viewed by many as a thinly veiled attack on some Labour-run councils, especially in London, where boroughs such as Haringey, Southwark and Lambeth have carried out huge and often controversial rebuilding schemes. Facing a squeeze in funding and increased pressure for housing, councils and others have sought to replace 1960s council estates with privately built developments, some including little social or affordable housing. Other councils were more circumspect but defended their regeneration plans. Mark Williams, in charge of housing in Southwark, said opponents of schemes such as the ongoing rebuilding of the 1960s Aylesbury estate had wrongly claimed many tenants were being forced out of the area, when 95% of those who had moved still lived in the borough. Corbyn’s plans do, however, tap into longstanding public opposition to some of the schemes. In Lambeth, residents of a 1960s low-rise estate, Cressingham Gardens, have fought a long battle against the council’s plans to demolish what they say is a vibrant community. Jo Parkes, one of the campaigners, said that after Lambeth declined to ballot residents on its plans, her group did, and found 86% of households opposed them, with a 72% response rate. Parkes said she believed campaigns such as the Cressingham one had helped push Corbyn into action. “Absolutely,” she said. “We’ve been talking about it for some time, and it had been a bit disappointing that Corbyn was silent on this before now. “You can understand that as a politician he didn’t want to wind up his Labour councils, but now it seems the grassroots within the party are influencing policy, and he’s got to put his money where his mouth is.” One senior Labour figure in a council, speaking anonymously, said that if Corbyn wanted to crack down on public-private housing schemes he would need to find a replacement source of funding. He said: “One thing missing from the speech is that there wasn’t an acceptance that while the aims are perfectly laudable, a Labour government would have to put serious amounts of cash behind it. I think it would, but that has to be recognised.” A source in the national Labour party said Corbyn had a plan to fund the proposals. “There would be new funding,” the source said. “Jeremy recognises councils have had to be creative over these plans, and his speech wasn’t intended as a direct criticism of them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/sep/28/corrections-and-clarifications--","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T20:00:05Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/28/corrections-and-clarifications--","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/sep/28/corrections-and-clarifications--","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• In an article (Law review on police pursuit of moped gangs, 26 September, page 4) we said that Henry Hicks was killed when his moped collided with an unmarked police car during a high-speed chase.

Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery.” These lines kept returning to me as I read Jeffrey Eugenides’s excellent short story collection, in which two new pieces bookend work first published in magazines and literary journals between 1989 and 2013. Despite the stories being written over such a long period, one in which Eugenides won the Pulitzer prize for his novel Middlesex (which has sold upwards of 4m copies and made its author very wealthy indeed), there is a uniformity to its concern with financial matters: whatever their annual income, many of the characters we encounter in these pages are at least ought and six over Micawber’s threshold. If the theme is unexpected, the way it manifests, as a kind of longing, is consistent with the subjects of Eugenides’s novels. In “Timeshare”, the narrator’s father, thoroughly Micawberish in the way his optimism overcomes all the empirical data, claims the dilapidated motel he has spent every penny on “is going to get all fixed up and we’re going to make a million dollars!” In “Early Music”, a teacher is swamped by debt incurred paying for his cherished clavichord, but for which family life leaves no time. “If I make a million bucks,” his wife says, “I’ll pay off your clavichord.” In “Great Experiment”, Kendall, editor of a tiny, high-minded publishing house, a porn magnate’s vanity project, colludes with an accountant to defraud the company. “I’m talking maybe half a million for you, half a mil for me,” the accountant tells him. “Maybe, if things go smooth, a million each. Then we shut it down, cover our tracks, and move to Bermuda.” In each of these stories, that “million dollars” is an unrealisable fantasy; in each Eugenides deploys his pronounced gifts for comedy and characterisation at the same time as he builds an overwhelming atmosphere of suffocation. It is hard to say exactly why money exerts such fascination for the author. It can efficiently propel a story towards crisis, of course, but beyond that it emerges from these pages as the central subject of American life, driving the country but also infecting its citizens with a kind of mania. In “Great Experiment” particularly, Eugenides is blatant about this: it opens with Kendall surveying the skyline of Chicago, “refulgent in early-evening, late-capitalist light”. “Kendall had never expected to be as rich as his parents,” we learn later, “but he’d never imagined that he would earn so little or that it would bother him so much.” His family lives in “middle-class squalor” in “a big fixer-upper in Oak Park, without being able to fix it up”. They long to be able to afford hired help, envy the neighbour’s Range Rover and lust over the renovations and “handsome, affluent families” depicted in the architectural magazines they read out of a blend of aspiration and masochism. For Della in “Complainers”, one of two new stories, the housing problem is more acute: her sons claim they can’t afford more than the prison-like retirement community they have moved her to. They can, but greed or miserliness prevents them. In the extremely funny and dark “Baster”, where Darwinism meets consumerism, the greed isn’t for cash but genetic material, the ultimate commodity. Wally Mars’s ex-girlfriend Tomasina, 40 and despairing of finding a mate, shops for a surrogate father. Wally, still in love with Tomasina and bitter that his shortness, “buggy eyes and potato nose” disqualify him from contention, notes that while men’s objectification of women is widely acknowledged, “none of our sizing up of breasts and legs can compare with the coldblooded calculation of a woman in the market for semen”. Wally considers himself “a catch, pragmatically speaking. I make a lot of money, for one thing”, but still has too much in the debit column to get what he really wants. Only in “Air Mail”, probably the best story in the collection, does the obsession with money and acquisition recede – from the story’s surface, at least. Instead we witness the spiritual awakening, on a Thai island amid a turbulent bout of diarrhoea, of the American college student Mitchell Grammaticus, whom readers will know from Eugenides’s novel The Marriage Plot. Searching for enlightenment, Mitchell interprets the constant ringing he hears as a herald of revelation, although it might as easily be a symptom of malnourishment. The story ends with Mitchell floating in the warm water of the Gulf of Thailand, bathed in moonlight, “his insides emptying out … a steady flow of his essence into nature”. Yet he is suspended not only by the warm sea, but also by his wealth: whereas other characters’ credit cards are markers of debt, small, weighty millstones with “horrendous running balances”, his is a gift from his parents, a magic carpet he can summon at any time to carry him home. Among Eugenides’s characters only Mitchell, rich, young and independent, can afford not to think about money. • Fresh Complaint is published by 4th Estate.

The artist, who died in Paris in 1973 aged 47, was neglected for years outside her native Poland. Only in the past decade has she begun to be recognised with major exhibitions at, for example, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2013, and now at the Hepworth, Wakefield, the first major exhibition of her sculpture in the UK. Perhaps because of this very absence, because she has not been absorbed into the tidy narratives of art history, her sculptures can look as if they have been created by a singular imagination from another world. There are bulbous shapes cast in resin from human bellies, embedded in a sea of polyurethane foam; lipstick-red lips and nipples growing from slender stems like flowers and serving as lamps; shiny boulders of alabaster-like resin from which crushed-up human features emerge – her own cast face. (These last are called “personified tumours”, and were made after she was diagnosed with breast cancer, from which she eventually died.) There is a lot of shine and slime in her work. Things seem to melt and dissolve or, conversely, solidify like lava. A work called Stele – the title a reference to the funerary monuments of classical antiquity – shows a woman’s lips, chin and knees protruding from a slab of what almost looks like hardened tar, as if the gravestone has engulfed or consumed, rather than commemorated, a corpse. These are works that are not easy to look at. They make you think, at times, of the fleeting beauty of the body, but also of its leakages and effusions, of what fails to be contained by the skin: sputum, mucus, discharge. They are not polite; they are not what you might call “tasteful”. For all that the work can seem alien, Szapocznikow was no outsider: as Andrew Bonacina, co-curator of the exhibition at the Hepworth points out, she was plugged into the artistic movements and conversations of her time, and you can, if you so choose, read her sculpture in relation to pop art, to late‑flowering surrealism, and to neo-realism. Her friends included artists such as César, Annette Messager, the young Christian Boltanski and Louise Bourgeois. She made an exchange of works with the last: Bourgeois kept a pair of Szapocznikow’s lip-lamps in her bedroom. She was a vivid presence on the art scene in Paris, the city where she spent most of her adult life. “She was a fantastic artist and a lovely woman,” says her son, Piotr Stanisławski, “but you didn’t want to cross her. She could become extremely angry. If you were going to sum her up in two words, they would be ‘love and hate’.” She was seductive, persuasive, he says. People ended up “besotted by her charm”. Photographs of her in her studio show a woman of intense and buoyant beauty with an utterly disarming grin. Hervé Loevenbruck, the Paris gallerist who manages her estate, says that veteran members of the city’s art scene sometimes show up to the gallery and reminisce. “People still speak of her with a tremor in their voices. She left an impression on people’s emotional lives.” The story of Szapocznikow’s life is so extreme that it can threaten to overwhelm the experience of looking at her art. She was born in Pabianice, Poland, the daughter of a dentist father and a paediatrician mother. Her father died in 1937 from TB; and when Poland was occupied by the Nazis she was interned, with her mother and younger brother, first in the Pabianice and then the Łódź ghetto, where she assisted her mother in a hospital. Later, she was transported to Bergen-Belsen via Auschwitz, where she also worked in a camp hospital. But these were years never to be spoken of – certainly not to her son Piotr Stanisławski, nor is there any allusion to them in her correspondence with her first husband Ryszard Stanisławski. Piotr recalls that he once came home from school to find her “sitting on the sofa looking at a book about the camps. When she heard I was there she snapped it shut and hid it.” He asked her why – “after all, I knew what had happened in the camps” – but the subject remained as closed as the book. “Either it was too difficult for her, or she wanted to protect me,” speculates Stanisławski. “If she spoke of trauma it was obliquely, through the poetry of her sculpture.” At any rate, in 1944 she and her mother were separated, and – though the precise circumstances are unknown – at the end of the war she ended up in Czechoslovakia, where she changed her name to Šapočniková, claiming that she had been born on the Czech side of the border. She had assumed none of her family had survived (indeed, her brother died in Terezín) but in late 1945 her mother, who had managed to return to Poland, tracked her down to Prague. Meanwhile, she began to study stonemasonry and then sculpture at the Higher School of Arts and Industry in Prague. In 1947 she left for Paris, beginning studies at the Beaux-Arts the following year. What Stanisławski can only guess at is how and why his mother, who from the age of 13 had lost her childhood to incarceration and unspeakable horrors, took the decision to train as a sculptor. Perhaps part of the answer – a theory that seems borne out by looking at her work – lies in the human body, which she must have seen at its most anguished, fragile and abject during her years as a medic in the ghettos and camps. What is clear is that her early training was, in line with the practice of the times, traditionally classical: she was, in effect, creating bodies, complete and solid bodies made not of frail flesh but of stone. “Perhaps she wanted to magnify the body, to make it immortal, to conserve it,” says Loevenbruck. Szapocznikow began to live the life of the emigree artist – mixing with a group of expatriate Polish intellectuals and writers, studying, travelling on occasion to Prague and to Poland. She met Ryszard Stanisławski, a student at the Sorbonne who switched his studies to art history (and in later life, ended up running a major Polish museum). She almost succumbed to TB in 1950, her life saved by an experimental antibiotics treatment. In 1951 she and Stanisławski moved back to Poland, partly in order to throw themselves into the country’s postwar reconstruction. There, they adopted Piotr, a fact only discovered by him after his mother’s death. Szapocznikow made figurative, social-realist works such as a portrait of Stalin and Monument to Polish-Soviet Friendship. But after Stalin’s death in 1953, restrictions on artists began to loosen up, and the seeds of her mature work began to emerge. A remarkable small sculpture from 1957 called Exhumed is a blurred and blunted figure that reminds me of the casts made of the victims of Pompeii; it seems to hover between being consigned to death, unearthed from the grave and raised to life. She also made a decisive move in her art in 1962 when she cast her own leg: from then her work would focus more and more on her body. That same year she returned to Paris – at least partly, according to Stanisławski, because she felt the need to experiment with new methods and materials. For the next decade came restless experimentation with polyester resin and other novel materials. A series of photographs from 1971, for example, documents sculptural forms made with that most everyday of materials, chewing gum, something shaped by the body in a crudely primal manner. (She wrote of these works: “One has only to photograph and enlarge my masticated creations in order to achieve a sculptural presence. Chew well then. Look around you. Creation lies just between dreams and daily work.”) Stanisławski remembers accompanying her to the labs of the Rhône-Poulenc pharmaceuticals firm, where she would question chemists on the properties of polyester – “how it could be mixed, whether colours could be used, how long would it take to harden”. With these new materials her exploration of the body seemed to become more intense: she took it apart, loosing lips from bodies and breasts from torsos, but also seemed to want to preserve it, keep its fleeting traces safe. A late and remarkable sequence of pieces were called Herbariums: fragments of her, and sometimes her son’s, body cast in resin and then partially flattened, like flowers kept in a press to preserve them. In a rare statement about her work, made in March 1972, she wrote that she made “objets maladroits” – awkward objects. She had begun her life in art studying the problems of “balance, volume, space shadow and light” and found that to be a “thwarted vocation”. She had found her mature voice through her casts of the body with which “I try to fix the fleeting moments of life, its paradoxes and absurdity”. A “fixing” that she knew was doomed, the body frail and mortal. After her death a single exhibition was held in Paris, and then came years of oblivion in western Europe – despite a significant exhibition in Warsaw in 1998, on the 25th anniversary of her death. The works sat in a grubby theatre storage space “near the worst place on the Périphérique”, according to Stanisławski. She was, like so many female artists of the mid-20th century (Pauline Boty, Eva Hesse, Bourgeois) recognised slowly and late, her sculpture long dismissed by grandees of the Paris art scene as “not our taste”, according to Loevenbruck. Now the time has finally come for this singular artist, for her conviction that “of all the manifestations of the ephemeral the human body is the most vulnerable, the only source of all joy, all suffering and all truth”.

Fresh concerns about gambling firms’ efforts to tackling addiction came as the government prepares to unveil a review that could overhaul regulation of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) and advertising by the industry. The lengthy report, commissioned by the betting sector’s Industry Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG), was branded “shocking” by Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson. It found: Staff are poorly trained or see problem gambling measures as “pointless”. Some staff reinforce “false beliefs” about lucky numbers or slot machines. Responsible gambling messages are hidden where customers can’t see them. Betting firms set default spending limits as high as £99,999. The report found that firms have undermined their own efforts to reduce harm, indicating “double standards”. “It’s a clear wake-up call to the gambling industry,” said Marc Etches, chief executive of the UK’s leading charity for betting addicts, GambleAware. “Frankly, all sectors need to do more to ensure staff and customers know when, how and where to seek help.” Watson, who said last month that Labour would impose a levy on gambling firms to fund addiction treatment, said: “This shocking report is a litany of poor practice from an industry that is out of control. “Instead of trying to help problem gamblers, and encourage responsible gambling, too often gambling firms and their staff are facilitating irresponsible behaviour.” The report, written by research group Revealing Reality, raised concerns including staff suggesting to customers that there may be patterns in games that are based entirely on chance. One customer was told: “You always win when you sit at this table, don’t you?” In another case, staff also reserved a seat at a particular slot machine based on their inaccurate belief that it was a “ticking timebomb” about to pay out after a string of losses. The report’s authors said this was not believed to be deliberate deception but pointed out that “few [staff] had ever received training in how to practically deliver and integrate responsible gambling practice into their day‑to‑day role”. Some shop staff said they found problem gambling initiatives to be “pointless” or “futile”. The claim comes less than a week after the Guardian revealed that Ladbrokes is under investigation over claims its staff looked on as a problem gambler took out payday loans to fund bets. Bookmakers were also criticised for making problem gambling messages far less prominent than promotions and advertising, with warnings “hidden away in dark corners” or “illegible”. Some websites were found to be creating conditions that might lead to riskier play, such as setting default spending limits as high as £99,999. Betting operators were also found to be resistant to adopting new approaches to tackling addiction, raising objections such as cost of lack of academic evidence that they did not apply to sales and promotional initiatives designed to boost profits. Watson accused the industry of “defending the indefensible rather than clearing out the worst offenders”. “The gambling industry needs to take more responsibility for tackling Britain’s epidemic of gambling addiction. If they don’t, the next Labour government will make sure they will,” he said. An IGRG spokesman, John Hagan, said: “The gambling industry is working tirelessly to promote responsible gambling. “And it was industry recognition of the importance of raising standards of messaging and training which led to the commissioning of this report.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/03/catalonia-tensions-rise-as-strikes-held-over-police-violence-during-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T18:30:23Z","webTitle":"Catalonia responds to police violence: 'people are angry, very angry'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/03/catalonia-tensions-rise-as-strikes-held-over-police-violence-during-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/03/catalonia-tensions-rise-as-strikes-held-over-police-violence-during-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Catalonia responds to police violence: 'people are angry, very angry'","bodyText":"Like much of Catalonia, the Hotel Vila in Calella was shuttered on Tuesday morning, its rooms empty, its doors locked and a sign reading Hotel Tancat (hotel closed) stuck to a window. But on Sunday night, hours after the Spanish police’s attempts to halt the Catalan independence referendum exploded into violence, the hotel became another frontline in the skirmishes between locals and Spanish police; a further manifestation of the furious disbelief that has triggered strikes across the region and which brought thousands of people on to the streets of Barcelona and Girona on Tuesday to protest against an unaccustomed brutality. Calella, a seaside resort town 36 miles north-east of Barcelona, the Catalan capital, has long served as a billet for Spanish police officers who stay there when they are deployed to keep order at large-scale events in the city. However, the Guardia Civil officers lodged in the Hotel Vila over the weekend soon learned that they were no longer welcome. At around 10.30 on Sunday night, incensed by the scenes of police brutality in nearby Sant Cebrià de Vallalta and around many parts of Catalonia, a group of local people headed to the hotel chanting: “Out occupation forces!” A video of the protest also shows some people shouting “fascists!” and calling the officers sons of bitches. A group of officers – some carrying batons – emerged and, despite the intervention of members of the Catalan police force, allegedly attacked the protesters. According to the town’s mayor, 14 people were injured, of whom four were taken to hospital. “We’ve had Guardia Civil and national police staying here for years before big football matches and nothing’s ever happened,” said one local business owner, who did not wish to be named. “There had never been problems until now. All the bars around here used to be full of them. But now people here are scared.” By Monday night, the Guardia Civil had left Calella, leading Ramón Cosio, a spokesman for Spain’s main police union, to complain that officers were “fleeing from hotel to hotel; they are like rats who have to hide”. The Unión de Guardias Civiles went further, saying the “harassment” of its officers in Catalonia was “more like Nazi Germany than what you see in any other country where democracy reigns and rights are guaranteed”. With Madrid under growing international pressure to resolve its worst political crisis in decades, crowds gathered in Barcelona on Tuesday, chanting “independence”, repeating the cries of “occupying force” and urging Spanish police to leave the region. Municipal police said about 15,000 people had stopped traffic as they rallied, many draped in the blue, yellow and red Estelada flag used by Catalan separatists, shouting: “The streets will always be ours.” The protest came as several small labour unions and grassroots pro-independence groups urged workers throughout Catalonia to go on partial or full-day strikes. Schools and universities were shut and most small businesses were closed after unions called for the stoppage to “vigorously condemn” the police response to the poll, in which Catalonia’s leader said 90% of voters had backed independence from Spain. Metro stations in Barcelona that are usually busy were deserted as services were cut back sharply, and the Boqueria market was almost empty. Elsewhere, the response to the strike call was patchy. There were no reports of disruptions affecting big industry or Barcelona’s airport. “People are angry, very angry,” said Josep Llavina, 53, a self-employed worker who had travelled to Barcelona from a nearby town to participate in the protest outside the Catalan headquarters of the Spanish national police. “They brought violence with them. They have beaten people who were holding their hands up. How can we not be outraged?” According to Barcelona city hall, some 300,000 people took part in the various demonstrations held in the city. A further 30,000 marched in Girona and there were protests in virtually every Catalan town and village. Spain’s attorney general insisted the police action to prevent the referendum on Sunday didn’t affect “normal life of citizens” and criticised the Catalan government for “irresponsibly” summoning people to vote in “tumultuous” gatherings. But the continuing presence of thousands of officers from the Guardia Civil and national police has angered the Catalan government and highlighted tensions with the Mossos d’Esquadra and Catalan firefighters, some of whom formed human barriers to protect voters on Sunday. While all three police forces were under a judge’s orders to stop the referendum going ahead, several national police and Guardia Civil groups have accused the Mossos of failing to do their duty and demonstrating both “clear disobedience” and an “unacceptable passivity” when it came to halting the vote. One Guardia Civil association lamented the fact that some Mossos had been involved in “confrontational situations with Guardia Civil officers who were only trying to obey orders”. It also tweeted a video of an angry encounter between members of the two forces and later wrote: “A lot of people thought that the difference between a guardia civil and a mosso was about salaries. Now they know it’s also about professional dignity.” A Catalan police union responded to Sunday’s events with a statement reading: “The police are always on the side of the law. But to treat Catalan citizens, in their entirety, as a mass of criminals and act against them with disproportionate violence can also be considered criminal – or seen as a measure of the poor democratic quality of the [Spanish] government”. Anna Comas, a 54-year-old interior designer who took part in Sunday’s protest in Calella, said she and others had gone to the hotel spontaneously. “They’d been brutal in Sant Cebrià de Vallalta, where there were old people and kids,” she said. “They came and beat the first people they saw. People were crying over what they did. It was a show of brutality and hate. It was in their eyes.” Calella, she added, had now had its fill of Spanish police. “We’re used to having them here and there’s never been a problem,” she said. “But now we don’t want to see them here again.” Another Calellas resident was blunter. “If they come back,” he said, “they’ll get beaten.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/04/seeking-revenge-ever-justified-notes-queries","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T10:30:22Z","webTitle":"Is seeking revenge ever justified?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/04/seeking-revenge-ever-justified-notes-queries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/04/seeking-revenge-ever-justified-notes-queries","fields":{"headline":"Is seeking revenge ever justified?","bodyText":"Is seeking revenge purely for its own sake ever justified?

Scientists, with their annoying fixation on facts, have published study after study suggesting that an upbeat attitude protects you from cancer, heart disease and stroke. In one big analysis of American women, the most optimistic were 29% less likely to die, during a six-year follow-up, than the least; in another, involving men too, people with positive views of ageing ended up living longer. At last, though, we pessimists have something to fight back with: a new study in Psychological Science, highlighted on the Research Digest blog, that compared levels of optimism, cholesterol and body weight among people in the US and Japan. It found Americans are much likelier to have healthier cholesterol, and less likely to be overweight, if they’re chipper. But there was no such connection among the Japanese. Whatever explains Japan’s chart-topping life expectancy – lots of fish, a strong tradition of family care for the elderly – it isn’t being really cheerful all the time. What’s going on? In these studies, it’s notoriously hard to say what’s causing what. (Maybe it’s being healthy that makes you optimistic, not vice versa.) But one plausible explanation for the new finding, which the researchers endorse, is that American optimists are healthier because optimism, in the US, is a strongly reinforced cultural value. You’re supposed to feel happy, and to show it. Whereas in east Asian cultures, as lead researcher Jiah Yoo put it, “people commonly view positive emotions as having dark sides – they are fleeting, may attract unnecessary attention from others, and can be a distraction from focusing on important tasks”. In other words, maybe it’s not optimism per se, but being in tune with the prevailing culture, that makes American optimists healthier. Remove the cultural pressure to be happy, and pessimists get to have healthy cholesterol levels, too. That also might explain the 2015 finding that happiness doesn’t make British women live longer, either. Say what you like about British culture, but an unrelenting pressure to seem ultra-happy isn’t among its faults. If I’m honest, though, none of this really proves my point that miserabilism has its upsides. What it implies, more uncomfortably, is that you’re likelier to be happy and healthy if you share the attitudes and culture of the people around you. It’s surely no coincidence that the populations held up as bastions of contentment – notably the Danes, inventors of hygge, and the Japanese, for that matter – tend to be homogenous, rather than diverse. Perhaps the key isn’t their outlook on life, but the fact that everyone they meet shares it? This isn’t much of a recipe for making more diverse societies happier and healthier. For that, we’ll need to stop chasing the notion that one or another frame of mind is the Best One To Have. Optimism, pessimism, introversion, extraversion – maybe they can all work, except when we insist that everyone makes the same choice. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/03/its-time-companies-caught-up-to-a-new-way-of-working","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T17:25:44Z","webTitle":"Challenges of rural entrepreneurship | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/03/its-time-companies-caught-up-to-a-new-way-of-working","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/03/its-time-companies-caught-up-to-a-new-way-of-working","fields":{"headline":"Challenges of rural entrepreneurship","bodyText":"After nearly three decades of working in the mining industry and financial sector, I traded my stiletto heels for wellies and went sheep farming. It immediately became apparent that the traditional business model of farming was unsustainable; the reliance on EU subsidies, the volatile and seasonal price of lamb subject to the big supermarkets importing cheap meat, and a wool price that barely covered the cost of shearing. So I applied my City of London background to diversifying my business. From my farm, I now ship locally and internationally a range of luxury wool bedding made from the fleeces of much of the UK’s Southdown pedigreed flock. I also offer disabled-accessible self-catering accommodation for a working farm experience. The problem with this business model is its dependency on three sectors, whose services I am finding totally inadequate and antiquated, to the point where my entrepreneurial initiative is being undermined. First, the telecommunications sector seems incapable/unwilling to deliver reliable high-speed broadband to rural communities. The service is so erratic that I have difficulty maintaining a full e-commerce site; something that is pretty much fundamental to my success. I even have difficulty submitting my quarterly VAT returns online, something HMRC will be expecting all companies to do in the near future. Secondly, the legal sector has, by its own admission, failed to keep up with developments associated with the internet. This state of affairs affords me no conclusive advice when it comes to trademark and copyright issues as it applies to Google advertising, Facebook and Twitter or anything that might be related to cyberattacks and hacking of websites. Thirdly, my insurers have failed to recognise the vulnerability I have with respect to trademark and copyright issues. Their cover focuses on traditional labour and contractual issues which are indeed still important, but the evolution of the cover for which I am paying a hefty monthly premium again has not kept pace with the way I am now doing business. Brexit will bring great uncertainty as to whether or not the government will, after 2022, continue to support the agricultural sector in the absence of EU subsidies. Farmers who do not recognise this and fail to diversify will be in peril. But more importantly, the service industries on which the agricultural sector depends to succeed in this transformation, need to get their act together and modernise their range and quality of the services they provide. I am tired of listening to lame excuses. The readers of your newspaper may need an insurance assessor, a solicitor and a telephone engineer perhaps once a year, but rest assured, they need a farmer three times a day. Dr Jessica Cross Southdown Duvets • The rail and tube strikes this week are once again upsetting the country’s business productivity, with thousands of commuters affected (Report, 30 September). Employers across the UK should be seizing the opportunity to fully embrace smarter ways of working. The tools and technology are there to enable workers to remain efficient and productive while working remotely, be it from home or an alternative work space. Employers are likely to find that trying out a flexible working system this week proves popular and effective for the long term. Three-quarters (77%) of workers claim a job offer would be made more attractive with flexible working, and more than half (55%) believe the ability to work flexibly is crucial when searching for their next job. Smarter working encourages smarter thinking. It allows people to balance their life outside of work and work more effectively. It’s been years since the government introduced the right for any employee to request flexible working, but still nearly half of employers (48%) are not actively encouraging it.

The state department said the expulsions did not necessarily mean the US had concluded that the Cuban government was responsible for a variety of symptoms including hearing loss, headaches and cognitive problems, but it said Cuba had failed to live up to its obligations under international law to protect diplomats. The US also said that the move was designed to achieve parity in each country’s embassy functions, after Washington announced the withdrawal on Friday of non-emergency personnel – more than half its diplomats in Havana, as well as all family members. Those US nationals are still in the process of leaving Cuba, while the 15 Cuban embassy staff are being given a week to leave. “The decision was made due to Cuba’s failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention,” the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said in a written statement. “This order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations A state department official said that the move did not signal a change of policy towards Cuba. “We are maintaining diplomatic relations with Havana.,” the official said. Havana angrily protested the move, calling it “irresponsible” and “hasty.” Foreign minister Bruno Rodríguez called a news conference to again deny involvement and defend his country’s efforts to assist in the US investigation. “The ministry of foreign affairs strongly protests and condemns this unfounded and unacceptable decision as well as the pretext used to justify it,” Rodriguez said. The state department said the US was cooperating with that investigation while conducting its own. Officials have said there was still no evidence of the source of the attack. Speculation has included the possibility of some form of sonic weapon and a surveillance operation that went wrong. US officials said they were confident that the incidents were targeted attacks, pointing out that some of the affected diplomats had been staying in a hotel, where none of the hotel workers seem to have been affected. The Associated Press reported over the weekend that US intelligence officials were among the first to be affected. The incidents began late last year with the last being recorded in August. The state department said 22 of its personnel had been affected, an increase of one since Friday. An official said that the new victim had experienced health problems in January but only now has a determination been made that they were connected to the other health incidents. “We have underscored repeatedly to the Cuban government its responsibility for the safety, wellbeing, security and protection of our diplomatic staff under the Vienna Convention in Havana,” the state department official said. “We will need full reassurances from the Cuban government these attacks will not continue before we even contemplate returning personnel.” The moves deliver a significant blow to the rapprochement between the Washington and Havana that was launched by Barack Obama and Cuba’s president Raúl Castro in 2015. Democratic congressman Eliot Engel criticised the decision to expel the Cuban officials. “It appears that this plays right into the hands of a potential rogue actor – Russia, perhaps – that is trying to create a further wedge between our two countries and other nations in the hemisphere. We need to be smart and thoughtful in responding to these attacks. Unfortunately, today’s response was extremely shortsighted.” Geoff Thale at the Washington Office of Latin America (Wola), a human rights thinktank, said that there was no logic to the move. “The United States is using the confusion and uncertainty surrounding these events as justification to take a big step backwards in US-Cuban relations,” he said. “This doesn’t serve our national interests, or our diplomacy, and it most certainly doesn’t do anything to help advance human rights or a more open political climate in Cuba.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/03/england-ben-stokes-australia-mitchell-starc-ashes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T14:57:29Z","webTitle":"Ashes absence of Ben Stokes would be good for Australia, says Mitchell Starc","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/03/england-ben-stokes-australia-mitchell-starc-ashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/03/england-ben-stokes-australia-mitchell-starc-ashes","fields":{"headline":"Ashes absence of Ben Stokes would be good for Australia, says Mitchell Starc","bodyText":"Mitchell Starc believes the possible absence of Ben Stokes from the Ashes is a blow for England and “good for us”. The Australia fast bowler, who will return from injury at the weekend for the first of three Sheffield Shield matches, said on Tuesday: “Everyone in world cricket knows how good a cricketer Ben is. He is England’s best all-rounder. It is yet to be seen whether he will be on the plane – if he does come we know how good a player he is and he makes that team more balanced. If he is not there it is a blow for them and good for us.” Stokes was arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm during a late-night altercation outside a Bristol nightclub. He was released without charge but is under investigation. He and Alex Hales have both been made unavailable for international selection until further notice, with an announcement not expected until the middle of the month. Australia will not be complacent whether Stoke travels or not, Starc said. “I am sure they can still be competitive. They’ve got those experienced guys at the top and he is not the be-all and end-all of their team. There are plenty of others we need to worry about. They bat quite deep, you’ve got Moeen Ali coming in at No8 and Chris Woakes at No9. It is not just one guy.” Starc is keen to ensure England have the same problems as they did when Mitchell Johnson was the driving force in the 5-0 whitewash of England in Australia four years ago. “We’ve got a great attack there, it is not really down to one person, obviously everyone would like to bowl like Johnno and terrorise the Poms like he did and take a thousand wickets in the series but the great thing for us is we have a young group who complement each other nicely,” Starc said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/oct/03/chores-forgotten-how-to-do-changing-lightbulb-fuse-box","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T16:23:23Z","webTitle":"A guide to the chores we can no longer do – from changing a lightbulb to resetting the fuse box","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/oct/03/chores-forgotten-how-to-do-changing-lightbulb-fuse-box","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/oct/03/chores-forgotten-how-to-do-changing-lightbulb-fuse-box","fields":{"headline":"A guide to the chores we can no longer do – from changing a lightbulb to resetting the fuse box","bodyText":"Modern life is making us stupid. The latest skill we used to be able to do, but now needs to be relearned, is how to do the washing-up. According to the Good Housekeeping Institute (GHI), people have become overly reliant on dishwashers and don’t know that there is a correct order to do the dishes (glasses first, roasting pans last). So it has produced a guide. Scrape dishes clean before you start, it says, change the water halfway though and wear rubber gloves so you can use extra-hot water. The washing-up is not the only thing we need help with. According to a new YouGov survey, the majority of 18- to 24-year-olds don’t know how to bleed a radiator or change the fuse in a plug. Which seems a bit unfair – record numbers still live at home with their parents – but even among older people, these skills are not universal (a quarter of 35- to 44-year-olds can’t bleed a radiator). Does it really matter, when there is a YouTube tutorial for everything from darning a sock to changing a tyre? “Life has changed,” says Trisha Schofield, director of the GHI. “But it’s sad that we’re losing all those skills. They can save us money, are often quicker to do than farming it out, more satisfying and relaxing.” And if nothing else, if we forget them, how else will we understand what the servants are doing in the Downton Abbey movie? Here are some other things we’re struggling with. Changing a lightbulb According to YouGov, 11% of people don’t know how to change a lightbulb (although a survey this year by Aviva put that figure at 21%). The hardest part is knowing which bulb to buy. Campaign for a single fitting and just two choices in wattage: atmospheric and dazzling. Bleeding a radiator The cold spots on your radiator are trapped air, which you need to “bleed” out, although 69% of people don’t know how to do it, according to the YouGov survey. Getting a radiator key (from a DIY shop) is the first true mark of adulthood. Turn your central heating off – assuming you’re not one of the 11% flummoxed by your boiler – put your key over the square bleed screw in the top of the radiator, turn slightly until the air comes hissing out and close when water starts to trickle out (a towel will come in handy). Then you have to do complicated things such as check the pressure on your boiler and turn the heating back on. Sewing on a button Only 65% of people feel confident replacing a button, but it’s a fairly easy job. Anchor your thread on the inside of your fabric with a few stitches or a knot, then, on the outside, line up the button with the buttonhole. “From the back of the fabric, pull the needle and thread up through one of the holes and then push the needle down through the second hole,” says Schofield. “Repeat until the button is securely in place. On the last stitch, push the needle through the fabric but not the hole, and wind the thread around the stitching between the button and fabric to strengthen attachment. Push the needle back down through the material. Finish by making a couple of stitches on the underside of the fabric.” Resetting the fuse box More than a third of us don’t know what to do about a tripped switch. These days, you will hopefully have a modern fuse board or consumer unit. You will also know where it is, and have a torch handy. “Open up the front cover or lid and you are looking along the line of switches for whichever one might be in the down position,” says Mark Barnes-Rider, standards engineer with Certsure. Flick it back up. If it keeps tripping after a couple of times, “then that’s the time to call out a competent electrician”. Making a bed Just 3% of people don’t know how to make a bed, according to YouGov – but it probably didn’t ask whether people were using flat sheets and hospital corners. “The trouble with fitted sheets is they’re an absolute devil to iron,” says Jane Urquhart, principal of the London Academy for Household Staff, reminding us that we don’t iron our bed linen anyway. So, hospital corners: tuck in the pillow end, then the bottom, “so it’s absolutely tight”. Move to the side of the bed and, about a foot from the corner, pull the loose sheet up on to the bed to create a kind of trapezium shape on its side. Tuck in the sheet below it and then fold the flap down, like closing an envelope, and tuck in. “The sheet should remain creaseless,” says Urquhart. “Whatever you’re getting up to in bed, it will remain good, tight, firm and beautifully made.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/04/doctor-foster-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T05:00:20Z","webTitle":"Doctor Foster review – pinging about in a pinball machine of hatred","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/04/doctor-foster-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/04/doctor-foster-review","fields":{"headline":"Doctor Foster review – pinging about in a pinball machine of hatred","bodyText":"I can imagine how it might have gone. The writer Mike Bartlett had done well, had had plays at the Royal Court and the Hampstead theatre, the Almeida and the National, about the world today. He’d won awards by the armful, received glowing notices from proper theatre critics, such as Michael Billington. He had done well. And he thought to himself: now I’m going to have a bit of fun. So he took a bottle of chablis out of the fridge (maybe Mike doesn’t always drink white wine, but he wanted to get inside the head of the monster he was about to create). He poured himself an enormous glass, downed it, poured himself another, then settled down at the kitchen table and began Doctor Foster (BBC1). As Mike went on, he delved deeper into the darker, uglier corners of humanity – jealousy, betrayal, bitterness, greed, obsession, revenge – and he ran with them (the wine helped). He smiled a wicked smile as he wrote; maybe he was cheating a bit – being unfaithful to himself – but hell was he enjoying it. As was everyone else (even if some of them also suspected it was a little bit wrong). Millions of them, more than go to all the theatres. And Mike liked this too. So he came back for more (as cheaters often do). Only this time he pushed it further still. Surely he can’t do that, or go there, he said to himself. But then he gulped down another goblet and chuckled a wicked chuckle, because he could, and he did. And the second series grew, in size and pace and almost physical tension, and utter preposterousness. Until the end of the penultimate episode last week, with Gemma (Suranne Jones) pointing her car at Simon (Bertie Carvel) – now broke and broken and alone – then stamping her right foot to the floor. For a more thorough medical diagnosis of the final hour, visit Julia Raeside’s fabulous episode guide. In short though, Gemma doesn’t do it, death by Hyundai doesn’t happen. She swerves at the very last moment. (There’s a lot of that going on in the episode – swerving at the last moment to avoid death, by other drivers, and by Mike Bartlett, too.) For now, Simon’s down but not quite out. And with Kate safely out of the way, in France with daughter and parents, this can all be about them, the main event, Gemma v Simon, in the final round – gloves off, no rules – most probably to the death. He would kill her now if he had a knife, he says. She is going to stab him, with the scissors (the ones from the title sequence presumably) … except it’s not him this time, at the door, but friendly new neighbours. (Leave! Now! Parminster is not a good place to bring up children.) He’ll kill himself, he tells young Tom. Poor Tom (Tom Taylor), he’s in the ring too, collateral damage as he has been throughout, pinged about in the pinball machine of hatred. Oh God, please don’t let it be Tom who gets killed, that would be genuinely upsetting. Simon tries a new tactic: they should get back together. What!? Well, they were happy once [cue flashbacks, happy memories, photos, a meaningful champagne cork]. They’re not going to, are they, have another over-the-kitchen-island hate-shag? They’re not; Bartlett shows rare restraint; I’m disappointed. On the subject of kitchens, Gemma tells Tom they should get a new one. Because that is what 15-year-old boys are most interested in. Sorry that Dad and I have made your life hell and done permanent psychological damage and that I wished you were dead when I had postnatal depression (that was the secret). But would a Neff hob and new granite worktop help, at all? That must wait though, because Dad – Simon – is back on his suicide mission. No, not like that, says Gemma, pulling him back from the edge of the dual carriageway. Like this, and she leaves him the three syringes full of poison from her black doctor’s bag (ah, the loose ends are tying up nicely, however outrageous the whole package is). But then, after The Worst Breakfast In The World, she changes her mind again, maybe don’t top yourself after all, for Tom’s sake. Where is Tom though? Nooooooooooo! No, just gone, run away. As he should have done ages ago, it’s his only hope. “I’ll always be here waiting, when you want to come back,” says Gemma, standing in the doorway, doing her weird nervous right hand fidgety thing, looking straight into the eye of the camera. “Whenever you want to come back.” Hmmm, well that’s not closing any doors on a possible third series is it? Don’t do it – come back Tom, certainly, but also Mike B. It’s been fabulous, and outrageous, and addictive. Enough though. I think a third – syringe, series – might polish me off as well.

Those recent concerts found the group roving across their entire career, featuring tracks from their 1976 debut album such as American Girl and Breakdown and pieces from their latest album, Hypnotic Eye, which was their first to become a US No 1. They ranged through landmarks such as Refugee, Don’t Come Around Here No More and chart favourites such as Mary Jane’s Last Dance and Learning to Fly. They also found room for Petty’s solo hits from his 1989 album Full Moon Fever, such as I Won’t Back Down, Free Fallin’ and Runnin’ Down a Dream. Petty had accepted that time was catching up with him and could not foresee further giant tours in future. “We’re all on the backside of our 60s,” he told Rolling Stone. “I have a granddaughter who I would like to see as much of as I can. I don’t want to spend my life on the road.” Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, and he sold more than 80m records in his career. His concise, melodic songwriting, fashioned from a blend of rock, pop, blues, country and psychedelia, found the perfect vehicle in the Heartbreakers, an unflashy but effortlessly accomplished ensemble capable of spanning numerous musical styles with ease. Their work stands in a lineage of American groups that stretches back through the Byrds, the Band and Creedence Clearwater Revival, while also incorporating a hefty streak of British pop from the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to the Searchers. Born in Gainesville, Florida, Tom was the son of Kitty (nee Avery) and Earl Petty. Kitty worked in the Gainesville local tax office; Earl went through several jobs including running a grocery store, hawking wholesale goods from a truck to stores, and finally selling insurance. He was also a drinker and gambler who would sometimes beat his son with his belt. Tom had a brother, Bruce, who was seven years younger. When he was 11, Tom had the life-changing experience of meeting Elvis Presley, when his aunt and uncle took him to see Presley filming Follow That Dream in Ocala, Florida. “I caught the fever that day and I never got rid of it,” he recalled. Tom’s parents gave him an acoustic guitar for Christmas when he was 12. He graduated to an electric instrument and began writing his own songs (his first composition was called Baby, I’m Leaving). The inspiration of Presley was followed by the arrival of the Beatles. “There was the way to do it,” he recalled. “You get your friends and you’re a self-contained unit. And you make the music. And it looked so much fun.” Petty formed his first band, the Sundowners, when he was 14, then on his 16th birthday joined the Epics, which later became Mudcrutch. He was singing and playing bass, while on guitar was Tom Leadon, brother of Bernie, who later moved to Los Angeles and joined the Flying Burrito Brothers and the Eagles. Mudcrutch also included the future Heartbreakers Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell. Gainesville’s musical activity centred on the music store Lipham’s Music, where Petty, Bernie Leadon and the future Eagles guitarist Don Felder all worked at various times. Mudcrutch became a popular local band who could play to sizeable crowds across Florida, and in 1974 they signed a deal with Shelter Records and headed for Los Angeles. The week before they left, Petty married Jane Benyo, who was also from Gainesville. However, after their single, Depot Street, flopped and their newly recorded album remained unreleased, a disillusioned Petty quit Mudcrutch. Shelter’s boss, Denny Cordell, encouraged him to become a solo artist, but when he was invited to play on a recording session organised by Tench, Petty found himself alongside the musicians who would become the Heartbreakers – Tench, Campbell, bass player Ron Blair and drummer Stan Lynch, all from Gainesville. Petty suggested they join forces and since he was already signed to Shelter there was no need to hunt for a new record deal. Thus Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers was born, and their debut album of the same name was released in 1976. The response in the US was initially muted, but the album was pounced upon by the British music press, who appreciated Petty’s pithy songwriting and the group’s almost punk-like attitude. Helped by a UK tour with Nils Lofgren, the album reached 24 in Britain. The songs Breakdown, Anything That’s Rock’n’Roll and especially the resounding anthem American Girl became some of the band’s trademark pieces. They fared better in the US with You’re Gonna Get It! (1978), which entered the Top 30, but then the band hit a roadblock when their record label was bought out by MCA. Petty found himself bound to a highly disadvantageous contract, prompting a bitter nine-month legal battle from which he and his legal team finally emerged victorious, winning a new deal with the MCA subsidiary Backstreet Records. At one point the band had taken to wearing T-shirts bearing the motto “Why MCA?”. Petty’s first post-lawsuit release was the celebratory Damn the Torpedoes (1979), which sold 3m copies in the US, reached No 2 in the album charts, and broke Petty through to the mainstream. It contained some of his finest songs, notably Refugee, Louisiana Rain and Even the Losers, which all became radio favourites. Hard Promises (1981), released after Petty fought another battle with MCA to get the price reduced from $9.98 to $8.98, went Top 5 and delivered a Top 20 singles hit with The Waiting, though Long After Dark (1982) saw sales slacken despite a Top 10 placing. Southern Accents (1985) was the product of much angst and endless recording sessions, during which Petty became so frustrated that he broke several bones in his hand by punching a wall. However, it produced the No 13 singles hit Don’t Come Around Here No More. Let Me Up (I’ve Had Enough) from 1987 was a commercial disappointment for the Heartbreakers – this was also the year Petty’s house in Encino, California, was burned down by an arsonist – but he found huge success as part of the Traveling Wilburys, a collaboration with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, George Harrison and Jeff Lynne whose debut album (1988) was a triple-platinum hit, spinning off the singles Handle With Care and End of the Line. Petty then hooked up with Lynne to make his first solo album, Full Moon Fever (1989), a hit on both album and singles charts. Lynne produced the Heartbreakers’ set Into the Great Wide Open (1991), which earned major exposure for the title track, and Learning to Fly, while Greatest Hits (1993) spawned Mary Jane’s Last Dance, a smash on MTV thanks to a spooky video starring Kim Basinger. Wildflowers (1994) was Petty’s first solo disc under a new deal with Warner Bros and another multimillion seller, but after a bout of extended touring his marriage fell apart and divorce followed in 1996. A depressed Petty fell into reliance on heroin, and had to go into detox. The bleak Echo (1999) mirrored his state of mind, and sales were modest. The Last DJ (2002), a glum diatribe against music industry greed, fared even worse. Petty’s days of multimillion sales were over, but the solo set Highway Companion (2006) was musically strong, and the band bounced back with Mojo (2010) and finally Hypnotic Eye (2014). In 2008, Petty revisited his past by reforming Mudcrutch for a new album and tour. He is survived by his second wife, Dana York Epperson, whom he married in 2001, his daughters Adria and AnnaKim from his first marriage, his stepson, Dylan, from Dana’s previous marriage, his brother, Bruce, and granddaughter, Everly. • Thomas Earl Petty, musician, born 20 October 1950; died 2 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/07/can-technology-help-you-pick-best-babysitter-trust-online-safety-checks","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T10:00:18Z","webTitle":"Who do you trust?

How data is helping us decide","bodyText":"My first lesson in the dangers of trusting strangers came in 1983, not long after I turned five, when an unfamiliar woman entered our house. Doris, from Glasgow, was in her late 20s and starting as our nanny. My mum had found her through a posh magazine called The Lady. Doris arrived wearing a Salvation Army uniform, complete with bonnet. “I remember her thick Scottish accent,” Mum recalls. “She told me she’d worked with kids of a similar age and was a member of the Salvation Army because she enjoyed helping people. But, honestly, she had me at hello.” Doris lived with us for 10 months. For the most part she was a good nanny – cheerful, reliable and helpful. There was nothing unusual about her, aside from a few unexplained absences at weekends. Back then, our neighbours, the Luxemburgs, had an au pair Doris spent a lot of time with. Late one evening, Mr Luxemburg knocked on our door after discovering the pair had been involved in running a drugs ring. “They had even been in an armed robbery,” my father later related, “and Doris was the getaway driver.” The getaway car, it transpired, was our family’s Volvo estate. My parents decided to search Doris’s room. In a shoebox under her bed, she had stuffed piles of foreign currency, stolen from my parents’ home office. My dad stood on guard by our front door all night with a baseball bat, scared Doris would come home. Thankfully, she didn’t. “Even as I retell this story, I feel sick,” my mum says. “I left you in the care of a serious criminal. And it took us so long to know who she really was.” Looking back, what would she have done differently? “I wish we’d known more about her.” My parents are generally smart, rational people. Would they have made the same mistake in today’s digitally connected world? Maybe not. A growing band of technology companies are working on helping us decide who we can and can’t trust – whether hiring a nanny, renting out our home or ordering a taxi. Technology today can dig deeper into who we are than ever before. Can an algorithm determine who is the real deal and who can’t be trusted, better than us? *** On a crisp autumn morning, I visit the modest offices of Trooly in Los Altos, a sleepy backwater city north of Silicon Valley. Savi Baveja, Trooly’s CEO, wants to show just how powerful these new trust checks can be. “What do you think of me running you through the Trooly software to see what comes up?’ he says, smiling encouragingly. I blush, trying to recall all the bad or embarrassing things I’ve ever done. My many speeding and parking tickets? The weird websites I spend time on (for research purposes, of course)? Old photos? I laugh nervously. “Don’t worry – we can project it on to the large screen so you can see what is happening in real time,” Baveja offers. Somehow I don’t find that reassuring. Anish Das Sarma, Trooly’s chief technology officer and formerly a senior researcher at Google, types my first and last name into the Instant Trust program, then my email address. That’s it. No date of birth, phone number, occupation or address. “Trooly’s machine learning software will now mine three sources of public and permissible data,” Baveja explains. “First, public records such as birth and marriage certificates, money laundering watchlists and the sex offender register. Any global register that is public and digitised is available to us.” Then there is a super-focused crawl of the deep web: “It’s still the internet but hidden; the pages are not indexed by typical search engines.” So who uses it? “Hate communities. Paedophiles. Guns. It’s where the weird people live on the internet.” The last source is social media such as Facebook and Instagram. Official medical records are off limits. However, if you tweeted, “I just had this horrible back surgery,” it could be categorised as legally permissible data and used. Baveja and his team spent nine months weighing up what data they should and should not use. Data on minors was out. “In some countries,” he says, “there is a legally agreed definition of the difference between ‘private’ and ‘sensitive private’ information – the latter includes medical, plus race, religion, union membership, etc. The latter is where we drew the line, as we were very aware of the creepy factor.” After about 30 seconds, my results appear. “Look, you are a one!” Baveja says. Profiles are ranked from one to five, with one the most trustworthy. “Only approximately 15% of the population are a one; they are our ‘super-goods’.” I feel relief and a tinge of pride. How many are “super-bad”? “About 1-2% of the population across the countries Trooly covers, including the US and UK, end up between five and four.” Baveja was previously a partner at the consulting firm Bain &amp; Company. One of his longest-standing clients was a “well-known online marketplace”. It started him thinking about the importance of trust in the digital world. “Our client needed 6% of their entire budget – hundreds of millions of dollars – to respond to things going wrong in their marketplace,” he says. “It got me thinking how the typical star rating system was not adequate to prevent a very large number of incidents online.” Meanwhile, Baveja’s wife was running a small dental practice. People would refuse to pay, or threaten to leave bad reviews, and at the weekend there would be callers demanding drugs. “It occurred to me that small businesses, relative to big businesses, know very little about their customers,” Baveja says. “Wouldn’t it be cool if they had a way of weeding out potentially bad ones?” To get my trust score, Trooly’s software crawled more than 3bn pages of the internet, from around 8,000 sites, in less than 30 seconds. The data was consolidated into three buckets. The most basic verified my identity. Was I who I claimed to be? This is done by scanning, say, my personal website against my university profile. Next was screening for unlawful, risky or fraudulent activity. But it’s the third category that is fascinating, in which I was assessed against the “dark triad”, a trio of callous personality traits that make con artists tick: narcissism (selfishness with excessive craving of attention), psychopathy (lack of empathy or remorse) and machiavellianism (a highly manipulative nature with a lack of morality). Unfortunately, Baveja can’t give me a separate score here, but it’s safe to say I passed. Trooly was awarded a US patent two years ago for this software, “determining trustworthiness and compatibility of a person”. Its algorithm was also programmed to take into account the “big five” traits – openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism – widely accepted by researchers in the 80s as a key way to assess personalities. “Trooly developed sophisticated models to predict these traits using hundreds of features from an individual’s online footprint,” Baveja says. “It was interesting figuring out what, in that footprint, might help predict if someone is going to be, say, neurotic or rude. If you look at someone’s Twitter account and it’s peppered with excessive self-reference and swearwords, the person is much more likely to be antisocial.” *** I remember a heated conversation I had with my father when I was 18. I had seen a nice-looking secondhand Peugeot for sale on eBay. He pointed out that the seller’s pseudonym was Invisible Wizard, which did not inspire confidence. So we went to the local car dealer instead. These days, even my cautious father is something of an eBay addict. And as a society we are increasingly using technology for more intimate personal interactions, often with total strangers, whether it’s sharing our homes and cars, or finding love or babysitters online. But when you first connect with someone, how can you know if they pose a risk? Are they who they say they are? Is it even a real person? These are questions companies such as UrbanSitter need to answer. This American website connects families with babysitters, and has more than 350,000 parents and 300,000 sitters on its books. As with many online services, they have to join via Facebook or LinkedIn. The result, says 43-year-old founder Lynn Perkins, is that “when you go to book, you can see how many ‘friends’ have previously booked or are in some way connected to that sitter”. Sitters and parents create detailed profiles. The amount and type of details people will voluntarily disclose are extraordinary. “One parent included a long description about their pot-bellied pigs,” Perkins recalls. “They wanted to make sure the sitter was comfortable with their pets. It sounds weird but is great expectation management.” The final level of security is provided by Trooly and rival trust rating services such as Checkr. Did the sitter really get a childcare diploma from South Thames College? Does he or she use foul language online? Is he or she on a sex offender register? Only 25% of the sitters who start the registration process make it on to the platform. The remaining 75% are rejected or give up because they can’t or won’t jump through the vetting hoops. Things do go wrong now and again in this brave new world, but it is almost impossible to get entrepreneurs such as Perkins to reveal the precise number of bad incidents, minor or serious, that happen on their platforms. “They do happen but they are extremely rare,” is all she will say. *** In June, Airbnb acquired Trooly for an undisclosed sum. It’s part of its investment in troubleshooting, along with people such as Nick Shapiro, a former deputy chief of staff at the CIA who joined Airbnb in 2015 as global head of trust and risk management. “Earning and keeping trust will always be a core part of any functional society,” Shapiro says. “What has changed is where and how trust is exchanged. Rather than placing trust in major institutions like big business, the media or government, people are trusting each other more and more.” Part of his brief is to figure out how Airbnb responds when things go awry. Take someone like David Carter, who booked a luxury New York apartment for the weekend in March 2014. He told the host, Ari Teman, he was looking for a place for his brother and sister-in-law to stay while they were in town for a wedding. In fact, his “in-laws” turned out to be guests for a rowdy orgy featuring “big beautiful women” and stuffed animals. Teman discovered the X-rated soiree only after he popped back into his building to pick up his luggage. Carter had a verified Airbnb account and positive reviews. “We have a responsibility to go back and see if we could have done anything differently,” Shapiro says. “Was a mistake made?” In other words, how can the world’s Carters be weeded out? “You could have easily figured out something like that was going to happen,” Baveja says. “You didn’t need to go deep into Carter’s psyche to work out this guy was a professional organiser of sex parties.” A simple Google search on Carter’s email address led to online ads for events such as Turn Up Part 2: The Pantie Raid, and BBW Panty Raid Party. One person even gave the apartment’s address in a tweet for an “XXX FREAK FEST”. “I learned new acronyms looking at his profile,” Baveja says. “I’m blushing just thinking about it.” I tell Baveja about Doris. Would the search have caught her if she had applied to UrbanSitter? It would. My parents would have known she didn’t belong to the Salvation Army, had no previous childcare experience and a patchy criminal history. Doris would not have made the cut. *** Should we embrace these new trust algorithms? Baveja and Shapiro acknowledge the responsibility that comes with trying to take ethical decisions and translate them into code. How much of our personal information do we want trawled through in this way? And how comfortable are we with letting an algorithm judge who is trustworthy? At my Trooly test, I found myself worrying about tiny or long-ago “transgressions” being held against me. Do companies take note of those? “No one likes to be judged, whether by a robot or another person, but that isn’t what our screening is about,” Shapiro insists. “We are looking for major risks such as hate group membership, a violent criminal past or a fake identity. We don’t care if you sent a stupid tweet or got a parking ticket.” Still, those things might influence an employer. Increasingly, recruiters are using digital footprints and machine learning to filter candidates. Recruitment tools such as Belong, Talview and the Social Index are offering products that aggregate and analyse online data to determine the “fit” of a candidate with a company’s culture. There are other questions. What, for example, are the consequences for “digital ghosts”? People like my husband, who has never used Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn. Does his “thin file” reduce his ability to be considered trustworthy? “For 10-15% of people, we can’t give a confident score,” Baveja admits. “There’s either not enough of a digital footprint or not enough accurate inputs.” On sites such as Airbnb, invisibility will not necessarily work against you. “We are looking for derogatory information,” Shapiro says, “and the absence of information doesn’t count against you.” In a world in which we can find someone to fix a leak or drive us home or date with a few swipes of our phones, online trust is set to get faster, smarter and more pervasive. The first time we put our credit card details into a website, say, or find a match on Tinder, it feels a bit weird, even dangerous, but the idea soon seems normal. Can technology strip out all the risk of dealing with strangers? No way, says UrbanSitter’s Perkins. Humans are complex moral beings, and it would be foolish to remove ourselves from the picture entirely. “If a sitter shows up and you get a weird feeling, it doesn’t matter if they have passed checks, how well reviewed they are or what you thought about them online, go with your gut and cancel.” If the onus is still on us to decide where to place our trust and in whom, we are now in a better position to ask the right questions and find the right information. Which should mean we’re much less likely to hire a narco-bank robber as a nanny. • Rachel Botsman is the author of Who Can You Trust?, published by Portfolio Penguin at £14.99.

Decades on, some countries have the lowest levels of internet penetration in the world due to factors including geographical isolation, barriers to infrastructure and political restrictions. According to the World Bank’s 2015 statistics (the most recent available), Kazakhstan is the most-connected of any country in the region, with nearly three-quarters (73%) of the population online – compared to 43% in Uzbekistan, 30% in Kyrgyzstan, and 20% in Tajikistan. In Turkmenistan, just 15% of the 5.6 million population use the internet. But across Central Asia the number of internet users has grown as smartphones and data have become cheaper and more accessible. Social media use is also on the rise, particularly since Facebook introduced capacity for local languages. To those outside the Stans, social media offers a glimpse into these once secret cities, while those who live in them have a means of sharing their homes with the world. Last year photographer Hassan Kurbanbaev documented Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan where he was born and still lives, in a project that was widely featured by arts and culture magazines on Instagram. “It seems to me, for different reasons, Tashkent is not displayed well in the broadest sense of contemporary documentary, and lately I have depressing feeling about that,” he says of the motivation for his tashkent.DOC series. “I decided just to go out and start to document my city.” Kurbanbaev told Guardian Cities that social media use was becoming increasingly widespread in Tashkent. (A spokeswoman for Instagram said it was available in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajkistan, though there were sometimes “temporary disruptions”, and unavailable in Turkmenistan.) “Some politics websites that cover our region are blocked here – but they can’t block social media and Instagram,” he says. “Though the mobile internet is quite expensive, in my opinion, Instagram has a huge influence on young people, and the popularity is rising very fast.” Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @guardiancities.

This is one reason humanism regards art as sacred: it exists for its own sake. Other value systems, religious or political, might insist that art serve a theological or ideological cause, but the novel – in its origins a bourgeois enterprise – makes a poor missionary or soldier. The uniforms fit badly and it keeps flunking basic training. The mission of Omar El Akkad’s first novel, American War, is admirable: to encourage western readers, especially Americans, to put themselves in the shoes of the world’s radicalised displaced people. Set in the late 21st century, the novel imagines an America wrecked by war and the flooding brought on by climate change. Its heroine, Sarat Chestnutt, grows up in a shack by the Mississippi, in a Louisiana eaten away by the rising Gulf of Mexico. A handful of southern states, refusing to abide by federal laws prohibiting the use of fossil fuels, have attempted to secede from the union, setting off a second civil war. Sarat’s parents want to emigrate north, where the economic opportunities are better, but her father is killed in a suicide bombing and Sarat, her mother and two siblings end up in a refugee camp near a contested border. Violence and reprisals leave Sarat bereft and vengeful. A suave groomer provides her with education, training and weapons, and a terrorist is born. El Akkad, a Canadian journalist born in Egypt and raised in Qatar, has said that his intention with American War is not to make the reader admire Sarat. Rather, “in this incredibly polarised world we live in”, he hopes that by the time the reader gets to the end of his novel, “you’re not on her side, you don’t support her, you’re not willing to apologise for her – but you understand how she got to the place where she is”. This could have been done otherwise, with, say, a novel set in contemporary Iraq or Afghanistan. The milieu, the history, the culture might have been unfamiliar to many western readers, but the revelation of the familiar in the strange is one of the forms of alchemy we seek in fiction. Paradoxically, the more particular the author’s vision – this exact kind of biscuit dipped in that precise type of tea – the more easily we can locate the universal in what is described. Instead, El Akkad sets American War not just in America, but in the American south. The news from Charlottesville testified to the truth of Faulkner’s maxim: in the south, “the past is never dead. It’s not even past.” The same backward-looking frame of mind that makes it so hard for the south to shake off the dead weight of racism and cultural resentment also lends southern culture the nation’s most pronounced regional flavour, beloved in one form or another by even its most ambivalent natives: the sweet tea and collards, the delta blues and zydeco, the courtly manners and local dialects. Americans joke about the ability of many southerners to rattle off the names of their ancestors going back half a dozen generations. The south has its own literature and, disturbingly, often its own version of history. The defeated side in a civil war loses the ability to control its future, and this often leads to an accentuated investment in the past. But the south of Flannery O’Connor, Leadbelly, Elvis Presley and Margaret Mitchell has been erased in El Akkad’s America. A mere 75 years in the future, as he imagines it, there will still be a Democratic and a Republican party, but no one will care much or talk about race any more. Sarat has “fuzzy” hair, but her father’s skin was a “caramel” shade and he keeps a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe in the converted shipping container where the family lives at the novel’s beginning. The Chestnutts don’t claim any ethnicity at all. Perhaps El Akkad envisions an America where the old races have so intermingled they can’t be distinguished , but in his version of the future, no one even seems to remember that race was once a cornerstone of American identity, a division and a heritage that tore the nation apart again and again. El Akkad’s southerners don’t talk like southerners, don’t behave like southerners, don’t seem to have any real roots in the land they fight for. (The idea that people would be willing to kill and die for the right to burn petroleum, while somewhat redolent of the longstanding southern resentment of federal intervention, is laughable.) It’s hard to view this novel as the story of how an American would respond to the conditions that create terrorists in other nations because Sarat and her family don’t seem especially American. They have the generic, benighted quality of figures who appear briefly in newspaper articles about human rights crises in obscure, “war-torn” nations, detached from their homeland and its customs and all the fragile dignity those things carry. Sarat’s identity is entirely shaped by the war and what she loses to it. Late in the book, when Sarat has been almost completely hardened, she offers up what amounts to the novel’s thesis: “The misery of war represents the world’s only truly universal language.” In peacetime, the peoples of the globe may seem diverse, but when war strips them of “the empty superstitions to which they clung so dearly”, they are “kin. The universal slogan of war, she’d learned, was simple: if it had been you, you’d have done no different.” The point is arguable. What people do in extremis, and what they suffer, is not all that they are, and plenty of combatants and victims cling all the more fiercely to the faiths and identities they owned before war wrecked their lives, finding them even more meaningful afterwards. But Sarat can’t be stripped of any of those things because she never really has them to begin with. She is a contrivance, existing only to serve the message of American War.

Peter Madsen, 46, faces a murder charge over the death of the 30-year-old journalist, whose headless, dismembered torso was found floating off Denmark’s capital city 10 days after she boarded the inventor’s self-built submarine for an interview. Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told the court that cause of death had not yet been formally established, but that the multiple knife wounds had been inflicted “at the time of death or shortly afterwards”. Traces of Madsen’s DNA had also been also recovered from Wall’s body, as well as traces of a saw blade consistent with the removal of her head and limbs after her death, Buch-Jepsen said. An examination of Madsen’s computer had also uncovered material featuring women being tortured and killed. Madsen, who denies killing Wall, took part in the half-hour custody hearing with his lawyer via a video link from Copenhagen’s Vestre prison. He said he was “not the only person” with access to the computer in his workshop, and the extreme content did not belong to him. His defence lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said the court had heard “nothing that supports Kim Wall being killed by my client”. No investigations had been carried out to substantiate Madsen’s claim that the journalist died in an accident and that her body was still intact when he disposed of it at sea, she said. Madsen told a hearing last month that the journalist died when a 70kg hatch cover fell on her head while she was climbing on to the deck of the surfaced submarine. “It was a terrible accident, a disaster,” he said. Feeling “suicidal”, he attached a metal weight around her waist so her body would sink, and planned to sink his submarine, taking his own life, he said. “In my shock I thought it was the right thing to do,” he told the court. Wall, who had written for the Guardian and New York Times, was last seen alive on the Nautilus on 10 August. After her boyfriend reported her missing, the 18-metre submarine was located south of Copenhagen the following morning. Madsen, an entrepreneur, artist, submarine builder and self-taught aerospace engineer, was rescued just before the vessel sank, and arrested. He will appear in court again on 31 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/05/nobel-peace-prize-2017-who-are-the-likely-nominees","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T04:00:13Z","webTitle":"Nobel peace prize 2017: who are the likely nominees?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/nobel-peace-prize-2017-who-are-the-likely-nominees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/05/nobel-peace-prize-2017-who-are-the-likely-nominees","fields":{"headline":"Nobel peace prize 2017: who are the likely nominees?","bodyText":"The winner of the 2017 Nobel peace prize will be announced in Oslo on Friday, selected by a panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament from a total of 318 known and reported candidates. Apart from the victor, the names of the nominees are officially kept secret for at least 50 years, but nominators – including former laureates, politicians and academics – often disclose their candidates. False reports are also common. More or less likely nominations this year – both rumoured and confirmed – include Lions Club International, Julian Assange, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jo Cox, the Bulgarian Orthodox church, David Bowie, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. But Norway’s Peace Research Institute Oslo, which each year draws up a shortlist, and the betting markets have settled on a handful of frontrunners. Mohammad Javad Zarif and Federica Mogherini The Iranian foreign minister and EU foreign policy chief are seen as strong contenders as orchestrators of the Iran nuclear deal. With tensions mounting between the US and North Korea, the jury could choose to support a landmark effort to restrict nuclear arms development and proliferation now at risk of being torn up by Trump, who has called it an “embarrassment”. John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, was also a key part of negotiations but the Nobel committee could be keen to stress broad international backing for the deal. The White Helmets and their leader Raed al Saleh A decision in favour of the group formally known as the Syrian Civil Defence, nominated several times in recent years, and its remarkable efforts to help civilians in a country torn by six years of war would be a popular award recognising vital humanitarian work and social solidarity in the face of a brutal military onslaught and extreme danger. Can Dündar and Cumhuriyet Now living in self-imposed exile in Germany, Dündar was a columnist and editor-in-chief of the secular, republican-leaning Turkish daily, several of whose staff have faced charges of complicity in terrorism for simply doing their jobs. A prize for the editor and his former paper would be a symbolic blow against president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s crackdown on press freedoms. UN high commission for refugees The UN refugee agency has won two Nobel peace prizes in the past but none since 1981, and the jury may feel its work, led by Filippo Grandi during a period of unprecedented global migration and displacement, is worth rewarding. In recent years, the agency has responded to the Syrian civil war, Europe’s refugee crisis and Muslim Rohingya fleeing Myanmar. Angela Merkel has reportedly also been nominated for her decision to open Germany’s border to more than 1 million refugees and migrants. Pope Francis A favourite with at least one bookmaker this year. No pontiff has ever won the prize but Francis would be widely seen as a popular choice for his strong stance on issues such as refugees, poverty, social justice and climate change. He was nominated this year by a Norwegian member of parliament reportedly because “he is one of the rare ones to stand up to Donald Trump”. American Civil Liberties Union The American Civil Liberties Union has been particularly active since Trump’s inauguration, mounting repeated legal challenges against the US president’s more controversial decisions, including his travel ban and ban on transgender military personnel. It has described Trump as “a one-man constitutional crisis”. Raif Badawi Arrested in June 2012 and found guilty of insulting Islam through his website and in TV comments, the Saudi blogger has been sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes. He has received 50 of those, with medical opinion declaring he would be unlikely to survive the remainder. Championed by human rights groups around the world, his victory, after repeated nominations, would be for courage, rationalism and freedom of speech – and an implicit criticism of a brutally repressive regime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/03/bame-workplace-stats-show-mixed-picture","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T17:25:17Z","webTitle":"BAME workplace statistics show mixed picture | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/03/bame-workplace-stats-show-mixed-picture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/03/bame-workplace-stats-show-mixed-picture","fields":{"headline":"BAME workplace statistics show mixed picture","bodyText":"Reni Eddo-Lodge, in her article You’re talked to as if you are a junior (27 September), refers to Policy Exchange’s report Bittersweet Success?. She says the report concluded that non-white ethnic minorities in highly skilled, middle-class, well-paid professions are concentrated at the bottom level of senior management roles and that it evidenced “drastic racial disparities”. Our report actually found that in professions such as law, medicine, and the civil service, minorities clustered towards the bottom, but that the shares at the top were broadly in line with the entry cohorts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was only at the very top of the top of the professions – FTSE 100 boards, NHS trusts, the most senior civil servants – that we found a shortfall of ethnic minority individuals. The report also found that just 12% of minorities believed themselves to have been discriminated against in promotion, and that ethnic Chinese and Indians (groups with the greatest educational attainment and thus the most likely candidates for professional advancement) were less likely to apply for it. Such factors need to be considered in any discussion of glass ceilings for ethnic minorities. There are real issues with progression and discrimination but these need to be properly quantified and benchmarked.

Spain was struggling to come to terms with the shock of Catalonia’s disputed referendum, as chaotic scenes of police violence accompanied a strong vote in support of independence. Across the Atlantic, meanwhile, the dreadful consequences of yet another US gun massacre, this time in Las Vegas, were slowly becoming clear. Both stories feature prominently inside this week’s paper (including, on the Vegas shootings, an unmissably cutting reflection from our US commentator Richard Wolffe). But our cover splash this week takes us to the Amazon, where Brazil’s plans to create a mega-trade canal through the Tapajos basin threaten to wreak untold devastation on one of our last great unspoiled wildernesses. Told in rich detail by Jonathan Watts, and with great collaboration from our graphics team, this is another example of the relentless encroachment of so-called economic progress on the Earth’s natural wonders. I think it’s exactly the sort of reporting the Weekly should be drawing to your attention and I hope you find the piece as eye-opening as I did. Elsewhere in the paper there’s a moving dispatch concerning families separated on Chad’s border with Nigeria, cheering news for women drivers in Saudi Arabia and heartbreak on the frontline of the Rohingya Muslim exodus from Myanmar. From the UK we uncover fresh evidence of disturbing work practices in a chicken-processing plant, bring you news lines from the Conservative party conference and report on the sudden failure of one of the country’s biggest holiday airlines. The Review section takes us into the world of filing cabinets and dusty offices occupied by Germany’s last remaining Nazi hunters, as the years wind down on one of the world’s final great cold case investigations. Discovery has an interview with the great naturalist David Attenborough, still making genre-defining wildlife documentaries at 91. As a major retrospective opens in London, Culture considers the work of the late artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, whose work made the difficult transition from the street to the gallery. And there’s a look at the art of craft beer labels, whose playful designs are helping to bring traditional ales out of the tap room and into the mainstream. I’ll admit there was a fair bit of head-scratching at times over how to piece together this week’s edition, but I’m very proud of the outcome. Special mention is due to the Weekly’s long-suffering production team, who cheerfully accommodated a testing range of fiddly page changes from the acting editor! I can only hope you enjoy the fruits of their labours. Thank you for your support as subscribers and please feel free to email me your views about the paper.

Here’s our full news story and some reading/listening material, for both the Ishigurus (my newly coined term, to match Murakami’s ardent Harukists) and the readers among you who have yet to discover him (you’re in for a treat): Speaking to the BBC, the author has called the award a “magnificent honour, mainly because it means that I’m in the footsteps of the greatest authors that have lived”. “The world is in a very uncertain moment and I would hope all the Nobel prizes would be a force for something positive in the world as it is at the moment,” he said. “I’ll be deeply moved if I could in some way be part of some sort of climate this year in contributing to some sort of positive atmosphere at a very uncertain time.” Ishiguro, who was born in Nagasaki, lived in England for almost 30 years before he made his first trip back to to Japan in 1989. He reportedly wasn’t aware of his home town’s significance as the target of a US atomic bomb in August 1945 until reading about it in a British textbook. Despite this detachment from his country of birth, Japan features prominently in Ishiguro’s first novel, A Pale View of Hills, which is set in Nagasaki and England. His second novel, An Artist of the Floating World, centres on Masuji Ono, a once respected artist who, in postwar Japan, must come to terms with his support for the country’s doomed militarist adventurism during the first half of the 20th century. Britain’s selective memory regarding its imperial past also applies to Japan, Ishiguro said in a 2015 interview with the Asian American Writers’ Workshop. “In Japan – and I’m very distant from Japan, so I’m looking at this from a great distance – but there has always been this conflict with China and Southeast Asia about the history of the second world war,” he said. “The Japanese have decided to forget that they were aggressors and all the things that the Japanese imperial army did in China and south Asia in those years.” Self, in typically lugubrious form, has emailed: “He’s a fairly good writer, and surely doesn’t deserve the dread ossification and disregard that garnishes such laurels.” The former UK poet laureate Andrew Motion says: “Ishiguro’s imaginative world has the great virtue and value of being simultaneously highly individual and deeply familiar – a world of puzzlement, isolation, watchfulness, threat and wonder.” “How does he do it?” asked Motion. “Among other means, by resting his stories on founding principles which combine a very fastidious kind of reserve with equally vivid indications of emotional intensity. It’s a remarkable and fascinating combination, and wonderful to see it recognised by the Nobel prize-givers.” When Ishiguro’s last book, The Buried Giant came out, many were excited for what was anticipated to be his first foray into fantasy writing. But Ishiguro was concerned about his readers’ reaction to his new direction, telling the New York Times: “Will readers follow me into this? Will they understand what I’m trying to do, or will they be prejudiced against the surface elements? Are they going to say this is fantasy?” A bit of literary fisticuffs ensued, with Le Guin quickly responding in a sharply worded blog post: “Well, yes, they probably will. Why not? It appears that the author takes the word for an insult.” “I had no idea this was going to be such an issue,” Ishiguro later said at a Guardian Bookclub event. “Everything I read about [The Buried Giant], it’s all, ‘Oh, he’s got a dragon in his book, ’or ‘I so liked his previous books, but I don’t know if I’ll like this one’. [Le Guin]’s entitled to like my book or not like my book, but as far as I am concerned she’s got the wrong person. I am on the side of the pixies and the dragons.” However, even if he had laid claim to the term, Ishiguro wouldn’t be the first writer of fantasy to win: Rudyard Kipling, Maurice Maeterlinck, Hermann Hesse (The Glass Bead Game) and Isaac Bashevis Singer (who wrote short stories featuring ghosts and devils). There are also laureates who wrote speculative fiction – which Ishiguro is also known for since his 2005 novel Never Let Me Go: Doris Lessing (Canopus in Argos), José Saramago (Blindness) and Nadine Gordimer (July’s People). Salman Rushdie, a friend of Ishiguro, has sent his thoughts to us: “Many congratulations to my old friend Ish, whose work I’ve loved and admired ever since I first read A Pale View of Hills. And he plays the guitar and writes songs, too! Roll over Bob Dylan.” Our Japan correspondent Justin McCurry says: Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, southwestern Japan, and moved to Britain with his parents and two sisters in 1960, when he was aged five. Many Japanese will be familiar with the 1993 film adaptation of Remains of the Day, but the mood in the country of Ishiguro’s birth is likely to be one of disappointment that Haruki Murakami has missed out on the Nobel prize yet again. Here is the man in his own words, on writing his 1989 Booker winner The Remains of the Day: At the announcement, the academy’s Sara Danius described Ishiguro’s style as a mix of Jane Austen and Franz Kafka, adding: “But you have to add a little bit of Marcel Proust into the mix, and then you stir, but not too much, and then you have his writings.” “He’s a writer of great integrity. He doesn’t look to the sidee’s developed an aesthetic universe all his own,” she said. Danius says her favourite Ishiguro novel is The Buried Giant, but called The Remains of the Day “a true masterpiece, which starts as a PG Wodehouse novel and ends as something Kafkaesque”. “He is very interested in understanding the past, but he is not a Proustian writer – he is not out to redeem the past, he is exploring what you have to forget in order to survive in the first place, as an individual or as a society,” she said, adding – in the wake of last year’s uproar about Dylan – that she hoped the choice would “make the world happy”. “That’s not for me to judge. We’ve just chosen what we think is an absolutely brilliant novelist,” she said. The Academy has praised Ishiguro, the author of novels including The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go, and his writing as “marked by a carefully restrained mode of expression, independent of whatever events are taking place”. Ishiguro is the 114th winner, following in the footsteps of Seamus Heaney, Toni Morrison, Mo Yan and Pablo Neruda. (Ishiguro is a very serious guitar player, one of his many talents.) Strangely enough, the last time the Guardian interviewed Ishiguro was not for a book, but for a science exhibition – the show featured a machine to predict coastal storm surges built by his oceanographer father. What a surprise – although perhaps not such a big one after Dylan last year. Ishiguro was not a favourite to win, but he is renowned as a novelist – particularly for his 1989 novel The Remains of the Day, for which he won the Man Booker. The UK’s Kazuo Ishiguro! We’re getting close! In the meantime, lets admire the academy’s taste in doors. This usually isn’t a bad way of predicting the winner: (Or if it is a woman, the least translated into English) It seems Margaret Atwood is the last minute favourite with readers, according to the bookies. Ladbrokes said that this year had been their busiest prize, in terms of amount staked, with Atwood the most popular writer. She was at 6/1 but is now amongst the favourites at 7/2 in the final minutes of betting. A Ladbrokes spokesperson said: “literary punters think this year’s prize is hand-made for Atwood”. Oof. Author Hari Kunzru is still a bit gloomy after Dylan’s win last year. (Me too, Hari.) Another perennial favourite is Haruki Murakami: Known for his existential, experimental novels (which often feature his love for cats and for women with nice earlobes), Murakami was born in Japan in 1949 and began writing when he was 29. His most famous novels include Norwegian Wood (1987); The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1994-95) and Kafka on the Shore (2002). Our very own Steven Poole once praised Murakami as “among the world’s greatest living novelists”. Murakami makes it on to the favourites list every year – and every year, “Harukists” (ardent Murakami fans) head to bars in Japan, hopefully waiting for their beloved author’s name to finally be called. If it doesn’t happen this year, at least they have the solace of liquor. Here’s a lovely document: Albert Camus’s letter to his teacher, thanking him after his Nobel win in 1957. The Chinese novelist and short story writer Yan Lianke is also a favourite: Yan, who hails from Henan province, has won the Hua Zhong World Chinese Literature prize, the Lao She Literary award and the Franz Kafka prize. His novel The Explosion Chronicles, about a rural village which becomes a megalopolis, was longlisted for this year’s Man Booker International prize. He has previously been shortlisted twice for the award, last year for his novel The Four Books, set in a Mao-era labour camp. Last year, judges for the Man Booker International called him “one of China’s boldest living writers”. Now the South Korean author and poet, Ko Un: Described by Allen Ginsberg as “a magnificent poet, combination of Buddhist cognoscente, passionate political libertarian, and naturalist historian”, the Korean poet Ko Un is the author of more than 150 collections of poems, essays and fiction, and has long been named as a potential Nobel laureate. He became a Buddhist monk after the horrors of the Korean war and wrote his first few collections while under holy orders, going on to become a political activist, during which time he was arrested and imprisoned repeatedly. Andrew Motion has described him as “a major poet, who has absolutely compelling things to say about the entire history of South Korea, and equally engrossing things to say about his own exceptionally interesting life and sensibility”. Now for Margaret Atwood, arguably the most famous name on this year’s list. Atwood has had a doozy of a year with the very successful television adaptation of her 1985 novel, The Handmaid’s Tale, and another to come in Alias Grace, due on Netflix next month. The Canadian novelist, who is 77, is known for weaving searing political commentary into her novels, most often environmentalism and feminism. She won the Man Booker prize in 2000 for her novel The Blind Assassin, and has been nominated four other times. Her most recent novel, Hag-Seed, is a retelling of Shakespeare’s play The Tempest. Let’s have a look at the current favourites, starting with Ngugi wa Thiong’o Born in Kenya in 1938, Ngugi wa Thiong’o published his first novel, Weep Not Child, in 1964. When he started working with a local theatre group and writing in the Gikuyu language, he was arrested in 1977 and held in Mamiti Maximum Security Prison for a year without trial. “In prison I began to think in a more systematic way about language,” he told the Guardian in 2006. “Why was I not detained before, when I wrote in English?” He carried on writing and publishing in Gikuyu, even after his exile in 1982. He is now a professor of English and comparative literature at the University of California. His last novel, translated in English as Wizard of the Crow, was published in 2006. It has been pointed out online that the Academy may be hinting at a female winner this year, by tweeting this picture of the 14 women laureates (they did the same when Svetlana Alexievich won in 2015): But the Academy are notoriously hard to predict. Perhaps the selection of Bob Dylan was the first salvo in a campaign to take literature back to the streets. After all, the arguments in favour of considering Dylan as a poet apply equally straightforwardly to rap music, and arguably with more force. Step forward the self-styled King of the Streets, Grandmaster Melle Mel, who Sara Danius will agree has been working “not just the written tradition, but also the oral one; not just high literature, but also low literature” since the 1980s, when he performed “often together with instruments” on tracks such as The Message, Step Off and White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It). If the trailblazing vigour of Melle Mel is too much for the committee, then maybe they’ll opt for the dizzying inventiveness of Missy Elliott or the linguistic dexterity of MC Solaar. It is, however, a literary award, so it’s difficult to see past the mesmeric economy of Salt-N-Pepa, as exemplified in their 1986 hit Push It: Ah, push it - push it good Ah, push it - push it real good Ah, push it - push it good Ah, push it - p-push it real good Last year, Bob Dylan’s odds shot from 50/1 to 10/1 just before the announcement. This year, according to the betting data site Smart Bets, which assesses odds based on the whole market, “the writer with the same momentum” is the South Korean poet Ko Un, who has moved from 33/1 to 10/1. “It has definitely paid to follow the money over recent years when it comes to identifying the winner of the prize. Plenty of literary pundits scoffed at the idea of Bob Dylan being a contender, but they were made to eat humble pie by those watching market fluctuations,” said Smartbets.com’s Alexander Kostin. “The literary betting public [is] seemingly very confident in the Korean poet, who has been a mainstay in the betting lists for considerable time. As for Murakami, the day he finally wins bookmakers will be made to pay by his army of fans. But my suspicion is that they will miss out again.” Mũkoma wa Ngũgĩ, author and son of consistent Nobel favourite Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, has a new technique: When Dylan was announced as the 2016 winner, the Swedish Academy’s Sara Danius immediately anticipated the furrowed brows and launched straight into his literary credentials. “If you look back, far back, you discover Homer and Sappho, and they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to,” she said. “They were meant to be performed. It’s the same way with Bob Dylan. But we still read Homer and Sappho. He can be read and should be read.” A lot of authors, who can also be read and also should be read, were less than impressed. Hari Kunzru: “This feels like the lamest Nobel win since they gave it to Obama for not being Bush.” Reza Aslan: “I’m sorry but this is total bullshit.” Will Self, was more sanguine (about Bob, not the Nobel): “My only caveat about the award is that it cheapens Dylan to be associated at all with a prize founded on an explosives and armaments fortune, and more often awarded to a buggins whose turn it is than a world-class creative artist. Really, it’s a bit like when Sartre was awarded the Nobel – he was primarily a philosopher, and had the nous to refuse it. Hopefully Bob will follow his lead.” (He didn’t). Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s coverage of the Nobel prize in literature. Introduced as part of a swathe of awards by 19th-century industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1901, the literature prize is either the most prestigious award in books, or as Irvine Welsh put it last year: “An ill-conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies.” Earlier this week, medals were awarded in physics, medicine, and chemistry. Unlike last year, the literature medal is being awarded in the same week as the rest of the prizes. At the time, the academy’s Per Wästberg denied gossip that the week-long delay was due to members disagreeing over the proposed winner; later, the prize would go to the determinedly elusive singer songwriter Bob Dylan. This year the prize is worth 9m Swedish krona (£832,000) – 1m more than last year. We’ll be here to tell you who the 114th winner is at 12noon BST (1pm Central European Time). When that happens, we’ll either explain who they are or watch bemusedly as literary celebrity is showered on Kenny Loggins, who knows."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/05/liam-gallagher-as-you-were-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T13:00:24Z","webTitle":"Liam Gallagher: As You Were review – motormouth meets the Beatles, again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/liam-gallagher-as-you-were-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/05/liam-gallagher-as-you-were-review","fields":{"headline":"Liam Gallagher: As You Were review – motormouth meets the Beatles, again","bodyText":"The relative commercial failure of Liam Gallagher’s post-Oasis band Beady Eye counts as one of the more perplexing events in recent pop history. To an impartial observer, their two albums seemed neither better nor worse than Oasis’s multi-platinum latter-day efforts. It was surprising that a fanbase who once seemed perhaps the most devoted and undiscriminating around – people who dutifully trooped out in their millions to buy albums as mediocre as Heathen Chemistry, people who sent a track as slender as Songbird to the upper reaches of the singles chart – suddenly became so capricious, so seemingly discerning in their pursuit of Beatles/Slade-influenced bloke-rock. But they deserted in their droves: comparing Beady Eye’s sales figures to those of even the least successful Oasis album, 90% of them jumped ship. Why? Was it loyalty to Noel? Or does some kind of super-sense lurk beneath their feather-cuts that enables them to discern a qualitative difference between the contents of the Beady Eye album Different Gear, Still Speeding and all the forgettable old toot Oasis peddled in the noughties? Whatever the reason, it has left the younger Gallagher in a strange position: working, at his new record label’s behest, with pop songwriters for hire – most notably Greg Kurstin, of Adele, Sia and Ellie Goulding fame – and openly referring to his debut solo album as “my last chance”. If the pro songwriters occasionally just turn out machine-tooled takes on the aforementioned old toot that became Oasis’s main commodity in their later years, elsewhere the decision to employ them pays dividends in punchy, sharp production touches – the sampled guitar screech that powers the great single Wall of Glass; ominous We Love You-esque piano at the end of Come Back to Me – and some dexterous melodic twists and turns. An otherwise nondescript two-chord trudge called I Get By is unexpectedly rescued by a middle eight that achieves a dizzying vertical take-off. For What It’s Worth and Paper Crown, meanwhile, are fantastic: conspicuously better ballads than Gallagher Snr has come up with in 20 years, although it’s perhaps worth noting that their degree of craftsman’s polish means they don’t recall Oasis so much as the stadium air-punchers Guy Chambers and Robbie Williams wrote under Oasis’s influence. Chinatown is based around a lovely acoustic guitar figure, but is hobbled by lyrics so awful they can only be listened to safely with a pillow in front of you, thus avoiding injury when the urge to beat your head against the table becomes overwhelming. It sounds like a parody of one of those portentous Noel’s-been-having-a-think ballads that stank up Oasis’s late albums, and furthermore seems to favour us with Liam’s indispensable thoughts on Brexit: “What’s it to be free, man? What’s a European? Me, I just believe in the sun.” In truth, the lyrics are a problem throughout – although in fairness, at this stage, anyone buying an Oasis-related product in the hope of hearing decent lyrics is optimistic to the point of insanity. At their best, they aim for Shaun Ryder-y gibberish and occasionally hit their target – “You would keep the secrets in yer / You’ve been keeping paraphernalia” – or throw out put-downs that sometimes stick: “You made fun of everyone that falls, but in the meantime they were saving you a place.” At their worst, they persist in the wearying old habit of cramming clunking Beatles references in at every conceivable turn – “Happiness is still a warm gun”, “Look for the girl” – which rather serves to underline that there’s nothing new here, nothing to suggest that there has been any broadening of Gallagher’s musical horizons in the last 25 years. This is an album on which a track that sounds like the Hollies rather than the usual gallery of 60s and 70s suspects counts as a bold step into the unknown. You listen to him on the concluding I’ve All I Need, singing “Slow down, all things must pass, take your time, know the score, tomorrow never knows” and think: never mind the rest of us mate, are you not getting a bit bored of this stuff by now? In fact, I’ve All I Need – written by Gallagher alone – has a certain elegiac quality, as if its author assumes it’s going to be the last his audience hear of him for the foreseeable: “Dry your eyes … thanks for your support.” That seems a bit premature: if As You Were is not an unalloyed triumph, then nor is it the stuff of career-ending disaster. Its failings are the failings you could level at pretty much every Oasis album, its sprinkling of highlights an improvement on most of their output since the mid-90s. Perhaps that’s enough to win back the fans who jumped ship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/29/grenfell-fire-hundreds-gather-at-mosque-for-funerals-of-five-victims","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T16:12:40Z","webTitle":"Grenfell fire: hundreds gather at mosque for funerals of five victims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/29/grenfell-fire-hundreds-gather-at-mosque-for-funerals-of-five-victims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/29/grenfell-fire-hundreds-gather-at-mosque-for-funerals-of-five-victims","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell fire: hundreds gather at mosque for funerals of five victims","bodyText":"Hundreds of people have gathered in the al-Manaar mosque in west London to say funeral prayers for three women and two children who died in the Grenfell Tower fire. After the 75-minute ceremony on Friday, members of the mosque and the local community lined a narrow street close to the Westway flyover to see coffins containing the remains of the victims taken for burial at the Gardens of Peace Muslim cemetery in Hainault, Essex. In driving rain, grieving members of the families clung to each other and wept as the coffins, draped in green cloth embroidered with verses from the Koran, were brought out of the mosque and placed in hearses. The remains of Rania Ibrahim, 31, and her daughters Fethia Hassan, four, and Hania Hassan, three, were found in their flat on the 23rd floor. Rania’s husband, Hassan Hassan, an employee of the mosque, was in Cairo at the time of the fire and watched his wife’s harrowing video uploaded on Facebook in real time before boarding a plane back to the UK. Rania was identified by dental records, and her children by “anthropology and secondary supporting evidence”, Westminster coroner’s court heard. The provisional cause of their deaths was given as “consistent with the effects of fire”. The mother and daughters were identified three months after the fire on 14 June. Isra Ibrahim, 33, and her mother, Fathia Ahmed, 71, also lived on the 23rd floor. The two women are believed to have sought refuge with Rania, who was their neighbour, as the flames and smoke advanced up the tower. Isra Ibrahim’s brother, Abufars Ibrahim, 39, died of multiple injuries after jumping from the building, an inquest heard. At the start of the prayers, Abdurahman Sayed, the chief executive of the al-Manaar mosque and Muslim cultural heritage centre, called on Allah to give people strength and patience as they bid farewell to loved and valued members of the community. The mosque has been a crucial pillar of support in the community in the aftermath of the fire. Before the janaza, or funeral prayers, were said, an imam delivered a sermon in Arabic and English, reminding people of their “duty to stretch out the hand of help” to those in need. In the upstairs women’s prayer area behind fretwork wooden screens, rows of women shuffled up to make room for latecomers. Even so, many prayed outside the hall in corridors and on stairs. Dozens of vehicles, including a coach, took relatives and friends of the two families to the Gardens of Peace, one of the UK’s largest Muslim cemeteries. They were due to return to the mosque later for a reception. The Grenfell Muslim response unit has estimated that a majority – perhaps 80% – of those living in Grenfell Tower were Muslim. The organisation has worked with Eden Care, a specialist Muslim end-of-life and burial service, to organise funerals for Grenfell victims – including non-Muslims – without charge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/29/tesco-admits-error-over-repackaging-of-returned-lidl-chicken","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T08:16:45Z","webTitle":"Tesco admits error over repackaging of returned Lidl chicken","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/29/tesco-admits-error-over-repackaging-of-returned-lidl-chicken","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/29/tesco-admits-error-over-repackaging-of-returned-lidl-chicken","fields":{"headline":"Tesco admits error over repackaging of returned Lidl chicken","bodyText":"Tesco has said it made a mistake when it described chicken sold under its Willow Farm brand as “reared exclusively” for the supermarket chain, after undercover footage of a processing plant showed packs of drumsticks returned by Lidl being repackaged as Willow Farm products. The UK’s biggest retailer has removed the claim that Willow Farm chicken is “reared exclusively for Tesco” from its website after film obtained as part of a Guardian and ITV News investigation into poultry giant 2 Sisters Food Group (2SFG) showed packs of Lidl drumsticks being opened and emptied back on to the production line. The drumsticks then re-emerged at the end of the line, repackaged with Willow Farm labels and destined for Tesco’s shelves. “The Willow Farm brand is exclusive to Tesco and this is clearly marked on our packaging,” said a Tesco spokesman. “The wording on our website unfortunately was incorrect and we have already removed it. We sincerely apologise to customers for any confusion this may have caused.” Lawyers from Schillings, speaking on behalf of 2 Sisters, said: “The Willow Farms brand is exclusive to Tesco, but the raw material is not.” Willow Farm is one of seven so called “farm” brands launched by Tesco last year to stop customers defecting to cheaper rivals Aldi and Lidl. The use of fake British-sounding farm names, such as Woodside, Willow and Boswell was controversial from the outset with the National Farmers’ Union pointing to the abundance of real farms in Britain. Retailers can return chicken to suppliers for a variety of reasons including packaging and labelling errors. It does not mean it is unfit to eat. However, if older meat is mixed with fresher meat, the use-by date should reflect the age of the oldest meat in the batch. The Guardian investigation found evidence of 2 Sisters workers altering the slaughter date of poultry, raising the risk that shoppers could end up buying meat past its use-by date. It also captured workers dropping chicken on the floor of the processing plant and returning it to the production line. In a statement Schillings, 2 Sisters’s legal advisers, told the Guardian: “2SFG meets the raw materials specifications for the Willow Farms brand.” Tesco said it took the allegations against 2 Sisters extremely seriously and was carrying out its own “rigorous” investigation into the issue. “The Food Standards Agency has conducted an initial inspection which did not find any current breaches, however we will continue to review their findings as well as our own,” continued the spokesman. “To provide additional assurance to our customers we will also be putting in place further quality measures at the site while our investigation continues.” The Tesco boss, Dave Lewis, a marketer who spent most of his career at consumer brands giant Unilever, has always defended the no-frills farm brands which span meat, poultry and other produce, and have been a big hit with shoppers. Willow Farm chicken drumsticks are the cheapest on sale in Tesco at £1.99 per kilo. Free range, corn-fed drumsticks, sold under its top house brand Finest, cost more than twice as much at £4 a kilo. Last year Lewis insisted that customers were “savvy” about how marketing worked. He added: “Do they come from farms? Yes. Can one farm satisfy all the demand from Tesco? No. The product truth is absolutely right.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/childrens-books-filth-author-biff-chip-kipper-pugwash-pooh","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T15:44:14Z","webTitle":"Dogging and side-boobs – are children’s books really bulging with filth? | Stephanie Merritt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/childrens-books-filth-author-biff-chip-kipper-pugwash-pooh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/childrens-books-filth-author-biff-chip-kipper-pugwash-pooh","fields":{"headline":"Dogging and side-boobs – are children’s books really bulging with filth?","bodyText":"“Christopher Robin went up the stairs, trailing Pooh behind him.” My son considered this the all-time funniest line in literature when he was small – it’s fortunate he never discovered the 90s spin-off Cooking With Pooh (still available from Amazon, complete with set of shaped cookie-cutters, for those who are into that sort of thing). The original Pooh was apparently named after a swan, though it’s hard to imagine AA Milne didn’t know what he was doing. Generations of kids have squealed with delight at the scatological bear’s antics (particularly the one in which Pooh gets stuck in a tight hole), before they graduate to the unintended hilarity of all the Dicks, Fannys and Tittys in other well-loved 20th-century classics. Innocent times. These days, our children’s primary school books are apparently rife with subliminal images of cottaging, predatory priests and references to STDs. At least, according to Twitter, where this week someone claimed to have found a background picture in the popular Biff, Chip and Kipper series that showed a group of moustachioed men entering a clump of bushes, only to be discovered in the next scene by a granny so shocked at what she saw that her glasses fell off. Alas, the truth turns out to be more prosaic; as so often in life, context is everything, and the book’s publisher, Oxford University Press, pointed out that pages had been missed out in the original tweet to suggest a cause and effect that was never intended. Still, it must be noted that the Biff, Chip and Kipper team has form in this area: one book had to be reprinted in 2003 after sharp-eyed readers spotted a scene in which alphabet building blocks spelled “hepatitis”. Personally, I have no problem with anything that gives my child a subliminal advantage at Scrabble, but it was also observed that another illustration from the same series shows an eye-test chart behind a character supposedly based on Rolf Harris that reads “FROT”. Again, this book was published before real life caught up with us. None of this is new. The history of children’s literature is littered with eagle-eyed moral guardians convinced they have uncovered corrupting influences, and just as many authors and illustrators who have clearly entertained themselves by seeing what they can get away with. In the early 1990s, a US edition of Where’s Waldo? was withdrawn after a partial side-boob was discovered in a beach scene, but then Where’s Waldo? is the perfect place to smuggle in a cheeky image. Disney and Pixar have been doing it for years, and there are YouTube videos dedicated to uncovering scenes of transvestism, torture and human sacrifice that have sneaked past the censors. In my teens, we were all very excited to learn that The Magic Roundabout was a secret encyclopedia of drug references. With hindsight, it seems that this was mostly wishful thinking, though it does contain some choice lines which can’t be accidental: “I’ll probably get cornered by some boring old fruit,” sighs Dougal, on the way to a party (he is later approached by a talking banana). It’s this juxtaposition of innocence and knowingness – combined with the fact that children are often reading or watching with parents – that makes it so tempting for the creators to slip in an innuendo that will go over the children’s heads. But there can be a dark side to determinedly seeking filth that isn’t there. The other classic “fact” of my teenage years was that the Captain Pugwash books, which I had loved as a kid, were filled with all manner of double entendre; we thought it was hilarious that we’d never noticed. The reason we hadn’t is that none of it was true: “Seaman Staines”, “Master Bates” and “Roger the Cabin Boy” were inventions of a 1970s student magazine, but the names became such common currency that John Ryan, creator of the Pugwash series, successfully sued for libel in the early 90s after two newspapers published the invention as fact. After his death, his daughter said he had been badly upset by the slur on his books, and had given the damages he was awarded to lifeboat charities – a detail I find unbearably poignant. Sometimes things really should be allowed to be innocent. At other times, though, the temptation is too delicious to resist. If ever there was a set-up that invited dirty subtext, it was the Rainbow house in the 70s and 80s children’s programme, where a man in a rainbow jumper shared a bed with a big bear, and Rod, Jane and Roger lived in a bizarre musical menage a trois. Aware of the implications, the cast made a perfect deadpan spoof episode, apparently for the staff Christmas party (not, as was reported in 2001, when it was discovered as a pilot episode). Once you’ve heard Bungle shout “I can’t get it in, Geoffrey,” from behind a bedroom door, Biff and Chip’s dogging adventure seems rather tame by comparison. • Stephanie Merritt is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/29/cameroon-palm-oil-campaigner-arrested-crackdown-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T17:03:17Z","webTitle":"Cameroon palm oil campaigner arrested in crackdown on activists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/29/cameroon-palm-oil-campaigner-arrested-crackdown-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/29/cameroon-palm-oil-campaigner-arrested-crackdown-activists","fields":{"headline":"Cameroon palm oil campaigner arrested in crackdown on activists","bodyText":"A prominent campaigner against palm oil plantations has been arrested amid a growing crackdown on environmental and human rights activists in Cameroon, according to local lawyers and NGOs. Nasako Besingi, who has led opposition to a US-funded 73,000 hectare farm in a biodiverse rainforest, is among more than 100 individuals who have been detained during an escalation of tension between the predominantly French-speaking authorities and the country’s large English-speaking minority. Supporters of Besingi claim the authorities are using the “anglophone crisis” to put pressure on the campaigner, who has been jailed, threatened, and sued on several previous occasions. Police raided Besingi’s office in Mundemba on 25 September, seizing his passport, documents, phones and computers. The NGO Frontline Defenders said the arrest was in keeping with a pattern of intimidation. In November 2015, Besingi lost a defamation case filed by the US company Herakles Farms regarding a claim that he was beaten by the company’s employees. In January 2016, a court ordered Besingi to pay a fine of 344,400 CFA francs (£450) or serve a year’s imprisonment. “We see this as a continuation of the intimidations against him and his organisation Sefe [Struggle to Economise the Future Environment] for the work related to environmental and social justice campaigns,” said a local source. “Our worries are with his health. He has a health condition and needs access to medication. We are not clear if this is being provided.” A lawyer familiar with the case predicted Besingi would probably remain in prison on suspicion of sedition until the end of October, when he and others detained in the crackdown were likely to be freed. “This isn’t the first time this has happened. What is new is that people are using social media to spread the news so there is international attention,” said the lawyer, who asked not to be named due to fears of repercussions by the authorities. The Cameroon human rights committee did not respond to the Guardian’s request for a comment. Besingi had rallied the local community against the plantation, one of many to open up recently in the Congo basin, the world’s second-largest rainforested area. After his previous trial, Greenpeace condemned the alleged efforts of the palm oil company to silence Besingi. “Nasako has committed no crime other than exercising his democratic right to protest at what he believes to be a project detrimental to his community, his environment and local livelihoods,” said Irène Wabiwa Betoko, a forest campaign manager with Greenpeace Africa. But Besingi had also spoken out against the human rights violations, including recent arrests of anglophone activists – potentially putting him on the radar of security forces in the ongoing crisis. Several people have been killed in protests over the past year that call for greater economic and political representation by the anglophone community. In recent demonstrations some waved secessionist flags. The rallies are expected to peak on independence day this Sunday, prompting concerns of violence. President Paul Biya has deployed the military, advised parents to keep their children at home, and warned that demonstrators will “meet the firm reaction of the armed forces”. The border with Nigeria has been temporarily closed. The roots of the linguistic divide lie in the partitioning of the former German colony at the end of the first world war between the French and British victors. Although the two groups unified after independence in 1960, there have been allegations of unequal treatment. The recent upsurge of hostility has alarmed onlookers. On Thursday, António Guterres, the UN secretary general, expressed “deep concern” and urged the government to promote measures of national reconciliation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/29/john-foskett-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T16:43:38Z","webTitle":"Canon John Foskett obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/29/john-foskett-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/29/john-foskett-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Canon John Foskett obituary","bodyText":"My father, John Foskett, who has died aged 78, was a clergyman and pastoral counsellor who worked primarily in churches and hospitals but also in other environments. He was born in Croydon, south London, the son of Mary (nee Challis), an elocution teacher, and Herbert, a corn factor. He went to Tonbridge school, where, because of his dyslexia, he was taken under the wing of the school chaplain. This association was instrumental in his decision to study theology. He graduated from St Catharine’s College, Cambridge, in 1962. John went on to Chichester Theological College and was ordained in 1964, becoming a curate at St John the Baptist in Old Malden, Surrey, and then priest in charge at St John the Evangelist, Kingston upon Thames. Alongside his theological studies he trained in counselling with Richmond Fellowship. This led him to become the first full-time chaplain of the Maudsley and Bethlem Royal hospitals in London in 1975, a job he did for 18 years before he retired on health grounds. He was also an honorary canon of Southwark Cathedral (1988-94), and went on to work in private practice, supervising, teaching and giving counselling. He was a pioneer in clinical pastoral education, teaching both clergy and mental health professionals about pastoral counselling for those with religious or spiritual views or conflicts. For much of his professional life he fought to give a voice and structural power to people with mental health needs. He had the ability to sit and talk with just about anybody and listen and respond with wisdom and compassion. His writing included two books: Meaning in Madness (1984), about mental health, religion and chaplaincy, and Helping the Helpers (1988), with David Lyall, about supervision for pastoral counsellors. He also wrote articles for therapeutic journals, including the journals of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and of the Association of Pastoral Care and Counselling, which he helped set up. He had many passions besides his work, including cricket and rugby, good food, the countryside and fun times with family and friends. He belonged to a couple of local campaigning groups in Dorchester, organising talks, going to functions attended by the local MP, Oliver Letwin, to raise issues of climate change with him, writing letters and being active on the Dorset churches group that campaigns for its buildings to function more ecologically. His health had been declining slowly for over a decade, as a consequence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which began in 1987. He married Mary, a teacher and dietitian, in 1964, having met her at Cambridge University in 1961. She survives him, as do his children, Andrew, Sam, Naomi and me, and his grandchildren, Luke, Max, Wesley, Phoebe and Sullivan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/01/the-13-year-old-syrian-refugee-prizewinning-poet-amineh-abou-kerech-betjeman-prize","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"The 13-year-old Syrian refugee who became a prizewinning poet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/01/the-13-year-old-syrian-refugee-prizewinning-poet-amineh-abou-kerech-betjeman-prize","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/01/the-13-year-old-syrian-refugee-prizewinning-poet-amineh-abou-kerech-betjeman-prize","fields":{"headline":"The 13-year-old Syrian refugee who became a prizewinning poet","bodyText":"“I take words from anywhere,” says Amineh Abou Kerech, moments after winning the 2017 Betjeman poetry prize for 10- to 13-year-olds last week. “I take them from songs and films, from what I see on the computer or the television. And I put them all together.” She makes it sound so simple. It’s anything but, according to her older sister Ftoun, who is smiling at Amineh across a pub table in London’s St Pancras station. “She sits in her bedroom all the time and practises, practises.” Amineh, who was born in Syria 13 years ago, nods. She started writing poems during the four years her family spent in Egypt, but since moving to England last summer, with a new language to master and a new culture to get to grips with, she has been working doubly hard on her verses. Her prizewinning poem, Lament for Syria, was written half in English, half in Arabic, and translated fully into English with help from her sister, her teacher and Google Translate. At the prizegiving, which took place on National Poetry Day last Thursday, next to the statue of John Betjeman at St Pancras, she read the first part of it in English before switching to Arabic at the words “I am from Syria.” Amineh was eight when they left. The civil war had begun a year earlier, in 2011, sparked by the Arab spring and kindled by disaffection towards the Assad regime. Her family lived in Darayya, a Damascus suburb known as a centre of anti-government protest. When violence flared up, Amineh’s parents Tammam and Basmeh fled the city with their young family. They moved around for a year, sleeping wherever they could find shelter, until remaining in Syria was no longer viable and they escaped to Egypt. “In Syria, all the time we were scared,” says Amineh. When they settled in Cairo, despite the fact that her family had lost everything (her father had owned a shop in Damascus selling fabric) and were living in the most basic conditions, Amineh’s fear abated. She began writing poetry, she says, as a way of putting her dislocation into words. “When I remember my Syria I feel so sad and I cry and start writing about her.” She tells me she doesn’t remember the country very well, though her poem suggests otherwise: it is, she writes, “a land where people pick up a discarded piece of bread / So that it does not get trampled on … a place where old ladies would water jasmine trees at dawn.” After four years, the family moved to England as refugees, settling in Oxford where Amineh and her two siblings – Ftoun, 14, and Mohammad, 11 – now go to school. At Oxford Spires, a multicultural academy in the east of the city where more than 30 languages are spoken, the two sisters joined a workshop led by the Iraqi poet Adnan Al-Sayegh. That’s where they met Scottish author Kate Clanchy, the school’s writer-in-residence since 2009, who has been nurturing Amineh and Ftoun’s talents at weekly classes. When I speak to Clanchy at the prizegiving, she marvels that Amineh has been speaking English for only a year. “Some of my most amazing writers lost a language at an early age,” she says, “in the sense that they arrive suddenly in England and are no longer able to tell stories and make themselves powerful in that way. It can turn them in on themselves. But I also think they have a special capacity at that age to produce really unusual rhythms and sounds in English, which makes them into really interesting poets.” This year’s judges, the poet Rachel Rooney and Observer cartoonist Chris Riddell (until recently, children’s laureate), agree that Amineh’s poem stood out from more than 2,000 entries, drawn from schools across the UK and the Republic of Ireland. “I found it really moving,” says Rooney. “It was passionate and complex. She was asking: ‘How can I do myself justice through a poem? How can I create a homeland on paper?’ And then she was actually doing it. Amazing.” “It addresses a contemporary issue that’s been breaking all our hearts,” adds Riddell. “It has a solemnity to it, but also the profound view that you get through a child’s eyes. It stands up as a poem, in any context.” Though it’s named after a most English poet, the Betjeman prize has been showcasing diverse voices since it was set up in 2006. The perspective here is global – one of Amineh’s fellow finalists, 10-year-old Shanelle Furtado, evokes her grandparents’ home in Mangalore in six vivid haikus – and it shows that adults are not the only ones with important and timely things to say. Speaking before the winner is announced, its director (and Betjeman’s granddaughter) Imogen Lycett Green makes a case for poetry’s importance in an uncertain world. “Poets are in the fringes of society, they’re not in the establishment,” she says. “They look at events, at lives, at love and at themselves from a sideways position. And in glancing from the side, the truth can sneak in. If adult poets are seeking the truth, I think children who are burgeoning writers are even closer to the truth.” When her poem won, Amineh looked stunned, then buried her head in her hands and wept. A moment later, as her family gathered round to congratulate her, she was beaming. “It’s a surprise for me, like a dream,” her father tells me afterwards. He never imagined his daughter winning a prize like this: poetry doesn’t run in the family. “I used to write simple things, but after the war, after the hard time that we had, we didn’t think that we needed to write anything,” he says. “We survived.” At the end of her poem, Amineh asks, “Can anyone teach me / how to make a homeland?” Although the future of her birthplace remains gravely uncertain, there are consolations to be had in her new home. “I feel so happy here because I have a future and things won’t be scary any more,” she tells me. “Everything will be good,” she adds, “and we will always be in peace.” Lament for Syria by Amineh Abou Kerech Syrian doves croon above my head their call cries in my eyes. I’m trying to design a country that will go with my poetry and not get in the way when I’m thinking, where soldiers don’t walk over my face. I’m trying to design a country which will be worthy of me if I’m ever a poet and make allowances if I burst into tears. I’m trying to design a City of Love, Peace, Concord and Virtue, free of mess, war, wreckage and misery. * Oh Syria, my love I hear your moaning in the cries of the doves. I hear your screaming cry. I left your land and merciful soil And your fragrance of jasmine My wing is broken like your wing. * I am from Syria From a land where people pick up a discarded piece of bread So that it does not get trampled on From a place where a mother teaches her son not to step on an ant at the end of the day. From a place where a teenager hides his cigarette from his old brother out of respect. From a place where old ladies would water jasmine trees at dawn. From the neighbours’ coffee in the morning From: after you, aunt; as you wish, uncle; with pleasure, sister… From a place which endured, which waited, which is still waiting for relief. * Syria. I will not write poetry for anyone else. * Can anyone teach me how to make a homeland? Heartfelt thanks if you can, heartiest thanks, from the house-sparrows, the apple-trees of Syria, and yours very sincerely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/01/charity-grandpics-ageuk-grandparents-day","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T23:05:01Z","webTitle":"Putting Granny online?

They asked me directly to do this. I said no. F*** em, I said. I didn’t say f*** em. But I did say no. There are three reasons I was nervous. One: I’m basically old enough to be a grandma myself and don’t understand how you’d convert an old photo album into a tweet.

Your friends will always ask to see pictures of the kids and, if you’re on TV, strangers are a bit like friends. It’s not their fault this creates a weird scenario whereby there’s a monetary value on a toddler’s image, motivating photographers to jump out from behind hedges.

Here are four snapshots: • My grandma Martha, who lived in a flat with vibrant patterned carpet, liked to make the Sunday roast in advance. 24 hours in advance. Chicken, potatoes, peas, the lot. Then she’d heat it all up in the morning. Lunch with her was slightly peculiar but it was never late. #grandpics • Grandpa Sam was handsome and funny and smoked a great deal. We didn’t quite know what he did for a living. He was possibly a plumber, or a handyman, or a debt collector. At any rate, he had a big spanner. Everyone said that he could have done anything, if only his father had let him go to university. #grandpics • Grandma Isabel was smiley, sparkly, cuddly and deaf like a grandma in a storybook. She was supposed to spend her life as a glamorous European socialite, not a lonely foreigner in Derby and Stanmore, but war got in the way and you had to figure you were lucky to be alive. She remembered being in Budapest when Lenin died, but I never asked about it because I was more interested in playing bridge with her. If you bid a suit and she raised to game, she’d cry: “Don’t invite me to a party if you don’t expect me to dance!” #grandpics • Grandpa Michael was a downbeat sort of fellow. His mother and siblings thought he was a terrible pessimist, always expecting the worst. So they didn’t go with him when he left Prague for England in 1939, setting off quickly with nothing but a briefcase. They stayed behind and they were taken to the camps and died there. He never got over the guilt. He liked to grow sweetcorn in the garden. #grandpics There: I make that £20 for AgeUK. The third reason I was nervous to tweet photos is that I thought, if you’re a lonely old person with internet access, you wouldn’t feel better to see a riotous celebration of family life. That’s the ultimate point, isn’t it? That is what lies behind the enterprise: the country’s masses of lonely and forgotten old folk with nobody to tell about their day or their life, their worrying health problem or their cold damp bedroom. Nobody to give them a hug, a squeeze, a reheated Sunday roast. Is it giving with one hand and taking away with the other, to celebrate our elders by parading happy families in front of them? Such a parade might be cripplingly sad if you were widowed and without grandchildren or estranged from your children and their offspring. Those are the saddest estrangements. In my observation, however small the spats or huge the rifts, it usually comes down to both sides yearning for more love than they think they’re getting. Or for love to be shown in a different way. Yet they somehow can’t change the dynamic. Heartbreaking. But this campaign will raise money to help address the danger of loneliness among the elderly, with advice and helplines and volunteers, which is such a huge and important cause. I haven’t given to AgeUK for a long time, not since our (LET ME BE CLEAR, BEAUTIFUL) daughter was born. I’m experiencing that cliche of motherhood: overnight, you start hearing the cries of babies and children all over the world and you forget how to care about anything else. When I was single, I always gave to old people’s charities. I thought the kiddie ones had no trouble raising money: it’s easy to make a poster when you can show huge, sad eyes in a tiny, innocent face. Same with cats. Incontinence and osteoporosis, among those sullied by life and time and changing politics, are not so easily romanticised. But the elderly should have priority, I thought, because the clock is ticking harder; there is no hope of happier future decades. And then I had a baby. And that was that. Anyone who says that parents are more “empathic” than the childless is quite wrong. If anything, it’s less so. My empathy changed direction and shrank. The idea of a suffering child is now unbearable to a degree I never imagined, but everyone else, with all their needs and sorrows, has drifted away. I wish my grandparents were still alive and could see her."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/02/sardinia-yacht-club-targets-sailors-with-charter-to-cut-plastic-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T05:30:22Z","webTitle":"Sardinia yacht club targets sailors with charter to cut plastic waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/02/sardinia-yacht-club-targets-sailors-with-charter-to-cut-plastic-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/02/sardinia-yacht-club-targets-sailors-with-charter-to-cut-plastic-waste","fields":{"headline":"Sardinia yacht club targets sailors with charter to cut plastic waste","bodyText":"One of the most exclusive yacht clubs in the world has drawn up an environmental charter to ask 150,000 sailors across the globe to reduce plastic pollution in the ocean. The Costa Smerelda yacht club in Sardinia, established by the Aga Khan 50 years ago, is publishing the charter to cut plastic waste at the One Ocean Forum conference. International sailing organisations have signed up to support the document which will be disseminated to 150,000 sailors who compete across the world. Riccardo Bonadeo, commodore of the club, said there was a need to raise awareness among sailors, people who live on and use the coast, and the wider public, about the need to reduce plastic waste and adopt more environmentally friendly marine practices. The charter aims to gather a commitment from yacht clubs, their members, marinas and other ocean users to adopt a set of principles and actions to reduce marine waste. Oliver Schwall, managing director of the Sailing Champions League which has contact with individual national leagues across the world, has signed the charter. “Behind the Sailing Champions League and the International Sailing League Association are up to 300 sailing clubs from 15 countries who have more than 150,000 members. “This give us a great opportunity to make the ideas of the Charta Smerelda known throughout Europe,” he said. The charter will be published at a conference run by Costa Smerelda yacht club in Milan on Tuesday and Wednesday. Bonadeo believes there has never been a more pressing time to promote its message which includes: eliminating single-use plastics preserving water resources protecting and preserving marine habitats adopting renewable energy adopting ethical and responsible behaviour during boating and sailing and raising public awareness of marine litter and pollution and the need to reduce it. Data from the Ellen MacArthur foundation show the scale of marine pollution. The foundation in a report in 2016 revealed that every year more than 8m tonnes of plastic are leaked into the ocean. Up to 40% of the world’s oceans are heavily affected by human activities causing pollution, loss of coastal habitats and depleted fisheries, according to the UN’s sustainable development goals. By 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur foundation. New figures revealed by the Guardian showed a million plastic bottles are bought across the world every minute. By 2021 purchase of plastic bottles will rise by 21% to 583bn bottles across the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/29/crimean-tatar-leader-ilmi-umerov-convicted-not-seek-clemency-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T14:40:04Z","webTitle":"Crimean Tatar leader convicted of ‘separatism’ will not seek clemency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/29/crimean-tatar-leader-ilmi-umerov-convicted-not-seek-clemency-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/29/crimean-tatar-leader-ilmi-umerov-convicted-not-seek-clemency-russia","fields":{"headline":"Crimean Tatar leader convicted of ‘separatism’ will not seek clemency","bodyText":"A Crimean Tatar leader sentenced to two years in jail for opposing Russian rule in the annexed territory has said he will not appeal to the Kremlin for mercy, despite illnesses that mean his life could be at risk in prison. “There is little hope for justice through an official appeal, and I will definitely not be making any appeals for clemency,” Ilmi Umerov told the Guardian by telephone from his Crimea home, saying he did not want to beg to his oppressors. Umerov, who was found guilty of “separatism” this week by a court in Crimea, has been diagnosed with stage three Parkinson’s disease, has type 2 diabetes and underwent a heart operation several years ago. His lawyer, Mark Feygin, said he was “physically unable” to withstand a prison term, calling it “effectively a death sentence”. He said he would mount a legal appeal, though he believed the case was politically motivated and only a political decision in Moscow would have an effect on the outcome. Umerov was tried for comments made to a Crimean Tatar television station last year in which he decried the 2014 annexation of the territory. The court claimed the words contained a call to change Russia’s borders by force, but Umerov and Feygin said his words had been incorrectly translated from Crimean Tatar language into Russian. “It’s absolutely clear to me that I was on trial for nothing more my refusal to shut up about my belief that Crimea is part of Ukraine, and the fact that I call an annexation an annexation and an occupation an occupation,” said Umerov. Moscow’s takeover of Crimea was supported by many in the region, but critics of the annexation have been dealt with ruthlessly. Independent media has been shuttered and there has been a wave of arrests and threats directed against the Crimean Tatars, the majority of whom opposed Russian rule for historical reasons. Joseph Stalin had the entire Crimean Tatar population deported in 1944 for alleged collaboration with the Nazis, and they were only allowed to return to Crimea in 1988. Umerov was the long-standing mayor of Bakhchiserai under Ukrainian rule, but resigned several months after the Russian takeover, saying he would not serve a government he believed to be an occupying regime. Since then, he has been targeted by authorities, culminating in this week’s verdict. In an unusual move, the judge decided to impose a harsher sentence than state prosecutors had requested, imposing a two-year term in a penitentiary settlement rather than the suspended sentence for which the prosecutors had asked. Feygin said it was “extremely irregular” for the judge to act this way, and also said it was unusual that Umerov had been allowed to remain free until the appeals process was concluded. “None of this is normal and it’s completely obvious that this was ordered from above,” he said. “I think it’s part of a Kremlin game. They want western leaders to call Putin and start bargaining over it.” Umerov said he had no regrets about not fleeing Crimea when he had the chance, insisting that the peninsula was his homeland. “Even if someone gave me a safe corridor to leave now, I would not accept,” he said. The case has been widely derided by rights groups, including the Moscow-based Memorial, which called it “illegal and politically motivated”. The European Union said the conviction was in breach of international humanitarian law and called on Russia to reverse it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/29/henry-bolton-elected-new-leader-of-ukip","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T15:24:58Z","webTitle":"Former soldier Henry Bolton elected as new leader of Ukip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/29/henry-bolton-elected-new-leader-of-ukip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/29/henry-bolton-elected-new-leader-of-ukip","fields":{"headline":"Former soldier Henry Bolton elected as new leader of Ukip","bodyText":"Ukip has narrowly avoided a shift towards the far right after its members elected the relatively unknown former soldier Henry Bolton as its new leader, just beating a populist anti-Islam candidate. In a result announced at the party’s annual conference in Torquay on Friday, Bolton, whose main political experience was to stand as Kent’s crime commissioner, won 3,874 votes, just under 30% of the relatively low total. Anne Marie Waters, who has called Islam “evil” and has links to the far right, finished second in the seven-candidate race with 2,755 votes. Numerous senior Ukip figures and most of its MEPs had threatened to walk away if she won. Instead, Ukip’s fourth leader inside a year is a low-key technocrat who has worked for the UN, stood as a Liberal Democrat MP and ran on the pledge to professionalise and unite a party riven by splits and seeking a new purpose following the Brexit referendum. Bolton, 54, was relatively unknown even among the Ukip faithful before the election to succeed Paul Nuttall, but gained momentum with a sober and restrained approach that distinguished him in a race often characterised by extremism and eccentricity. His election was immediately welcomed by Nigel Farage, Ukip’s former leader, who had reportedly planned to start a new party if Waters won. Farage tweeted that Bolton was “a man of real substance” while Arron Banks, the insurance millionaire who was Ukip’s biggest donor, said he was ready to engage with the party again. Bolton said he would “have a conversation” with Farage on a future Ukip role, and wanted to talk to all the other candidates, including Waters, before making decisions about them. He promised to keep Ukip at the forefront of the Brexit debate, but said it needed to expand its focus. “Brexit is our core task,” he said. “However, it is not the end of the line for us.” Bolton, a former soldier and Thames Valley police officer, later worked for organisations such as the UN and Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Kosovo and other countries. Asked at a press conference after the result was announced whether this made him an “establishment mole”, Bolton said his background made him ready for the job. “If you look at the things I’ve done, you’ll see a certain degree of endurance there, both physical, emotional and political,” he said. He said that, while he was different to Farage, he had the qualities for the job: “I’m not Nigel. None of us is Nigel. None of you are Nigel. Nigel is Nigel. I’m not going to try and fill his boots, I have my own style, my own personality.” Bolton distanced himself from the anti-Islam direction advocated by Waters and to a lesser extent by the early favourite, Peter Whittle, who finished a surprise fifth in the contest. “I absolutely abhor the rhetoric that says we are at war with Islam, or anything that indicates such,” he said. However, he said: “Islam is of concern, the nature of Islam and the practices of the religion are such that they tend to have a more dominating effect in a community where there’s a larger Muslim population than the Christian population.” He promised to review Ukip’s “integration agenda”, which was devised by Whittle for the 2017 election and which called for a ban on full-face veils in public, among other policies. Bolton faces a considerable task in heading a party whose share of the vote fell to 1.8% at the last general election from 12.6% in 2015. There were a total of 12,915 votes cast in the leadership election, compared with the more than 300,000 secured by Jeremy Corbyn when he was re-elected as Labour leader last year. Not all senior Ukip figures are thrilled by the rise of Bolton, or convinced he has the charisma and personality to turn the party around, with one predicting that, while Waters would destroy the party quickly, Bolton would bring “a slow death”. The party has been riven by splits and disagreements, one of which resulted in MEP Steven Woolfe being taken to hospital after a fight with another Ukip MEP. At the conference a year ago, members elected Diane James to succeed Farage, who stepped down after the Brexit referendum. She resigned after just 18 days in the post, saying she could not work with the party hierarchy. Another election followed, in which Paul Nuttall was selected as leader. However, he faced a tumultuous six months in charge, in which Ukip’s support at the general election plunged from almost 4m votes in 2015 to fewer than 600,000 in June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/live/2017/oct/02/the-2017-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T11:07:02Z","webTitle":"Jeffrey C Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W Young win 2017 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2017/oct/02/the-2017-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/live/2017/oct/02/the-2017-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine-live","fields":{"headline":"Jeffrey C Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W Young win 2017 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine – as it happened","bodyText":"One down and two to go – for the sciences at least. Today we saw the 2017 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine go to three American researchers, Jeffrey Hall at the University of Maine, Michael Rosbash at Brandeis University, and Michael Young at the Rockefeller University, for their decades-long work on the circadian clock. Given the 5am calls they had from Stockholm, I suspect they are experiencing firsthand what happens when that clock is disturbed. Thanks for joining us for today’s announcement. We’ll be back on Tuesday morning with our live coverage of the Nobel prize in physics. We expect to hear the winner or winners at the slightly later time of 10.45am BST. Do join us if you can. The Swedish news agency TT has quoted Rosbash as saying he got the call about the award just after 5 am local time. He paints a glamorous scene: I’m still shocked. I’m sitting here in my pajamas with my wife. I hadn’t even had a thought about this. I haven’t spoken with my colleagues yet. I haven’t even had time to have a cup of coffee. I’ve just spoken with Sir Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, who shared the Nobel prize in 2001 for research on the cell cycle. He knows the circadian clock work well. He shared a lab for a while with Michael Rosbash in Edinburgh in the 1970s, and as a former president of Rockefeller University knows Michael Young too. Here’s what Nurse had to say: Circadian rhythms are common to all organisms, from very simple single-celled algae through to ourselves. It’s a basic physiological process of great importance. What we have here are three individuals, one of whom was my colleague at Rockefeller, Mike Young, who used fruit flies to identify genes that when mutated alter the circadian rhythm. With that entrée from genetics, they went on to identify biochemically the components made by those genes, the RNA and proteins, and describe their regulation to understand the mechanisms that maintain that cellular clockwork which gives rise to the circadian rhythm. I asked Sir Paul why the work deserved the prize: It’s important for the basic understanding of life. Every living organism on this planet responds to the sun. All plant and also animal behaviour is determined by the light-dark cycle. We on this planet are slaves to the sun. The circadian clock is embedded in our mechanisms of working, our metabolism, it’s embedded everywhere, it’s a real core feature for understanding life. There’s a second reason. We are increasingly becoming aware that there are implications for human disease. With the modern technological age we get more and more divorced from the circadian rhythm, as we are able to travel across time zones and disturb our circadian rhythm. We can now live in light-dark regimes that are nothing to do with the circadian rhythm. This is leading to conditions like jet lag which are disturbing and may in turn also lead to other consequences that we don’t fully understand about the human condition. There is some evidence that treatment of disease can be influenced by circadian rhythms too. People have reported that when you have surgery or when you have a drug can actually influence things. It’s still not clear, but there will almost certainly be some implications for the treatment of disease too. I wanted to know a little about the scientists’ characters: are they artists, do they climb mountains. That sort of thing. Sir Paul said: They are excellent scientists and like many such individuals they have certain eccentricities which are charming and interesting and make them good people to share time with. When pushed to elaborate, Sir Paul did not. Here’s Michael Young, another one of today’s winners, speaking about his work at the same prize event we saw Rosbash and Hall talking at earlier: The winners have raised “awareness of the importance of a proper sleep hygiene” said Juleen Zierath of the Nobel academy. Here are two of the Nobel prize winners, Michael Rosbash and Jeffrey Hall, talking about their work on circadian rhythms after winning the 2012 Canada Gairdner International Award: One of the Nobel committee members has just described the scientists’ contribution as “the discovery of a fundamental mechanism underlying very important aspects of physiology: how our cells can keep time.” This, the first Nobel prize of the week, is a triple win for the US, the country with the most Nobels under its belt. The Nobel committee has not been able to reach Michael Young yet. Michael Rosbash replied: “You are kidding me,” when he got the call. The circadian clock, of course, is fundamental to our health. Here’s what the Nobel Foundation has to say about today’s prize for understanding the body’s inner clock: Life on Earth is adapted to the rotation of our planet. For many years we have known that living organisms, including humans, have an internal, biological clock that helps them anticipate and adapt to the regular rhythm of the day. But how does this clock actually work? Jeffrey C Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W Young were able to peek inside our biological clock and elucidate its inner workings. Their discoveries explain how plants, animals and humans adapt their biological rhythm so that it is synchronized with the Earth’s revolutions. Using fruit flies as a model organism, this year’s Nobel laureates isolated a gene that controls the normal daily biological rhythm. They showed that this gene encodes a protein that accumulates in the cell during the night, and is then degraded during the day. Subsequently, they identified additional protein components of this machinery, exposing the mechanism governing the self-sustaining clockwork inside the cell. We now recognize that biological clocks function by the same principles in cells of other multicellular organisms, including humans. With exquisite precision, our inner clock adapts our physiology to the dramatically different phases of the day. The clock regulates critical functions such as behavior, hormone levels, sleep, body temperature and metabolism. Our wellbeing is affected when there is a temporary mismatch between our external environment and this internal biological clock, for example when we travel across several time zones and experience “jet lag”. There are also indications that chronic misalignment between our lifestyle and the rhythm dictated by our inner timekeeper is associated with increased risk for various diseases. Here come the committee members who’ve been in a huddle at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. Worth remembering that the time given for each announcement is a “no earlier than” – it gives them time to contact the winners and get them lined up for phone interview with the Foundation. It’s not unheard of for winners to be hard to reach, or even go AWOL. Let’s here who it is then! We’re only a few minutes away from the announcement now. At least one person will have had that all important call from Stockholm. And it probably got them out of bed. For reasons that escape me now, I once thought it’d be fun to ask Nobel laureates about the downsides of winning the prize. I expected responses along the lines of “My wallet’s too tight for my 50s” and so on. But a few winners made some good points. Frank Wilczek, a physics Nobel laureate at MIT, had this to say: The main downsides are temptations, that can be resisted – specifically the temptation to rest on your laurels, and the dual temptation to pontificate on grandiose questions. Sage words indeed, especially that latter warning which does seem to be a common trap Nobel winners fall into. I also liked this point from Wilczek about watching deserving colleagues miss out on the prize. It can be a hard thing, emotionally, for people who think they will, or should, get it, when they don’t, year after year. And also for people who have near misses, when the prizes are announced, and the winners are somebody else. This can be painful even to watch, much less experience. Tim Hunt at Cancer Research UK won the medicine prize in 2001 along with Paul Nurse and Leland Hartwell. He notes that it’s not something many scientists take in their stride: I found it pretty hard to bear at first, and was extremely nervous that the Swedes would realise their mistake and rescind the prize at the last minute. The frog-levitating Andre Geim at Manchester, who won the 2010 Nobel prize for physics with his colleague, Konstantin Novoselov, perhaps hit the nail on the head with his response to my query: Journalists’ questions are the obvious downside in the context ;-). The Nobel prize in physiology or medicine has been awarded 107 times since 1901. Of those, 12 have gone to women, making medicine the least male-dominated of all the Nobels. The last to win the prize was Youyou Tu for her work on compounds that led to the anti-malarial drug, artemisinin. Talking of Barry Marshall, he has gone to the pub with fellow Nobel laureate Robin Warren to watch the announcement. And here is that selfie! Is that the 12th pint to celebrate their anniversary, or a pint to celebrate the 12 anniversary? Let’s assume the latter until more selfies turn up. There’s never a shortage of good contenders for any Nobel prize. Who is in the running for medicine this year? How about the scientists behind the gene-editing procedure known as Crispr? Unlike artemisinin, the anti-malaria drug that won a share of the 2015 Nobel prize for Youyou Tu, Crispr has yet to save lives. On that basis, it may be too soon for it to bag the prize. It could also give the committee an unwelcome headache: there are at least four people with a reasonable claim on the research, namely Emmanuel Charpentier, Jennifer Doudna, George Church and Fang Zheng. The Nobel rule of three would mean someone was left out, unless the prize was somehow split between medicine and chemistry: unlikely but not impossible. Each year, the analysts at Thomson Reuters mine the scientific literature for researchers who look worthy of the prize. They like the look of James Allison, Jeffrey Bluestone and Craig Thompson for their work on how T cells influence the immune response. Also in the running, they believe, are Gordon Freeman, Tasuku Honjo and Arlene Sharpe for work on programmed cell death, a process that has driven the latest hopes for cancer immunotherapies. Others on their radar are Michael Hall, David Sabatini and Stuart Schreiber for their work on the immune-suppressing drug, rapamycin. Will it be any of these? There are so many contenders, the likelihood is low. We shall find out soon, when the committee emerges. Last year, the medicine prize went to Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese scientist who discovered mechanisms for so-called autophagy, a fundamental process in cells that can be harnessed to fight cancer and dementia. It can be thought of as the body’s recycling system: it takes old components of cells, strips out the useful parts, and used them to generate energy or make new cells. It is crucial for keeping infections at bay, maintaining healthy metabolism and preventing cancerous growths. Juleen Zierath, a member of the Nobel committee, had this to say about the award: Every day we need to replace about 200 to 300g of protein in our bodies ... We are eating proteins every day, about 70g, but that’s not enough to take care of the requirement to make new proteins. Because of this machinery, we’re able to rely on some of our own proteins, maybe the damaged proteins or the long-lived proteins, and they are recycled with this sophisticated machinery so that we can sustain and we survive. I don’t know why we love the Nobels so much. It is easy to wonder whether Alfred Nobel, who built his fortune on weapons and explosives, wanted to be remembered for better things when he established the prizes to honour those whose research most benefited humanity. That has surely been the effect. The prizes paint an unrealistic picture of science. In Nobel world, singular geniuses or tiny teams crack baffling problems that in reality took tens, even hundreds of people, to solve. At times, the research is impenetrable. At times, key people are overlooked. But like The Great British Bake-Off, Strictly Come Dancing, and the Eurovision song contest, the Nobels belong to that weird breed of entertainment that refuses to be ignored. There are good reasons to enjoy the prizes, though. They shine a light on the hard graft of science and the tenacious and imaginative characters behind the endeavour. Thanks to the 2005 medicine prize, many more of us know how Barry Marshall drank a petri dish of Helicobacter pylori to prove that it was the bugs, not stress or spicy food, that caused most peptic ulcers. Most of the winners deserve to be honoured, but not all. In 2006, a public debate at the Royal Institution voted the Nobel prize-winning “ice pick lobotomy” the worst idea anyone ever had on the mind. Has it only been a year? The last time the Nobel Foundation dished out its gongs the UK hadn’t told Europe it was off, the Tories hadn’t blown their parliamentary majority, and the US President wasn’t warmongering on Twitter. How long ago it seems. But never mind the real world. This week is Nobel week, a time when secretive committees meet behind closed doors to decide who and what will be honoured with the most prestigious prizes on Earth. This year each full prize is worth 9m Swedish kronor or £823,000, although their real value is measured in kudos: a currency that allows you to work pretty much anywhere in the world. The season kicks off today at 10.30am UK time when the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm announces the winner or winners of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine. The physics prize is announced at 10.45am on Tuesday and the chemistry prize at the same time on Wednesday. Both will come from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Do join us for the live announcements, explanations of the work, and reaction from the winners and others in the world of science."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/02/can-even-moderate-drinking-increase-the-risk-of-cancer","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T07:10:24Z","webTitle":"Can even moderate drinking increase the risk of cancer?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/02/can-even-moderate-drinking-increase-the-risk-of-cancer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/02/can-even-moderate-drinking-increase-the-risk-of-cancer","fields":{"headline":"Can even moderate drinking increase the risk of cancer?","bodyText":"Alcohol may be a social lubricant but WHO and Public Health England say it can cause cancer. Last week the alcohol industry was accused of downplaying the link between alcohol and the increased risk of seven cancers: mouth, throat, oesophagus, liver, breast, rectum and colon. A research paper in Drug and Alcohol Review found that “responsible drinking” information funded by the alcohol industry tends to push the message that only heavy drinking increases the risk of these cancers. But the paper says the risk starts with low levels of drinking, even though the risk itself is low. So is the recommended number of alcohol units a week – 14 – too high? The solution Even less than 1.5 units a day – a small glass of wine – can increase the risk of mouth, throat, oesophagus and breast cancer (in women), according to a UK government committee. While the toll of heavy drinking on the liver and pancreas is well known, the link to cancers, especially breast and colorectal, is less so. There are more than 100 epidemiology studies showing an association between breast cancer and alcohol, the risk increasing with less than one daily glass of wine. Research at Harvard found that while light to moderate drinking was not significantly associated with an increased risk for men (unless they smoked), it did increase the risk of breast cancer for women. Edward L Giovannucci, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health and the lead author of the report, says that the increase in risk is modest. And there are some health benefits from occasional drinking that make the true risk to health harder to quantify. He points out other research that shows that one drink per day reduces the risk of diabetes for women. “So the overall effect on health for women might still be positive,” he says. “For colorectal cancer, the risk for men and women is low until you reach more than two drinks per day.” There are also individual genetic differences in metabolising alcohol that can increase the risk of cancer. Ethanol in alcoholic drinks is broken down into acetaldehyde, which is toxic to cells, damaging DNA and proteins. Some people have genetic variations that are less effective at getting rid of acetaldehyde, and they may have a higher risk of oesophageal cancer. Giovannucci says that overall he wouldn’t recommend drinking alcohol to improve your health. “But if one enjoys a glass or occasionally two a day as part of a healthy diet, and doesn’t smoke, I think the increased risk of cancer is small,” he says. “For those with a family history of colorectal or breast cancer, I’d suggest not drinking or not exceeding one glass per day.” • This article was amended on 3 October 2017.

A place where tramps may mix freely with millionaires, a place like no other – apart from streets, ports and all sorts of other places. It is no exaggeration to say that the railway may be Britain’s greatest gift to the world, the apotheosis of the industrial revolution. It has become part of our national psyche, a symbol of longing for a time when to be British meant standing in the corridors because there weren’t enough seats on the train. And there is no greater glory to our railway network than our stations. Here are 100 that I’ve happened to visit in the last year or so. Paddington Named after a bear that Isambard Kingdom Brunel adopted when he was attempting to extend the Great Western Railway to Lima, Paddington is a rare masterpiece. Although many will appreciate it mainly for its towering glass canopy and for the swift service at the Upper Crust on the forecourt, for the connoisseur its principal attraction has to be the gap between the platforms and the trains, which is wider than usual. At dusk, this allows shards of light to bounce off the wheels, creating a magic of its own. Victoria Poor Victoria, unloved by many now it is no longer a gateway to the exotic charms of the Channel ports. But while there is much to admire in the clockface that adorns the outer facade, perhaps its greatest pleasure is its departure board. There can be few better ways to while away an evening than watching the crowds gather below the hallowed board while every service on Southern Rail is listed as “delayed” or “cancelled”. Morden At first glance, there seems to be little going for this underground terminus of the Northern Line. But stride briskly through the ticketing area, past the thought for the day notice and down to the platform, and you will witness a miracle. Look to the roof and you will spy a single tile glazed in a variant of the dull cream that permeates so much of the Tube network. In the fourth volume of his seminal work Tiles of the London Underground: 1930-38, the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner speculates that this tile may be unique. I see no reason to doubt him. Bodmin Parkway This West Country jewel is a monument to the minimalist movement that the eminent railway historian Gordon Godron so evocatively describes in his 1973 masterpiece Bodmin Parkway Reimagined. This station, conveniently situated a six-mile walk from the local town, dispenses with the faux-gothic grandeur of so many aspirant halts and makes do with a simple stone structure and a couple of prefabricated cabins selling month-old copies of The People’s Friend. Wolferton Regrettably not in use since the East Anglian branch line to Sandringham was inexplicably closed in 1969 (“one of the greatest acts of 20th-century vandalism” according to local historian Charles Windsor), Wolferton is still worth a visit for its urinals alone, designed by the notable royal toilet specialist, William Ashbee. The surrounding walls are home to some interesting graffiti scrawled by Edward VII shortly after he was diagnosed with a prostate complaint. Liverpool Lime Street Although it languished in relative squalor for much of the 20th century, it has latterly undergone a revival as the only station to have barred Michael Portillo from making a film of one of his tedious railway journeys. The mauve pastel jacket, so eloquently described in the 1973 Man at C&amp;A catalogue, has become a blight on railway stations everywhere. The sooner it is eradicated the better. Glasgow Central Although Edinburgh is, to my mind, the finer city, Glasgow’s stations unquestionably have the edge. Central has a style that Richard Rogers once identified as a unique mixture of Scottish 17th-century and Italianate, with the merest hint of Swedish, though to me it looks more middle-to-late Romanesque. Perhaps more late than middle. Of particular note is the M&amp;S Simply Food, housed in a curved wooden-fronted building, from which the late Duke of Argyll – whose views on railway architecture can be found in his privately published memoir, My Views on Railway Architecture – used to buy his daily tuna and cucumber sandwich. Tidmouth The largest station on the Isle of Sodor, where railway enthusiasts are always guaranteed to be able to have a nice conversation with one of the many steam engines. In recent years, however, there have been unwelcome sightings of Ringo Starr who, along with station manager Mr F Controller, is unable to prevent himself from haranguing people about the benefits of Brexit.

While the government has offered a one-month reprieve, it is vital that any decision the government reaches in relation to funding of sleep-ins being paid at the national living wage takes full account of the reality that the sector has been operating for years within very contradictory guidance; and that there is no blame for providers. In these circumstances it must be right that the government should accept responsibility for meeting the substantial costs of backdating sleep-in costs up until the date of the announcement on 26 July. None of the additional funding announced for social care in 2017 has been allocated to meet the demand of retrospective liability.

Both qualified for the eight-player Candidates in Berlin in March 2018 which will decide who challenges for Magnus Carlsen’s world title later next year. Aronian stood better in four drawn classical games but was unable to convert against Ding’s stubborn defence. He switched to a more fluid attacking style in the fifth, a speed tie-break, provoked errors and broke through for a mating attack. Faced with a must-win sixth game, Ding mishandled a promising position and was overwhelmed by a swift counter. The problem for Aronian in Berlin will be his history of below-par results in previous Candidates, plus the presence of in-form opponents. Sergey Karjakin, who lost narrowly to Carlsen in 2016, has already qualified along with Aronian and Ding, while Fabiano Caruana and Wesley So of the US are virtually sure of the two rating spots. Their rival, Russia’s former champion Vlad Kramnik, collapsed in the early rounds of the current Isle of Man Open, where he lost in this week’s puzzle diagram to 65-year-old James Tarjan, who was an Olympiad gold medallist before Kramnik was born, then drew with the English IM Lawrence Trent, who shrewdly found an opening to chop off most of the pieces. Two Candidates places remain to be settled at the Grand Prix final in Palma de Mallorca in November, with France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and the Azeri Shak Mamedyarov the favourites. One place is an organiser’s wild card but there is no German with the required 2725 minimum rating. Meanwhile the Chess.com Isle of Man Open has its final two rounds this weekend (1.30 pm start on Saturday, midday on Sunday). Carlsen took a clear lead on 6/7 but several contenders including the England No1, Michael Adams, were within striking distance. India’s 12-year-old Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa is aiming to become the youngest ever grandmaster and has a chance of his first GM norm. As for Aronian, he will celebrate his latest victory by getting married on Saturday to his longtime fiancee Arianne Caoili. The Australian is a women’s international master, and she has been even more successful in her chosen career, learning Armenian and Russian and becoming a consultant editor of the leading newspaper in Erevan. Aronian’s nuance in game five was 12 Rae1!? and 13 Bb1!? in place of the usual Rfe1 and Bc2. Ding could have equalised by 14…Nc5!? 15 Qa3 Qc7 16 Nxd4 Rd8 17 Ngf5 Bf8 while instead of the risky 17…g5?! the unlikely 17…Ba5! 18 Re7 Bb4 19 Re2 Bg4 keeps the balance.

After all, that would be a completely preposterous scenario? A chain of events so outlandish and ludicrous that it could have no conceivable basis in reality? One so implausible that any media outlets reporting it first thing on Friday morning could be dismissed as purveyors of Fake News, eh? Oh. Those same City fans woke up to the weird news that only two sleeps before City’s biggest Premier League match of the season to date, their star goal-getter had in fact been knacked in a collision in the Dutch capital after attending a gig by the Colombian singer-songwriter Maluma, a smouldering Latin crooner who, despite occasional forays into reggaeton, would like it to be known he is not a reggaetonero, specifically, but also a purveyor of other genres including “ballads, mambo, merengue and underground stuff”. But The Fiver digresses: Sergio’s chances of mambaing his way through another Maluma gig, breaking Eric Brook’s Manchester City goalscoring record or indeed sneezing, laughing or even breathing without yelping in extreme pain any time soon have been put on hold. “The taxi driver did not see the curve and skid,” Agüero was quoted as telling Argentinian radio. “And when he skidded, we hit him with the pole. I broke my rib, now I’m resting. It hurts me badly. I’ll be discharged in a little while.” The news has prompted thousands of unqualified doctors to speculate on the length of Agüero’s absence via an array of social media aberrations (“the number of days he will be out, I don’t know,” sighed Pep Guardiola), but what it does mean is that the late Brook’s record will remain intact a little while longer. Which, in a weird way, seems almost fair as his goalscoring exploits were curtailed prematurely by both the outbreak of the second world war and a fractured skull. Since news broke of Agüero’s accident, the kind of people who describe gigs as “pop concerts” have been wondering what on earth a professional athlete was doing at such a soiree so soon before a big game, when he should have been spending his evening off at home with his feet up relaxing. Pity them, for they know not that the rhythm is gonna get you. And, as another Latin crooner Gloria Estefan once sagely pointed out, when it does there’s no way you can fight it every day.

The new gallery will occupy half of the Horniman’s existing building in Forest Hill and cost £4.6m. As well as a receiving a £3.3m Heritage Lottery Fund grant, the museum has also launched a crowdfunding campaign, calling on its visitors to help it raise an extra £30,000 towards the project.

Robert Storrie, keeper of anthropology at the Horniman, said: “The displays will show how things connect people – practically and emotionally – as well as giving each of us a glimpse into other ways of understanding our world.” Founded in 1901 by tea trader and philanthropist Frederick John Horniman, the museum has a collection of 350,000 objects, specimens and artefacts.

Not only is their profession increasingly brutal but the laws of the jungle have altered, banning the tackler’s old freedom to get up and cause legitimate mischief on the opposition’s side of the breakdown. It is not intended to make life easier for defenders, let alone up-and-coming English ball poachers like Sam Underhill. So why did Underhill, with a solitary cap behind him, appear so unconcerned this week at England’s training camp in Oxford? Perhaps for the best of reasons: he is good and clever enough to adjust instantly to whatever lawmakers and referees decree. The grapevine has been suggesting for two or three years that England have a natural-born predator at No7 who could become as crucial to his country as Richie McCaw was to New Zealand. This is no ordinary 21-year-old tip-toeing his way into the Premiership. That much was clear in Bath’s game against Northampton a fortnight ago, the forceful Underhill’s first for his new club since transferring back across the Welsh border from the Ospreys. “I think he made 25 tackles and had about 12 carries … and that was his first game out of the blocks,” says his director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, himself a former All Blacks back-row and captain. So, leaving aside the obvious unfairness of the comparison, does Blackadder believe English rugby has taken delivery of the new McCaw? If anyone should be sensitive to youngsters being weighed down by impossible expectations it is Blackadder, but before Sunday’s game at Wasps he has also detected something special. “If he plays consistently, the way he played that first game, then there is no reason why he can’t be of that ilk,” he says. “Richie’s core skill was mental toughness. I’ve not seen anyone who had the cardio-capacity he had. He would just go all day. You saw a lot of those traits in Sam. He doesn’t stop, he just fires into everything.” No wonder Eddie Jones is a fan. Newish England squad players have mostly been wrapped in media cotton wool and placed off-limits until they can be trusted not to say anything too interesting in public. Underhill, who has just switched to the University of Bath after two years studying for a degree in economics in Cardiff – “I don’t like maths very much, which is a terrible thing to realise halfway through an economics degree” – is refreshingly different. This newcomer is bright, focused and mature enough not to need nannying. From a back-row perspective he also offers a viable alternative to the bigger six-cum-sevens who have been in vogue. “A lot of sevens here are big sixes whereas he is an out-and-out openside which could be his point of difference,” says Blackadder. “He needs to continue to be strong and physical over the ball. Law adaptations? They do suit him. Look at how Richie adapted and kept adapting to law changes, half of which were supposedly designed to keep him out of the game. Great players adapt to circumstances. As a flanker you’ve got to be able to read the cues and clues at every breakdown.” That requires brains as much as brawn, which suits Underhill. He comes from an interesting family – his father, a group captain in the RAF, was awarded an OBE last year and one of his three older sisters is engaged to the grandson of the former prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home. His own plan is to pursue a degree in politics with economics, keeping his fingers crossed he will not have to repeat all the modules he passed in Cardiff. After an unfulfilling spell at Gloucester’s academy it was his decision to study in Wales, which temporarily delayed his ascent because of England’s policy of picking only home-based players; now he is free to advance on and off the field. “By having a degree I can open more windows for myself. That will probably facilitate me doing something after rugby that wouldn’t be attainable if I didn’t have a degree.” Sidestepping the excesses of freshers’ week, as he intends to do, will also not faze a powerful athlete who was not entirely sold on rugby as a teenager until he found that competing hard around the tackle area suited him perfectly. “Some guys are really quick. I was never one of those guys. Some guys are naturally really good with the ball. I probably wasn’t one of those guys either. “Justin Tipuric at Ospreys is one of the best open-sides in the world, one of the most skilful guys out there. As much as I’d like to be like that I’m never going to be that player. I can’t catch and pass. I like tackling, it is as simple as that.” Modest, talented, ambitious, focused: Underhill’s Test career is still in its infancy but he already looks born to it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/01/star-trek-discovery-deuce-child-in-time-benedict-cumberbatch-david-simon-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Star Trek: Discovery; The Deuce; The Child in Time and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/01/star-trek-discovery-deuce-child-in-time-benedict-cumberbatch-david-simon-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/01/star-trek-discovery-deuce-child-in-time-benedict-cumberbatch-david-simon-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in TV: Star Trek: Discovery; The Deuce; The Child in Time and more","bodyText":"Star Trek: Discovery (Netflix) The Deuce (Sky Atlantic) The Child in Time (BBC1) | iPlayer Front Row (BBC2) | iPlayer Billion Dollar Deals and How They Changed Your World (BBC2) | iPlayer The Vietnam War (BBC4) | iPlayer Netflix continues its coquettish bid to, if not exactly inherit the TV world, then just buy it instead. Its finance chief spoke recently of the chances, soon, of making a series costing $20m an hour: HBO is already looking at $15m an episode for the forthcoming endgames in Game of Thrones. This time, though, it’s not the tawdry cash stuff that excites me about Netflix: in a joyous first, surely indicative of overpaid staff who might want to get out and splaff their money in cocktail bars more often, it is now offering subtitles in Klingon. Thus it falls to me to inform you, whether you like it or not, that “ghoSll’ chaH!” was the thing belched, by an angry Klingon, at the very start of the latest Trekkie incarnation, Star Trek: Discovery. It translates as “they are coming.” And, indeed, coming they were, although in peace, which for some reason tends to make Klingons very warlike: a new batch of humans, Vulcans, and also a new thing, a Kelpian, seemingly an inscrutably bright, kind but timorous cross between (somehow) Spock and the twerpish Dobby from Harry Potter, who’s now set to become the go-to poster Kelpian for the snowflake generation. It’s all rather good, though. Set a decade before the events of the original series, it stars Sonequa Martin-Green and a stylish handful of expendables – the word is that, having taken a lesson from Thrones, the showrunners are newly unafraid to kill off some big names early. And it is filmed on what looked suspiciously like actual Mars, which must have eaten into the budget like nobody’s business. Quite importantly, it continues Gene Roddenberry’s yearning 60s vision of a more equal world for all: the Klingons are, if not exactly misunderstood wallflowers, at least given a hefty backstory, and there are handsome chunks of screen time vouchsafed – gasp – to nonwhite people and to women. Not to mention Kelpians. (As opposed to the Star Wars franchise, which simply continues George Lucas’s yearning 70s vision of making a lot of money.) Also making some money back in the America of the 70s were the pimps, chancers, bagmen, scoundrels and whores who were in on the floor of the porn industry: 42nd Street, New York, also known as The Deuce. This is their story, and thrillingly, viscerally, it is told. It is not a handsome tale. It is a filthy and a spattered one, and funky in exactly the wrong, as in rancid-smelling, sense. David Simon, creator of The Wire, and his longtime collaborator George Pelecanos look to succeed in precisely the milieu where the entirely unlamented Vinyl failed so dismally. “I want to be able to be read by the guy cooking in the kitchen, with my paperback in his back pocket. I don’t write for the critics,” Pelecanos told the Observer (told, in fact, me) many years ago: that sentiment, Pelecanos’s love for the streets, for flawed human greed, blooms here. New York in 1971, its smokes and browns and jets of dirty golden bourbon and sweaty do-rags, and new moral ambiguities, is lovingly recreated – somehow even the twin towers, in one half-second shot, seem to have been got up and running again – and I mean only the highest praise when I say that parts of the visual palette are most reminiscent, in their squeam, of a used condom filled with old coffee grounds. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who takes a producer credit, excels as hooker Candy: it’s a brave, warty performance. James Franco plays twin brothers, for some unexplained reason: surely America has too few actors in the same way it has too few lawyers. But he plays the more sympathetic sibling, Vinnie, intriguingly, with all Pelecanos’s hallmarks of a good man fated to go accidentally bad: this is a winner, and Scorsese and Jagger should rightly cringe for what Vinyl could have been. The Child in Time was scrupulously well acted, but woefully unsatisfying. Benedict Cumberbatch and Kelly Macdonald, as the devastated parents of a missing child – snatched, somehow vanished, in broad daylight – could hardly have been out-nuanced in their very separate ways, neither over the top nor anything less than haunted. But great gobbets of Ian McEwan’s clever novel didn’t make it into this adaptation or, far worse, were shoehorned in with zilch context, relevance or hinterland: the time-travel nuclear physicist stuff, the politician’s breakdown stuff, the whole Thatcherite backdrop. That the BBC chose neither to spread this over three or six weeks, or simply concentrate on the child loss and eventual near-salvaging of sanity, left me ultimately head-scratching, waiting for the other shoe to drop (or the next episode) and, actually, mildly vexed at its lack of ambition. Similarly with Front Row, which began on television last Saturday. I always struggle to find any adjectives for Giles Coren other than “amiable” and “professional”, though perhaps I should struggle a little more. But the opener, a doppelgänger of the smart nightly R4 beast, which, heavens be thanked, remains inviolate, was quite horrid in its lack of ambition. A so-so Gilbert and George thing, a Harry Potter “discussion”, in which the ever wise Nihal Arthanayake was given criminally little airtime… at the moment it’s the Boden catalogue of arts shows, the National Trust of arts shows. The Dido of arts shows, in which it’s safer to play that CD than risk anyone squeaking or covering their ears or throwing up. When might the BBC ever have the cojones to present an arts show that might challenge us to a) watch something difficult, possibly four times out of 10, immensely rewarding, or b) just bloody switch channels? The confidence shown, say, in two phenomenally promising new series from that apparently increasingly dysfunctional corporation. Billion Dollar Deals, from the impressive Jacques Peretti, had the power to make one genuinely, spittingly angry. His revelation of how Pfizer carved up the antidepressants market (with its own patented GPs’ questionnaire, which set the bar gigglingly low) … the disaster of the 1980 psychiatrists’ paper, which introduced more than 200 “nameable” – and thus, crucially, treatable, with manufactured pills – mental illnesses. Basically, how billionaires have profited, in billions, from giving pretty sweeties to treat mental health. And, of course, the forensic Vietnam War, Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s quite startlingly even-handed second treatment of history, more of which very soon. No whizzy graphics, a few talking heads, chilling insights and, as with Peretti’s, a tale of disaster, simply told. How can the BBC have the foresight to buy this, an unashamedly cerebral, ungimmicky, Big Number from PBS, and, as with Peretti, get so much so perfectly right, yet get so much else hamfistedly, timorously, wrong?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/29/austin-end-youth-curfew-racial-bias","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T13:19:54Z","webTitle":"Austin votes to end its youth curfew amid racial bias concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/29/austin-end-youth-curfew-racial-bias","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/29/austin-end-youth-curfew-racial-bias","fields":{"headline":"Austin votes to end its youth curfew amid racial bias concerns","bodyText":"Austin’s council has voted to end the city’s youth curfew amid concerns that it targets racial minorities and adds to the so-called school-to-prison pipeline. Despite backing the law earlier this year, Brian Manley, police chief in the liberal Texas city, changed his mind after reviewing data. “My recommendation is to not move forward with the curfew at this point,” Manley told the city council early on Friday. Manley said that in 14 stops by police of young people in the past three months that involved a curfew infraction, the curfew was not the reason for the initial interaction. “The ordinance did not have any impact on our ability to handle those instances,” he said. The council also heard from several students who argued the curfew needlessly criminalised young people and unfairly affected minorities, and voted not to renew it when it expires on 1 October. Austin’s curfew was introduced in 1990 in an attempt to reduce the juvenile crime rate. It applied both at night and during school days. In June, the council ended the daytime restriction but extended the nighttime curfew until October, with a new “three-strikes” citation policy. It banned under-17s from being outside from 11pm to 6am, with some exceptions – such as being accompanied by a parent or being in front of their house. Violators faced being charged with a misdemeanour and receiving a $500 fine. Austin police issued 529 daytime violations and 157 nighttime violations in 2016, mostly to 15- or 16-year-olds in some of the least affluent parts of the city, according to a report. It found that black and Hispanic youths were cited disproportionately: black people comprised 17% of nighttime and 15% of daytime violations but made up only 8% of the population. Long a part of American life, curfews came back into fashion in the 90s when then president Bill Clinton advocated for them as part of his tough-on-crime stance. “These are just like the old-fashioned rules most of us had when we were kids – ‘When the lights come on, be home, Bill,’” he said in a 1996 speech. Since the mid-90s, millions of teenagers have been arrested for violating curfews. Austin, the US’s 11th-biggest city, will be the largest without a juvenile curfew after New York City (which has an age restriction that applies only to drivers: junior learner permit holders are not allowed to drive between 9pm and 5am). Curfew supporters argue they help reduce the numbers of young people committing crimes and becoming victims, and point to falling crime rates. Critics counter that declining rates are part of a wider trend and cite studies indicating that curfews are not effective. There are also concerns that criminalising young people sets them up for problems in later life, such as difficulties finding a job. Truancy was a criminal offence in Texas that saw more than 100,000 students cited annually until the state revised its law on unauthorised absences in 2015. “Kids who are breaking curfew aren’t necessarily doing anything else wrong. Having them be put in the back of a police car and detained, or just the interaction with law enforcement, can change the way they think about themselves or the trajectory they think they’re on,” said Jennifer Doleac, an assistant professor of public policy and economics at the University of Virginia. Doleac co-wrote a paper which found that Washington’s juvenile curfew caused an increase in gunfire, probably because deserted streets are less safe than busy ones and enforcing curfews may distract police from other tasks. “As we try to find ways to improve the relationship between communities of colour and law enforcement this is exactly the kind of policy that people worry about,” she said. “I think most of them are based on this gut feeling that most people have that there’s no reason for people to be out that late. But sometimes there are good reasons … I hope that more cities follow Austin’s lead.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/08/true-stories-and-other-essays-francis-spufford","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T09:00:46Z","webTitle":"True Stories & Other Essays by Francis Spufford – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/08/true-stories-and-other-essays-francis-spufford","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/08/true-stories-and-other-essays-francis-spufford","fields":{"headline":"True Stories & Other Essays by Francis Spufford – review","bodyText":"In his 2010 book, Red Plenty – stories set in Soviet Russia – Francis Spufford crossed the border between fact and fiction, fusing history and imagination to compelling effect.

That’s Larry Lamb the actor (Archie Mitchell in EastEnders, Mick Shipman in Gavin &amp; Stacey) not Larry Lamb the dead newspaper editor and page 3 pioneer. And George Lamb his son, also on TV and the radio, not George Lamb the even deader (in 1834) politician and writer. Larry and George have been on holiday together for television before, to Namibia to stay with a tribe. This one, less thrillingly, is Britain By Bike With Larry &amp; George Lamb (Channel 5). But still, Larry’s got an electric bike – that might liven things up a bit, and make life a bit easier for him on the steep inclines of the Yorkshire Dales, which is where they are in the first episode. He is nearly 70 after all. They do have a slight Yorkshire connection. Larry met George’s mum in Yorkshire, he tells his son on the train up. Perhaps that will lead to some interesting Freudian father-and-son self-analysis that will continue throughout the series; difficult memories dragged out, repressed emotions released, an Oedipus complex perhaps … “That’s nuts,” says George. Not that kind of show then. More like a bit of gentle family banter, often about George not having any power assistance on his bicycle. It’s a couple of minor celebs touring around, trying stuff out, that’s what kind of show it is. “Look at that,” they say every time there’s a view (which, in the Dales, is often). They have a go at working with a sheepdog. They make pork pies in Skipton, go to a sheepdog auction and try their hand at fly-fishing. George does a bit of the Tour de France route at Buttertubs Pass, and has a go at rock climbing at Malham Cove. Larry takes in the Ribblehead viaduct, and meets up with his old pal Duncan Preston off Emmerdale. Then they all end up at the pub for beer and cheer, and to watch ferrets racing along tubes. They love Yorkshire; George says he feels blessed to have been. Which is lovely for Larry and George, but for the rest of us? It’s possible the other Larry and George Lamb would have been more interesting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/29/tourist-ghost-towns-people-flee-bali-volcano-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T13:29:56Z","webTitle":"Tourist hotspots turn to ghost towns as people flee Bali volcano threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/29/tourist-ghost-towns-people-flee-bali-volcano-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/29/tourist-ghost-towns-people-flee-bali-volcano-threat","fields":{"headline":"Tourist hotspots turn to ghost towns as people flee Bali volcano threat","bodyText":"Tourist hotspots on the Indonesian holiday island of Bali have turned to virtual ghost towns as residents and visitors clear out en masse in response to the looming threat of Mount Agung erupting. In Tulamben, a small fishing village on Bali’s east coast within the officially designated 7.5-mile (12km) danger zone, all hotels have shut down and there was not a single tourist in sight on Friday. A message on a blackboard outside an empty cafe said “pray for us”. Bali has been on edge since last week, when the threat level from the volcano was raised to maximum and hundreds of volcanic earthquakes began to rattle the area on a daily basis. “Tulamben is empty now,” said Made Pasaka, a dive instructor, squinting as he looked up at Bali’s highest peak. “The last time there was an eruption they said it lasted one year and we can’t imagine that. If it is the same again what are we going to do? We need to have a plan B.” About 20 minutes down the road in Amed, more than 180 hotels have emptied of tourists. “Everything is cancelled … some people are saying maybe, but then when it comes to the day they cancel, so there are no people,” said Sarah Laight, a British hotel investor. In the past week several governments, including in the UK, Australia and Singapore have issued travel advisories, cautioning travellers that volcanic activity could interfere with their plans. In the event of an eruption and the possible closure of Ngurah Rai airport due to resulting ash, the authorities in Bali have prepared for flights to be diverted to 10 airports across Indonesia. Laight estimated there were about 20 tourists left in Amed, a situation that would have a huge impact on the local economy if it went on much longer. For now, some in Amed are less worried about the volcano than they are about the bule (foreigners) leaving. “The people from the whole of the Amed area that work in tourism, which is thousands of people, probably from today forward they don’t have a paycheck,” Laight said. While Bali’s busiest areas appear normal, Laight, whose hotel opened 14 years ago, was worried about the impact of sudden mass unemployment. “If some of these people get overwhelmed with the debt and the banks, I don’t know what the banks will do for them, if they will hold the interest, or the payments,” she said. “Probably everyone has a loan for a motorbike, all the drivers have car loans, and then they are going to start getting stressed.” At a community meeting in Amed on Friday people discussed a “what if” scenario – the stockpiles of water, food, masks, medical and generators that might be needed in the event of an eruption. There are more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which perilously straddles the “ring of fire” – an area along the basin of the Pacific Ocean prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity. Volcanologists say the current seismological levels – the hundreds of internal earthquakes occurring inside Agung each day – are unprecedented since Agung’s activity being measured post-1963. The quakes, along with a new fracture in the crater that is emitting steam, indicate rising levels of magmatic energy. From the volcanology monitoring post in the village of Rendang, the seismologist Devy Kamil Syahbana said the smoky vapour was likely to be groundwater heated by plates of magma nearing Agung’s surface. The volcanology post takes continuous readings from an analogue seismograph, the needle of which twitches back and forth with every quake, as well as a digital equivalent, every six hours. Data is also drawn from satellite images and tiltmeters. Based on geological modelling, Syahbana explained, seismologists point to the possibility of Mount Agung erupting at VEI3, or a volcanic explosivity index of three, with an opening eruption height of more than six miles (10km). That, he said, pointing to a model drawn on his whiteboard, would create a column that would then rain down dangerous pyroclastic flows. It was also possible that Agung would not erupt but, at this point, the readings show the probability of an eruption was higher than not, Syahbana said. At the Rendang post, overlooking green ricefields and jungle leading to Agung’s cloud-covered peak, the men of the village were nervous but still managed a joke. “The ones who can still run are here,” said 42-year-old Nyoman Karyiarsa. Summing up the mood, he said everyone in the village had a full tank of petrol in their bikes – just in case. Rendang, on the border of the danger zone, is technically safe but many women and children have left. In the past week the number of refugees camped out in halls, temples and in the homes of family and friends swelled to more than 136,000. Many sleep at the camps at night and in the morning head to their homes, checking on their livestock and other belongings. Meanwhile, priests ride their motorbikes to the island’s “mother temple” of Besakih, on the slopes of Agung, attempting to calm the rumbling mountain through prayer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/universal-credit-mean-faulty-scheme-block-rollout-southwark-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T11:33:52Z","webTitle":"Universal credit is a mean, flawed scheme.

Its rollout must be blocked","bodyText":"“I’m going to have to quit work,” is what one single mum told me in my weekly advice surgery. She was a DWP “poster woman” for its apprenticeship programme – earning while training part-time to fit it around the care needs of her children. She was OK until universal credit was extended locally to cover some parents. My constituency of Southwark is a “full service area” and has been piloting universal credit before it is rolled out to other areas of the country in October. Her childcare costs should be covered within universal credit, but an IT glitch means her online “journal” cannot capture childcare adequately, leading to months of confusion, delays and missed payments. She relied on help from her family initially, but has fallen into debt and is at the end of her tether. This is not an isolated case. My constituent is far from alone in losing out under universal credit. Research by UK charity Gingerbread shows that single parents are being deliberately made worse off under universal credit. Working single parents will lose £800 a year on average by 2020 – and some will be £2,000 worse off. This sneaky, devious cut was one of George Osborne’s last acts before he was turfed out of government. Southwark’s trialling of universal credit has been fraught with problems. Almost weekly, I have seen the direct effect of the scheme’s inbuilt delays. From asking for help to getting any takes at least six weeks, but the average has consistently been higher – and many people wait up to 12 weeks. This pushes many into foodbank use, debt, rent arrears and even evictions. It is also unnecessary, as advanced payment agreements could be made to help people with learning disabilities, previous money troubles or at risk of homelessness, which cut the delays considerably. DWP has, to date, refused to advertise or use them properly. This DWP failure has a clear effect. The Leathermarket JMB is a resident-managed housing organisation in Southwark. It is well run and, until recently, the average tenant’s rent account was about £70 in credit. The 137 tenants on universal credit, however, now are an average of £648 in arrears. If universal credit is rolled out without tackling inbuilt delays it would leave councils, housing associations and other landlords with crippling deficits, and eviction costs, to boot. Pecan, Southwark’s main foodbank provider, estimates that benefit delays have caused a tripling of the number of children reliant on its help since universal credit was extended locally to cover parents. One single father recently broke down as he told me he couldn’t afford soap or sanitary products for his daughter. Theresa May promised a different focus for her government; universal credit is her biggest test yet. Failing to act now by delaying the rollout until it can be implemented effectively will inflict Southwark’s horrific experience on thousands more families across Britain. • Neil Coyle is Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/29/its-gods-own-county-but-its-not-heaven-life-in-uks-happiest-district","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T15:23:04Z","webTitle":"'It's God's own county but it's not heaven': life in UK's happiest district","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/29/its-gods-own-county-but-its-not-heaven-life-in-uks-happiest-district","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/29/its-gods-own-county-but-its-not-heaven-life-in-uks-happiest-district","fields":{"headline":"'It's God's own county but it's not heaven': life in UK's happiest district","bodyText":"“It’s not that I don’t get unhappy,” says Sarah Brook, landlady of the Albion pub in the market town of Skipton. “It’s just that when you look at the grand scheme of things and see how your life is compared to other people’s, there’s more to be grateful for than to feel bad about.” Her sunny outlook is typical of people living in the North Yorkshire district of Craven, according to the Office for National Statistics. Its annual study of the nation’s wellbeing found that residents of the area – which encompasses much of the southern Yorkshire Dales national park – were the happiest in the country, scoring 8.3 out of 10, compared with a national average of 7.5. The most miserable place in the UK was found to be Hertsmere in Hertfordshire, scoring 6.87. Sitting in the corner of the Victorian pub with his friend Alan Capstick is 69-year-old Michael Demain, a retired metallurgical chemist who has lived in Craven all his life. “I don’t know whether we consider ourselves to be happier than anywhere else really, but it’s a nice place and we are happy. We might just be simple, I don’t know,” he jokes, nursing the second pint of the afternoon. “Well, it’s not because the bloody sun shines, is it?” says Brook. The ONS asked about 150,000 people over the age of 16 four questions: How satisfied are you with your life nowadays? To what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile? How happy did you feel yesterday? How anxious did you feel yesterday? People were asked to respond on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 was “not at all” and 10 was “completely”. Brook says she would have responded 10 to the first three and zero to the last one. “I wouldn’t do what I do if I didn’t think it was worthwhile,” she says. This not the first time the area has been singled out for its high quality of life. In 2008 the high street in Skipton – Craven’s biggest town – beat Portobello Road in London to be named the best high street in the UK. In 2014 The Sunday Times named Skipton the best place to live in Britain. And in 2016 the National Campaign for Courtesy named the town the country’s politest place. Simon Myers, a Craven district councillor and self-described “member for good news”, partly ascribes the area’s happiness levels to its resilient communities, citing the endless list of community groups and events. “People don’t expect other people to entertain them here,” he says, sitting in the Bean Loved cafe in Skipton. “They tend to get together and do their own thing.” Another factor is Craven’s setting in a thousand square miles of moors and valleys. “I wonder what impact the landscape has on us?” says Myers. “I mean, there’s a great difference between living surrounded by all this massive, grand openness, and living in Hampshire with little farms and hedges and no trespassing signs.” In January, the ONS found that North Yorkshire had the lowest crime rate in the country. Council spokeswoman Jenny Cornish says this might be explained by the “broken window theory” – the idea that maintaining order within communities prevents serious crime. “If you live in a nice place, you don’t want to wreck it,” she says. But, as Myers points out, “it’s God’s own county, but it’s not heaven”. While Craven has comparatively low rates of unemployment, it’s a low-wage economy, with prohibitively high house prices and some rural isolation and poverty. Some of Craven’s biggest employers are the Skipton building society, bandage manufacturer Systagenix and financial firm Computershare, but many of the region’s jobs are provided by small and medium-sized businesses. Craven needs better paid jobs so young people aren’t pulled away to big cities, says Myers, who points to plans for a new business park on the outskirts of Skipton. “It isn’t just picture postcard, this part of the world,” he says. “It’s a working place.” Donna Vero, the manager of the Sweet Emporium, down the road from Bean Loved, is busy decorating the shop for Halloween. She loves what she does, she loves Craven and she says her three children – aged 19, 21 and 23 – want to stay in the area. “It is hard for them to leave home because of the cost of buying houses, but they do love it here,” she says. “My son loves it because he’s into biking, so he goes up onto the moors a lot ... My daughter is travelling the world at the moment, but she’s going to come back and be a primary school teacher in the Skipton area.” Vero says she earns only enough to get by, but that it doesn’t stop her being happy with her lot. “People in Craven aren’t rich,” says Myers. “They’re not poor – though we do have our problems with rural poverty – but it’s not somewhere like Harrogate. You can understand why Harrogate wins these things because it’s a rich place ... But it’s rather nice that we seem to be regarded as very happy even though we’re not loaded.” So what do people need to be happy? “You need to feel that you belong somewhere and that you’re contributing,” says Myers. “There’s great satisfaction in that and we need more of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/29/england-v-west-indies-fifth-and-final-one-day-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T18:57:00Z","webTitle":"England beat West Indies by nine wickets: fifth and final ODI – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/29/england-v-west-indies-fifth-and-final-one-day-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/29/england-v-west-indies-fifth-and-final-one-day-international-live","fields":{"headline":"England beat West Indies by nine wickets: fifth and final ODI – as it happened","bodyText":"And here’s Vic Marks’s match report: That’s a very happy end to a largely excellent summer for England. Jonny Bairstow played another superb innings, battering 141 not out from 117 balls, and it was clear as early as the second or third over that England were going to win this match with ease. “Thanks to you and all your colleagues for this season’s OBOs,” says Brian Withington. “Have helped make a summer otherwise stuck indoors fly by - hope to be kept awake by you this winter (in a manner of speaking).” Thanks Brian. And thanks to all of you who have read or emailed during a really enjoyable summer. See you for the Ashes! 38 overs: England 288-1 (Bairstow 141, Root 46) Root completes the most emphatic victory, with 72 balls and nine wickets to spare, by carting Marlon Samuels down the ground for six! 37th over: England 281-1 (Bairstow 135, Root 39) Bairstow hammers Nurse through mid-off for four. He can be brutal when the mood takes, and it has certainly taken him in the last half an hour or so. A second boundary, blasted through extra cover, makes this the highest ODI score by an England batsman against West Indies. “What’s the DLS score?” says Dave Voss. “Are England up with the rate?” 36th over: England 269-1 (Bairstow 124, Root 38) Bairstow flips Cummins through midwicket for his 13th four, and then crashes another through extra cover. He has dominated this partnership, wirh Root happy to stay in unobtrusive mode. “Maybe Root should bat at No11,” says Simon McMahon, “so that when England are 75-9 and the Aussies see Root walking out to the middle, they flip themselves and bowl filth, allowing Root and Anderson to add 150 for the last wicket and gain the psychological upper hand. Gotta think outside the box in Oz.” 35th over: England 255-1 (Bairstow 113, Root 37) England are hurrying to victory. Bairstow pulls four more round the corner, this time off Taylor. 34th over: England 249-1 (Bairstow 108, Root 36) Four more to Bairstow, muscled over midwicket off Cummins. In the Tests he had a slightly disappointing summer for a player of his ability, with no hundreds and an average of 32, but it’s been a breakthrough year in ODIs. He has become an extremely good all-weather player. 33rd over: England 241-1 (Bairstow 101, Root 35) After an interminable drinks break, Jonny Bairstow rushes to his second ODI century in fine style. He hit the first two balls from Jerome Taylor for four to move to 99 and then steered a single to reach his hundred. He’s such a likeable, impressive bloke and it’s lovely to see him make such an impact in the ODI team. The second of those boundaries was possibly the shot of the innings, a beautifully timed back-foot drive through extra cover that teased two fielders and seemed to pick up pace as it approached the boundary. “Aside from his keeping, which was outstanding, Knotty played really good shots which few others attempted at the time since they didn’t see the possibilities like he did,” says John Starbuck. “As he was a fairly short bloke (as many good keepers are), he wasn’t afraid to get down low for floor-level sweeps. The reverse sweep would have suited him down to the ground.” It does sound like he was decades ahead of his time, with bat and gloves. Selve always writes beautifully about him, particularly in reference to the 1976-77 tour of India. 32nd over: England 228-1 (Bairstow 91, Root 32) A long, long summer is ending quietly, on the field at least. The main point of interest is whether Bairstow can end the series as he started it, with a century. He crunches a yorker from Cummins down the ground for a single to move within nine of his hundred. 31st over: England 226-1 (Bairstow 90, Root 31) Bairstow steers a cut shot for four off Taylor, lifts another over the top for four more. He averages 105 in ODIs this summer: 72*, 51, 43, 100*, 9*, 13, 39 and 90*. In other news, I think I’ve missed an over somewhere. So sue me! “Who cares about the Ashes anyway?” sniffs Simon McMahon. “Frankly, it’s all about the 2019 World Cup.. And there’s got to be a World T20 in 2020, right? Even the ICC wouldn’t miss that opportunity.” Yeah, have a nice life, “Ashes”. I never liked you anyway. 29th over: England 214-1 (Bairstow 79, Root 30) “Darren Stevens!” says Scott Richmond. “Yes he 41, yes he is uncapped, but this is a very beatable Australian team who do crumble under pressure. Stevens would show that toil in the county circuit pays off no matter what the age; that form and results are more important than track record; and he’d bring a great storyline to the tour which would be great for English cricket. Simply put: Stokes bad, Stevens good.” I would love it if you were right, love it. And I agree that England would benefit enormously from a David Steele figure; I just don’t think there is one. 28th over: England 205-1 (Bairstow 75, Root 25) Root pulls Joseph smoothly for his first boundary, taking England past 200 in the process. They are administering one helluva beating here. 27th over: England 195-1 (Bairstow 72, Root 17) “Evening Rob,” says Harkarn Sumal. “We had the immense good fortune to be at Lord’s for the Women’s World Cup final back in July. What a nerve-shredding, heart-stopping, brain-frazzling day that was. Surely the zenith of this summer’s cricket. In amongst all the awful lows (the first ninety overs) and the searing highs (the last ten), the highlight for our gaggle in the Edrich Upper was the sensational stumping that Sarah Taylor clearly made when an Indian batter lifted her foot for a nanosecond, in respect of which the third umpire deigned to give the batter the benefit of the doubt for some inexplicable reason. Having been to international cricket regularly for over a decade and having watched on telly since the mid-eighties, it was for me the single finest bit of standing-up ‘keeping I’ve ever seen. It was pure silken magic.” I know it can be crass to compare women’s and men’s sport, but every time I see Sarah Taylor I realise why the generation before mine still talk in hushed tones about Alan Knott. She has an otherworldly genius. 26th over: England 189-1 (Bairstow 71, Root 13) Rovman Powell comes into the attack and is milked for six no-risk runs. England need 100 from 24 overs, and the players on both sides know this game is over. The only question now is whether we’ll be home in time for the new series of The Last Leg. 25th over: England 183-1 (Bairstow 67, Root 11) “No3 isn’t difficult,” says Jon Millard. “All a decent No3 needs is the mental agility to rapidly assess the situation and determine which of his two natural games, the nuggety opener or Gower-esque stroke player is called for. And, I suppose, the ability to pull the requisite game out of the hat. Oh, and the nous to spot early the situation changing and switch to the other one effortlessly. Or, of course, improvise if that’s what’s really needed. Frankly, if we can’t find someone who can do this shortly after a long day in the field, or in the last four overs before close, we’re looking in the wrong place.” 24th over: England 181-1 (Bairstow 66, Root 10) A slower leg-break from Cummins slips down the leg side and turns past the keeper Hope for five wides. Root then survives an extremely good LBW appeal when he whips across the line. West Indies have already used their review. No matter, because Ultra-Edge shows a very slight inside edge that was superbly spotted by Simon Fry. That really was brilliant umpiring. “You and the other OBO writers should heed the Stokes Lesson,” says John Starbuck. “Get all your nights out done before the Ashes and the seat-wrenching midnight blogs. You might not feel much inclined to do it at the end of the series so make merry while you can.” The Guardian selectors haven’t picked the squad yet but I’ll heed the lesson, just in case. Hic! 23rd over: England 170-1 (Bairstow 63, Root 9) Bairstow and Root are two Yorkshire folk who are very happy to get ‘em in singles. They run quite brilliantly together and have already scampered 14 runs from 10 balls in this partnership. “Hi Rob,” says Derek Fordham. “That video must be a fake. Too much about it is odd. He just drops the ball afterwards? They are practicing with a new ball? He doesn’t go all ‘arry Redknapp on the guy who has nearly killed them (“...that’s why he’s in the effing reserves”). Then they just wander off? Nah.” 22nd over: England 162-1 (Bairstow 60, Root 4) Joe Root, very happy to bat No3 in the ODI team, gets off the mark by pulling his first ball for a couple. “That Alastair Cook clip is remarkable,” says Matt Dony. “He really does bring ‘unflappable’ to wild new levels ‘nonchalant’. He is chalant embodied, and has never been flapped.” Jason Roy falls four short of a century, trapped plumb in front by the new bowler Cummins. Roy got in a bit of a tangle and played a strange shot down the wrong line. It’s a shame he missed out on a hundred but it was another spectacular innings: 96 off 70 balls to follow 84 from 66 on Wednesday. Yeah, he’s back. 21st over: England 154-0 (Roy 94, Bairstow 59) Roy moves into the nerveless nineties by pulling Nurse straight down the ground for four. This is turning into a rare old thrashing. “Here’s the one I was looking for earlier,” says Brian Withington. “Marcus must have snaffled it no more than an inch off the ground to the disbelieving horror of Eskinazi and the delight of Somerset bowler and fielders. Genuinely uplifting moment - even without any Essex supporting schadenfreude connotations regarding Middlesex’s relegation (as if).” 20th over: England 146-0 (Roy 87, Bairstow 58) Bairstow sweeps Samuels very hard for four, another excellent stroke. Then Roy lifts him miles over midwicket for six, an even better stroke. England are halfway to their target, and are playing with such ease that it will almost be a disappointment if they don’t win by ten wickets. 19th over: England 135-0 (Roy 78, Bairstow 52) Bairstow reaches another high-class fifty from 48 balls. It’ll be interesting to see who opens for England in their next ODI at the MCG in January. Their depth of batting in ODI cricket is almost comical. 18th over: England 126-0 (Roy 76, Bairstow 49) A victory here would mean England have won 15 of their last 17 completed ODIs, and 11 out of 13 this summer. That defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy semi-final gets more frustrating by the day. 17th over: England 119-0 (Roy 76, Bairstow 42) Roy edges Nurse through the vacant slip area for four. This is far too easy for England, who need 170 from the last 33 overs. “If we accept that players like Stokes are once a generation, then surely not trying to replace him is the best option,” says Felix Wood. “England spent lots of frustrating years trying to find the new Botham, and it always ended in tears. If Stokes is out the best thing is to start from scratch. As for the fire thing, I think that there’s a number of options between putting out the fire and not getting out of control at two thirty in the morning mid series. I think he really needs to consider whether real mates would let him be in the position in the first place.” Oh I agree. I was only referring to his on-field fire. He clearly needs to, and will, change his lifestyle. I just hope being burned at the social-media stake doesn’t impact upon his performances whenever he returns. And yes, I also agree about replacing him: you can’t, so don’t bother trying. That said, Ronnie Irani’s got unfinished business at Test level?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! 16th over: England 111-0 (Roy 70, Bairstow 40) Marlon Samuels comes on to bowl a bit of right-arm slow. He owes West Indies a few wickets after an abysmal series with the bat, in which he has a 1980s strike rate of 49 runs per 100 balls. Nothing much happens in his first over, which is milked for six runs. It’s time for drinks. 15th over: England 105-0 (Roy 65, Bairstow 39) Roy drives Nurse for a single to bring up the hundred. It’s not beyond the realms that England could break their own record for the highest target in a ten-wicket ODI victory; Roy and Alex Hales chased down 255 against Sri Lanka a year ago. 14th over: England 99-0 (Roy 61, Bairstow 37) A short ball from Joseph is spanked through midwicket for four by Roy. He carries on merrily with another pull for four, this time a beautifully controlled stroke. He’ll be desperate to get his fourth ODI hundred after missing out at the Oval. “Surely if Cook and Stoneman have batted for two hours, they don’t need Root to go in at No3,” says Graham O’Reilly. “The other thing is, you’ve gone for Ballance at 3 ‘to buy some time for the strokemakers’. You mean, like an opener would?” Yep, in the circumstances, and with Australian conditions in mind, I’d have picked three openers. As for Root at No3, the main argument for batting him at No4 is that he gets a bit of a rest after the Australian innings. If England were, say, 100 for one, I’d absolutely want him coming in to build on such a good start. That said, you can make a good argument both ways. This situation does make you realise what a rare gem England had in Jonathan Trott. No3 is probably the hardest position to fill in a Test team. 13th over: England 88-0 (Roy 51, Bairstow 36) Roy pushes Nurse for a single to reach back-to-back fifties, this one from 43 balls. When he’s good, he’s pretty damn good, and he has batted so dominantly since returning to the side earlier in the week. 12th over: England 85-0 (Roy 49, Bairstow 35) Joseph returns to the attack, with West Indies in dire need of wicket. The increasingly dominant Bairstow uppercuts superbly for four more. England are batting brilliantly here and have reduced the target to 204 from 38 overs. “I was looking for the video clip of Marcus Trescothick’s great kneeling catch “at prayer” against Middlesex yesterday, and stumbled on this remarkable Alastair Cook moment earlier in the season,” says Brian Withington. “Staggering reflexes in the (not so) old dog that may be further tested this winter.” Oh my, that’s a great find. Alastair Cook, the most nonchalant saver of lives since Doogie Howser MD. 11th over: England 77-0 (Roy 48, Bairstow 28) The big offspinner Ashley Nurse comes into the attack. It’s all very low-key out there, with England apparently cruising to victory. Bairstow crashes a fine drive through extra cover for four more. “If we are talking about a like-for-like Stokes’ replacement, a fast bowling all-rounder, many fall out of contention on an age basis such as Keith Barker, Rikki Clark, Darren Stevens etc,” says Peter Rowntree. “The only name which really comes to mind, and it’s a hell of a risk in terms of stepping up into international cricket from Div 2 is Ed Barnard. Let’s hope things do not turn out to be as bad for Stokes as they look right now.” I’m also worried about Stokes in the long term, whether the partially contrived outrage in the media will insidiously compromise the competitiveness that is so fundamental to his greatness. I know it’s a cliché, but there’s no Stokes without fire. 10th over: England 71-0 (Roy 47, Bairstow 23) “Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Hard not to love Moeen, but I was at the Old Trafford Test back in early August, and to see James Anderson take a wicket in his first over from the James Anderson End was pretty special. As for the OBO, did we all agree that Root should bat at 3 in Australia?” I’d bat him wherever he wants, which is clearly No4. There are huge risks in forcing him to bat No3, particularly on a tour that will drain his mental energy like nothing he has ever experienced. That said, I wonder if they could be a little more flexible - if Cook and Stoneman bat for, say, a minimum of two hours, then Root goes up to No3. 9th over: England 63-0 (Roy 44, Bairstow 18) Roy slaps Taylor just over the leaping backward point for four. He is such fun to watch when he’s in this mood, and on today of all days he has 44 not out from 35 balls. “Totally agree that there’s no off-the-shelf all rounder ready to replace Stokes, but who would you take in TRJ’s absence?” says Rob Razzell. “Has Porter done enough, or is he too much of an English-conditions type?” Haven’t they already picked Overton? I haven’t seen anything of Porter, though from afar he seems a bit too English in style for an Ashes tour. 8th over: England 54-0 (Roy 36, Bairstow 17) A wide ball from Cummins is flashed through backward point for four by Roy, who then survives an LBW review next ball. It was a good nipbacker from Cummins that hit him on both pads, and the umpire Simon Fry said not out. It looked close so West Indies reviewed; replays showed the point of contact with the outside of leg stump was umpire’s call. Bairstow, who has been happy to potter along in the background, reminds us of his attacking prowess with a hearty thump through mid-off for four. 7th over: England 43-0 (Roy 31, Bairstow 12) Taylor has bowled well, four overs for12, but the flurry of boundaries at the other end means West Indies are already in urgent need of a wicket or three. “Not sure we can continue to reject players like Stevens on the grounds of age, though relevant Test experience is an issue,” says John Starbuck. “Lots of sports have participants continuing much longer than they used to do because they take better care of themselves, such as Italian footballers, tennis champions achieving comebacks and of course boxing, though that has its own peculiarities. I suspect that Collingwood is going as both a coach and a possible back-up all-rounder who is still plenty active in the game.” I wish he was, as I always wanted a Lord Cowdrey story of my own, but I’m pretty sure he’s not. With Stevens, age is a valid consideration in Australia, I think (remember the Gooch/Gatting tour of 94-95); but more than that, fine county player though he has been, he’s not good enough to face Australia in Australia. 5th over: England 29-0 (Roy 18, Bairstow 11) “Moment of the summer has to be Shai Hope at Headingley,” says Jimmy Ainsworth. “You talk about inscrutability but the celebration for his second century was astonishingly low key. I look more emotional putting the bins out. Made me proud to be West Indian, and I’m not remotely West Indian.” 6th over: England 39-0 (Roy 28, Bairstow 11) Roy thumps the new bowler Cummins for a couple of boundaries through the covers. Roy has gone off like a getaway driver and has 28 from 21 balls. “Afternoon Rob,” says Harkarn Sumal. “When we’ve been batting in the longer form, I have never seen Chris Woakes do anything other than bat like a proper test batsman. I mean a real, Collingwoodesque bat. Dull, with occasional startling pyrotechnics. Despite invariably tootling in at 8, 9 or 10, he seems to have both the technique and the temperament to go in at five or six. Perhaps the answer is there, right in front of our noses? Woakes 5, Bairstow 6, Ali 7, and then slot in the rest behind them. You can then have an out-and-out bowler who can bat a little joining Messrs Broad, Ball, Anderson, probably at 8. Anyway, goodness knows. Let’s just keep everything crossed and hope it pans out like the “can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field” tour of ‘87.” Six bowlers and four specialist batsmen? That seems a bit cavalier. In times of trouble we’re always drawn towards extreme or unusual selections – I suspect it’s a legacy of growing up in the 80s and 90s – but the simplest solution is usually the best. From the current squad I would go for Cook, Stoneman, Ballance, Root, Vince, Bairstow, Moeen, Woakes, Overton, Broad, Anderson. Ballance is No3 is not ideal but nor is anyone else, and he might at least buy some time for the strokemakers as he did in Cardiff two years ago. 4th over: England 27-0 (Roy 17, Bairstow 10) You can tell a lot about the state of a game from the topic of conversation among the commentators. Rob Key and Sir Ian Botham are talking about Richie McCaw. This is not a particularly tense run-chase, hence the digressions, and at the moment England are cruising. Roy, who looks close to his thrilling best, drives and pulls Joseph for consecutive boundaries. 3rd over: England 15-0 (Roy 6, Bairstow 9) There would be no point trying to replace Stokes with an all-rounder, because there isn’t one. I think five bowlers are essential for this particular attack in Australia, so you could just move Bairstow and Moeen up a place. That’s not ideal, I realise, but English cricket departed an ideal world at 2.30am on Monday morning. 2nd over: England 11-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 6) Alzarri Joseph, who took a futile five-for two days ago, shares the new ball. England get stuck into him from the start, with Bairstow clipping four through midwicket and Roy muscling a pull to the square-leg boundary. 1st over: England 2-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 1) Jerome Taylor opens the bowling. Nothing to see here, just a couple of singles. “Dear Rob,” says Joe Tomlinson. “Following on from the earlier discussion about who could replace Ben Stokes, I have two words that I have surprisingly not seen posted yet: Darren Stevens. Better fc batting average, similar bowling average, fills the batting allrounder slot very well. Worth considering lending your support to this one? I’m sure a word on the OBO will go a long way to influencing Mr Whittaker.” I love a maverick selection but, much as I admire Stevens at county level, picking an uncapped 41-year-old might be a stretch. Hello there, happy end-of-summer day. England need 289 to secure their biggest ODI series victory against West Indies. There have been three 3-0 wins - 1988, 1991, and earlier this year - but never a 4-0. It would be a nice way to end the summer. I was thinking about my moment of the summer earlier today, and was almost surprised to realise just how many impressive, spectacular or feelgood moments there have been: Shai Hope and the Headingley miracle, Pakistan’s spine-tingling Champions Trophy win, England’s spine-tingling World Cup win, Morne Morkel’s happy-go-lucky brilliance, Jimmy Anderson’s 500th Test wicket and much else besides. I think my favourite moment was the celebration of Moeen Ali’s hat-trick at the Oval. The wait, the boyish glee on Moeen’s usually inscrutable face and the sheer joy of his team-mates’ celebration. All in all, it was pretty lovely. A shorter innings break because of the time lost early doors, so we’ll be back for the England reply post-haste. Rob Smyth will guide you through that, so I shall leave you with him. Your emails from this point to Rob.Smyth@theGuardian.com. Well, it’s just about a score. But that dithering in the middle overs against the spinners from Samuels and Shai Hope might ultimately cost them. The pitch is decent so you’d expect England to knock these off with relative comfort, but you do of course never know... 50th over: West Indies 288-6 (Ambris 38, Nurse 31) It’s Ball with the last over, and two singles come from the first two balls, before Nurse drops to one knee and smears four over straight cover. Then he tries an outrageous scoop from a ball that would’ve been close to an off-side wide, getting another four for his troubles. A repeat of the cover thwack is tried, but this one plugs in the turf and they settle for two, and from the last ball he tries the same shot again, but this time can only get an under-edge and they dash through for a single. 49th over: West Indies 275-6 (Ambris 37, Nurse 19) Curran up for his last one, starting with a good yorker then following it with an excellent slower ball that kicks up. But then, another slower one is quite emphatically picked by Nurse, who batters it over long-on for six. And then another slower one, which Nurse smacks but it goes high, high, high in the air - Plunkett gets under it just inside the boundary, but ends up dropping the ball over the ropes, for another six. Along with a couple of couples, that’s 16 from the over, and West Indies are approaching something like a score. 48th over: West Indies 259-6 (Ambris 34, Nurse 6) Nurse is the new man, and gets off the mark thanks to some poor fielding, as Morgan lets one through his grasp and they come back for two. A rather more deliberate few runs next, as Nurse raises a leg and flicks one round the corner than Bairstow can’t stop from reaching the boundary. Plunkett in for his last over, and Powell launches a meaty pull way over mid-wicket for six. Then he misses out in quite a profound way, missing a highish full toss that takes out off stump. 47th over: West Indies 246-5 (Ambris 33, Powell 5) Curran returns for Plunkett, and Powell goes for the biggest hoik you’ve ever seen but completely misses a slower ball. A single then Ambris repeats it, but this time it was too wide, and is called as such. The last ball is another slowie, this time really slow, and again Ambris swipes and misses. Decent over from Curran: five from it. 46th over: West Indies 241-5 (Ambris 31, Powell 3) A couple of fours for Ambris, as he squirts one through point-ish, then Ball tries the other side and instead offers up a leg-stump half-volley, which is firmly clipped past fine-leg. A few balls later there’s another one of those, but this time Bairstow dashes around to make a good save. Good over though: 14 from it. 45th over: West Indies 227-5 (Ambris 18, Powell 2) Plunkett’s here for a bowl, and we have five singles from the over. Sorry, not a huge amount more to say about that one. 44th over: West Indies 222-5 (Ambris 15, Powell 0) They crossed, so Ambris takes a single. Here’s Jakey Ball, and Hope gets a “Wow” from Mikey Holding as he absolutely pulverises a six high over straight mid-wicket. That was the sort of shot that you can imagine the leather coming off the ball as it flies through the air, like something breaking up as it re-enters the earth’s atmosphere. Ah, but hubris: Hope goes the other way but skews this one, going high to the cover fence where Billings waits, waits, waits and takes a solid catch. 43rd over: West Indies 212-4 (Hope 65, Ambris 12) Decent hook from Ambris, sending a Curran bumper between fine leg and deep backward square for a boundary. Then Hope tries something vaguely similar, but can only cuff the thing straight over the bowler’s head, plugging in the turf for a couple of runs. 42nd over: West Indies 203-4 (Hope 62, Ambris 6) Rashid goes down leg for a wide, then only marginally corrects himself and Ambris gets off the mark with a swipe out to square leg. Then Hope tries to go big, doesn’t get all of it and Root dashes around from long-off, just getting there but grasses a difficult diving catch. He is, nonetheless, very cross with himself. Don’t be unhappy, Joe. You might get two days of time off soon. 41st over: West Indies 195-4 (Hope 61, Ambris 0) Buttler dives to his right and parries what initially looked like a catch, but on closer inspection it was actually a toe-end that jabbed into the ground: so a great stop, then. A good yorker from Curran, a slower ball, and that’s a maiden after getting a relative tanning last up. Lovely stuff. “Inspired by the new Bladerunner film review in the Guardian,” writes Brian Withington, “would this Ashes be too soon to go the whole hog and develop a Stokes “replicant”? The AI needed should surely not be too challenging given the original. And it can’t possibly be as far-fetched as Cameron McFarlane’s endearing Ravi Bopara suggestion.” 40th over: West Indies 195-4 (Hope 61, Ambris 0) “Just the mention of Ravi brought about a wicket,” writes a triumphant Cameron McFarlane. “Get him on the plane!” Hope is waking up. Rashid returns for his last two overs, he drags an iffy ball short and Hope spins on it, whacking to the square leg boundary. But then, after a single, Mohammed has a go, tries to go for a six over extra-cover, but gets it wrong and Root runs around from long-off to take a decent catch. 39th over: West Indies 189-3 (S.Hope 56, Mohammed 24) After everyone has a drink, Curran’s back for Plunkett. After a couple of slower balls he slides down leg, and Hope gets down on one knee and sweeps it fine for a boundary - his first, as it happens. Then he gets his second, on his toes and flicked off his hip the other side of short fine leg. And then another! Similar place, this time a more full-blooded pull shot. Better hitting, but those last three balls were all a bit shoddy. 38th over: West Indies 174-3 (S.Hope 43, Mohammed 21) Here’s Mo for his last over, and what’s this! Mohammed skips down the pitch and smacks one over long-off, for six! Six! Six runs! The first one of those since the third ball of the sixth over, and the first by someone other than Gayle. Still, Mo finishes with very smart figures of 10-1-35-1. 37th over: West Indies 166-3 (S.Hope 42, Mohammed 15) Batsmen looking frustrated now. They’re sort of trying to hit out, but the bowlers are in a rhythm and they can’t get the big shots away. Another four from the over. 36th over: West Indies 162-3 (S.Hope 41, Mohammed 12) Mohammed looks in trouble after coming back for a second run, and Billings fires in a bullet of a throw coming in from the point boundary and the skipper makes it back to his ground with millimetres to spare. Only four from the over. 35th over: West Indies 158-3 (S.Hope 40, Mohammed 9) Some rare shoddy fielding from England: Bairstow dashes in from the boundary after Mohammed drives, but misses the one-handed pick-up and, despite his best efforts to recover the situation, it goes for four. A few balls later he gets a similar chance, this time going for the safer two-handed option and gives the ironic cheers from the crowd a quick nod. 34th over: West Indies 150-3 (S.Hope 37, Mohammed 4) Mo looks like he might bowl through here. Four singles from his eighth over. Are you a county cricket fan? Do you like hearing from other county cricket fans? Well you’re in luck, as county cricket fans give their say on what the summer has been like for them. 33rd over: West Indies 146-3 (S.Hope 35, Mohammed 2) Plunkett sends down a thronking lifter that Mohammed almost gets into an awful tizzy over, getting caught between playing and moving out the way, in the end just sticking the bat in front of his face. He was lucky it didn’t take a top edge and balloon to a grateful fielder. Mohammed slashes at a wide one and misses...although Morgan thought there was a little nick, which snicko seems to confirm. Possibly. “Re John Starbucks idea of a cardboard cut-out of Ben Stokes,” honks Matthew Doherty, “I thought that from the fuss about the squad that they were taking eight already?” 32nd over: West Indies 144-3 (S.Hope 34, Mohammed 1) That’s the real drawback of the slow pace: when you get out, a new man has to get himself in. And that new man is the skipper, Jason Mohammed. He gets off the mark with a sharp - possibly even ill-advised - single. I supposed, among all the stuff about the boundary drought, you could say it’s been a while since England took a wicket too. But there’s one, as Samuels tries to up the pace a little by coming down the track, but he runs past one and Buttler efficiently takes off the bails. A one day innings with a strike rate of only just over 50. Retro. 31st over: West Indies 142-2 (S.Hope 33, Samuels 32) Samuels swipes at a pull shot, and for a moment it looks like there might be a boundary, but fine leg stops it. Then a...drop? Actually that’s a bit harsh: Hope absolutely batters a drive above Morgan’s head at cover, the skipper jumps about three feet in the air and grabs it, but just can’t hold on. Would have been an incredible catch. And then...a boundary! The first in 131 balls! Samuels pulls behind square, and finally one reaches the fence. Cameron McFarlane isn’t quite so much thinking out of the box, but out of the box factory and all cardboard products: “I know it’s a bit out there, bit if we need another all rounder, how about bringing back Ravi Bopara? He’s not going to set the world alight, but is solid with bat, ball and in the field and as a County Champ he’ll be confident, and the international game isn’t new to him.” Our pal and OBOer Vithushan Ehantharajah will be delighted to hear that, Cameron. He might be the only one, mind. 30th over: West Indies 135-2 (S.Hope 31, Samuels 27) Still no boundaries. A couple of harder hit shots though: one of them even got as far as the fielder on the boundary. There’s one wide from a slower ball bouncer that looked a bit harsh. Seven runs from the over: even if they’re planning a 20:20 blitz from this point, they’ll have to go some in order to post a proper score of any description. 29th over: West Indies 128-2 (S.Hope 27, Samuels 25) Mo remains, and some smart fielding by Morgan saves a couple of runs from a Samuels whip. Otherwise, a tidy over. And a whopping 120 balls since the last boundary. 28th over: West Indies 126-2 (S.Hope 26, Samuels 24) With extremely ‘parents are coming to visit so sort the house out’ tidy figures of 8-1-28-0, Rashid gets a rest and Ball is back. Samuels swipes at a short ball, but misses and Ball’s returning over is rather tidier than some of his previous efforts. Not bowling at Chris Gayle helps, mind. 27th over: West Indies 124-2 (S.Hope 25, Samuels 23) A hint of aggression from Samuels, but he only gets a single to long-off after coming down the pitch. Samuels gets a thin snick on one down leg and Ball has to dash around to stop a boundary, but some slack running means they miss out on another run. Still: seven runs from that over, so at least that’s something. “If Stokes is that good,” muses John Starbuck, “how about a cardboard cut-out of him placed at short cover? Just enough to confuse the opposition.” 26th over: West Indies 117-2 (S.Hope 24, Samuels 17) A touch more intent, but only a touch. Samuels takes two from a very fine glance that gets past short fine leg but doesn’t reach the boundary. 25th over: West Indies 113-2 (S.Hope 23, Samuels 14) Rattlin’ through them now. Mo sends down another tidy one, they try to take a couple of singles but they can barely get the ball off the square, and what’s more they don’t look like they’re trying especially hard to. That’s now a honking 16 overs without a boundary. 24th over: West Indies 111-2 (S.Hope 22, Samuels 13) Big LB shout as Samuels sticks his foot down the wrong line and Rashid thunks into his pads, but that was missing. Five from the over, but more solid work from Rashid, mixing up the leggies, googles and toppers. 23rd over: West Indies 106-2 (S.Hope 21, Samuels 9) After that relative glut of runs from the last over, a slightly more modest two from this one. “I like Andrew Benton’s thinking regarding (not) replacing Stokes,” writes Brian Withington. “I think the Moneyball solution was to replace one star player with a composite of two or three, and converting a catcher (keeper) to first base. Still trying to figure how that translates from baseball to cricket though - might involve Jonny Bairstow batting out of his skin, catching everything at short extra cover and discovering he can bowl a mean in-ducking skidder at third change.” 22nd over: West Indies 104-2 (S.Hope 20, Samuels 8) No tap just yet, although they do positively rattle to five runs from the over: three singles and a two from Samuels, saved from a boundary by the diving Roy on the cover ropes. 21st over: West Indies 99-2 (S.Hope 18, Samuels 5) After 11 successive dot balls, West Indies finally get a run. Just one, a drive to the cover sweeper. Getting bogged down a little, but don’t be surprised if they start giving it some tap soon. 20th over: West Indies 98-2 (S.Hope 17, Samuels 5) A maiden from Rashid, and this is good stuff from England/sluggish batting from West Indies, depending on your point of view. No boundaries since the end of the 9th over, now. 19th over: West Indies 98-2 (S.Hope 17, Samuels 5) And now we have double spin, as Mo is into the attack. Four singles from the over, and we’re very much in the ‘ticking over’ section of the innings now. 18th over: West Indies 94-2 (S.Hope 15, Samuels 3) More good work from Rashid, giving up two singles, one of which was an under edge, then beats Samuels with a leg break. And now, drinks. 17th over: West Indies 92-2 (S.Hope 14, Samuels 2) Almost a shambles of a run out as Samuels gets a few steps down the pitch looking for a single which was not even remotely on. Plunkett sends down a wide, but otherwise a good over. Andrew Benton has been thinking outside the box, re: Stokes: “I’d leave a gap - play with ten men, in the warm up matches, see what difference it makes. And to rub in how unacceptable Stokes’ behaviour was to him.” 16th over: West Indies 89-2 (S.Hope 13, Samuels 1) Decent stuff from Rashid, keeping his men relatively quiet. A slip comes in as England become a little more confident, and there’s only three runs from the over. 15th over: West Indies 86-2 (S.Hope 11, Samuels 0) Plunkett says hello to Samuels with a decent bumper, that Samuels nonetheless sways away from with relative ease. Oh well that is just first class stuff from Plunkett. Kyle sort of jabs at a ball just outside off stump, it goes back to the bowler but reaches him around shin-height, at best, but Plunkett reaches down and plucks a wonderful return catch. 14th over: West Indies 85-1 (K.Hope 33, S.Hope 10) Oooh, lovely little delicate back-cut by Kyle off Rashid: on a dry ground that probably would’ve been four, but the damp turf denies him a run. Back on strike after a single, he then just reacts in time to a googly and somehow manages to get two runs out to deep point. 13th over: West Indies 79-1 (K.Hope 28, S.Hope 9) Both Hopes use the angle of Plunkett’s delivery, going in from wide on the crease, to collect a few runs down towards fine leg. Then Shai drives well out to the cover fence, where Bairstow runs around to save a few runs. 12th over: West Indies 73-1 (K.Hope 26, S.Hope 5) Spin! Here’s Dilly Rashid, and he starts well, mixing things up with some top-spinners and whatnot. Three from the over, as Kyle opens himself up and drives a couple through the covers from the last ball. 11th over: West Indies 70-1 (K.Hope 24, S.Hope 4) Bowling change, and here’s Muscles Plunkett to have a go. More pleasant driving down the ground, more singles but Shai only looks troubled when Plunkett drops one just back of a length. 10th over: West Indies 65-1 (K.Hope 22, S.Hope 2) A few nice strokes from both Hopes, but they only get three singles and a two for their troubles. Alex Book isn’t keen on the old guard: “If I hear Michael Holding, Ian Botham or any of the other old-timers on commentary use the phrase ‘proper cricket shot’ once more, I might need to put a premature end to the cricket season and switch off. Hope’s drive down the ground was a ‘proper cricket shot’ apparently, which makes Gayle’s five sixes....what??? Everything that’s wrong with prevailing attitudes of the cricket classes, captured in a single phrase. Tut tut tut.” 9th over: West Indies 61-1 (K.Hope 19, S.Hope 1) Ball, with the relieved look of a pensioner who has just found out the teenagers that hang around his house drinking Hooch and throwing bangers have been moved on to the next estate, continues. Hush hush, eye to eye, too shy Shai Hope gets off the mark with a single, then off the last ball of the over Kyle takes advantage of a long hop and whips a pull past fine leg for four. 8th over: West Indies 56-1 (K.Hope 15, S.Hope 0) Forgot to mention that wicket was one of Curran’s back-of-the-hand slowies, too. Good stuff from the man with the 90s haircut. K.Hope plays a nice shot down the ground which skips off to the long-on boundary, but beyond that Curran keeps things quiet. Well, as magnificent as his previous hitting was, that was a bit of a shambles from Gayle. He stepped away to leg, realised the ball was straighter than anticipated so tried to shuffle back and launch it, off balance and leaning back. The ball goes high in the air, Plunkett gets under it, misjudges the flight but then produces a brilliant diving catch to seal Curran’s first ODI wicket. 7th over: West Indies 52-0 (Gayle 40, K.Hope 11) Here’s Gayle, and there goes the ball: a decent enough delivery just back of a length disappears over extra cover, then a slashed effort goes over the slips and - get this - bounces before going over the boundary. What’s all this about, Chris? He rectifies things next ball, as Ball floats up an inviting effort that is murdered over long-off. And then - a single! Hope clips to fine leg for what should be a fairly long three, but Gayle ambles his way to two. Still, a handy 19 from the over, 43 from the last three. 6th over: West Indies 33-0 (Gayle 23, K.Hope 9) Slow coach Hope has his first boundary, not quite out of the meat, but he gets enough on a nice on drive that skips past the fielder. He then becomes rather cross with himself for missing out on a couple of presentable half-volleys. We all make mistakes, Kyle: don’t be so hard on yourself. 5th over: West Indies 29-0 (Gayle 23, K.Hope 5) Gayle has a shimmy around in his crease to try forcing something, but is tucked up again. Next ball he does get hold of one a little more, but a pull loops up over mid-wicket and plugs, bringing him two. And then: business. Gayle gets one in his arc, and casually puts it into the middle of the sightscreen; next ball is wider, he shifts his right foot out the way and spanks one high over the cover fence; next ball is down the ground again, slightly to the long on side, but with the same result. Six, six, six. Told you he looked scratchy... 4th over: West Indies 9-0 (Gayle 3, K.Hope 5) A few singles, a couple coming from inside edges that could have gone anywhere. Curran has started very well, that first ball wide apart. These twins are going to be some players. Meanwhile, an anonymous work skiver has more Stokes thoughts: “I’d honestly back Foakes to score more runs than any of the so-called batsmen in the squad. How about Bairstow as a specialist bat at six, then Foakes, Mo, Woakes to keep that depth? Last time the Aussies hammered us in stands after the fifth wicket. We need to take each game as long as we can. Having Bairstow in the cordon will help the fielding also, where Stokes is a big loss.” 3rd over: West Indies 6-0 (Gayle 1, K.Hope 4) Hope floats a couple off his pads, and a single brings Gayle back. This is of course tempting fate and you can screenshot it for when he’s completing his century in the 23rd over, but Gayle looks very scratchy so far: two go past the edge, and he only got a thick bottom edge on a very wide one that he might ordinarily have burst a hole in the advertising boards with. Still, he gets off the mark with a single. 2nd over: West Indies 2-0 (Gayle 0, K.Hope 1) And here’s Tom Curran with the ball from t’other end. He starts with a wide, then is more on line with one that Hope shovels towards mid-wicket for a single. Gayle shoulders arms to the last ball of the over but Curran gets it to duck back in, it hits the back leg above his pad, and the lbw claim is correctly turned down. 1st over: West Indies 0-0 (Gayle 0, K.Hope 0) Gayle begins in uncharacteristically circumspect fashion, nibbling at one down the leg side that clipped his thigh pad. Ball beats his outside edge/he pulls well inside a ball on off stump, depending on your point of view. But we begin with a maiden. Jake Ball will open the bowling. Should also say that despite the delayed start, we won’t lose any overs, with the innings break shortened. And here we, here we, here we go: the players are out on the field, with England to bowl first. Chris Gayle and Kyle Hope open the batting for West Indies. Before we start, let’s have a look back on the season in County Cricket: it’s The Wills 2017! James Blake has an update to Ian Copestake’s mantra: With apologies to I. Welsh, Ian’s mantra reminded me of another monologue slightly tweaked..... “Choose Cricket. Choose test matches. Choose ODI’s. Choose t20’s. Choose a f**king big television to watch them on. Choose nurdling, doosras, nightwatchmen and rampshots... Choose the Ashes and wondering why the f*ck you are up at 2am on Sunday morning listening to it. Choose sitting on that couch watching spirit crushing England collapses, sticking pork pies with piccalilli into your mouth. Choose getting it in the block hole and probing the corridor of uncertainty. Choose your nan’s batting with a stick of rhubarb and rotating the strike. Choose sticky wickets, bunnies and trundlers Choose your future. Choose life... And why wouldn’t I want to do a thing like that?” One change for England, as Chris Woakes has a niggle and is replaced by Tom Curran, making his debut. And West Indies are without Evin Lewis, obviously, as it would be pretty unreasonable to ask him to play with a broken ankle, while Jason Holder has returned home for his uncle’s funeral. Kyle Hope and Sunil Ambris come in. England Roy, Bairstow, Root, Morgan (capt), Buttler (wk), Sam Billings, Moeen Ali, Rashid, Curran, Plunkett, Ball West Indies Gayle, K.Hope, Ambris, S.Hope (wk), Samuels, Mohammed (capt), Powell, Nurse, Joseph, Taylor, Cummins ...and will bowl first. Before the toss, let’s have some of those thoughts on how to replace Ben Stokes. Featuring you, the public: Without Stokes, there is precedent (several of the tests last summer), where they pushed Bairstow and Ali to 6/7, had Woakes at 8 and then played 3 quicks. so i’d have some 5 batsmen and then Bairstow - Ali - Woakes - Overton - Broad - Anderson - Rob Little PAUL COLLINGWOOD. But seriously, we might have an issue, I can’t think of an all rounder in his mould at all, which is why he’s so special. The closest I can think of is Woakes, who will already be playing. Which begs the question... Is Chris Woakes now at his most valuable as a test player? - Matt Potter I think Woakes should play automatically now, then decide if that’s in a 3 man pace attack with an extra batsman, or as a 4 man attack with Overton/Crane playing and a longer tail, with Mo moving up. I’d like to see them call up Liam Livingstone. Bats well, and just taken his career best with the ball - Jonny Wilkins Replace Stokes? You can’t. I was thinking about what we’d miss most of his all round skills. Probably the batting. But do I have any confidence in the reserve batsmen? But then you have four bowlers, with Mo as one of them. So I’d move Mo to six, keep Bairstow at seven and play Woakes at eight. Probably means Coverton or more likely Ball will play. What it tells you though is how indispensable he is and how severely we’ll be weakened - Kevin Wilson 1pm did seem a bit optimistic. Apparently the toss will now take place at 12.50pm, with a start 25 minutes later, assuming there’s no more rain. Which, for what it’s worth, is not forecast. So as we wait, let’s have a piping hot debate! Assuming Ben Stokes doesn’t go to Australia, how would you replace him for the Ashes? Aha! Turns out I was being a big pessimistic ninny! The toss will take place in about ten minutes, and the game is now scheduled to start at 1pm BST. Huzzah! More encouragement: players who were lolling around on the balcony have now emerged from the dressing room and warm-ups are starting. Ian Copestake would like you all to gather around in a circle, join hands and repeat this mantra over and over: “Cricket is life. Smiley face.” There’s movement out on the field, and some of it even involves removing covers from. This can only be a positive sign. Would suggest it’s optimistic to expect cricket before 1.30, mind. While we wait, let’s enjoy Mark Nicholas, whose birthday it is today. We should be tossing coins about now, but the rain falls on Southampton. A delayed start, obviously, and thus no team news just yet. And so, here we are. The end of the England men’s team’s summer. It began on a brisk May day in Bristol and ends on a brisk September/nearly October afternoon in Southampton. They have played 24 games - seven tests, four T20s and 13 ODIs - winning 17, losing six with one no result and zero draws. They’ve scored 8,348 runs and taken 250 wickets against seven opponents using 30 players, only two of which put their international futures in jeopardy by getting involved in a sticky-floored Bristol nightclub stramash. That record, apart from the fighty bit, looks pretty good on paper, but what have we learned? Well, at the start of the summer we knew that England limited overs team was pretty decent with the odd moment of inconsistency and mental fragility, while the Test side had a solid quick bowling unit but serious questions about batting positions two, three and five. And now...erm...well...yeah. Really the only thing that’s changed is now more people recognise Moeen Ali for the king he is. And those that needed persuading anyway were only worthy of our pity previously. Have I missed anything there? It’s not that this summer has been pointless. England have played in 24 games of cricket, much of it entertaining, so that’s better than having to concentrate on life. It’s just that, at least if you’re the sort of person who concerns themselves with the Ashes, England might as well have spent the last five months finger painting for all the answers the cricket has provided. Now, we round off with a dead rubber against a side who would probably rather be somewhere else, but who have actually shown a few signs of life in the shape of some encouraging batting performances. But, to repeat: some cricket is better than the alternative, so let’s enjoy it before we become consumed by the months of early-hours fretting that the winter will bring. Start: 12.30pm BST."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/29/katharina-grosse-this-drove-my-mother-up-the-wall-review-south-london-gallery","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T12:13:00Z","webTitle":"Katharina Grosse torpedoes painting: This Drove My Mother Up the Wall review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/29/katharina-grosse-this-drove-my-mother-up-the-wall-review-south-london-gallery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/29/katharina-grosse-this-drove-my-mother-up-the-wall-review-south-london-gallery","fields":{"headline":"Katharina Grosse torpedoes painting: This Drove My Mother Up the Wall review","bodyText":"The landscapes that have succumbed to the brilliant, blaring colours of Katharina Grosse’s spray-paint gun include abandoned buildings, public gardens and seashores: a spectacular blend of painting and land art that has made the German a major player on the international art circuit. In the Rockaways, New York, she once coated part of the old army base and its surrounding sands in too-red polluted sunset hues. Earlier this year in Denmark she splurged the lurid pink and white of seaside sticks of rock across the undulating grass banks that flanked a busy road. Within galleries, meanwhile, her experiments in taking paint beyond the bounds of the canvas have seen huge felled trees, piles of dirt and fibreglass boulders become the base for psychedelic abstractions. All of which means This Drove My Mother Up the Wall, her installation at the South London Gallery, seems in comparison somewhat quieter – if quiet is a word you can apply to a work that touches every surface of the emptied exhibition space with rainbow paint. In the Victorian building’s central gallery, it begins at the edges, dissolving the boundaries where the skirting boards meet the floor in swaths of colour, which roll upwards like rising waves. Much remains brilliant white, and here and there pale voids, left behind by stencils, jut out from the paint. Grosse has described her art as aggressive and it is easy to see why. Not only is it an effective takeover of the environment, it torpedoes, one by one, the assumed limits of painting. The picture frame, obviously, is out the window: whereas painting once depicted the world, she applies paint to the world itself. Inevitably, she has been likened to graffiti artists – but while the tagger makes a distinct mark, this is an art that flirts with the idea it might coat anything, without bounds. Just as the divide between art and life starts to dissolve, however, Grosse takes steps not to let us be seduced wholeheartedly by her new colour-saturated world. Artists have painted directly on to building interiors for centuries. Yet unlike trompe l’oeil architectural features, for instance, her abstractions are deliberately at odds with their 3D ground. Then there are those bare white stencilled absences with their fuzzy edges, a reminder that this is all a construct. What is striking here is the sensation of walking on to an empty stage, one bereft of its main player: the artist with her gun. (This oft-repeated description suggests a Lara Croft figure, but in documentation of Grosse’s process she looks more like pest control, in a white head-to-toe protective suit and wielding a long spray-paint pipe.) Unlike theatre, however, we can drop in when we feel like it, picking up her path at any point. Here is a plume of lava orange erupting up the wall. There, a single bruise of mauve blooms on the ceiling. At either end of the gallery, layers of colour resemble gauzy fabric decking walls and the original doors with their blocky pediments. The spray paint does a lot of different things. It can be dense and concealing, luring us into the illusory depths of overlain ribbons of colour, or airy and speckled against white. Occasionally it bleeds down the wall. Like the artist, we must walk through space, rubber-necking to take in her painting’s collisions and collusions with what is real. There are lovely moments, like discovering the shadowed undersides of the ceiling’s square mouldings. These have been emphasised with blue and orange, riffing on the play of light and shade that is one of 2D art’s oldest tools when it comes to depicting the 3D world. It also recalls an origins story Grosse has told, a childhood obsession for mentally painting over the shadows in her bedroom with an invisible paintbrush. Two films she has selected to screen alongside the installation shed more light on her thinking. In Claudia Müller’s Women Artists, Grosse curates her virtual dream show, featuring artists who both channel the everyday world and push art’s limits, including the Indigenous Australian painter Emily Kame Kngwarreye and the rising star Camille Henrot. Then there’s French new wave legend Agnès Varda, whose The Gleaners and I is her personable, freewheeling documentary exploring how people put to new use what society normally casts off, be that foraging for food or street junk repurposed as art. As she drives along, Varda’s thumb and finger repeatedly frame the backs of lorries on the road, like a temporary viewfinder. It is a slight, revealing gesture concerning art’s sticky, slippery grip on the real world that chimed loudly for me with the contradictions Grosse courts by fusing painting and its support, the artifice of pigment and the stony empiricism of the gallery wall. Above the venue’s spray-painted doors I notice that the exit signs are untouched. Health and safety, presumably, but they provide a harsh flash of ordinary life that she would surely appreciate.

The former poet laureate was wrong. As far as younger people were concerned, it was just the start of a spending boom that went on for the rest of the century. Then things flipped around. After decades in which young people had consumed more on average than the population as a whole, since the turn of the millennium it has been the older generation who have had the spare cash to flash around. The conventional wisdom is that young people are having a tough time of things, which is why they voted overwhelmingly for Jeremy Corbyn in the general election. This view of the world has not gone unchallenged. The millennials might not be seeing the same sort of growth in real incomes as their parents and grandparents did, but they are still having a grand old time, streaming their music on Spotify, jetting off for weekend breaks in Budapest and eating avocado on toast before heading off to the movies. A study of consumption data stretching back to 1963, carried out by experts at Loughborough University for the Resolution Foundation, puts this theory to the test and finds it wanting. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the young are spendthrifts frittering away their money. The real story is that the baby boomer generation have been on the winning side both when they were young and now that they are getting older. Young people are, by contrast, being squeezed in two ways – their incomes are not rising nearly as rapidly as was the case in the past, and more of that income is being spent on housing. In 1963, those aged between 25 and 34 spent marginally less than 55- to 64-year-olds, but that picture changed markedly: by 1989 those aged 25-34 were spending 11% more. By 2014, they were spending 15% less. As far as individual categories of spending are concerned, the report finds that those aged 25-34 do eat out more than those aged 55-64, but that is mainly accounted for by the fact that younger people spend less on eating in. Since 2000, the upward trend in eating out has been driven by older working-age adults. There is, says the report, little support for the idea that “avocado on toast consumption in cafes is crowding out more long-term or purposeful spending” among younger people. Similarly, consumption of holidays by younger people has remained flat since 2000, with the strongest growth recorded by the 55-64 demographic, who enjoy more leisure trips than any other age group. The narrative that millennials are jet-setting more than their predecessors is not supported by the facts. Nor have the older generations missed out on the consumer products made available by technological developments. Younger people spend £9 a week on their mobiles and internet services, compared with £7 a week for those aged 55-64, and the increase in spending since 2000 has been similar at all ages. The report the 10th done for the Resolution Foundation’s intergenerational commission and contains both an economic and a political message. The economic message is that young people – especially those on low incomes – are struggling. They are cutting back and often living in grotty housing conditions. The political message is that the different consumption patterns explain why the Conservatives only secured a majority in the election among those in their mid-40s and older."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/lgbtq-azerbaijan-fleeing-police-raids-arrests-government-hiv","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T11:05:15Z","webTitle":"LGBT people in Azerbaijan are being rounded up.

No wonder they’re fleeing","bodyText":"Azerbaijan has never been a safe place for LGBTQ people. When I lived there, you could face discrimination and brutality in your daily life. You would get rejections from jobs, and be humiliated by family, neighbours, classmates. LGBTQ people would never go to the police for help – the police would not protect you. But that’s gone a step further with the recent police crackdowns in Baku. I left Azerbaijan in 2014 for the US. I came as a student and decided not to go back to a country where I’m not able to be myself. That became clear to me in the wake of Isa Shakhmarli’s death. After he killed himself using the rainbow flag, wider society became even more brutal about LGBTQ people. It was the first time there had been a public debate about the issues and it showed how dangerous people’s ignorance could be. Lately, things have become even worse; now you are not allowed to be seen in public places. Police raids started on 15 September when several transsexual sex workers were arrested by the police – who then sought out their friends. Those under arrest have been threatened and blackmailed by the police to make them provide information about others. Many gay and transsexual people have been arrested in their apartments. Living collectively, with five or six people to a flat, has made it easier for the police to find them. Detainees have reported that they have been beaten and humiliated, with police even shaving some people’s heads. This is all against Azerbaijani legislation. The statements coming from Azerbaijan’s ministry of internal affairs do not seem to reflect the reality. It has made three statements in the past week – first to say that there had been no raids on LGBTQ people; second, saying that some of those arrested had been tested for HIV and the results were shocking; and finally saying that 16 of the detainees tested HIV-positive. However, the Aids Centre in Baku released a statement saying they had not been involved in the process – and said that there was no request from the police to test anyone, and they had not even compared the names of detainees with the ones on their record. They have also revealed the statistics about HIV-positive people in Baku. There are 5,376 HIV-positive people registered at the centre. Among that number, 48.7% caught the virus as a result of injecting drugs, 40.3% after heterosexual sex – and a mere 1.9% after homosexual sex. I have been told that the police are now profiling people in every public place. There have been several incidents in which police have approached people and detained them without giving any reason. They may be released after a few hours upon paying a bribe – or they may be detained for up to 30 days. Human rights lawyers in Baku have taken on 33 cases already. All of these people were arrested on charges of resisting the police and disobeying them. None have been arrested because of prostitution. The whole Azerbaijani LGBTQ community is now living in fear. Some have left the country – and they don’t know how long it will be before they can go home. Without international support to put pressure on Azerbaijan’s government to stop this vile treatment, all we can do is help those who feel unsafe to leave the country. • In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

To get your CV noticed, you must include a tailored cover note in every one of your applications. Whether you are applying via a job website or direct email, write a friendly and professional paragraph to introduce yourself, build rapport, and explain why your CV is worth reading. Make your CV easy to skim-read Recruiters are pushed for time, so they will usually spend a few seconds skimming your CV for must-have terms before they decide to commit to reading it fully. To pass this preliminary test, make your CV extremely easy to read with a clean, simple font, clearly divided sections and short, sharp points. Never make readers wade through large paragraphs of text or you will risk losing their interest quickly. You should also research your target roles thoroughly to identify your most sought-after skills and ensure they are made prominent at the top of your CV. Providing a pleasant reading experience and reflecting the recruiter’s needs in your CV will hold their attention and create a perfect first impression. Buff up your current or most recent role Once recruiters have had a quick scan of your CV, they will look at your current or most recent role. This role is easily the best way to measure your current capabilities, so recruiters will spend lots of time reviewing this part of your CV. Spend plenty of time writing this role description and think about the questions that recruiters will want to know when reading it: Where do you sit within the organisation? Do you manage a team? How do you contribute to the company? What results did you achieve for your employer or clients? Structure the role with an introductory sentence to build context, then bullet point your responsibilities, and round the role off with some impressive achievements. Use data as evidence Numbers are crucial for recruiters to understand your seniority and impact, and benchmark you against other candidates. Many job seekers make bold claims in their CVs, but very few back them up with facts and figures, so buck the trend to stand out. Demonstrate the scale of your responsibilities by including numbers such as the size of budget you manage, or number of locations you work across. These figures provide a scale that everybody can understand and leave recruiters in no doubt of the level you work at. Prove your impact by including quantifiable achievements you have driven during your roles. Perhaps you have generated sales of £300k within six months, or maybe you have delivered a project that affected 3 million customers. Include these stats to show exactly what an employer can expect when they hire you. Weed out mistakes Providing just one bad CV to a client can ruin a recruiter’s reputation, so even the smallest of inconsistencies can deter them from shortlisting you. Glaring spelling and grammar mistakes will obviously be red flags, but they will also be on the lookout for any gaps in employment, or facts that just don’t add up. Proof read your CV thoroughly, check all of your dates, and don’t be tempted to add any white lies. Even something as trivial as an unprofessional email address can worry a recruiter, so keep everything looking as slick as possible and don’t give them any reason to doubt you. Essentially, recruiters just want to find the candidate who matches their client’s brief as closely as possible – it’s that simple. Ultimately, if you can show them that you have the skills and experience they are looking for, then you stand a good chance of being selected. If you also adopt clarity in the formatting of your CV to consider recruiter’s time constraints and workloads, you will see plenty of interview requests coming your way.

With the new, feverishly anticipated series just days away, obsessives have been able to rewatch all the old episodes, enjoy interviews with the key players – cranky ones with Larry David, stream-of-consciousness ones with Richard Lewis – and listen to the remarkably in-depth Origins podcast about the show’s conception. But Netflix has just uploaded perhaps the biggest curio of them all. It’s called Long Shot, and it’s basically Curb Your Enthusiasm: the true crime documentary. No, really. Long Shot tells the story of how Curb Your Enthusiasm helped an innocent man to avoid death row. In May 2003, a 16-year-old girl named Martha Puebla was shot to death on the doorstep of her Los Angeles home, days after testifying about two murders allegedly committed by her ex-boyfriend Jose Ledesma. Some months later, police arrested 24-year-old Juan Catalan for Puebla’s death. Catalan, the police reasoned, carried out the hit on the orders of Ledesma and Catalan’s brother Mario. He was placed behind bars pending trial; if found guilty, he would have received the death penalty. However, Catalan had an alibi. When Puebla was murdered, he claimed he was at Dodger Stadium, watching the home team get defeated by the Atlanta Braves. So far, so Netflix. Long Shot is brimming with all the true-crime tropes you’re used to by now. A grisly crime. An innocent man. An overzealous police force. Newsprint. Television footage. Jittery music. Talking heads in extreme closeup. If you’ve seen any of these offerings before, you’ll be quick to write off Long Shot as utterly generic. And then comes Larry David. If you’ve managed to avoid any mention of this story and want to preserve the twist, stop reading now. Although Catalan’s lawyer tried and failed to find footage of Catalan in Dodger Stadium at the time of the murder – neither the DodgerVision or live TV footage of the game showed Catalan distinctly enough to let him off – it just so happened that an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm (season four’s The Car Pool Lane, in which Larry hires a prostitute who then gets his father high on pot) was also filming at the stadium that night. It was footage shot for Curb Your Enthusiasm – timecodes and all – that got Catalan’s case dismissed. Better yet, in the footage that got him off, Catalan brushes right against Larry, seconds before Larry raises his arms in a gesture of mock triumph. Looking back it seems completely orchestrated, although in reality it was a one in a million chance. Larry David is interviewed for Long Shot. And he’s what makes the film worth watching, right from the moment he’s caught absentmindedly whistling while waiting for the film equipment to be set up. His appearance is nothing short of a Larry David masterclass, as he wrestles the nervy, teary-eyed tone into something far more sardonic. Catalan’s lawyer calls Larry a “mega-huge Hollywood star”; Larry responds with a withering eye-roll. Catalan cries with gratitude; Larry shrugs off the whole incident as “Maybe something I could impress a date with”. Welcome back, Larry. Long Shot is available on Netflix now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/29/dyson-electric-car-project-industry-experts-2020-engineering-manufacturing-regulatory-hurdles","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T10:02:39Z","webTitle":"Dyson: industry experts cast doubt on electric car project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/29/dyson-electric-car-project-industry-experts-2020-engineering-manufacturing-regulatory-hurdles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/29/dyson-electric-car-project-industry-experts-2020-engineering-manufacturing-regulatory-hurdles","fields":{"headline":"Dyson: industry experts cast doubt on electric car project","bodyText":"Dyson became the latest manufacturer to hop aboard the battery-powered bandwagon this week, revealing a £2.5bn investment plan to produce an electric vehicle by 2020. In doing so, British inventor Sir James Dyson and his vacuum cleaner-making firm, raised eyebrows across the auto industry. Dyson is attempting to crash the party at a time when traditional carmakers are embroiled in an electric vehicle (EV) arms race. Some of Britain’s biggest car manufacturers - steeped in the engineering and regulatory challenges that come with every new launch - reckon Dyson will struggle to rush a new EV into showrooms by 2020. The Wiltshire-based company has a team of 400 engineers on the project, which has been under wraps for two and a half years. But he consumer technology firm is moving into the cut-throat world of car manufacturing with a blank sheet of paper – it has an electric motor, but no chassis and no manufacturing plant. A source at one carmaker, with knowledge of EV production, said: “It is a challenge because getting a car to market is a long process. We are launching a new electric car next year. That process started five or six years ago - and we have everything in place (manufacturing facilities, established supply chain and manpower).” Beyond manufacturing challenges, the source reckons Dyson’s ambitious plan would be severely tested by the time it takes for each new vehicle to be passed fit by regulators. “The complexity of crash regulations alone is huge,” the source said. “Each car must be compliant in each market.” He said it takes “years rather than months” to get a new vehicle through the EU’s rigorous safety testing process until it is awarded a certificate of conformity. High end, small volume Dr Paul Nieuwenhuis, senior lecturer at Cardiff University’s Centre for Automotive Industry Research, believes Dyson is aiming to follow Tesla’s lead - by producing small amounts to sell at a high price. Tesla, Elon Musk’s California-based EV pioneer, has forced the hand of industry giants, such as Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors, to respond with their own EV launches. “The timescale sounds tight if you are developing the car and building it,” Nieuwenhuis said. “Some manufacturers have managed it in three years. However, they do that with a lot of technology carried-over from other models. “Britain is stuffed with a lot of engineers with experience specifically in low-volume manufacturing. For example, TVR could produce a new car in 18 months. So if that’s the way they are thinking, the timescale is doable but very, very tight. If you are a new entrant, it’s much easier to go in at the top, as Tesla has done, than at the bottom.” Dyson has experience of entering crowded markets at the premium end and convincing consumers to spend more on its products than cheaper alternatives, as it did with its pricey vacuum cleaners. Dyson indicated the car might be expensive, saying: “Maybe the better figure is how much of a deposit they would be prepared to put down.” Tesla’s Model 3, the Palo Alto firm’s first “mass market” vehicle, still comes with a comparatively hefty $35,000 price tag. However, the entry level Model S costs $94,000, while a Model X starts at $96,000. Solid state future Dyson is developing two solid-state batteries, which don’t contain liquids like the lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and electric cars. In theory, these batteries are safer, can be recharged more quickly and can hold a charge for longer. Japanese auto-firm Toyota announced earlier this year that it hopes to have cars with solid-state batteries on sale by 2020 – the same time frame as Dyson. While carmakers are battling to develop the best batteries, they are also fighting to secure enough of the key minerals used to manufacture these power packs. VW is scrambling to secure long-term supplies of cobalt, a vital component of rechargeable batteries. The world’s largest carmaker has asked cobalt producers to submit proposals by the end of September to supply VW with the key mineral for up to 10 years from 2019. VW has accelerated its EV ambitions following the “dieselgate” scandal and plans to invest more than $24bn in zero-emission vehicles by 2030. It aims to ramp up EV production to 3m a year by 2025. Others, such as Nissan, are buying up battery capacity to secure supply for future EV demand. “All of these things create huge question marks for Dyson,” said a source twho works with some of the world’s biggest auto companies. Dyson has hinted that although Britain remains a “frontrunner” to build the car, it is more likely the vehicle will be manufactured in the Far East. The British firm already has manufacturing operations in Malaysia. Experts believe Dyson will develop the vehicle and all future Dyson cars in Britain, but build them in China. It is not only cheaper to manufacture a new car in China, it is also where the market is. “Wherever we make the battery, that’s where we will make the car,” Dyson said. “We see a very large market for this car in the Far East … We want to be near where our markets are and I believe the Far East has reacted [to electric] more quickly than the UK or Europe.” Nieuwenhuis noted that China is by far the biggest market in the world for EVs; it is also the biggest market for luxury cars. “So that makes sense,” he added. In 2016, 507,000 EVs and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) were sold in China, a 53% increase from 2015, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Chinese car firms accounted for around 90% of these sales. Meanwhile, 222,200 EVs and PHEVs were sold in Europe, a 14% increase year-on-year and 157,130 units were sold in the US, up 36% from the prior year, according to EV Volumes according to industry analysts EV Volumes. The pro-electric Chinese government is pulling out all the stops to improve air quality in the country’s congested cities, with Beijing offering subsidies and other incentives to auto companies. Strong demand plus government support for EV technology is an attractive combination for the auto industry. Dyson insisted the venture will make a profit. But, the right technology and compelling offers of state support still don’t guarantee success. Tesla has benefitted from huge US subsidies dished out to EV buyers. Despite this, the poster child of the EV sector remains loss-making. The source with knowledge of EV production at one carmaker noted: “Tesla hasn’t made a quid yet. Breaking into the auto market is difficult. Tesla has done it, but last year’s figures show it sold 76,000 vehicles with no profit.” Jaguar Land Rover to make only electric or hybrid cars from 2020 Electric cars: everything you need to know Chargers, châteaux and the Channel Tunnel: can you really do a driving holiday in a Tesla?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/29/myanmar-un-ethnic-cleansing-genocide-rohingya","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T04:58:55Z","webTitle":"Myanmar tells UN: 'There is no ethnic cleansing and no genocide' of Rohingya","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/29/myanmar-un-ethnic-cleansing-genocide-rohingya","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/29/myanmar-un-ethnic-cleansing-genocide-rohingya","fields":{"headline":"Myanmar tells UN: 'There is no ethnic cleansing and no genocide' of Rohingya","bodyText":"Myanmar has rejected allegations of systematic atrocities against the Rohingya, telling the United Nations security council that “there is no ethnic cleansing and no genocide in Myanmar”. The denial followed a damning open session on the crisis in which the UN secretary-general António Guterres said the conflict had become “the world’s fastest developing refugee emergency and a humanitarian and human rights nightmare”. More than half a million minority Rohingya Muslims have fled an army campaign in just a few weeks, escaping Myanmar into Bangladesh. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, lambasted the government of Aung San Suu Kyi for the bloodshed. “We cannot be afraid to call the actions of the Burmese authorities what they appear to be: a brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority,” she said. “And it should shame senior Burmese leaders who have sacrificed so much for an open, democratic Burma.” But Myanmar’s national security adviser U Thaung Tun denied the accusations. “I can assure you that the leaders of Myanmar, who have been struggling so long for freedom and human rights, will never espouse policy of genocide or ethnic cleansing and that the government will do everything to prevent it,” he said. He repeated a government line that 50% of Muslim villages in north Rakhine state, the heart of the violence, remain intact. The violence, the latest and most deadly upsurge in years of government oppression and communal hatred between Rohingya and Buddhists in Rakhine, exploded on 25 August when Rohingya insurgents attacked army posts. A ferocious counteroffensive has destroyed more than 200 Muslim villages, which have been shown by satellite imagery to have been burned. Refugees in Bangladesh has recounted horrific stories of rape, mass murder and infanticide. U Thaung Tun said Myanmar was “concerned by reports that thousands of people have crossed into Bangladesh” but said the country needed to “fathom the real reasons for the exodus”, which he blamed on “terrorists”. But Masud Bin Momen, Bangladesh’s representative to the UN, said it was evident why people were escaping. “Any individual among the new arrivals would make it known why this exodus is continuing. They all narrate use of rape as a weapon to scare families to leave,” he said. “Available reports suggest that villages after villages have been burnt; people have been looted and abused in the Rakhine state. These atrocities attest that the Myanmar government is using arson to depopulate northern Rakhine and take over ownership of lands.” Myanmar has blocked aid access to the region for United Nations humanitarian agencies, preventing civilians in the conflict zone from receiving food, water and medicine. Meanwhile, aid workers in Bangladesh warn of a humanitarian catastrophe for hundreds of thousands of refugees kept in muddy camps over the border. The BBC reported on Friday that the head of the UN in Myanmar had been accused of mishandling the long-standing issue by prioritising development in impoverished Rakhine over pushing for Rohingya rights. It cited Caroline Vandenabeele, former head of office for UN resident coordinator Renata Lok-Dessallien, who said raising the Rohingya problem had negative consequences for UN staff. “An atmosphere was created that talking about these issues was simply not on,” she was quoted as saying. The UN in Myanmar said it strongly disagreed “with the accusations that the resident co-ordinator ‘prevented’ internal discussions”.

In what experts are calling the longest maritime migration ever recorded, an estimated one million creatures – including crustaceans, sea slugs and sea worms – made the 4,800-mile (7,725km) journey on a flotilla of tsunami debris. “This has turned out to be one of the biggest unplanned natural experiments in marine biology – perhaps in history,” said John Chapman, an expert at Oregon State University who co-authored a study of the creatures published this week in the journal Science. The towering tsunami, triggered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, generated five million tonnes of debris from the three prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima. About 70% sank quickly to the ocean floor, according to experts, but countless buoys, docks, boats and other items with buoyancy were swept out to sea. Between June 2012 and February this year 289 Japanese species attached to 600 pieces of debris washed up on beaches in the states of Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska and Hawaii, as well as in the Canadian province of British Columbia, according to the study. Some of the creatures – about two-thirds of which had never been seen on the US west coast – reproduced as they drifted eastward. “The diversity was somewhat jaw-dropping,” said James Carlton, a marine sciences professor at Williams College, in Williamstown, Massachusetts. “Molluscs, sea anemones, corals, crabs, just a wide variety of species, really a cross-section of Japanese fauna.” Although the rate of new arrivals has slowed, researchers were still discovering colonised tsunami wreckage on west coast beaches when their study ended earlier this year. Only last year – five years after the disaster – a Japanese boat arrived in Oregon with 20 fish native to the western Pacific inside. Some of the fish can be viewed at an aquarium in the state, Carlton said. The tsunami flotilla is a reminder of the threat that millions of tonnes of plastic pose to the global marine environment. Most of the creatures found in the US were attached to buoys, boats, crate and other items made from plastic, fibreglass and other materials that do not decompose. “I didn’t think that most of these coastal organisms could survive at sea for long periods of time,” said Greg Ruiz, a marine biologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, who co-authored the study. “But in many ways they just haven’t had much opportunity in the past. Now, plastic can combine with tsunami and storm events to create that opportunity on a large scale.” Experts say it will be several years before they can say if any of the creatures have colonised on the west coast, which might pose a threat to native marine life. The creatures are not the only products of the tsunami to have generated interest on the other side of the Pacific. In April 2012 a couple in Alaska found a football belonging to Misaki Murakami, a Japanese teenager who had lost his home in the disaster. One month later a Harley-Davidson motorcycle lost in the disaster washed up on a Canadian beach 4,000 miles away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/sep/29/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-29-september","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T07:20:29Z","webTitle":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 29 September","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/29/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-29-september","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/29/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-29-september","fields":{"headline":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 29 September","bodyText":"I’m not writing my usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

The average price of a home in the capital is £471,761, down by 0.6% between July and September compared with the same period last year. It was the first drop since the third quarter of 2009, when the UK economy was dealing with the aftershocks of the near-collapse of the global banking system. London was the only region in the UK where prices fell over the third quarter, making the capital the weakest-performing region for the first time since 2005. On a national level, house prices rose 2.2% to £210,982. East Midlands was the strongest performer, with prices up 5.1% at £177,825. While London remains easily the most expensive place to buy a property in the UK, Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the gap between house price growth in different regions was closing. “House price growth rates across the UK have converged in recent quarters,” he said. “Annual growth rates in the south of England have moderated towards those prevailing in the rest of the country. London has seen a particularly marked slowdown, with prices falling in annual terms for the first time in eight years.” Analysts said that a combination of unsustainable growth in prices, higher stamp duty on second homes – which has affected the London market more than any other region – and Brexit fears, were all weighing on prices in London. Weakness that began with London’s most expensive homes in central London appears to be rippling through to the capital’s outer boroughs, taking prices towards what analysts said were more realistic levels. “The capital’s gravity-defying, double-digit rates of annual price growth were always going to be unsustainable,” said Nicholas Finn, the executive director of London-based Garrington Property Finders. “The softening of prices was initially led by the capital’s prime market, which was knocked sideways both by Brexit and in the wake of the introduction of higher rates of stamp duty for high-value homes. But it is now spreading from the central boroughs – which saw prices rise fastest during the boom – to other areas where the growth came later.” Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said people selling homes in the capital were having to price their properties more realistically to close deals. “[The Nationwide report] shows the north-south divide in reverse and confirms what we have been seeing on the ground – that the London market is struggling for mainly affordability reasons and it is only those sellers who recognise the changed market conditions that are doing deals,” he said. Nationwide’s Gardner said that in the UK overall, house prices were being propped up by low mortgage rates, high employment and a shortage of properties on the market, but added that pressure on household incomes was starting to weigh on confidence. In recent weeks, Bank of England policymakers have signalled that they were nearing the point of raising interest rates for the first the time in more than a decade. Rates are at an all-time low of 0.25%, and economists believe the monetary policy committee could vote for an increase to 0.5% as early as November. Gardner said a small rise in rates would not put excessive pressure on homeowners, partly because a smaller proportion of people were on variable rate mortgages that would be most affected by a rise in interest rates. “Providing the economy does not weaken further, the impact of a small rise in interest rates on UK households is likely to be modest. This is partly because the proportion of borrowers directly impacted will be smaller than in the past,” he said. “In recent years, the vast majority of new mortgages have been extended on fixed interest rates. The share of outstanding mortgages on variable interest rates has fallen to its lowest level on record, at about 40%, down from a peak of 70% in 2001.” In September, UK house prices edged up 0.2%, after a 0.1% dip in August. On an annual basis, prices were up 2% compared with September last year. EY Item Club said UK house price growth was likely to slow to 2.5% this year, from 4.5% in 2016 on Nationwide’s measure. “The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain weak over the coming months with consumers’ purchasing power continuing to be squeezed by inflation running higher than earnings growth,” said Howard Archer, chief economist at the forecasting group. “Additionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by fragile consumer confidence and limited willingness to engage in major transactions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/04/pragmatic-syrian-team-also-have-the-firepower-to-upset-socceroos","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T17:00:05Z","webTitle":"Pragmatic Syrian team also have the attacking threat to upset Socceroos | John Duerden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/04/pragmatic-syrian-team-also-have-the-firepower-to-upset-socceroos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/04/pragmatic-syrian-team-also-have-the-firepower-to-upset-socceroos","fields":{"headline":"Pragmatic Syrian team also have the attacking threat to upset Socceroos","bodyText":"Whether the flight of the Qasioun Eagles is indeed a romantic rise or not quite the fairytale it has sometimes been painted, Ange Postecoglou would be well advised not to get too wrapped up in any distracting side-stories as his Socceroos prepare to meet Syria twice in a week for a place in a final qualifying playoff. The road to the World Cup in Russia is a long one; at the start of the journey, few, if any, gave Syria a chance of making it all the way. They came through the second round of qualification behind Japan but they were not expected to come close to finishing in the top two automatic places. The odds were even longer given Syria’s home matches took place in Malaysia, due to the civil war raging back in their home country. Just a few hundred fans usually make it to the Hang Jebat Stadium, a few kilometres outside the city of Malacca. Formerly colonised by the Portuguese, Dutch and British, the place was an important port on the old spice route but not much of a football centre. The atmosphere in an empty arena with its running track and bumpy pitch is nothing to write back to Damascus about. Yet results in southeast Asia have been decent enough and Ayman Hakeem’s team have improved game on game. Just two goals were scored in the first seven games. In the final three, the Syrians netted seven. Part of this was down to the need for results. The old method of sitting back and looking to nick a goal changed because it had to. And then there was the return of players who had earlier refused to represent a team closely linked to Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad and his regime. With the final stretch on the road to Russia coming into view, talented forwards Firas Al Khatib and Omar Al Soma joined the cause. Al Khatib refused to be drawn on why he had come back to the fold. “What happened is very complicated but I can’t talk more about these things,” he said. “Better for me, better for my country, better for my family, better for everybody if I not talk about that.” On the pitch it means that with Omar Khribin, scorer of a hat-trick earlier this week as Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal thrashed Persepolis of Iran 4-0 in the Asian Champions League tie, Syria have one of the most feared forward lines in Asia. There is power, pace and poise in the penalty area. Late victories over Qatar and Uzbekistan followed before their final game with Iran in Tehran. Carlos Quieroz’s men had not conceded a single goal in nine previous games in qualification. Syria scored twice against them, the last-minute goal from Al-Soma as coolly-taken as it was crucial. Earlier in the campaign, accusations of time wasting had plagued Syria. When they played South Korea in Malaysia last September, attempts to run down the clock by goalkeeper Ibrahim Alma prompted uproar – the No1 has talent in terms of stopping shots but acting it up to disrupt opponents’ rhythm is also a speciality. Against the infuriated Koreans, he went down injured no less than seven times. The cumulative time he spent writhing around on the floor clutching various body parts was clocked at 12 minutes and 46 seconds. The longest delay lasted almost three minutes, but Australian referee Chris Beath added around eight. No surprise then that Korean captain Ki Sung-yueng called the game an embarrassment to Asian football. Then coach Uli Stielike called upon the Asian Football Confederation to do more to stop “anti-football” and support those teams that want to play the game. Some of this was all down to frustration at letting two points slip unexpectedly, but there was genuine contempt for how the Syrians acted that evening – not only as the game approached it closing stages but almost from the outset. Ahead of the return match in Seoul in March, the message from the hosts was to score as quickly as possible to nip any grass-rolling in the bud. That is exactly what happened as Hong Jeong-ho netted in the fourth minute. Remarkably, Alma’s hands, head and all the rest went through the rest of the game unharmed. Such tactics came against the stronger teams in the pool, particularly in the earlier games in Group A. Only time will tell if the Socceroos will be forced to deal with the same, but they should be wary. If Postecoglou is perceived as an idealist, Syria are a pragmatic team that will do whatever it takes to win and to stop the opposition from playing. Of greater concern, though, is that they are increasingly a team with the attacking firepower to take advantage of any slip-ups."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/29/500-asylum-seekers-face-deportation-for-missing-protection-deadline","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T02:10:19Z","webTitle":"500 asylum seekers face deportation for missing protection deadline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/29/500-asylum-seekers-face-deportation-for-missing-protection-deadline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/29/500-asylum-seekers-face-deportation-for-missing-protection-deadline","fields":{"headline":"500 asylum seekers face deportation for missing protection deadline","bodyText":"Up to 500 asylum seekers, including families with young children, have not made a formal application for protection, just a day out from a government deadline that could see them deported from the country. In May, the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, gave nearly 7,000 asylum seekers living in the Australian community a deadline of 1 October to apply for protection or be barred from ever applying. He described them as “fake refugees” and said they were bleeding Australian taxpayers of millions of dollars in welfare payments each year. Many of the asylum seekers had been living in Australia for several years, but had been barred from applying for protection by the minister until just months before the deadline was announced. Several thousand were already on waiting lists with legal advocacy services to assist with their applications. The minister’s announcement sparked furious activity within refugee legal services, aided by “an army of lawyers” who offered pro-bono services, philanthropic donations and community support, Tanya Jackson-Vaughan from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in Sydney, told the Guardian. “We’ve gone from providing about 25 free legal sessions a week to about 125. That’s because we have been working seven days a week, nights, and we had an outpouring of pro-bono support from some of the top-tier law firms in Sydney. “We’re doing this on the smell of any oily rag, we hope that we’ve managed to assist most people.” With a day before the deadline, about 500 asylum seekers across the country have not lodged protection applications, most of those in Victoria and NSW. Those who have not lodged, legal service providers say, are some of the most vulnerable asylum seekers, including people suffering acute mental health issues, those with a history of torture and trauma, and others who, because of language difficulties or other barriers, do not understand the legal process for formally applying for protection. About half of those who have not applied are understood to be families with young children, including Rohingya families who fled Myanmar. “People are expected to recall what’s happened to them, and to provide a coherent, chronological protection claim, but many of those we’ve seen coming into our office the past month or two, these are some of the most vulnerable. We’ve had Rohingya families with little kids, people who have really suffered and have struggled to survive in the Australian community because of their vulnerabilities,” Jackson-Vaughan said. “Our fear is that people with genuine claims, but who have a lack of awareness what this deadline means, won’t be lodging an application, because they didn’t realise that was required of them.” The executive director of Refugee Legal, David Manne said the deadline was “arbitrary and unfair”. “Thousands of people were left in legal limbo for years without being allowed to apply for protection, desperately wanting to but not being allowed to, and then sent an arbitrary deadline of 1 October or risk of being deported to danger without even having their claim heard.” Manne said his organisation had massively scaled up its legal assistance, supported too by philanthropic donations, hundreds of volunteers and pro bono legal support. But cases were still coming. “Many of the people we are talking about have fled from brutality, have been deeply traumatised and then suffered a second wave of suffering in limbo in Australia. One of the central reasons that some people are coming to us just before the deadline is that they are confused and frightened. And they are still coming. We will be helping anyone that needs it right up until midnight on 30 September.” Both Refugee Legal and Refugee Advice and Casework Service say they will remain open, over public holidays and weekends, to assist last-minute applicants. Any move by the government to deport an asylum seeker without fully assessing their claim for protection would almost certainly be met by legal challenge. All of the asylum seekers subject to the 1 October deadline raised a prima facie protection claim when first interviewed upon arrival in Australia and so were “screened in” and allowed to live in the country. An immigration department spokesperson said there was limited time for those who remained to apply either online or by mail for a Temporary Protection Visa or Safe Haven Enterprise Visa. “Failure to lodge a TPV or SHEV application will be taken as an indication that an IMA (illegal maritime arrival) no longer intends to seek protection in Australia,” the department said. “IMAs who do not apply and who do not make arrangements to leave Australia may be detained and removed from Australia.” Since May, refugees lawyers and advocates have protested against the arbitrary and “unreasonably tight” deadline, but the government is concerned some of the cohort have lived in the community for several years without a deep analysis of their backgrounds. The 7,000 asylum seekers who had not applied for protection when the deadline was announced are part of the so-called “legacy caseload” of about 30,000 asylum seekers who arrived by sea between late 2012 and early 2014. Roughly 23,000 of that cohort had already applied for protection when the deadline was announced. Thousands are still waiting for their applications to be assessed, a process that could take years longer still."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/30/ronald-koeman-everton-burnley","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T21:29:44Z","webTitle":"Ronald Koeman can only wish Everton were in as good a shape as Burnley | Paul Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/30/ronald-koeman-everton-burnley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/30/ronald-koeman-everton-burnley","fields":{"headline":"Ronald Koeman can only wish Everton were in as good a shape as Burnley","bodyText":"Ronald Koeman told reporters in midweek that he was not prioritising either of his club’s forthcoming fixtures in the Europa League and the Premier League; he expected to win both of them. Apollon Limassol having dealt a crushing blow to that idea at a deathly quiet Goodison Park on Thursday, the Everton manager now finds himself and his players under a certain amount of pressure to perform against Burnley on Sunday afternoon. Burnley, as their stand-in captain Ben Mee puts it, are playing well, feeling confident and getting results – in other words, everything Everton are not doing. Koeman’s side now sit at the foot of their Europa League group with a single point, after making the worst start in the competition by any English team. Everton did escape the Premier League bottom three a week ago but only after being outplayed for much of the game by Bournemouth, who were eventually dispatched by two late goals from a substitute who was told by Koeman last season that he would need to find a new club if he wanted to continue playing football. There is no need to go over the by now well-known Oumar Niasse story again but suffice to say that, if Koeman does not give his Senegalese saviour a game against Burnley, it would not only be an act of almost indecent ingratitude but might well turn low-level grumbling and dissatisfaction into open revolt. Everton thought they were getting a smart operator when they recruited Koeman from Southampton, yet the manager has spent the last couple of weeks facing more criticism over his selection policy than his counterpart at Anfield, and that is saying something. Niasse has three goals from two appearances as a substitute and might well have continued his scoring run to make life easier against Apollon, yet due to Koeman still believing he had no future at the club as late as the beginning of September, he was not given a place when the Europa League squad was registered. Ordinarily Everton would expect to beat Burnley at home, though ordinarily Sean Dyche’s side would not be sitting above them in the table. And Burnley travel to Merseyside comfortable in the knowledge that they took a point from Anfield last month to add to the one they brought home from Wembley when they played Spurs. While the real stand-out scoreline of their season to date was the sensational win at Chelsea on the opening day, which might now be put down to an aberration for their hosts – were the teams to meet again this week, it seems unlikely Burnley would be three goals to the good by half-time – the points remain in the bag. “For us to have nine points on the board at this stage is fantastic,” Mee says. “We were close to a lot of the big teams last season but kept getting narrowly beaten. We seem to have learned from that now and this season we might be able to show people how good we are. We are certainly confident we can go to Everton and give them a game because our away form has been particularly good. “It’s another tough test, because they have some good players even if they haven’t been getting the results they would like. They can still punish us. We are well aware of that but, if we can be at the top of our game, we have a chance. When you have picked up a few points and good results it builds up confidence.” Koeman was saying the same thing not a week ago yet his expected confidence boost against the side that finished third in the Cypriot league last season failed to materialise. As he was pinning his hopes on three home wins to help ensure qualification for the knockout stage of the Europa League, the Everton manager’s strategy for the season is now in tatters. As supporters have been pointing out on phone-ins and Twitter for weeks, however, strategy does not appear to be a Koeman strong point. He was lauded at the start of the summer transfer window for moving swiftly to capture transfer targets such as Jordan Pickford and Michael Keane – the centre-half will miss the visit of Mee and his old club today through injury – though maintained all along that his main aim was to bring in a striker‑cum‑target man to replace Romelu Lukaku. That did not happen. Everton appear to have been led to believe Olivier Giroud might join them from Arsenal and, though that hope was dashed relatively early in the transfer window, no back-up plan was put into operation, not even to the extent of registering Niasse with Uefa. Koeman’s cunning plan to rejuvenate Wayne Rooney by bringing him back to his boyhood club has not been a conspicuous success, either on or off the field, and instead of playing Gylfi Sigurdsson in the hole behind the main striker as everyone expected, the Iceland forward has found himself pushed out wide, where the record signing has been less effective. People are beginning to ask whether Koeman knows what he is doing, in the same way that Liverpool supporters were up in arms about Jürgen Klopp following the draws against Burnley and Sevilla. The manager was frank enough after the narrow squeak against Bournemouth to admit he had been worried about losing his job but clearly thought a couple of home wins would restore confidence. That theory has yet to be proved and, if Everton end up taking lessons in confidence from Burnley, it might be a while before Koeman and his players can predict where their next back-to-back wins might come from."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/29/san-juan-mayor-plea-donald-trump-puerto-rico","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T22:16:34Z","webTitle":"San Juan mayor's harrowing plea: 'Mr Trump, I am begging.

We are dying here'","bodyText":"Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, spoke on Friday afternoon at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum. Like the rest of the US territory, the capital of Puerto Rico was hit hard this month by two hurricanes, Jose and Maria. The island is now struggling to repair damage, restore basic services and maximise the impact of a federal aid effort which Donald Trump and his administration have trumpeted but which many critics of the president have called slow and politically motivated. On Friday, Trump continued to insist that Puerto Rican leaders had praised his efforts and said logistical difficulties were slowing the delivery of aid. “This is an island,” he said, “surrounded by water. Big water, ocean water.” As she spoke to reporters, Cruz became emotional. This is a transcript of her remarks: ‘We are dying here. We are in trouble’ “We are dying here. And I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation in the world cannot figure out the logistics for a small island of 100 miles by 35 miles. So, mayday, we are in trouble. “Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Administration] asks for documentation, I think we’ve given them enough documentation.” “They had the gall this morning – look at this [gestures to two large binders filled with paper] – they had the gall this morning of asking me: ‘What are your priorities, mayor?’ “Well, where have you been? “And I have been very respectful of the Fema employees. I have been patient but we have no time for patience any more. “So, I am asking the president of the United States to make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives. “They were up the task in Africa when Ebola came over. They were up to the task in Haiti [after the earthquake of 2010]. As they should be. Because when it comes to saving lives we are all part of one community of shared values. “I will do what I never thought I was going to do: I am begging. I am begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying. And you are killing us with the inefficiency and bureaucracy. “We will make it with or without you because what stands behind me is all due to the generosity of other people. “Again, this is what we got last night: four pallets of water, three pallets of meals and 12 pallets of infant food. Which, I gave them to Comerío, where people are drinking out of a creek. “So I am done being polite. I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell because my people’s lives are at stake. And we are but one nation. We may be small, but we are huge in dignity and zealous for life. “So I’m asking members of the press to send a mayday call all over the world. We are dying here. And if we don’t stop and if we don’t get the food and the water into people’s hands, what we we are going to see is something close to a genocide. “So, Mr Trump, I am begging you to take charge and save lives. After all, that is one of the founding principles of the United States of North America. If not, the world will see how we are treated not as second-class citizens but as animals that can be disposed of. Enough is enough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/01/barnardos-black-history-victorian-archive-children-photos-testimonials","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T23:05:01Z","webTitle":"Barnardo’s black history in the words and pictures of long-forgotten children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/barnardos-black-history-victorian-archive-children-photos-testimonials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/01/barnardos-black-history-victorian-archive-children-photos-testimonials","fields":{"headline":"Barnardo’s black history in the words and pictures of long-forgotten children","bodyText":"A hidden store of remarkable personal testimonies, told by a selection of black children and teenagers given shelter by the Barnardo’s organisation up to 120 years ago, has been shared with the Observer this weekend, along with a series of original admission photographs. These unseen stories, released by the charity to mark the start of Black History Month, stand out not just because of their moving content, but because of the valuable glimpses they offer of some forgotten corners of history. One “Dr Barnado’s boy”, as they were called, recalls seeing the head of General Gordon carried aloft by Arab soldiers during his childhood in Sudan. The 16-year-old, Jaesell Macalonzie, had watched his family massacred by Mahdi troops at the siege of Khartoum. Although wounded, he survived to be sold as a slave, and then freed, before sailing on to England. Other children talked of dramatic rescues at sea, or of desperate times in Britain, living on the edge of survival in brothels or street gangs. These official “admission statements” were given to staff at Barnardo’s by young people as they were offered a home. Their words represent a wave of human suffering that brought many vulnerable youths to British ports, or later set orphans running from poverty back on track, after an early life in which they had been passed about like unwanted property. “Barnardo’s started its work in 1866, 60 years after the end of the slave trade, and it was the first national children’s charity in England to take in vulnerable black and mixed-heritage children,” said Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardo’s. “Our goal then was never to turn away a child that needed us, and that remains true today.” The work of Thomas Barnardo began in London’s impoverished East End, where he founded a “ragged school” to provide basic education for neighbourhood children. One evening a boy called Jim Jarvis showed him destitute children sleeping on roofs and in gutters nearby. Barnardo then set out to offer a roof to as many of them as possible. In 1870, the charity opened a home for boys in Stepney Causeway. Its door bore the sign “No Destitute Child Ever Refused Admission”, following the death of an 11-year-old boy called John Somers, just two days after he had been turned away because the shelter was full. A “Girls’ Village Home” was also founded in Barkingside. Barnardo’s stopped running homes for orphans more than 30 years ago, but it still supports the lives of hundreds of thousands of young carers, care leavers, foster carers and adoptive parents across Britain with training and parenting classes. EDWARD ALLEN Born in the West Indies and admitted to Barnardo’s in December 1887, aged 15. Edward ran away from home and joined a ship which foundered near the Western Islands, now known as the Azores. The ship’s crew were saved by a passing steamer, which took them to São Miguel, the largest island in the archipelago. The British Consul provided board and lodging there and, after four months, was able to get Edward on a ship to London, where he became destitute and was taken in by Barnardo’s. He returned to the West Indies the following year. JAESELL MACALONZIE Born in Somalia and admitted in November 1892. Jaesell was taken to the Liverpool Barnardo’s home after he was found in the streets with a shoeshine box, but no idea what to do with it. Once he was in the home, his story spilled out: “My father was a soldier under General Gordon. At the fall of Khartoum, the Mahdi’s troops killed my father, mother, sister and younger brother. I was stabbed in the neck and left for dead. A Sudanese soldier disguised me as an Arab and removed me to Dhurman. I remained there for seven months, when I was seized by Arabs and sold as a slave. After having been so disposed of two or three times, I eventually reached Alexandria, whereupon my owner gave me my liberty.” ELIZABETH PETERS Born in 1872 and admitted to Barnardo’s aged nine. Elizabeth grew up in Liverpool, one of four sisters, and was employed for a short time as a child dancer. The family moved to London, where their father abandoned them to take up a position as cook on a ship bound for Sydney. He left no money for his children and, soon after he left, the youngest sister died. Despite the mother having a job as a cleaner, the family ended up in a workhouse, although the children still went to school. When Elizabeth and her sisters came to Barnardo’s, she was described as “remarkably intelligent”. The report added: “She reads fluently and seems eager to learn.” She went into domestic service in 1887. MARIE ROBERTS Born in 1895 in Stamford Hill, north-east London. Her mother had a relationship with a lodger, who deserted her soon after the birth of Marie. When Marie was 10, a Barnardo’s application was made by a relative to take her in, as her mother was in Tottenham hospital, where doctors described her as suffering from “sheer starvation”. When the Barnardo’s agreement was taken to the mother, she was too exhausted to sign it, and it had to be approved by her half-sister. Her mother died shortly after. Marie went into domestic service in 1914. LETITIA FRAZER Born in 1894 in Cardiff, she was admitted in March 1904, aged 10. An application was made on Letitia’s behalf as she was found to be in “circumstances of extreme moral danger”. Her mother was destitute so, aged three, Letitia was placed for adoption with a couple who were later convicted of keeping a disorderly house. Letitia was returned to her mother, who was “living an immoral life by consorting with other men”. More concerning was the discovery that a young black girl who had been living with Letitia was keeping a brothel. Letitia ran errands for her and sometimes visited the brothel. AUGUSTUS WILLIAMS Born in Portland, Jamaica, in 1871, he was admitted in January 1890. Augustus lived with his mother who worked as a dressmaker following the death of his father in Kingston. In August 1889 she too died of fever and Augustus made his way from St Lucia to London, arriving in December 1889. Barnardo’s sheltered the destitute youth. In a reply to a letter from the charity, Horatio Vaz, clerk to Kingston’s circuit court with whom the boy had once lived, wrote: “I am glad to say he is well known to me. I found him to be a good and honest boy. I suppose, wishing to see a little of the world, he left his home.” Augustus returned to sea in late 1891, but his fate is unknown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/30/rats-overcrowding-slum-landlords-london-housing-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T19:40:25Z","webTitle":"Rats, roaches and overcrowding: the battle against slum landlords","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/30/rats-overcrowding-slum-landlords-london-housing-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/30/rats-overcrowding-slum-landlords-london-housing-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Rats, roaches and overcrowding: the battle against slum landlords","bodyText":"Mohammad Ayaz’s sunken, red-ringed eyes tell a desperate story of night shifts, low pay and poor housing. He hovers nervously outside the room he shares with his wife as police and housing officers check how many others are living in the small terraced house in east London. “You’ve done nothing wrong,” says Paul Oatt, a housing officer with Newham council. “Landlords who rent a house here have to have a licence, like you have to have a driving licence.” Ayaz earns £8 an hour working at a takeaway pizza shop. “We pay £100 a week for our room,” he says timidly. “I didn’t think London would be like this.” It soon becomes clear why he has not followed the officers into the kitchen when a rat the size of a pint glass bursts from a pile of boxes and darts into a food cupboard. “We buy takeaways – we can’t cook in there,” Ayaz says, fiddling with his branded work shirt. This rodent-infested, overcrowded house in deprived Little Ilford on Newham’s eastern border earns Ayaz’s landlord between £1,500 and £2,500 a month. This is the frontline in the council’s street-by-street skirmishes with slum landlords. And it is a war that Newham’s housing officers are starting to win, although they accept there is still much to do. “Licensing leads us to these properties and then we are able to put in the safeguards necessary to protect people – like an automatic fire detection system, fire doors on key rooms, emergency lighting,” says Russell Moffatt, a veteran housing officer now in charge of co-ordinating inspections in the borough. Since this Labour stronghold became the first council to license all landlords in 2013, it has carried out thousands of raids on unlicensed properties and launched 1,217 prosecutions for housing crimes. These account for 70% of all housing prosecutions in London. Newham, which has seen its rental sector balloon from 23% to 46% of the borough’s housing stock since 2006, has also in effect banned 28 of the worst landlords by refusing them licences and recovered more than £3m in council tax. But the scheme’s future is hanging in the balance. Under new rules brought in by the government two years ago, landlord-licensing schemes covering more than 20% of a council’s total area have to be signed off by central government. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, has been sitting on Newham’s renewal application since July. His verdict was supposed to come through three weeks ago but the council is still waiting. Back in Ayaz’s home, it soon becomes clear that problems upstairs are potentially more serious. In a shabby attic room, which has such a low ceiling you have to stoop to get in, two more men are sleeping on mattresses on the floor. They both work night shifts in central London. “There are no working smoke detectors and no fire doors,” says Moffatt. “This is a serious fire hazard. They are totally dependent on someone waking them up, but they don’t know the others.” The single bathroom, which is shared by at least eight tenants, is damp and mouldy. “It’s also about the grinding misery of the place,” says Moffatt, gesturing at the broken tiles and green mould on the wall. A short drive away stands yet another overcrowded Victorian terrace. The landlord, who is collecting about £2,500 a month, has told the council it is being rented to a single family, but once the officers get inside they find at least 12 people, including a child, living in a warren of locked rooms. The back room has no windows and the lean-to has been converted into two tiny cell-like spaces with barely enough room in each for a single bed. Patrick Pinto, a head chef who lives with his wife in the front bedroom, has to fold up their bed to make room for his three-year-old son to play. “We’ve been living here over a year,” he says, pointing to cockroaches on the walls. “I think the landlord knows about them.” Again the attic has been turned into a makeshift bedroom. Again there are no fire doors or functioning smoke detectors. The man living there, Raman Bharbway, an assistant manager, worries about escaping if there is a fire. “I was thinking, ‘if anything happens, what I should do?’ Where I work I saw one 30-metre rope and I thought, ‘OK, I need to buy it’,” he says, chillingly. This is not idle speculation. There are outbreaks of fire in rented homes in Newham every couple of weeks, most of them in the borough’s 10,000 bedsits. “We quite often see fires in houses in multiple occupation but so far all of the people have got out safely,” says Moffatt. “But you only need one instance where people don’t get out and you’ll get very high numbers of fatalities.” Sir Robin Wales, Newham’s Labour mayor, is fearful that the borough’s landlord licensing scheme may be blocked. “We are worried. We don’t understand why the government is dragging its heels,” he says. Newham has good reason to worry. In 2015, the government turned down neighbouring Redbridge’s borough-wide licensing scheme and wrote to town halls warning that the “blanket licensing approach” creates “unnecessary costs for reputable landlords”, which are generally passed on to tenants in higher rents. Wales “absolutely disputes” the government’s logic, claiming the £150 cost of a five-year licence is “just coppers” because Newham landlords are making around £1,500 to £2,500 a month. He warns that slum landlords will be celebrating if the scheme is not renewed in January. “If we don’t get it then, the bad landlords will come back and people will live in disgusting and disgraceful conditions,” he says. Newham’s bid to renew its scheme takes place against a backdrop of a deepening national housing crisis, with a chronic shortage of affordable homes and falling real wages pushing more people into the private rented sector. Earlier this month, Brent housing officers found 35 men living in a three-bedroom house. Every room was piled with bedding except the bathrooms, with one mattress even laid out under a canopy in the back garden. There are 4.5m households renting in the private sector, including an increasing proportion of young people and families with children. This represents 20% of all households in England – double what it was in 1980s and 1990s. Yet 30% of privately rented homes are classed as “non-decent”, a far worse figure than for owner-occupied homes and social housing. Housing was at the top of the agenda at the Labour party conference in Brighton last week. Jeremy Corbyn said in his closing speech that thousands of people “are living in homes unfit for human habitation” and promised a review of social housing policy. He also promised that a Labour government would introduce rent controls: “Rent controls exist in many cities across the world. And I want our cities to have those powers too and tenants to have those protections.” Javid’s decision on licensing will have implications beyond Newham. The handful of other Labour councils with city-wide licensing schemes – such as Liverpool, Waltham Forest, Barking and Dagenham, and Croydon – also face renewal battles. If Newham fails, they fear they will struggle to get approval. Javid’s communities department says it has requested further information from Newham. “Local authorities can introduce selective licensing of private landlords to target serious local problems,” said a spokesman. “The London borough of Newham has submitted its proposal for a licensing scheme for all private landlords in the borough and we are still considering this. We hope to make a decision shortly.” RISE OF THE RENTAL SECTOR Across England, 64% of households own the home in which they live, while 18% of homes are privately rented and 17% are social housing. In London, a smaller proportion of households own their home – only 50% are owner-occupied. The number of households privately renting in England increased by 121% between 1996 and 2016. In 2016, almost half (46%) of 16 to 34-year-old households were privately renting, up from 21% in 1996. Last year, the median monthly rent in England was £650. London had the highest median monthly rent, at £1,452, and the north-east had the lowest median monthly rent, at £475.

I had the pleasure of meeting Dawn with her on-screen husband, Jack (the late Bill Tarmey) at the Corrie set and they were both good humoured and warm, exactly as you’d imagine. Our soaps can be much underrated, yet when done right, they celebrate a slice of British life and people that would otherwise be lost. But the magic can’t happen without the right casting. As Vera, Dawn brilliantly encapsulated a type that was both quintessentially northern and working class – salt of the earth and common as muck with it. And I mean “common as muck” entirely positively, in a way that reclaims the phrase. It was Dawn’s gift for encapsulating this “fag in the gob, tights drying on the radiator” prole warrior spirit that made her such a popular Corrie character, and, since her retirement, a much-missed one. Part of the reason that Vera and Jack endured was because they told the truth, the big dirty secret, about being common as muck – it’s loads of fun. Indeed, it’s beautifully drawn, deceptively nuanced characters such as Vera Duckworth who give the working classes their cultural rocket fuel. RIP, Liz Dawn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/29/trump-tax-plan-benefit-richest-1-percent","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T19:18:54Z","webTitle":"Trump tax plan for 'average Americans' would mainly help richest 1%, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/29/trump-tax-plan-benefit-richest-1-percent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/29/trump-tax-plan-benefit-richest-1-percent","fields":{"headline":"Trump tax plan for 'average Americans' would mainly help richest 1%, study finds","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s “once-in-a-lifetime” plan to cut taxes for “average Americans” would mainly benefit the richest 1% and deliver only modest cuts for most US households, according to an independent analysis released on Friday. Trump announced a radical overhaul of the US tax system on Wednesday, claiming the plan would bring relief to middle-class households. But according to a study released by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, the average cut to most households would be just $1,700 by 2027 – and one in four households would actually pay more tax. Households making more than about $900,000 a year, however, would see their taxes drop by more than $200,000 on average. While many of the tax plan’s details have yet to be specified, Trump did propose stopping taxpayers from claiming itemized deductions on their tax returns. If passed, that change would mean taxpayers can no longer deduct state and local property tax deductions from income. The shift would reduce the tax savings of many middle-class households and mean the majority of households making between $150,000 and $300,000 would receive a tax increase, according to the report. “Taxpayer groups in the bottom 95% of the income distribution would see modest tax cuts, averaging 1.2% of after-tax income or less. The benefit would be largest for taxpayers in the top 1% (those making more than $730,000), who would see their after-tax income increase 8.5%,” the report calculates. Trump himself would be a big beneficiary of the plan, despite his claims that the proposals had “very little benefit for people of wealth”. The plan will reduce the tax paid by so-called “pass-through” businesses to 25%. Currently profits from those businesses are taxed at the same rate as the business owner’s personal tax rate, the top rate being close to 40%. Trump owns about 500 such entities. The plan would also scrap estate taxes, meaning he could pass on his fortune to his family without loss."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/01/jeremy-corbyn-nationalisation-plans-voters-tired-free-markets","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T06:54:02Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn’s nationalisation plans are music to ears of public","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/01/jeremy-corbyn-nationalisation-plans-voters-tired-free-markets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/01/jeremy-corbyn-nationalisation-plans-voters-tired-free-markets","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn’s nationalisation plans are music to ears of public","bodyText":"Few opinion polls that claim to detect a shift in public attitudes merit the ubiquitous label “landmark research”, but here’s one that does. The Legatum Institute, a thinktank, and Populus have found levels of support for nationalising large parts of the economy that would have been hard to believe a few years ago. The big four industries in the sights of Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell should all return to public ownership, according to a strong majority of respondents. Water topped the poll (83%), followed by electricity (77%), gas (77%) and the railways (76%). Nationalisation fever also appears to be infectious. Royal Bank of Scotland, you might assume, is not a powerful advert for the delights of state ownership but the country is apparently evenly split on whether all banks should be nationalised. There was even 27% support for nationalising airlines, as if the budget airline revolution never happened. Dig deeper into the figures and you will see a remarkable convergence of opinion across age groups for most sectors. This is not a generational phenomenon. Some 78% of 55-64-year-olds, who are old enough to remember the days of British Rail (unloved at the time), support public ownership of train companies. When the winds have shifted this far, it’s no wonder that prime minister Theresa May felt the need last week to rally to the defence of free markets as the “only sustainable means of raising the living standards of everyone in a country”. She can keep singing the same line, but the public seems to want to try something different. The Legatum/Populus research did not seek to explain why public opinion is currently so pro-nationalisation, but a few reasons are easy to guess. First, almost a decade after the financial crisis, real incomes in the UK are still being squeezed, so an appeal to the power of capitalism to improve living standards feels limp. The market has not delivered lower housing costs for generation rent, for example. Second, support for nationalisation seems to go hand-in-hand with a general collapse in trust in business. This statement gained the strongest support in another part of the polling: the pay of senior executives should be capped. Executives have brought that on themselves. Most of the working population never earn a bonus but quoted companies run “remuneration” schemes that make it almost impossible for a top executive not to get one. Sir Richard Lambert, former editor of the Financial Times and former director general of the CBI, said in 2010 that “it is difficult to persuade the public that profits are no more than the necessary lifeblood of a successful business if they see a small cohort at the top reaping such large rewards”. His speech made a splash at the time but seems to have had zero impact on executive pay. Third, the utilities and the train companies are in the firing line because the supposed benefits of privatisation seem so feeble. Water companies do not compete with each other and, for those that have been taken private, opaque financial structures make it impossible for outsiders to follow the fancy financial engineering and sums extracted by the owners. The energy companies regard a 5% profit margin as a birthright whereas supermarkets, which compete intensely, survive on half that level. And, while privatisation may have produced a surge in journeys by rail, more demand has not led to lower prices. The extraordinary part of this pro-nationalisation shift, however, is that Corbyn and McDonnell have barely bothered to explain how they would pay for the assets, or how they would run them better. If a company were contemplating a series of takeovers worth £200bn-plus, the shareholders would want to know the details. The prime minister, if she’s serious about defending capitalism, might want to push that argument. She could also try rewriting the regulatory system for the utilities to ensure consumers get a better deal. You’d probably start with water – it’s hard to mess up and current owners enjoy a life of almost risk-free luxury. Good news for generation rent For the first time in eight years, house prices are falling in London. The annual decline, according to the Nationwide, is modest at 0.6% and not being replicated elsewhere in the country. But where the capital leads, the rest of Britain tends to follow and with the Bank of England signalling an increase in interest rates in November, a further easing of property prices looks inevitable. Such is the enduring love affair of Brits with bricks and mortar, this will no doubt be seen as national tragedy. It isn’t. For years, house prices have been supported artificially by ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. The upshot has been that those who own property have been the lucky and undeserved beneficiaries of a boom in asset prices, while those who don’t own property have seen their dream of getting their home disappear further and further into the distance. Booms sometimes end when interest rates go up sharply, as was the case in the late 1980s, when official borrowing costs doubled to 15% and unemployment hit 3 million. On other occasions, as now, they peter out when house prices become unaffordable to new buyers even when mortgage rates and the jobless rate are low. This is the latter sort of market. In London, the house-price-to-earnings ratio for a first-time buyer – even assuming they can find the deposit – is running at around 10, an absurdly high multiple. You don’t need to be a financial genius to see why the upward trend in home ownership stretching back a century has gone into reverse. Rising house prices have been good for the buy-to-let landlords of the baby boomer generation: they are terrible for the millennials of generation rent. There are only two ways in which property can become more affordable: incomes have to rise or prices have to fall. There is precious little sign that wage inflation is picking up, so that means anyone seeking to sell a house in London has to be more realistic about the asking price. That, unambiguously, is a good thing. Uber boss faces hot seat The streets of London are paved with gold for Uber, so new boss Dara Khosrowshahi will be keen to get the app’s licence to operate in the city back with a minimum of fuss. Khosrowshahi has some explaining to do at this week’s sit-down with Transport for London boss Mike Brown, if he is to pull it off. The bare minimum Khosrowshahi should offer is a commitment to tackle TfL’s list of concerns head on. This could include detailed plans for more thorough background checks on drivers and a system for the timely reporting of passengers’ allegations of crime. But TfL will have had unspoken concerns about Uber that weren’t included in its official statement, not least drivers’ minimal employment rights and Uber’s tax minimisation methods. If Uber’s cars are to stay on the streets of London for good, Khosrowshahi should come bearing gifts designed to ensure that TfL will have no reason in the near future to take further punitive action that will reopen old wounds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/30/canada-first-nations-orthodontics-teenager","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T08:00:28Z","webTitle":"Canada has spent $110,000 to avoid paying $6,000 for indigenous teen's orthodontics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/30/canada-first-nations-orthodontics-teenager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/30/canada-first-nations-orthodontics-teenager","fields":{"headline":"Canada has spent $110,000 to avoid paying $6,000 for indigenous teen's orthodontics","bodyText":"Days after Justin Trudeau told the United Nations that his government was working hard to improve the quality of life for indigenous peoples in Canada, it has emerged that his government spent more than C$110,000 ($88,000) in legal fees to avoid spending C$6,000 on orthodontics for a First Nations teenager suffering from chronic pain. The figures, released through the Access to Information Act, were made public by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on Friday. They relate to a continuing court battle that has pitted the federal government against Josey Willier, a teenager from Sucker Creek First Nation, who for two years complained of chronic headaches and jaw pain stemming from an impacted tooth and a severe overbite. In 2014, two orthodontists warned that without braces, Willier would eventually need invasive jaw surgery. One noted that Willier’s condition would probably worsen and could leave her with difficulties in eating and speaking. For help in paying the C$6,000 treatment, the family turned to a benefit program run by the federal government – which covers the cost of health services, basic dental care and orthodontic treatment when medically necessary for First Nations people living on reserves. The family’s request was denied by the Health Canada, who said her condition was not serious enough to warrant braces. Three appeals of the department’s decision proved unsuccessful. With the help of a lawyer working pro bono, the family took their case to the country’s federal court, where a judge determined that the denial of payment was “reasonable”. During a span of 16 months, the federal government spent at least C$110,336.51 in legal fees to fight the request for payment. The legal costs are likely to rise, as the family filed an appeal of the federal court decision in June, arguing that it failed to take into account the chronic pain suffered by Willier as well as the eventual need for surgery. “I think it’s atrocious,” Cindy Blackstock, whose First Nations Child and Family Caring Society intervened in the case, told the CBC. “As a taxpayer, I’m absolutely floored that Canada would spend $110,000 defending [against] a $6,000 investment to help a child. They could have used that money to buy 18 children in medical need the orthodontic services they needed.” In a statement to the Guardian, Health Canada pointed to the process used to assess the claim. “In this case, the issue is not about the monetary value or affordability of the claim,” it said. “Like all requests for coverage of orthodontic treatment, this case was reviewed by a licensed orthodontist when it was initially submitted for approval, and subsequently reviewed by three other licensed orthodontists during the appeals process, all of whom agreed with the initial assessment. The evidence did not support the request for coverage.” The department said its plan covering First Nations children was more generous than the private plans held by most Canadians. Dental care – save for surgical-dental interventions and a few prevention programs aimed at children – is not included in Canada’s universal healthcare and instead is often funded through private insurance or out of pocket. A 2014 report noted that Canada provides one of the lowest proportions of public funds towards dental care among OECD countries, contributing 6%, compared with 7.9% in the US and 79% in Finland. News of the government’s legal costs was revealed a little over a week after Trudeau used his speech at the UN general assembly to highlight the plight of Canada’s indigenous peoples. For many, Canada’s legacy of colonial relationships had been one of “humiliation, neglect and abuse”, he said. Trudeau promised his government would do better. “We have been working hard … to correct past injustices and bring about a better quality of life for indigenous peoples in Canada,” he said. “Though this path is uncharted, I am confident that we will reach a place of reconciliation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
