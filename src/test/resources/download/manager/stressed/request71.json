Here's one thing we can do","bodyText":"So much news in the US recently has been upsetting, and rarely uplifting; but the champions of voting rights have reasons to be both aghast at recent headlines and encouraged by them. On the one hand, the Trump-Pence “election integrity” commission’s every move continues to underscore concerns that it is driving at 90mph towards national voter suppression. Then there is the sudden decision by Donald Trump and attorney general Jeff Session’s Department of Justice to support purging voter rolls in Ohio. It’s enough to make voters feel like they have targets on their backs. On the other hand, Rhode Island recently became the ninth state to enact AVR – automatic voter registration – and on 28 August Illinois became the 10th when its Republican governor signed the bill into law. While the federal government perpetuates myths and conspiracies in an effort to justify taking the vote away from citizens, more and more states are taking local action to strengthen and protect this most fundamental democratic right. Roughly 41% of eligible voters didn’t vote in the 2016 election. Such low voter participation is a significant dent in the credibility and legitimacy of our elections. Our government gains its legitimacy by being representative of the people, but if the reality is that it only represents a little more than half of eligible voters, that premise is shaky. We cannot make people vote, but we can certainly make it easier for them to do so. And it can be achieved without pillaging state voting records to build a national voter database that is susceptible to abuse and hacking. AVR involves two steps. The first is that eligible voters are registered to vote, or have their voting information updated, any time they interact with state agencies, or with federal agencies under national AVR. Second, those agencies electronically relay the information to appropriate state electoral officials. The results are more registered voters and more up-to-date voter rolls. It is one of the single greatest ways to improve the legitimacy of our elections, and in turn our democracy. It results in a default “opt-out” system, whereby people have to take action to opt out of being registered, rather than having to go out of their way to register to vote. Alex Padilla, California’s secretary of state, captured it perfectly when he said: “Citizens should not have to opt in to their fundamental right to vote.” The right to vote, and peoples’ exercising of it, is a central pillar of the legitimacy of our democracy. Our system of government – the balance of power, the accountability to the people – only works if people vote. It is that simple. And in states that have enacted AVR, it has significantly increased voter registration, and initial indicators point to increased voter participation in elections. The benefits to our democratic legitimacy should be a case-closed argument for AVR; but there are other reasons AVR makes total sense. It is not only cheaper and less error-prone than the current paper process: it would also clean up existing voter rolls and reduce the potential for voter fraud – two goals often highlighted by those who cry foul over voter fraud concerns. The push for AVR in many states is being led by secretaries of state, who are often states’ top election officials, and understand the cost and logistical and democratic advantages of AVR. As Rhode Island’s secretary of state recently stated, AVR “will help reduce the bloat in our voter rolls resulting from unintentional, duplicate voter registrations, and help increase voter participation”. Also encouraging is that this is a bipartisan issue at the state level. Republican legislators and Republican governors have helped enact AVR in different states. Moreover, AVR is popular among citizens, as seen in Alaska, where it was adopted by the voters. A national AVR bill was introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in June, and if enacted would result in the automatic registration of eligible voters who interact with federal agencies, with the option for individuals to opt out. This could be a huge success for this administration, and is being handed to the White House on a plate. In the House, Robert Brady, a Pennsylvania Democrat), along with 53 co-sponsors, is advancing the proposed bill. And in the Senate Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, and five co-sponsors are working to move similar legislation. Momentum exists at the state level as well. AVR is now standard practice in 10 states and the District of Columbia, and legislation has been introduced in as many as 30 other states. An effort to enact national AVR could motivate more states to enact it at the state level, or expand existing AVR. For instance, to maximize the impact and benefit of AVR, voters should be registered and their information updated any time they interact with a state agency, whether that be housing, education or motor vehicles. If restricted to interactions with the Department of Motor Vehicles, as is the case in some states, AVR becomes susceptible to the same flaws as restrictive voter ID laws. Many people don’t have a driver’s license and don’t do business with the DMV. They should not be required to procure a driver’s license just to vote. Driving is an option. Voting is a right. National momentum on AVR could promote best practices by states. Rather than raising concerns about purging voter rolls and voter suppression, the country has an opportunity to champion voting rights and actually improve the legitimacy of our elections and our democracy. It doesn’t require a discredited commission, a national voter database, or an invasion of citizens’ privacy. It just needs lawmakers who genuinely care about voter participation and our democratic legitimacy. If members of Congress are serious about wanting to improve our elections, let’s see them champion AVR and support the Brady and Leahy measures right away.

But then I came face to face with my prison guard","bodyText":"When I first arrived in Australia, I thought it was like heaven. I felt like I’d been given a second life – or more like a fifth or sixth life. When I look at my son, Freeman, it brings back memories. I wasn’t far away from his age when I was a child solider. I was only 13 when I first used an AK47. In 1983, a civil war broke out in Sudan. My father and older brother died around the same time. I wanted to fight, because I was very angry. I volunteered in the beginning not really knowing what I was getting myself into. We trained in Ethiopia. There was little food. We ate a staple diet that consisted of ground maize or boiled rice. The training they gave us was very harsh. If we tried to escape they would punish us severely. We sometimes fainted from the heat and excessive training. If you didn’t get up they would leave you there, or drag you out of the way. While fighting in Sudan, we had to jump into ditches and holes to escape the bombings. One of the child soldiers was hit by a bomb. All that was left of him was his belt. That was the only way we could identify him. We were always being ambushed by the enemy. Even when I would go to the toilet, I was shot at. But for me, the worse part of it was burying child soldiers my age who died from malaria, diarrhoea or self-inflicted gunshot wounds while cleaning a gun. One friend shot his lieutenant and then turned the gun on himself. The suffering was unimaginable. It was unlike any movie I’ve ever seen. I ran away too many times to keep count. Every time I ran away they would send the prison guards to come and get me. They’d put us into prison for up to four weeks. The prison was run by this guy called Anyang. He was only a few years older than me. Anyang was a ruthless trainer who handed down severe punishment. The teenage guards did what they were told – otherwise they would get beaten up too. I came to Australia as a refugee from South Sudan in 1996. I didn’t expect Australia to be this good. The first day I arrived, I ate so many sausages thinking that it was the only time I was going to be fed. I haven’t eaten them since. The first morning I woke up, I looked out of the window only to see quiet. It was an alien environment to me. It took me a while to fit in. I tried to put the past behind me but it was really hard to forget. Then on one Sunday visit to a church in Brisbane, I was confronted by a situation beyond belief. At the end of the service, I looked to my right – and looked again – and saw this face that I could only remember from when I was a child solider. And then something just clicked – bang! – in my head. I took another good look ... And I realised it was him! It was Anyang. We had eye contact, although I’m not sure if he saw me. But I recognised him straightaway. It was his eyes. It was about two years later when I saw him again and told him that I would have killed him if he and I were back in Africa and he no longer had the protection or power he had in Sudan. I was still struggling with the horrific memories that seeing Anyang in the church had triggered. I soon realised that, if I don’t talk to him, if I don’t face him and don’t forgive him, it’s going to be in my mind for so many years to come – and that will hurt me. If I see him again it might help me move on with my life. The new documentary series Look Me in the Eye offered me the chance to come face to face with Anyang again, without words getting in the way. Based on the proven counselling technique of non-verbal communication, I wanted to look Anyang in the eyes and see remorse. I wanted answers. But most of all, I wanted to move on with my life and get closure. The host, Ray Martin, asked me what I was feeling before I met with Anyang. My emotions were mixed to say the least. Anger was the most prevalent feeling I had at the time. Was I going to be able to face him? What would I do? We all handle our life experiences the best way we know how. I need to put the painful memories behind me and any help would be worth the time. You have to start somewhere and I couldn’t think of a better way to do it. I thought facing the history of my tragic past would help me heal, forgive and move on with life. My life changed when my son Freeman was born. It gave me something to live for. The reason I called him Freeman is because he’s a free man. I never had freedom myself, so when he was born, there was no better name to give him. I never had the opportunities that he’s got. I never had a good life. I never grew up around my family. In the army, I was just running and running and running. I ran from Sudan to Ethiopia then back to Sudan. I ran to Uganda, to Kenya, to Somalia, then back to Kenya before coming to Australia. But I think ... I think now I have stopped running. Look Me in the Eye premieres Wednesday 6 September, 8.30pm on SBS. Episodes will be available after broadcast anytime, anywhere, for free via SBS On Demand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/sep/05/the-guardian-essential-report-5-september-results","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T02:18:15Z","webTitle":"The Guardian Essential Report, 5 September results","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/sep/05/the-guardian-essential-report-5-september-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/sep/05/the-guardian-essential-report-5-september-results","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian Essential Report, 5 September results","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/06/australian-government-urged-to-ban-orphanage-tourism-immediately","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T18:00:09Z","webTitle":"Australian government urged to ban orphanage tourism immediately","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/06/australian-government-urged-to-ban-orphanage-tourism-immediately","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/06/australian-government-urged-to-ban-orphanage-tourism-immediately","fields":{"headline":"Australian government urged to ban orphanage tourism immediately","bodyText":"A Liberal-led committee will urge the government to ban Australian involvement in orphanage tourism as a matter of urgency. The government is currently examining the introduction of a modern slavery act, which would seek to crack down on exploitation, human trafficking and forced labour, particularly in corporate supply chains. Last month a committee considering anti-slavery laws heard extensive evidence about the involvement of Australian money in one form of modern slavery: orphanage tourism in developing nations. The practice – which mostly involves children who are not, in fact, orphans – is propped up by Australian donations and volunteers, particularly in south-east Asia. The committee is now recommending that Australia’s involvement in orphanage tourism be dealt with as an immediate priority, without waiting for a modern slavery act. The foreign affairs and aid subcommittee is preparing a letter to the attorney general, George Brandis, and the justice minister, Michael Keenan, urging them to consider an immediate ban on Australian involvement in orphanage tourism. The committee’s chairman, the Liberal MP Chris Crewther, said dealing with Australian involvement in orphanage tourism could not wait for parliament to establish a modern slavery act. “It could be another year and [in that time] you’ve got more people helping and aiding traffickers – that’s a circumstance we really don’t want to be in,” he told Guardian Australia. The letter is expected to be approved by the subcommittee on Thursday. In Cambodia, an estimated 80% of the 16,500 children in orphanages still have a living parent. Children are frequently subjected to exploitation, abuse and slave labour, according to the United Nations children’s fund (Unicef) and others. Many of the institutions are run to profit their owners, propped up by Australian money and volunteers sent by churches, schools, universities, travel agencies and nongovernment organisations. Even well-run orphanages can tend to have negative impacts on children. Studies have shown institutional care for children, which no longer exists in Australia, makes them more likely to develop reactive attachment disorders, developmental delays and behavioural issues. On Monday, the education minister, Simon Birmingham, announced the government would examine policies that could reduce school and university funding for orphanage tourism. The ban proposed by the foreign affairs and aid subcommittee would make the government’s response considerably stronger. “Not many countries have really taken action, we’re probably leading in terms of any other country in even considering taking action on this issue,” Crewther said. “The fact is that it’s a money-making exercise and people are being made orphans by traffickers because it feeds into a human-trafficking scheme and it pulls on people’s heart strings.” Details on how such a ban would work in practice have not yet been considered. Experts have urged the government to take care not to cut off all Australian funding at once but instead seek to redirect it to aid agencies and nongovernment organisations working to keep children with their families or communities. Crewther said a transitional model was needed, one that did not immediately cut off all funding to orphanages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/04/dele-alli-england-slovakia-fifa-offensive-gesture","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-04T22:44:01Z","webTitle":"Dele Alli could face Fifa disciplinary action for offensive gesture at Wembley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/04/dele-alli-england-slovakia-fifa-offensive-gesture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/04/dele-alli-england-slovakia-fifa-offensive-gesture","fields":{"headline":"Dele Alli could face Fifa disciplinary action for offensive gesture at Wembley","bodyText":"Dele Alli has risked disciplinary action from Fifa after cameras caught him making a one-finger salute, sparking suggestions it had been directed at the referee, Clément Turpin, late in England’s 2-1 World Cup qualifying victory over Slovakia. The Tottenham midfielder was visibly frustrated after the official waved away his appeals for a free-kick following a foul by Martin Skrtel on the edge of the Slovakia box 13 minutes from time. Turpin had his back turned at the time and subsequently penalised Jordan Henderson for a foul on the other side of the pitch, failing to notice Alli’s gesture, though world football’s governing body may still choose to scrutinise the incident. Gareth Southgate, unaware of Alli’s reaction during the game, spoke to the player after the final whistle with the midfielder suggesting he had actually been aiming the gesture at his former Tottenham team-mate Kyle Walker. “I’ve not seen it but I’ve been made aware of it,” the England manager said. “Kyle and Dele were mucking about, and Dele’s made a gesture towards Kyle. I don’t know what the angle picked up by the camera is, so I don’t know if that is clear. The pair of them have a strange way of communicating but that’s what they’ve said when it’s been raised.” Alli later posted on Twitter insisting that had indeed been the reason for the salute. “Just to clarify, the gesture tonight was a joke between me and my good friend Kyle Walker! Apologies for any offence caused! Great win 2nite,” he wrote. Fifa would determine any sanction applicable and have applied bans in the past for abuse of officials by players. The highest profile was arguably Lionel Messi, who was initially banned for four matches and fined 10,000 Swiss francs (£8,100) for supposedly “having directed insulting words” at an assistant referee during Argentina’s World Cup qualifying game against Chile in March, an offence which had not accrued a card at the time. However, having sat out the first match against Bolivia, he had the suspension overturned on appeal due to a lack of evidence. England have two qualifying fixtures remaining – against Slovenia and Lithuania – and need only two points to qualify for the tournament in Russia following Monday’s success, a win inspired by the excellent Marcus Rashford. The 19-year-old forward recovered from an early mistake, upon which Slovakia capitalised to open the scoring, to provide an assist for Eric Dier’s equaliser and then belt home a fine winner to register his first goal at Wembley for his country on his 11th cap. “Having worked with him, he’s such a mature character,” Southgate said. “The start [he made] surprised me. But the switch of wings was important as well. It allowed him a slightly different defensive role, and he adapted very well to that. His maturity is excellent. You look at him and he’s never in awe of the occasion. He doesn’t have any fear of anything.. I don’t think the team did, either, and responded well. He’s still a work in progress as we saw at the beginning of the game but he’s getting stronger. His impact, in taking people on and getting us up the pitch in the counter-attack, was huge. He had a huge impact on the game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/13/why-national-heroes-meant-zero-to-brecht","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T17:08:09Z","webTitle":"Why national heroes meant zero to Brecht | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/13/why-national-heroes-meant-zero-to-brecht","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/13/why-national-heroes-meant-zero-to-brecht","fields":{"headline":"Why national heroes meant zero to Brecht","bodyText":"Now that a way has been found to calculate the asset value of a tree (Put a price on trees and halt this chainsaw massacre, 12 September), maybe we should do the same for people.

And an urgent call demanding acknowledgement. He hustled after me, swearing, smacking a fist into his open palm. We moved, pursuer and pursued, in steady bank holiday drizzle, down a slippery, stone-flagged ramp towards the laby-rinth of borough engineer Sidney Little’s reinforced concrete subterranea: a buried swimming pool, a vault to take cars away from the promenade, a marine walkway pressed against a wall of broken bottles. Like a reliquary for beachside drinking schools, the thirsty ones at the end of the land. Panoramic sea windows, lacking glass, are set in expectation of invasions still to come. (Between 1940 and 1944, Little had a sideline, working with the Admiralty on the construction of a concrete Mulberry harbour for the D-day landings.) Hastings in the 1930s, in the borough engineer’s pomp, was a punt at the better way: sanctioned leisure time for all, seasonal tourism as a benefit. And smooth rail connections to the capital, the Smoke. Open roads, carving through the humped folds of the chalk downs, beneath the outlines of mythical giants, were celebrated in collectable posters by the finest artists and designers. Cars were not yet weapons of choice, primed for mindless assault on the crowd, those who are privileged to walk freely in the city. Where did it all go wrong? When was the vision that sanctioned the spectacular amphitheatre of the West St Leonard’s lido and the magnificent folly of the tallest block of residential flats in England, built to look like a beached cruise liner, like the newly launched Queen Mary of the Cunard White Star Line, downgraded to nostalgic flickers on a monitor screen in the little visited town museum? “Are you on the street?” Ever since I told myself that I had done with the compulsion to write about London, I felt that I had lost my centre of gravity. As if the familiar markers I ambled past every day no longer recognised me or had any use for a sleepwalker in the muzzle of elective silence. There was no longer an obligation to carry a notebook or a camera. Or to endure the madness of being overwhelmed by random voices, mendacious signage, tags and scribbles, snippets of intrusive mobile-phone babble: along with the moral imperative of shaping white noise into a coherent narrative. The rough sleepers, ranters on buses, spice zombies, station beggars I sourced as potential characters were taking their revenge by welcoming me into their survivalist sodality. Did I look like one of them now? Did my skewed, eyes-down trudge transmit a different code, a new set of pheromones? The Hastings man in the tunnel was enraged: most pressingly with uniformed enforcers who were tidying up the mid-town shopping centre, prodding him from his habitual ledge in the shadow of Lloyds Bank, away from the shelter of the padlocked public toilets now under offer as “commercial property”. He had nowhere to go. His tormentors were tight-lipped and implacable. And, beyond these irritations, it was the world at large. Those spiteful iniquities: the way that politicians and post offices and wives and publicans singled him out as a person worthy of torment. Gulls screamed in derision. Electrified invalid carriages piloted by Hell’s Angels grannies with a sense of fierce entitlement used him for target practice. But I was sympathetic. Or so he imagined. A fellow traveller in distress. I was on the street. Was it the clothes, the tilt in my walk? Another grizzled prospector for small brown coins gummed to tarmac. Did he sense that I had lost my project? That I was rambling without purpose, burdened with too many convenience-store bags? I underlined a quote from the paperback I was reading; a gift from a New Yorker commissioned to make films for the Discovery Channel, in which he shadowed particular writers through their special cities. The sprawl of Mexico City was entrusted to Paco Ignacio Taibo II. The book, featuring a broken detective dragged back from the grave, was Return to the Same City. “Now more than ever he had the absurd ability to feel out of place everywhere.” Taibo’s one-eyed, cola-swilling investigator, in his John Ford eye patch, knows that “you can’t return to what doesn’t exist, but you can long for what you had.” And that was pretty much my take on London. From the moment, cutting the grass around a Hawksmoor church in Limehouse, when I assembled an overcooked stew of poetry-reportage, work diary and speculative essay in 1974, to polemics against Olympicopolis and the imposition of CGI unreality on the corporate theme park of the Lower Lea Valley, I believed that the job involved channelling aspects of the past, scratching at resistant memory traces. I’ve never moved far from the WB Yeats quote that started it all: “The living can assist the imagination of the dead.” I was like one of the dead myself. The invisibles of the city, the troubled ones who are not part of the general contract, began to see me as something other than a predator with a ballpoint pen or a petty-cash patron. I thought of what happened to the real writers when the crunch came. It never did for JG Ballard: notice of premature mortality was an equation to be solved with an immaculately constructed final memoir, Miracles of Life. The earlier fictions were refined and revised into benevolent myths, all dues paid, carrying the story towards its necessary conclusion at the hands of a “strong-minded, wise and kindly physician”. William Burroughs, creator of more demented surgeons, slid across his last border into a far west of dreams. After his malignant succubus – the will to write – was exorcised in a Native American sweat lodge ceremony, he was freed from the karma of composition, the penance imposed for the shooting of his wife, Joan Vollmer, in Mexico City. In Kansas exile, Burroughs humoured his superior cats and kept meticulous dream journals. The characters and sets were still in place, but now they composed their own stories. “A long time ago,” Burroughs wrote in one of his final entries, “but not too far to walk.” Walking, always the favoured iteration of the dream of the city, has become, hour-by-hour, a more conflicted activity. The peripatetic vagrants, the ones who yelled at me across the blur of morning cyclists, demanding a response, were balanced by the sitters, the vegetative slab-squatters and pavement warmers who had found their place. With no intention of giving it up. Metropolitan hustlers, the monad of scurrying, dawn athletes coming out of their pristine, new-build, railside apartments, hitting the street like a treadmill, do not see the benched Buddhas. They are inoculated against empathy. Outpourings of public emotion are reserved for horrible media catastrophes: outrages on London bridges, underfunded and irresponsibly provided tower blocks that become crematorium chimneys, stealing the lives of the unregistered who live alongside stuccoed ghost terraces occupied by rumours of remote speculators. Ill prepared for many aspects of a city polarised by satellite developments, east and west, around the two Westfield retail colonies (street food from every nation), I was open to any invitation to take to the road. There would be a tent show in Brighton, at the fringe festival, inspired by Watling Street, a book by John Higgs. I was asked to contribute. And, being literal minded, I left London for Dover, to make my own pilgrimage, by way of Canterbury, Faversham, Sittingbourne, Rochester and Shooter’s Hill, to the Old Kent Road and Westminster. I was getting away from London’s karma by marching, in a fugue of absence, right into the worst of it. ❦ I carried with me the imprint of fire and water: repeat excursions over the same ground. Fractal patterns of pondweed on which new coots have to learn to walk rather than paddle. Viridian swirls of instant derangement from tattered nitrous oxide balloons on London Fields are earthed by the heat from old bricks in the wall of the Beehive Foundry. Physical work is still going on. All the dramas of our lost London are enacted within a few yards of the railway bridge crossing the Regent’s Canal at Mare Street, Hackney. A speculative development under one arch arranges its imported plants and cafetieres in denial of the surrounding scene. Polish builders in smart trainers and Gap T-shirts decant from Addison Lee taxis. A filthy, rat-disputed shelf under the bridge was previously occupied by a rough sleeper in a sack like a body bag. Until he was joined by others in an all too visible camp, their shelters scavenged from driftwood. These unfortunates were prodded awake and swept away by the black vans of Home Office immigration enforcement (sanctioned to do just the opposite). The raiders come early and defer, in whispered conversations, to a higher authority. Television crews, professional entropy tourists, revise the graffiti on the gothic ruin beside Empress Coaches for the latest episode of London noir. The narrowboat with the pirate flag is boarded and captured. The container stack, looking like a Mad Max apocalypse dumped beside the smouldering landfill dunes on Rainham Marshes, is a shared-desk hipster hive for internet startups and craft beer websites. The narrow towpath, where several cyclists came to grief as they bombed out from under the bridge and into the water, was occupied by what looked like a pile of discarded, post-disaster charity clothing. It turned out to be a young Asian man who greeted me with a friendly salute. He still hoped to find better accommodation “over there”. He waved in the general direction of Victoria Park, before warming his back on the heated bricks of the foundry. We exchanged a few words every morning. But only after we had established terms did he indicate that he might be prepared to accept a coin or two. On days when he was still asleep, burrowed into his layers, other benefactors left fruit on his pillow. One morning I noticed a pair of fresh bananas. The wall-hugging perversity of walking beside water is a habit I am reluctant to break. Breathing space on towpaths, pavements and crossing points between highway upgrades is critical. And bridges: think of the woman shoved into the path of a bus by a jogger setting a PB in his fantasy Olympics. There are hierarchies of entitlement: the Lycra peloton fretting for respect or the headphone joggers in outfits boasting of the conspicuous charity of bankers. Pedestrians are at the bottom of the food chain, cushioned in self-righteous indignation and fondly imagining ourselves to be revenants from an earlier, better time. One evening a young man rapped imperiously on my door. He had been commissioned by the council to carry out a survey on how many steps we old folk managed in a day. Tapping white teeth with a black Biro, he suggested a properly supervised class in how to make a circuit of London Fields. I was attracted by the ever-open doors of J Hoyle &amp; Son. And the name of that canalside building: Beehive Foundry. An intensely local spill of heat. The sanded floor of a dark cave. A lung-scouring inhalation leaving needles in the nose. Formaldehyde is used to set moulds for the casting of iron stair rods. This family business, one of many such Hackney operations, threatened or vanished, was started eight years before the Jack the Ripper murders. The Blakean furnace roars with no reference to the status struggles, nudges and shunts of the morning towpath. The Gentle Author from Spitalfields, who dropped in on the foundry one afternoon, informed us that “no piece of railing or fence need ever be irreparable”. James Hoyle &amp; Son cast the decorative ironwork for the Bank of England, the British Museum and 10 Downing Street. I replayed these Hackney vectors – fire cave, bundle of occupied rags huddled against the wall, swish of the peloton – when I left town for Dover. I had no good reason to return, beyond the dream of a terrace house, endured and enjoyed for almost 50 years: the nest, the base, the fixed point from which all journeys begin. Watling Street was a 14th-century branding exercise, after the Roman imperium, giving status to a series of ancient trackways, and upgrading Wæcelinga Street, a title derived from tribal territory around St Albans, into a premature autobahn, a contraband highway waiting impatiently for the invention of the internal combustion engine. I packed a proof copy of the lively and engaging book by John Higgs, but I realised very quickly that there was something amiss: Higgs was in a car, diverting wherever the fancy led him, making it his business to string together a yatter of counter-culturalists and embedded subversives. In form, Watling Street blended the amiable eccentricities of John Aubrey’s Brief Lives with the polemic thrust of William Cobbett’s Rural Rides. Higgs took his children along, the outings were informative and fun. They lent themselves very well to “outcomes”: tent shows, blogs, itinerant performances. They travelled from now to now. The oldest trackways made the shape of a carrion crow’s footprints in mud, starting in three landing places at once: Rutupiae (Richborough), Portus Lemanis (Lympne) and Portus Dubris (Dover). Choosing Dover and stepping out on a Sunday night was a confirmation that it was closed to hospitality and barely tolerant of passerines – and only if they are prepared to visit the defensive block of the castle, the Roman ruins. Professional drinkers nesting for the night around the pale glow of a cash machine are infected by a universal malaise, impotence simmering with resentment. I remembered the man I’d heard that morning, ranting as he power jogged beside the canal. “I bought 2,000 bottles of poppers, thinking the price would be incredible when they were made illegal. I speculated. Post-Brexit I am always angry.” We are all angry, leavers and remainers, but where to place the blame? On the peeling seawall, under the curtain of the chalk cliff on which they recently projected a monumental image of Vera Lynn, a slogan has been painted: “NO PASARAN!” The Spanish republican boast from the siege of Madrid. The chant of those who resisted the Mosleyite march through the East End in the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936. Heroic defiance erects a hard Brexit barrier against the procession of Channel ferries. On the promenade, buffeted by the downdraft from a caravan of sealed lorries escaping the port, I was stopped by a black tablet, lettered in gold like a freshly restored gravestone, and set “In memory of 58 young people from China who died near here on 18th June 2000. All human life is precious”. Choked of breath as an illegitimate cargo. The only refuge, tucked hard against the cliff, is the Last Pub in the Civilised World. And so it feels. The German behind the bar, like the purser on a doomed freighter, has many sausage-based dishes on his card, but only pizza available at this time. He doesn’t know the difference between cider and lager, but he charges a sturdy hiking couple, Indian women in shorts, just £1 for the pot of tea they have nursed all afternoon. I know that the American in the corner, in his Ferlinghetti hat, is going to tell me at any moment that he is a poet who can extemporise for “40 minutes straight” on the Beats. He is chilling out between gigs in Chatham and Margate. He has an internet presence. He asks how long I have been on the street. A tuneful dirge in the background references “Bridge Over Troubled Water”. “Simon and Garfunkel,” my new street friend says. “Those guys are why I became a poet.” And why I need to get back out into the weather. Next morning I meet the film-maker Andrew Kötting at Dover Priory station. Andrew finds a pair of white flints that he twists in wire and presses against his eyes like blind spectacles. The better to see with his feet, he says. To counter dull aches with the acute pain of blood dripping from the flaps of torn ears. We reach Canterbury in good heart and dine that night at Byron on one of their riskier specials, the fat-cheeked Kimcheese burger with Korean BBQ glaze, Freddar cheese, kimchi cucumbers, “under a dollop of gochuchang sauce and spicy ssamjang mayo”. With an optional bucket of fries. A suicide feast appropriate to these darkening days. Threat and counter-threat on screens in restaurants and Premier Inn lobbies. After enduring the dead miles of the A2 between Canterbury and Sittingbourne, we are heading home to a city that is no longer there. Andrew left Deptford years ago, at the time of Thatcher’s “right to buy”, but nostalgia for riverside stinks puts a bounce in his stride. Reconnecting with the putative Roman road, we find nirvana: an enterprise punting disability vehicles alongside what looks like superior road kill. Deep-frozen Euro-imported exotics are very popular, apparently, at Kentish weddings, functions and festivals. The strength of London’s centripetal power is not felt until we reach Shooter’s Hill and the stutter and surge of Old Kent Road. On Westminster Bridge, close to the original ford, we are processed into another reality. We are reminded, by floral tributes, shedding sunflowers and unopened yellow tulip heads, of the mindless slaughter committed by Khalid Masood who came, in pain and rage, from the coast to the capital. He stayed at Preston Park Hotel on London Road in Brighton, making a final meal of takeaway kebab, before steering his Hyundai hire car into innocent walkers on the bridge. He crumpled his piloted projectile against the low wall, the decorative ironwork barrier, with its roses and spikes, outside the Houses of Parliament. This was the fence cast by the Beehive Foundry in Andrews Road, Hackney. We parted beyond St Paul’s, after stepping around the queue of Chinese bridal couples waiting to pose, in costume, inside a red telephone box. Andrew drifted across London Bridge, the site of the next attack, while I meandered, through reflex City passages loud with early evening drinkers, to Shoreditch and home. • Iain Sinclair’s The Last London: True Fictions from an Unreal City is published by Oneworld.

Darroch’s total remuneration almost quadrupled year-on-year, from £4.6m in 2016 to £16.3m last year, thanks to a payout of nearly £12m under Sky’s long-term incentive plan. The scheme, which vests every two years, paid him a more modest £4.7m in 2015. He also received an almost maximum bonus of £1.9m, 186% of a potential 200% of his £1.04m annual salary. The payouts came as Sky’s total operating profits fell 6% to £1.47bn for the year. The UK, which accounted for £1.3bn of that, was down 14%. Sky said it was an excellent performance given a one-off rise in the cost of its Premier League rights deal of £629m and £51m spent so far getting its mobile service up and running. Revenues across the group, which also has pay-TV operations in Germany, Italy and Austria, rose 10% to £12.9bn. Darroch cashed in £11.5m in shares in July, and Andrew Griffith, Sky’s finance chief, sold £6.8m. Sky also revealed that it had paid £16m to advisers in the year to the end of March in relation to 21st Century Fox’s takeover bid for the 61% of the company it does not already own. The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, said on Tuesday that she would refer the deal to the competition regulator for a six-month investigation on media plurality and broadcasting standards grounds. This means Sky shareholders can look forward to a £172m special dividend, which the satellite company said it would pay out if the deal did not complete this year. The delay in completion means Sky investors will now also receive a further interim dividend of up to £224m, usually paid out at the end of March. Fox has promised a £200m break fee if the deal fails to be sealed. Wilton Fry, an analyst at RBC Europe, said investors believed there was still an 85% chance that the Competition and Markets Authority would clear the deal. RBC believes Fox will get the deal through by offering to separate Sky News to address news media control concerns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/14/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-body-modifications","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T19:00:12Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend: share your songs about body modifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/14/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-body-modifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/14/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-body-modifications","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend: share your songs about body modifications","bodyText":"Body modifications of all kinds will be considered this week – so long as there’s a song about them you’d like to recommend.

May will speak in the historic Italian city on Friday 22 September “to update on Brexit negotiations so far”, the prime minister’s spokesman said. “She will underline the government’s wish for a deep and special partnership with the European Union once the UK leaves the EU,” he said. News of the planned address emerged just over a week ago when Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said the next round of UK-EU talks on the subject would most likely be delayed as May planned to make an “important intervention” on the issue. May’s spokesman gave no further details of what the prime minister would be saying and whether the speech would include any new information or proposals. “The PM has said that she would provide updates on how the negotiations were going and be engaged in an ongoing conversation with Europe, and that’s what she’s doing,” he said. May will be travelling to Italy purely to make the speech, which is not tied in to any bilateral talks or conferences. The list of attendees has yet to be announced, but Downing Street has informed the office of the Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, about the event. Asked why the venue had been picked, May’s spokesman said the prime minister “wanted to give a speech on the UK’s future relationship with Europe in its historical heart”. He said: “The UK has had deep cultural and economic ties spanning centuries with Florence, a city known for its historical trading power. As the UK leaves the EU, we will retain those close ties. As the prime minister has said on many occasions, we are leaving the EU, not Europe.” Under the guidance of the Medici dynasty, the then city state of Florence was one of the most important trading centres of medieval Europe and is often seen as the birthplace of the Renaissance. Trade with England, especially London, was a key part of the Florentine economy during this period, notably in wool and cloth, though critics of Brexit might point out that this declined in the 16th century as Antwerp took over as a trade destination. Speaking on Thursday, the chair of the retailer John Lewis said businesses would be seeking more details about how Brexit might shape the economy. Charlie Mayfield – who was speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after the department store chain announced its lowest staff bonus for more than 60 years – was asked what he might want to hear from May in Florence. He said: “We should be under no illusions – Brexit is having an effect on the economy. No question, it’s the same for everybody, and the main effects are sterling and confidence. “Uncertainty is one of the consequences of this, and of course businesses never like uncertainty, because it makes it hard to plan for the future. “Personally, I think we need to do justice to this uncertainty, and there needs to be a serious parliamentary debate to figure out what kind of Brexit we’re going to have in the best interests of the country and the economy. I think that’s what is pressingly needed.” The fourth formal round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels had been due to take place on 18 September but it was announced on Tuesday that this had been delayed for a week. May’s spokesman denied that the Florence speech was the reason for this, saying: “Both sides have settled on the date for the next round, after discussions between senior officials, in recognition that more time and consultation would give negotiations a flexibility to make further progress.” The speech will be seen as May’s third major explanation of her plans for Brexit, beginning with her speech at Lancaster House in London in January, where she first indicated her robust approach, including a willingness to leave the EU without a trade deal if needed. Then in March, May wrote to the European council president, Donald Tusk, triggering article 50, the formal beginning of the Brexit process. Her letter reiterated the no-deal possibility and warned this could have consequences for security cooperation. May’s speech in Florence will be scrutinised to see if this stance has softened following a tricky start to Brexit talks during which senior EU figures have expressed frustration over the UK’s demands and approach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/16/good-morning-britain-piers-morgan-itv","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T09:00:08Z","webTitle":"Good Morning Britain, we need to talk about Piers Morgan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/16/good-morning-britain-piers-morgan-itv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/16/good-morning-britain-piers-morgan-itv","fields":{"headline":"Good Morning Britain, we need to talk about Piers Morgan","bodyText":"I am not, I will admit, a breakfast TV sort of person. The primary colours and endless jollity traditionally favoured by television in the early hours have always been, to my mind, an affront to all that is decent and proper. I’ll keep the TV off, the curtains drawn and have Radio 4 on at a low murmur, if it’s all the same to you. But, because it’s good to mix things up (and because I was told to), over the last few weeks I have braved the carnival of controversy that is Good Morning Britain (Weekdays, 6am, ITV). I have done this every morning through a mist of tears, while biting down on a stick to muffle the screaming. In this case, it’s not the dazzling sets, the zany “light” segments and the relentlessly upbeat weather reports that have pushed me over the edge; in fact, all these things have brought merciful relief. The source of my agony is Piers Morgan, a man so ghastly that even America packaged him up and sent him back with a note saying: “Keep him. He’s yours.” It seems the more he is bounced from one show to another, the more bullying and cartoonishly grotesque he becomes. Now he has taken to yelling at guests as they try in vain to finish a sentence. On his quieter days, they will get roughly eight seconds to make their point before he starts hurling insults and barking like an elephant seal. Witness him huffing and frothing at the trans model and campaigner Munroe Bergdorf recently, and reducing what should have been a thoughtful and nuanced debate about white privilege and racism to: “How dare you insult ME? ME ME ME ME ME ME MEEEEEE!” A few days later, GMB’s bookers saw fit to invite suited corpse Jacob Rees-Mogg to air his grimly reactionary views on abortion and gay marriage, perhaps because he’s the only man in Britain able to make Morgan look vaguely reasonable. Morgan’s early-morning scenery chewing is, of course, great news for GMB’s bosses, who have seen a spike in ratings and round-the-clock bonfires on social media, many of them stoked by Morgan himself who, in the reversal of the vampire trope, starts to smoke and shrivel whenever the light moves off him. It’s not such good news for A&amp;E departments that, one assumes, have experienced a surge in Morgan-induced aneurysms. It’s a wonder that his co-presenter Susanna Reid wasn’t carted off long ago, driven to distraction by his incessant foghorn condescension. Still, Reid’s expression is currently less “surrendered wife” than “woman biding her time”. We shouldn’t be surprised if one day, in the not-too-distant future, the cameras zoom in to find her sitting beatifically next to Morgan’s head skewered on a pole. Ultimately, with Morgan’s pointlessly combative questioning and world-gone-mad rants, Good Morning Britain doesn’t feel much like breakfast TV at all. There’s precious little jollity among the presenters and guests here, more gritted teeth and a “let’s see if we can make it to 8.30am without anyone crying” resolve. There was a time when breakfast telly, with its bland yet jolly presenters, terrible sweaters and sunshiney motifs, was about easing viewers into the day. In Morgan’s sweaty hands, it’s about getting them up, slapping them about a bit and sending them off to work with a black eye. Thanks, but no thanks. I’m going back to bed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/13/dominic-grieve-calls-for-urgent-deal-on-post-brexit-citizens-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T15:31:39Z","webTitle":"Dominic Grieve calls for urgent deal on post-Brexit citizens' rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/13/dominic-grieve-calls-for-urgent-deal-on-post-brexit-citizens-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/13/dominic-grieve-calls-for-urgent-deal-on-post-brexit-citizens-rights","fields":{"headline":"Dominic Grieve calls for urgent deal on post-Brexit citizens' rights","bodyText":"Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP and former attorney general, has called for an urgent side-deal on EU citizens’ rights post-Brexit to secure their future in the event Britain crashes out of the bloc without an agreement with Brussels. Grieve said it was paramount to ringfence a deal that secures employment and social rights in order to protect both the estimated 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK and the 1.2 million British nationals on the continent from further uncertainty about their futures. “I would regard it as essential to be able to ringfence a deal, otherwise it is going to be a serious problem for both EU nationals and UK nationals, which I think is unacceptable,” he said. Grieve, MP for Beaconsfield, was speaking after addressing hundreds of anxious EU citizens who assembled in Westminster to lobby MPs to secure their rights as part of a campaign day organised by the grassroots organisation the3million. He is one of a handful of Tory MPs calling for significant amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, which passed its second reading in the Commons on Tuesday. Among those gathered in Westminster were Peter and Sabine Klepsch, two German medical consultants who have lived in the UK for the past 12 years. “We are thinking a bit more about going back to Germany,” said Peter, 51, who is an anaesthetist in Bristol. He said he did not believe the “golden, shiny promises” made by politicians about their future rights and although he and his neuroscientist wife were free to leave the country, he feared for the future of the NHS. “I know a lot of EU doctors and nurses who are saying: ‘I’m not going to stay very much longer.’ With the NHS on its knees, losing anyone is a disaster,” said Peter. Although both EU and UK leaders have tried to reassure EU citizens on both sides of the channel that their future rights will be secured, there was an overwhelming sense of fear and uncertainty among those gathered at the Emmanuel Centre in Westminster. Inside parliament, Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee, told campaigners at the launch of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Britons in the EU that he did not believe the UK and EU were “miles apart” on EU citizens. But he said there were still fundamental differences to be resolved, including the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, rights of family members and criminality checks before residency was granted. Benn said he thought the negotiations had been hampered by the attitude of some in the government, including the prime minister. “Things were said and impressions given that have, in my view, greatly damaged the UK’s standing the world because … people felt Britain doesn’t want us any more, which is certainly not the case. “When the prime minister went to the European council to tell them all would be well, instead of saying 3 million citizens could stay here and were valued, it was reported she said: ‘Don’t worry, no one is going to be deported.’ In my visit to Brussels last week, people told me that eyes widened when she arrived; instead of offering reassurances, she spoke about deportation.” Benn said he also accepted the view of EU citizens who said the current process for applying for residency via an 85-page form was unacceptable as a process for 3 million people. “The government is going to have to come up with a much, much simpler system to do this … the current system is a complete non-starter,” he said. Jane Golding, a British lawyer who lives in Germany and is chair of the campaign group British in Europe, said that unless the UK showed flexibility she did not see the EU moving its position. The future of EU citizens, along with the exit bill and the Northern Ireland border with Ireland, are the three priorities in the first round of Brexit talks. So far, however, fewer than half of the issues raised in talks on EU citizens have been agreed. “I would like to see this [talks on EU citizens] accelerated; we need to have a deal for EU citizens and UK nationals. As it’s a human issue, it’s in everyone’s interests that a deal is done as quickly as possible,” said Grieve. To cheers, he told EU citizens that “irrationality tends often to be the hallmark of some [Brexiters]”, but he said this was because some “people are ignorant or spend too much time, I’m afraid, reading the Daily Mail”. He said nobody in his party had suggested EU citizens should be turfed out and he had “every confidence that not a single one of you in this room will ever be required to leave the United Kingdom”, he said. However, he re-iterated the Tory position that the EU deal could not include any oversight for the European court of justice. Paul Blomfield, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, called on the government to send out “a strong message” to employers and landlords that discrimination against EU citizens was unacceptable. Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that the government Equalities Office was to examine growing evidence that EU nationals in the UK were being illegally prevented from renting or buying properties, getting jobs and booking holidays, after Blomfield submitted a dossier of examples compiled by the3million."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/15/jo-swinson-i-find-it-harder-now-to-offer-simple-solutions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T14:27:55Z","webTitle":"Jo Swinson: ‘I find it harder now to offer simple solutions’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/15/jo-swinson-i-find-it-harder-now-to-offer-simple-solutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/15/jo-swinson-i-find-it-harder-now-to-offer-simple-solutions","fields":{"headline":"Jo Swinson: ‘I find it harder now to offer simple solutions’","bodyText":"The Liberal Democrats are struggling to attract voters from the centre ground who are politically homeless after Labour and the Conservatives have shifted to the edges, according to the party’s new deputy leader, Jo Swinson. The former women and equalities minister, who won back her East Dunbartonshire seat from the SNP in June, said the party had to show it could represent the gulf between the two. “It’s not really the zeitgeist,” she said. “There is this big yawning gap in the middle of British politics, the Conservative and Labour parties have gone to the edges. In this divided, polarised world, the pragmatic centre ground is a bit unloved.” Swinson said convincing centrist voters – mostly remainers – to back her party was still a huge challenge. “We clearly haven’t been able to make that connection yet and resonate with a lot of those people. That’s the task to get stuck into,” she said. The party’s former leader Paddy Ashdown wrote in a blunt blog post before the party’s conference in Bournemouth this weekend that the atmosphere had never been more fertile for a Lib Dem advance, but that it was failing to make the connection with those voters. “The vast sea of people who share our beliefs find themselves voiceless and silent,” he said. “Not all of them, sadly, are Liberal Democrats or want to be.” Ashdown said his party was no longer seen as a radical force, compared with the time when it had opposed the Iraq war and championed equal marriage – “not as a force for change, but as a part of the establishment”. On social media and in newspaper comment pages, the suggestion for the future of liberal centrism has been to create a new party, perhaps a UK version of Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche, rather than a Lib Dem renaissance. In the 2017 election, two years after the party’s most catastrophic performance, the Lib Dems make some patchy inroads in seats with high numbers of remain voters, including winning back Swinson’s seat, and Vince Cable’s in Twickenham, south-west London, as well as seats in Bath and Oxford. Swinson, a business minister in the coalition, said the party needed to rediscover “radical solutions that might upset the apple cart” but intimated her time in government had given her some sympathy for those on the other side of the despatch box. “My experience in government is there is a whole host of unintended consequences you have to think through,” she said. “I can’t un-know that, I find it harder now to offer simple solutions.” With the forces of change in the ascendency, Lib Dems have found themselves, somewhat uncomfortably, as the party of caution and continuity, though in the current climate Swinson said being unashamedly in favour of remaining in the EU was a bold idea. She still believes there is a route for Britain to remain in the EU, which she hopes will show the party ultimately on the right side of history. “Long term it is strategically right, [the former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron] got that right,” she said. “But was an election in 2017 the one where that would yield the greatest electoral return? Well clearly not. Perhaps obviously not, but it wasn’t necessarily obvious at the time. But it is our position.” No rethink of the party’s policy on Europe is on the horizon for now. Swinson said it would be a mistake for the party to ditch its unique selling point as a home for remainers. “Remaining in the EU is the best thing for the UK. I can’t ever see a scenario where we would think an alternative option was better,” she said. “I still think there’s some doubt over whether we do leave, but I do think on balance the more likely scenario is that we do. I will do my best as a parliamentarian to try to get the best, closest possible relationship in the event that we leave.” Farron had made no secret he wanted Swinson to run for the leadership of the party, announcing his decision to create a deputy leader post before his own belated decision to resign, a post clearly designed with Swinson in mind. His own campaign, repeatedly dogged by questions about his Christian faith and attitude to homosexuality and abortion, had been tough for the party to watch, Swinson said. The MP, who spent her two years away from parliament writing a book on gender inequality, said she could defend Farron’s personal views but not those of MPs like Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has said his Catholic faith means he opposes abortion in all circumstances. “There’s a big difference between Tim and Jacob Rees-Mogg and the distinction has not been drawn,” she said. “Politicians should be judged on their actions, rather than necessarily their views on scripture. “Jacob Rees-Mogg does wish to impose his view on other people, including on women who have been raped, who he thinks should be forced to go through with a pregnancy against their will. He is prepared to vote on that basis to restrict those rights and I think that is different and it is right to be judged for that.” When Farron stepped down, in part because he believed questions about his faith would forever hamper him, Swinson looked to be the favourite to replace him. She had long been popular with the party’s young grassroots, in part because of her friendly, confident demeanour and skills as a DJ at the annual Lib Dem disco. But more significantly she did not come with the same baggage as Cable or the other rumoured contender, Ed Davey, who had been coalition cabinet ministers. However, in a frank blogpost, Swinson said she did not feel the time was right to take on the job, but suggested that, had she been a man, she might have been more likely to seize the opportunity. The viral post caused a furore she had not been expecting. “I didn’t think it was a controversial thing to say!” Swinson said. “But obviously some people did. And then I thought, you people are going to hate my book.” The former Labour party deputy leader Harriet Harman was among those clamouring for her to reconsider. “The men can aspire to be your deputy!” she tweeted. Swinson said she felt a pang when she saw Harman’s tweet, though she did not doubt her decision. “I love Harriet Harman, she is a supporter of women of all parties, a kind word, a friendly voice, and this country is lucky to have her,” she said. The pair have spoken since, Swinson said. “I still knew I was right, but she is reflecting on her own career too.” Swinson entered parliament aged 25 and has been in Westminster for a decade – a third of Harman’s career – and says she has hopes to emulate how the Labour grandee has encouraged younger women of all political stripes. “Sometimes I also look back and see things differently to how I did when I was 21,” she said. “If I can share some of that with the next generation of women coming through, I want to be strong advocates for them.” Cable won the leadership unopposed but, at 74, there has been widespread speculation that the former business secretary will eventually hand over to his deputy. Swinson’s relative youth and growing profile may mean she believes she can afford to wait until liberalism is back in vogue and she does not deny she may eventually want the top job. “I’m not going to sit here now and plot out my entire future,” she said. “Four months ago I didn’t think I’d even be sitting here in parliament.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/17/top-10-small-cruise-boat-trips-worldwide","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"10 of the best small-scale cruises worldwide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/17/top-10-small-cruise-boat-trips-worldwide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/17/top-10-small-cruise-boat-trips-worldwide","fields":{"headline":"10 of the best small-scale cruises worldwide","bodyText":"Mekong, Vietnam-Cambodia The first tourist ship to negotiate the river passage from the Vietnamese Mekong to the more tranquil Cambodian side in 2003, the RV Mekong Pandaw is still doing the trip today.

It was the Sunday night of a long weekend, and the mood was perfectly loose, in the way only bank holidays can make adults feel. And this quintet were serious players, with more than 100 years of experience between them. There was grand history in the room: the pianist, Norman Simmons, had played for Carmen McRae and Sarah Vaughan. The trumpeter, Philip Harper, had an impish smile, and sang a cheeky version of Everything Happens To Me. Cleave Guyton played the tenor sax, the flute and the piccolo fluidly, and told me to come to Ronnie Scott’s when I was back in London. Vince Dupont played bass, and ducked his head every time he was called “Bubbles” by the bandleader, drummer Winard Harper. Harper was unreal.

Yet Jude Law managed to cause a security scare at a cinema in Bath last week after staff failed to recognise him. Bath Odeon employees were told to monitor a hooded man who was “acting suspiciously” by loitering in the foyer of the cinema last Wednesday. The cinema’s manager had failed to spot that the man was Law, who was trying to keep a low profile while attending a screening of historical drama Detroit. Eventually cinema attendant Connor Walter recognised Law and asked for a picture with him, as well as giving the actor a hand-written message. Law later sent Walter an email thanking him for his “kind note”. “I was working as the ticket tearer stood at the bottom of the stairs, and my manager told me to keep an eye on a man acting suspiciously with his hood up in the main foyer,” Walter told the BBC. “The man spent a good 10 minutes just standing around on the phone, then he came and bought a ticket from one of my colleagues and my colleague who served him the ticket did not recognise him. He came to the bottom of the stairs and I tore his ticket, I looked at his eyes and recognised him, then he said ‘thanks’ and I just knew it was him within an instant. “If I had not been working that night, nobody else would have recognised him as he was very unrecognisable with his black hoodie and beard,” he said. After the screening Walter approached Law and asked for a photo with the actor, before slipping a note “praising him for his work over the years” into his back pocket. Walter later received an email from Law thanking him, and apologising for his swift departure. “From one movie madman to another... thanks for your kind note,” Law wrote. “Sorry I ran off. I am always aware of making a scene in public. Hence the hood! I’m a huge film obsessive too. I love them. Nice to hear someone else does”. Law is currently filming the sequel to JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in the nearby village of Lacock, Wiltshire. The actor will appear as a young version of wizard Albus Dumbledore in the film, the latest in a series of prequels to the author’s Harry Potter books."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/13/golovkin-alvarez-fight-real-deal-mayweather-mcgregor-sideshow","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T16:02:00Z","webTitle":"Golovkin v Álvarez: the real deal after the Mayweather v McGregor sideshow | Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/13/golovkin-alvarez-fight-real-deal-mayweather-mcgregor-sideshow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/13/golovkin-alvarez-fight-real-deal-mayweather-mcgregor-sideshow","fields":{"headline":"Golovkin v Álvarez: the real deal after the Mayweather v McGregor sideshow","bodyText":"It is time for boxing to fix its house. Two weeks after Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor did each other a mutual favour in a cross-discipline public spar that delivered them an estimated $400m to share (the Irishman getting a quarter slice), Gennady Golovkin and Saul “Canelo” Álvarez meet in the same ring on Saturday night to decide who is the best middleweight in the world. It is almost just like the old days. So outstanding are they, and so evenly matched are their skills – Golovkin the walk-forward concussive hitter, Álvarez the dangerous counter-puncher – that the 20,000-seater T-Mobile Arena is sold out. Two Saturdays ago, when punters rebelled at the grotesque asking price of even the cheap seats, it was not. That was a worldwide pay-per-view stunt; this will reach a global TV audience as well, but it is a legitimate fight, the sort of world title event that should occur more regularly in a perennially anarchic business. “I’m very happy, fighting soon in a couple of days in Vegas,” Golovkin said on Tuesday in his halting English. “Too much talking. Before, why not, but last couple of weeks my focus is boxing. I wanna fight. We’re both professional athletes. He’s not a crazy guy. We feel very comfortable. I’ve wanted this fight for a long time, three years.” His chief frustration is that the fight should have been made a long time ago. The situation resembles the five-year wait fans had to endure for Mayweather to agree to meet Manny Pacquiao – and the inevitability of the eventual fight being a disappointment. “I know him a long time,” Golovkin says of Álvarez. “He’s been inside the same weight the last couple of years. He [could fight] anybody. I want this fight since [Álvarez beat Miguel Cotto for the WBC middleweight title in November] 2015. I was in the mandatory position.” Álvarez instead defended against and stopped Amir Khan, then Liam Smith. Golovkin, meanwhile, entertained Kell Brook, then had his toughest night in a while last March before beating Daniel Jacobs to keep his unbeaten record intact. But it has been the Mexican’s team (rather than the fighter) who have procrastinated, claiming he was not big enough for Golovkin. Six years ago, Álvarez beat Matthew Hatton and Ryan Rhodes back-to-back at light-middleweight; the suggestion that he has not moved up because he is not big enough is palpable nonsense. When he knocked out Khan at an agreed 155lbs, he entered the ring a day-and-a-half after the Friday weigh-in 35lbs heavier than the British challenger. In May, he outpointed Julio César Chávez at super-middleweight and, face to face, he looks rock solid at 160lbs. The man Golovkin blames for the delay is Oscar De la Hoya, the promoter. But the former six-weight world champion does not see it that way. He reckons Álvarez has grown into the weight and now is the perfect time for them to meet. There are many who suspect De la Hoya has dragged his feet to allow Golovkin to get a little older, a bit slower, more vulnerable. At 34, Golovkin is seven years older than Álvarez, even though the busy Mexican, who started boxing for money at 15, has had 51 fights: one more than the 41-year-old and newly retired Mayweather – and, more surprisingly, 14 more than the smiling Kazakh. “There are fighters who need a good dancing partner,” the Golden Boy boss insists. “Canelo against Golovkin will go down in history for many years to come. It will be talked about for many years, just like Hearns and Hagler is still being talked about, like Sugar Ray Leonard with Hearns is still being talked about. These are the fights that make it all worthwhile as a promoter.” He added: “I strongly believe this fight will be on that level. Both guys know going into this fight that they are in the hurt business. They are in the fight business. They are not in the whole money business. They are not thinking about it. Yes, the prize at the end of the fight, at the end of the tunnel is the purse, is the money, but they know they must fight hard and with everything they have because they have so much passion for the game and they respect the fans.” Whatever the reason for the wait, this is the most equal match-up out there, in nearly any division, and the most eagerly anticipated. Nobody in either camp is talking with the sort of brash certainty familiar to the industry. The fighters respect each other and they want to settle their argument without unnecessary fuss. Golovkin was not worried about being acclaimed as the best, pound-for-pound, in his sport. “There are so many great boxers, different styles.” It is his first fight in Vegas, but that is not a consideration for him, either. “Vegas, New York … it’s just another ring.” He agreed, though, that this could be a, “history fight’, one to set alongside the memorable middleweight matches of the past, with Marvin Hagler against Tommy Hearns invariably flagged as the most exciting war of the modern era. Golovkin says he watched those two wonderful fighters, along with Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, on TV, when he was a small boy in Kazakhstan. “I’m old school: just one champion. Four champions? No. This is the first step,” he said, referring to their journey along that road to greatness. “I believe we will have a second step, a second fight, maybe more.” At the moment, Golovkin is the man. Regardless of who wins, if the fight lives up to expectations, Golovkin’s desire for a trilogy with Álvarez will be a reality. What a prospect that is."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/13/anglo-saxons-dont-face-death-differently","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T17:09:03Z","webTitle":"‘Anglo-Saxons’ don’t face death differently | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/13/anglo-saxons-dont-face-death-differently","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/13/anglo-saxons-dont-face-death-differently","fields":{"headline":"‘Anglo-Saxons’ don’t face death differently","bodyText":"I’m glad that Kevin Toolis’s father taught him an invaluable lesson in “how to die” (In my father’s wake, Family, 9 September) but why is his article constructed around the narrative that the “Anglo-Saxon” world is in denial about death? Where is his evidence? Having worked as a palliative care social worker with hundreds of dying patients and their families from many different backgrounds, I have never observed any difference in how the “Anglo-Saxons” approach death. Some face death head on and talk about it openly, others carry on as normal until the last minute, some are sad or angry or resigned – and so on. Toolis states that Anglo-Saxons would be very shocked if deaths were announced on local radio. Would they? They might be bored because, as he admits, there are a lot of deaths each day in a city like London. More to the point we are no longer able to announce a death in the local newspaper, as was traditional, as they no longer exist. In the absence of such ways of recognising a death many people now take to social media to pay their respects to the dead. Please don’t let’s have any more stereotyping of the Anglo-Saxons. It is disrespectful both to people trying to face their final illness with dignity and courage, particularly if they have not been fortunate enough to live to an old age, and to those seeking to support them in these harsh times of cuts in public services.

Motherhood is almost as endemic a theme in the genre as the Big Two – sex and death. Indeed, in its most horrific manifestations, it co-opts those as well. Most horror-movie mothers are very, very bad: either sexually repressed, over-possessive, insanely jealous, overbearing or – in the worst-case scenario – all of these things at once. Horror mothers are Freudian nightmares made flesh or, in some cases, ectoplasm. But bad horror mothers come in all shapes, sizes and dispositions. They don’t even necessarily have to be female, as the mother of all horror mothers reminds us. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde: all women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does, unless his name is Norman Bates. In many ways, Mrs Bates is the blueprint for many a horror mother to come: domineering, possessive, jealous, homicidal and dead. In horror movies, mothers are the root of all evil. Even when they don’t actually get blood on their own hands, their bad mothering ensures that blood will be spilt, often by the children whose psyches they’ve twisted out of shape. Freud reminds us that mythological mother goddesses were invariably creators and destroyers. Echoing Nyx and Echidna, who inflict all manner of monstrous and sinister offspring on the world in Greek mythology, Nola Carveth (Samantha Eggar) in David Cronenberg’s The Brood undergoes experimental psychotherapy that enables her to vent her inner rage by giving birth to homicidal mutant dwarves. They enact her subconscious desires, which basically means killing everyone that annoys her. Horror mothers are nearly always angry – either about betrayal, or a failure to appreciate the sacrifices they’ve made – or, especially, when their evil children are harmed. And if there is anything more dangerous than a monster, it’s the monster’s mother, especially if she’s played by a scary mo-cap Angelina Jolie with snakily braided tail, gold stilettos and uncanny valley features as Grendel’s mother in 2007’s Beowulf. Smash those eggs in Aliens and you risk drawing the ire of the egg-laying xenomorph, who will get her own back by trying to co-opt your own surrogate child as an incubator. Werecat Charles Brady (Brian Krause) dismembers a teacher in Sleepwalkers, but he’s a rank amateur compared to his mother (also his lover, since female werecats are apparently thin on the ground). Mary Brady (Alice Krige) outdoes Angelina by cutting a bloody swath through local law enforcement (stabbing one cop through the head with a corn-cob and a “no vegetables, no dessert” wisecrack) before dragging the town virgin (Madchën Amick) back to her house so Charles can suck out the girl’s purple essence, the ultimate gesture of motherly love. But even when morphed into a reptilian-looking werecat, Mary cannot match Vera Cosgrove (Elizabeth Moody) in Peter Jackson’s Braindead for perverse un-maternal grotesquerie. Vera is a jealous and domineering Mrs Bates-type with a homicidal backstory even before she gets bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey and turns into a zombie. Eventually, she mutates into a humungous mumzilla with pendulous breasts, who sucks her zombie-killing son Lionel back into her womb with the words, “No one will ever love you like your mother!” Which is true; even his girlfriend can’t do that. Lionel’s only recourse is to slice his way free of smothering motherliness with a DIY caesarean. While real-life mothers valiantly struggle to assimilate the conflicting advice of parenting experts, the mothering instinct in horror films is all too easily perverted by tragedy into a biblical lust for vengeance. Bereavement, whether of husband or child, is a recurring motif that transforms women into vengeful slasher-movie furies. Sometimes they set their sights on the foetus in another woman’s uterus, such as Béatrice Dalle in Inside, slicing up everyone who gets between her and the embryo she has decided will replace the one she lost. Or they inveigle their way into a family, like Rebecca De Mornay in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, who gets a job as evil nanny to the woman she blames for her own triple trauma of bereavement, miscarriage and hysterectomy. De Mornay also deserves to win a Bad Mother of the Millennium award for Mother’s Day, in which she appears to be modelling herself on Tamora, Queen of the Goths, from Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus, who revels in her sons’ atrocities. De Mornay has raised her boys to be bank robbers, rapists and killers and, possibly deferring to some vague idea that a mother should help shape her children’s hobbies, presides in person over their torture-happy home invasions. As the advertising for another movie had it, “The family that slays together stays together,” a tagline that could also apply to 1974’s Frightmare, in which mumsy Dorothy (Sheila Keith) encourages her daughter Debbie to join her in her favourite pastime, which happens to be cannibalism. Shakespeare’s Tamora was tricked into eating her own sons, baked in a pie, but Dorothy isn’t fussy and just chows down on everyone who calls on her. The bond between mother and child is one of the strongest emotional ties in human nature, so it is hardly surprising that it’s such a regular element in the work of (mostly) male film-makers seeking relatable motivation for their female protagonists without having to think too deeply about metaphysics. Sometimes, though, it makes you wonder about the directors’ own relationships with their mothers. Psycho is not the only Alfred Hitchcock film to feature a domineering mother; Hitchcock himself admitted to having been traumatised by his own mum, who famously punished him by forcing him stand for hours at the foot of the bed, a personal memory he assigned to Norman Bates in Psycho. In horror movies, maternal grief or jealousy is so amplified it can persist beyond the grave, particularly when it comes to ghosts whose very femaleness is judged (by men) to make them more emotionally unstable than their male counterparts, as though death has stopped their body clocks at the wrong time of the month in perpetuity. There is a monstrousness to motherly urges, which have a malevolent disregard for fairness or justice. Like Medea, who butchered her own babies to get back at her ex, all they want is revenge. And in their primal rage they don’t care who gets it in the neck. In The Woman in Black, the phantom of Jennet Humfrye avenges the accidental death of her child by claiming the lives of children or lawyers who stray into her district. Likewise, the ghost mother in Mama is mourning her dead baby and doesn’t find it at all inappropriate that she should salve her grief by luring a couple of living kiddies off the edge of a cliff. Maybe she didn’t love her dead baby as dearly as she thinks if she’s prepared to swap it for the very next child she lays eyes on. Another mother driven homicidal by bereavement is Mrs Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) in Friday the 13th, who hacks her way through a bunch of randy camp counsellors she blames for the accidental death of her son Jason (even though he’s not actually dead, since in the sequel he’s revived to inherit his mother’s love for slashing and hacking, and carries on doing it for another 10 films). If only Mrs Voorhees had been told of her error and reunited with her child in that first film, the whole thrust of the franchise might have turned out a sight less … stabby. Horror mothers do not necessarily start out as monsters. Motherhood is one of the most taxing responsibilities any woman can be faced with, and even the most saintly real-life mum can be driven to distraction by sleep deprivation, financial worries and wilful toddlers. Horror movies simply amp up the pressure to an intolerable degree. Insecurity, guilt and resentment open a doorway to stressed mothers being possessed by the spirits of baby-killing witches, photosensitive ghosts or bogeymen from the pages of children’s books. But, for all their susceptibility to the forces of darkness, possessed mothers do essentially have their children’s best interests at heart. One can also sympathise with the oblivious mothers, those workaholic grownups who fail to understand or even notice their children’s grim ordeals in films such as Let the Right One In or It Follows. At least their neglect stays on the acceptable side of child abuse, unlike Victoria Tennant in Flowers in the Attic, who doesn’t just keep her kids locked up but feeds them arsenic-laced cookies so she can deny their existence and collect her inheritance. Stir religion and sexual repression into the mum-mix, and you have an even more poisonous recipe for murderous mayhem. Tallulah Bankhead as Mrs Trefoile in Die! Die! My Darling! doesn’t just hold her dead son’s ex-fiancee Pat (Stefanie Powers) prisoner in her mansion but blathers on about “vile bodies”, pelts her with endless Bible readings and throws a wobbly when Pat asks her to pass the salt. “God’s food should be eaten unadorned!” rants Mrs Trefoile. “We are vegetarian. For instance, this meat loaf is synthetic, compounded of bread, oatmeal and wheatgerm.” Which sounds almost as unappetising as the arsenic-laced cookies of Flowers in the Attic. But a blind love of Jesus can be enough to turn horror mothers into child-abusing harridans even without bereavement. Poor Carrie is not half as scary as her mother, Mrs White (Piper Laurie), whose festering guilt about once having had sex makes her lock the fruit of that copulation in a cupboard and harangue her with deluded nonsense about sin, dirty pillows and the evil colour red (a trait she shares with Mrs Trefoile in Die! Die! My Darling!). Mrs White may not be directly accountable for her daughter killing half her classmates with her deadly telekinetic abilities, but she sure as hell is responsible for warping Carrie’s character out of shape by withholding vital sex education and insisting everyone will laugh at her. If only Carrie had been more conversant with the facts of life she wouldn’t have been so traumatised by her period, and having pig’s blood tipped all over her at the prom might not have triggered that catastrophic psychic meltdown. In the end, Mrs White is fully prepared to kill her own daughter for being, as she imagines, an evil witch – though by any standards it’s the mother who is the real monster here. Medea had nothing on these mums, whose attitude to sex has been so deformed by guilt they are prepared to sacrifice their own progeny rather than face up to their own tortured consciences. In 2015’s The Witch, the mother’s unquestioning embrace of a misogynistic belief system redirects her own sexual shame towards her daughter, whom she tries to strangle: “The devil is in thee and hath had thee. You are smeared of his sin. You reek of evil!” It’s little wonder the daughter prefers the company of a horny goat and wanders off into the woods, where she can likely find herself a more supportive matriarchal figure among the baby-eating witches. Possessive or neglectful, encouraging or abusive, horror mothers invariably get it wrong, even more so than their real-life counterparts. But it is hard not to feel sorry for genuinely well-meaning parents such as Chris MacNeil in The Exorcist, who does the best she can when Pazuzu makes her daughter puke pea soup. And there is at least one other horror movie mother who does everything right, in theory, but still ends up with the short end of the stick. When Rosemary (Mia Farrow) learns the truth about her pregnancy in Rosemary’s Baby, her maternal instincts trump her understandable squeamishness at having been forced to give birth to the spawn of Satan. Rosemary is clearly a good horror mother. Who knows, maybe she can even raise her devil baby to be a good kid, though the history of horror mothers suggests it will be an uphill struggle, and that she’ll probably end up with a son who’ll make Norman Bates, Jason Voorhees and Carrie seem like paragons of selfless humanitarian benevolence.

The silence should have pleased the chancellor, who in the wake of the VW emissions scandal has hinted at a possible ban on sales of the diesel cars for which German manufacturers are renowned. German cities plagued by air pollution, including Munich, home of BMW, are mulling over the banning of diesels from their centres. Internationally, the UK and France recently promised to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040, while carmakers including Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover have raced to pledge electrification of their future models. The summer of love for battery cars prompted newspaper editorials heralding the end of the internal combustion engine. One bank even forecast that all new car sales in Europe would be electric within two decades. Meanwhile, diesel car values have plummeted. So it should perhaps come as no surprise that electric cars have taken centre stage at the Frankfurt motor show, which opens to the public on Saturday. BMW is showing off a new version of its popular i3 battery-powered car and new battery-powered Minis. Rival Mercedes-Benz has introduced a futuristic concept electric car, the EQA, which has pride of place at the centre of its hall, and the company’s chief executive promised all models from 2022 will be electrified to some degree. France’s Renault unveiled a concept electric car that could double as a backup battery for the home. Japan’s Honda launched a boxy battery-powered concept car, the Urban EV, which European motorists will be able to buy in 2019. “This is not some vision of the distant future,” said the Honda chief executive, Takahiro Hachigo, as he also pledged that all the company’s new models in Europe would soon be either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or fully electric. South Korean challenger Hyundai said more than half the models it sells in Europe by 2020 will be battery-powered. So is the internal combustion engine’s century-long reign coming to an end? The carmakers here do not seriously believe that, despite the rhetoric and the prominence of battery models. “That’s just hype,” said BMW’s Robert Irlinger, of the notion that conventional engines were dead. Irlinger, who heads the firm’s “i” electric division, expects electric models to make up only 15%-20% of the firm’s sales by 2025. “There is a change and we are really starting with electrified cars, but we do not hide our normal cars,” he said, adding that the company was putting a “huge amount of money” into the development of battery-powered cars. One Mercedes-Benz executive said that with €10bn committed to work on electric vehicles it was, if anything, overinvesting in the technology compared with its peers. “It’s something that might be overhyped,” said Jürgen Schenck, the company’s head of e-drive integration, of the suggestion petrol and diesel cars were finished. “We’re intent to go on with diesel … it is a good technology for [cutting] carbon emissions.” A ban on diesels entering German cities would, he said, be a “crazy idea”. Indeed, the European car manufacturers’ association argues that diesel is still the only serious way to meet future EU carbon targets, despite concerns over air quality. Dieter Zetsche, the president of the ACEA, said: “Any rash move away from this technology [diesel] would make it harder to meet the [European] commission’s [carbon] targets.” With electric and plug-in hybrid cars making up just 1.2% of new car sales in Europe today, he called for a reality check on how big a contribution they could make to carbon cuts. “When it comes to market uptake of electric vehicles we have to look at the reality. The reality is the market uptake of these vehicles remains low. It’s not due to a lack of availability: all ACEA members are expanding their portfolios of electric vehicles, you can see proof of that on display here,” said Zetsche. “We don’t see the immediate death of the combustion engine,” said Joe Bakaj, vice-president of product development at Ford of Europe, which sees more efficient diesel as the most cost-effective way to cut carbon emissions in the short term. “We’re not seeing a strong pull [from customers] on battery electric vehicles. There’s a lot of talk, a lot of hype, but there aren’t a lot of customer numbers.” He blames their limited driving range, upfront price and a shortage of charging points as reasons why. The issue of the limited charging point infrastructure is cited by many carmakers at Frankfurt as a barrier to electric car takeup. Steven Armstrong, Ford’s president in Europe, said investment was needed in ageing infrastructure. “This is particularly true of the challenge facing our efforts to scale up the operation of electric vehicles in cities where we already have a strained energy grid,” he said, announcing a joint venture with Aldi, Daimler and Porsche to fit fast-charging points along Europe’s motorways. Chargepoint, a North American charging firm entering the UK market, points out that most electric cars are topped up at home or work. Moreover, because take-up of the cars will be gradual, so can the roll-out of chargers. “You don’t need to fully build all the infrastructure before you sell the first car,” said Pasquale Romano, the company’s chief executive. But while electric models have taken pride of place on many of the carmakers’ displays in Frankfurt this week, they are still hugely outnumbered by petrol and diesel vehicles. The big launch for Toyota, the Japanese carmaker synonymous with hybrids, was a Land Cruiser with a choice of a huge petrol or diesel engine. Nonetheless, most manufacturers agree that the endgame in the long-term is probably electric. “There isn’t a plan B, this is plan A: we go electric,” said Schenck at Mercedes-Benz. “What is sure is electric vehicles will increase dramatically. We feel the tipping point has been reached,” said Guillaume Berthier, chief of sales and marketing for electric vehicles at Renault, which has seen a 40% increase in battery electric vehicles this year. And there are plenty of reasons an electric switch might come sooner than many think: a higher oil price, changes in taxation and, most worrying for the European motor industry, the diesel exclusion zones being mulled in many European cities. “That,” said Bakaj, “could change things very quickly.” Electric cars to buy today FULLY ELECTRIC Nissan Leaf £16,680 (plus battery leasing), 155-mile range The Leaf is a small family car that has been around long enough that used ones can be bought for less than £7,000. Alternatively you could wait until next year for the new version, which has a longer, 255-mile range. BMW i3 £28,570, 125 miles This head-turning model is a large part of the reason BMW has sold more than 150,000 electric cars in Europe. If the range puts you off, there’s the option of a version with a small petrol engine with extends its reach to 206 miles. Renault Zoe £14,245 (plus battery leasing), 250 miles Cheap and cheerful, the Zoe also has a battery capable of rivalling some Teslas, though its supermini size won’t be big enough for everyone. HYBRIDS Toyota Prius plug-in £29,195 A halfway house between petrol and electric cars, the plug-in version of Toyota’s iconic hybrid can travel 39 miles on battery power – enough for most local journeys and commutes – with the reassurance of a petrol engine for cross-country trips. Hyundai IONIQ £22,385 (hybrid), £24,995 (electric), £27,495 (plug-in hybrid) South Korean manufacturer Hyundai is the first to offer a model you can buy either as a hybrid – the lowest level of electrification – all the way to a plug-in hybrid and through to a 100% electric version. Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV £31,805 This SUV plug-in hybrid runs 33 miles on electricity before its petrol engine kicks in and has been wildly popular, becoming the UK’s best-selling plug-in electric car in recent years.

Somewhere in the world an important tournament is under way and on subscription TV. The less seriously committed are faced with the long inter-slam drought between the US and Australian Opens. Fortunately palliatives are at hand in the form of two movies, Battle of the Sexes and Borg vs McEnroe. The first film is about the 1973 match between Billie Jean King and the self-proclaimed male chauvinist pig and former world No 1 Bobby Riggs; the second focuses on the 1980 Wimbledon final. They are linked by the way that in 2000 Donald Trump offered John McEnroe a million dollars to play either of the Williams sisters at one of his hotels. As McEnroe recounted in his 2002 autobiography Serious, the sisters’ claim that “they could beat ranked male players” prompted him to respond that “any respectable male player, be it a top college competitor, a senior player, or a professional, could beat them”. Trump stumped up the money but the Williamses “came to their senses and put out a statement that they didn’t want to play against ‘an old man’”. That was the end of that until this summer when McEnroe published a sequel, But Seriously – a book even well-disposed critics had trouble taking seriously – and, possibly as a controversy-provoking way to nudge it up the rankings, ventured the opinion that Serena would be ranked around 700 on the men’s tour. She volleyed back that he should respect her privacy – at about the time that she had appeared naked and pregnant on the cover of Vanity Fair. History has a way of repeating itself, first as farce and then as farce. The difference is that the first time around, when 29-year-old King played the 55-year-old Riggs, it was precisely the farcical nature of the encounter that made it so serious. Riggs, as King understood, was a clown and a hustler, and the more ridiculous his antics the more demeaning it would be if she lost. Especially since he had already beaten Margaret Court who, exactly as predicted, wilted under the pressure of the occasion. So while Riggs did everything he could to publicise the forthcoming bout, King trained for it. Since all of this – build-up, match and aftermath – was filmed, recut and retold in an excellent recent documentary, the question is whether there was any need to re-enact the story in a biopic. Perhaps the fact that there was no need freed the film-makers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris to come up with a striking piece of cinema in a way that the similarly superfluous Selma never managed. Emma Stone is wonderful as Billie Jean (so wonderful as to make one wonder: was she quite so charming in real life?) and Steve Carell’s Riggs is a far more nuanced – and tormented – character than the cartoon sexist he gleefully set himself up to be. As BJK realises, Riggs is both a colourful manifestation of and an energetic distraction from the blazered patriarchy at work behind the scenes. More subtly, camerawork and design do not just capture the colours and textures of the early 1970s – how can one not adore the sun-swept, traffic-less freeways of California? – but also a broader sense of historic convergence. An altogether less dramatic moment in the vexed history of the sexes occurs in Rebecca West’s immense book about Yugoslavia, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon. The author is in a restaurant in Pristina in the 1930s, when a man and a woman enter, the woman carrying “the better part of a plough on her back”. The sight of “unrestricted masculinism” of this kind is “disgusting” to West, less because of the effect on women “who are always taught something by the work they do, but because of the nullification of the men”. In a hectic schedule of publicising matches, flogging tickets, looking pretty and playing tennis with each other – plus, in BJK’s case, having her first lesbian love affair – the rebellious women on the tour are seen having a high old time. With the exception of Billie Jean’s devoted dude of a husband – the most poignant scenes in the film show him taping ice to her aching knees – and the gay costumiers on the women’s nascent tour, the men remain imprisoned by what they unthinkingly thought they were preserving. If anything the fact that the result was so clear-cut – Riggs got his ass royally kicked in straight sets – makes the waters seem less turbulent than they were. Contrast the well-orchestrated hoopla of the match in Houston with a debate on feminism in New York two years earlier, as preserved in the documentary Town Bloody Hall. Holding the fort in the name of… well, himself really, Norman Mailer struggles manfully to fend off a gang of marauding brainy women including Susan Sontag, Germaine Greer and Diana Trilling. It’s all just talk but the anarchic swirl and passion of the event make the Houston contest seem as decorous as a mixed-doubles match at Wimbledon. In Battle of the Sexes, Stone/King recalls how, as a little girl, she was excluded from a team photograph because she was wearing shorts. At that moment she decided to take up her racket-cudgel on behalf of womankind. This stand casts her as an infant Jeanne d’Arc, predestined for saintly and bespectacled greatness. That, I suppose, is part of the attraction of politically symbolic sporting events such as Jack Johnson v James J Jeffries or Jesse Owens v the Nazis in Berlin in 1936. They make everything simple, while life proves stubbornly resistant to resolution by knockout or tie-break. Still, better King v Riggs than Borg v McEnroe which seems entirely – and for a tennis film fatally – pointless. The outcome of the match is known in advance and nothing except that result is at stake – unless you buy into the idea that somehow McEnroe, “the kid from Queens”, as the lawyer’s son never tires of describing himself, was somehow trying to bring down the English ruling elite as symbolised by the lawns of SW19 and the umpires who were their myopic custodians. The film retains vestiges of interest, only if one attends to everything except its titular match-up. Waiting to come on court for the final, Björn and John sit on a bench beneath the famous lines from Kipling: “If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster / And treat those two impostors just the same…” It’s as if the audience’s doubts have been projected on screen! The film is really a Best Impostor contest, but it’s impossible to treat the contestants in the same way. Sverrir Gudnason looks so like Borg it makes one conscious of how unlike McEnroe Shia LaBeouf looks. Method-wise, LaBeouf would seem to have had the advantage in that he has acted like a jerk in real life, and McEnroe’s inner life has been demonstrably and repeatedly expressed on court and off. With McEnroe forever acting up – contractually obliged, it seems, to reprise the role of his tantrum-prone younger self even on the senior circuit – LaBeouf is left with little to do except brood on how his hair looks more like Bob Dylan’s than Johnny Mac’s. Borg, meanwhile, remains a mystery. McEnroe/LaBeouf suspects that the reason his opponent sleeps in a hotel room with the AC turned up to arctic frigidity is not that he’s an ice-borg; he’s really a volcano about to erupt. We know this is true because of the scenes from Borg’s adolescence where he seems to be getting in character for the racket-smashing role of forever-young McEnroe/Dylan. His trainer persuades him to harness those tears of rage and express them solely through forehands and backhands. Where, to rephrase Eric Liddell’s moving speech in Chariots of Fire, does the rage come from? Partly because he’s been told tennis is not for certain classes of person. More generally – and the film is necessarily vague on this score – from some non-specific Scandinavian malaise: an all-court rumble of Hamlet, Kierkegaard, Ibsen and Strindberg, barely held in check by a sweaty headband. (Or could it be caused by the headband?) So while LaBeouf is playing superbrat in a tennis flick, Gudnason wanders around as if marooned in an Ingmar Bergman film directed neither by Bergman nor his acolyte Woody Allen but by Janus Metz. “What’s going on in that head of yours?” people keep asking. No one knows and nothing in the script rivals the way the question was framed by the poet William Scammell when he wondered whether it was “chess against a breaking wave / or just some corny Abba tune”. Which leaves us, as always, with the tennis. In this regard the critical heart of the matter was articulated years ago by my dad. I was watching a Woody Allen film on TV, a sequence in which Allen’s character plays squash. My dad had no idea who Allen was but after watching for a few minutes said, “The li’l un’s not up to much is he!” It’s as simple as that. Can the tennis players in these films play tennis? Yes they can. I assume that this is a product of technology whereby the heads of the actors can be grafted on to the bodies of their doubles. But the issue is not only whether they can play tennis well enough. They have also to be able to play oldly enough. Compared with today, tennis of the 1970s looks a leisurely, almost sub-aqua affair, but any difference in overall quality is also a technologically induced illusion. Only pole-vaulting has been as thoroughly reconfigured by advances in equipment as tennis. Stone’s last big hit, La La Land, negotiated a similar problem. Can she and Ryan Gosling dance like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers? No they can’t. The solution is to let the camera do the dancing. In the battle to replicate the actual tennis, Battle of the Sexes is more effective than Borg vs McEnroe for exactly the opposite reason. Whereas in the latter the camera is down there on court, moving in close and scampering after the ball, the former opts for viewing the match as though on TV: a reminder that although as a tennis match it was pretty silly, it was the spectacle – seeing Riggs make a spectacle of himself in front of a television audience of 90 million – that mattered. Aesthetically it also takes us back to the 1970s when cameras were not able to immerse us in every-angle HD closeups of the shifting narrative increments of a match. Ironies abound. The celebration of women’s tennis being taken seriously comes at a time when women’s tennis is in danger of becoming seriously boring, as endless players from eastern Europe and beyond – “all these new -ovas”, as Venus Williams wittily put it – thump the ball into the middle of the second week. There have been quite a few one-sided semis and finals in recent years but the close-fought conclusion to this year’s tournament at Indian Wells between Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Vesnina was a prolonged exercise in endurance – for anyone watching. The problem is not a lack of personalities; it is the surfeit of women whose games are all but indistinguishable from each other. Qualities traditionally identified as feminine – grace, delicacy and beauty – have become the exclusive preserve of the men’s game. (The dudes even cry more than the chicks!) I say “preserve” because those qualities have long been endangered in the men’s game too. Watching John Isner, Kevin Anderson and Sam Querrey remains one of the less edifying sporting experiences available. We have become used to dads like Mike Agassi and Richard Williams pushing their kids to become players from infancy. The next move might well be to breed monstrously tall, big-servers in a laboratory. In spite of this, the men’s game is presently more pleasing to the eye than the women’s. This was not always the case. Mischa Zverev is lauded as a throwback to the serve-and-volley heyday of Wimbledon – but hey, that day often comprised serve minus volley. To go from Ivan Lendl plying his joyless trade to watching Steffi Graf play was like seeing the covers coming off after a rain delay had somehow assumed human form. And then – to cut a long story short – along came Roger Federer, who was blessed with power, subtlety and grace. David Foster Wallace famously described Federer as “Mozart and Metallica at the same time”. Women’s matches these days often resemble a mashup between Metallica and a Metallica tribute act. Lacking equivalents of the unpredictable Gaël Monfils or the dreadlocked Dustin Brown, the women’s game remains deadlocked in the power phase. Let’s put it as simply as possible. Since the retirement of the glorious Justine Henin-Hardenne none of the top women play with a single-handed backhand. Without single-handed backhands the potential for beauty in tennis is severely cramped. The final irony is that one emerges from Borg vs McEnroe fascinated not by the rivalry, but by the legendary tie-break after which, as Tim Adams memorably put it in his book On Being John McEnroe, Borg came out for the fifth set “as if nothing had happened”. That, as Adams writes, was one of the great moments in sport. But a great film could potentially be made about the nothing that did happen, after Borg retired at the precocious age of 26, after he turned his back on everything that gave his life meaning, or kept the lack of meaning at bay: a film, that is, about what happens to volcanoes after they opt for extinction. It could be so boring. It could be Bergmanesque. Borg vs McEnroe is released on Friday; Battle of the Sexes is out on 24 Nov.

Then you laid them out and comforted grieving relatives before getting back to work as though nothing had happened. No counselling, no break, no time. That doesn’t happen every day, but as a theatre nurse it can happen. Even on so-called quiet days, I’m always in a heightened state of alert and I have to be prepared. It’s a privileged job but it comes with an incredible weight of responsibility. On the night of the Manchester Arena attack in May, I was at home. Like many of my colleagues, I dropped everything and turned up at the hospital to help. The skill, compassion and dedication of NHS staff was humbling. Everyone from cleaners to consultants, healthcare assistants to nurses, went above and beyond the call of duty. Nurses deal with traumatic events every day. And every day we stay late and miss breaks because we won’t leave our patients stranded. It’s not a job for us: it’s a vocation. We don’t want the violins or the plaudits; we just want recognition and respect. Fair pay is central to that. People who are underpaid are undervalued, and it’s that message – “You’re not worth a pay rise” – that undermines our profession in the eyes of the public and destroys our morale. In the past seven years, nurses’ salaries have plummeted in real terms by 14%. During the same period the price of food and utilities has rocketed. Some of my colleagues are forced to work extra shifts with agencies and resort to using food banks just to make ends meet. Stress and anxiety are through the roof. A friend of mine has panic attacks at the thought of going to work. Nurses, and the NHS, are always at the bottom of this government’s priorities. Having dismissed public sector workers as “this and that” earlier this week, Theresa May offered prison and police officers a pay rise on Tuesday. I don’t begrudge them that. They deserve it, as do we. But with inflation at almost 3%, the so-called pay rise amounts to a pay cut, which in any event would be funded by cuts elsewhere in the service. Nurses and my NHS colleagues were yet again kicked into the long grass. There’s a shortage of 30,000 nurses in England alone. This is a crisis brought about by the government’s refusal to lift the pay cap and its failure to train enough nurses. It has been exacerbated by the recent scrapping of bursaries for student nurses and the EU referendum result. The number of nurses from the EU registering to work in the UK has dropped by 96% since Brexit. On top of that, the majority of nurses are over 50 and counting the days to retirement. Such is the crisis that our normally compliant profession voted in May to ballot for strike action over pay. That’s unprecedented in the Royal College of Nursing’s 101-year history. I’ve been a nurse for 20 years and things have never been this bad. I was one of the lucky ones. I came into nursing when there were bursaries, when you didn’t have to go into debt to be a nurse, when patient care came before cuts and when nursing was still a valued profession. Most NHS staff are too frightened to speak out, and it’s not without trepidation that I do so, but my profession is in crisis and I owe it to the next generation of nurses to voice my concerns. Until the pay cap is lifted, the NHS will continue to haemorrhage nurses and the recruitment crisis will intensify. Despite that, I’m proud to be a nurse and of my nursing colleagues who, no matter what this government throws at us, will always go the extra mile for our patients."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/14/the-other-one-review-a-sisterly-sitcom-driven-more-by-narrative-than-gags","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T05:02:33Z","webTitle":"The Other One review – a sisterly sitcom driven more by narrative than gags","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/14/the-other-one-review-a-sisterly-sitcom-driven-more-by-narrative-than-gags","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/14/the-other-one-review-a-sisterly-sitcom-driven-more-by-narrative-than-gags","fields":{"headline":"The Other One review – a sisterly sitcom driven more by narrative than gags","bodyText":"There is a lovely start to The Other One (BBC2). Well, it’s not lovely for Colin, or really a start for him, more like an end, the end. It’s his birthday; his wife and daughter are throwing him a surprise birthday party. Trouble is, the surprise party exposes the Big Lie that Colin has been harbouring. Not only is he cheating on his wife but he has a whole other family, a mistress and another daughter (also called Catherine Walcott, to avoid mix-ups). The shock of suddenly being so publicly found out is too much for poor Colin; he has a heart attack, and sadly dies. Surprise! The end – of the show – is rather nice, too. Colin’s ashes are scattered, by his daughters, the Catherine Walcotts, in a layby. Not because it was a favourite layby, but because it’s exactly equidistant between where the Catherines live, and it was all they could agree on. Meanwhile, in the same layby by happy coincidence, Colin’s wife Tess is having sex with a man she’s just met on the internet (Guardian Soulmates as it happens: it makes me proud to work where I do), in his car. Well, trying to have sex, it’s not going that well. The Kia might have scored well on fuel efficiency in Which Car but it’s rubbish for sex in the front. Plus Tess’s kaftan is in the way a bit, and she’s not really over Colin to be honest, even if he was a lying, cheating, hypocritical bastard. He does finally get a better send-off: his ashes swept up off the layby (along with the odd fag butt), packed into a distress flare and fired into the Manchester night sky. Aww. But this is not about Colin. It is about Tess (Rebecca Front). And it’s about her love rival Marilyn (Siobhan Finneran). And it’s about the two Catherines, Cathy and Cat (Ellie White and Lauren Socha, respectively). It is these four women who fill the bit between the start and the end, and they do so very well. A lot of the humour comes from the social chasm between the half-sisters. Cathy is in reinsurance; she’s organised and prissy, and she has a dull fiance called Marcus (though that might be in jeopardy after he sent some inadvisable picture texts and it looks as though his penis is about to go viral, flapping about all over social media). Cat works at Deliveroo and isn’t with anyone at the moment. “Well, this summer I finally completed Tinder so I’m just taking a bit of a breather,” she tells her new sister. Finally completed Tinder! That’s a very good joke isn’t it? Hats off Holly Walsh, who wrote it. And it seems Cat really has completed Tinder; she knows every minor male character on it, knows them very well. Perhaps surprisingly, Cathy and Cat do find common ground. Not just because they share genes and a dad, but also a love of Supertramp (even if that obviously came via him). Nothing bridges a social chasm quite like a good 70s guilty pleasure carpool karaoke singalong. Like a king without a castle, Like a queen without a throne, I’m an early morning lover, And I must be moving on … Lovely – and so very different – from White and Socha. Though perhaps unsurprisingly, it’s Front who nicks the show off them. She wears the role like she wears that kaftan: exuberantly, with loads of colour and relish, and a bursting out a little. It’s good to see a comedy pilot that is more about character and narrative momentum than it is about gags. And one that doesn’t come with laughter included; you get to decide yourself whether to or not, almost like you’re an adult. I am not convinced the premise screams six-episode series, but I’d be delighted to be proved wrong. My Hotter Half (E4) looks as though it totally fulfils the Channel 4 remit. Melvin Odoom, presenting, even says “think of it as a public service”. Couple Charlotte and Darren both think they’re better looking than the other. Darren is certainly buff. “Someone call a vet cos those swans are sick, bro,” says Melvin. About his biceps, obviously. (I know what it means as I get it quite a lot, too. Maybe I’ll go on with my girlfriend, just so she knows she’s punching too.) They take selfies and the public get to decide who is right. I think it can claim innovation, and maybe diversity.

As the head of the institute’s directing programme, director Claire Simon (Gare du Nord) has an insider’s understanding of the process but films the endless debates between examiners with a cool detachment, seemingly taking no sides. Ultimately, this is much less about the applicants than about the teachers and industry professionals who give up their time to decide who is worthy of pursuing a career. It’s clear that they want to run it as meritocratically as possible, but what’s interesting is how the criteria for what talent is and who gets to judge it come up for debate. About halfway through, one examiner defends an applicant’s poor communication skills by pointing that the “director of Drive” (ie Nicolas Winding Refn) has zero communication skills with his crew on set, but look at what a great film-maker he is. It takes all types, and a village, and a lot of determination to make it to the folding chair behind the camera."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/15/were-in-the-foothills-premierships-attempt-to-crack-america-reaches-philly","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T13:00:08Z","webTitle":"'We're in the foothills' – Premiership's attempt to crack America reaches Philly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/15/were-in-the-foothills-premierships-attempt-to-crack-america-reaches-philly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/15/were-in-the-foothills-premierships-attempt-to-crack-america-reaches-philly","fields":{"headline":"'We're in the foothills' – Premiership's attempt to crack America reaches Philly","bodyText":"Premiership Rugby and the promoter of Newcastle v Saracens in Philadelphia expected the game to sell out. Expectations have been adjusted. When the teams run out at the Talen Energy Stadium on Saturday, around 10,000 are expected to attend. That would be 8,500 below capacity and 4,800 down on the crowd for last year’s US game, when Sarries beat London Irish in New Jersey. “We’re in the foothills,” said Dominic Hayes, Premiership Rugby’s commercial director. “In 20 years’ time hopefully we’ll be looking back and seeing rugby with traction in the US market. That journey has got to begin somewhere.” This week, Hayes and executives from seven clubs have met the local government and the city’s Eagles (NFL), Phillies (MLB) and Union (MLS). “We’re here to build,” he said. “We’re in this long-term, to find the optimum date for the fixture. It’s about more than just this game.” Accordingly, there have been coaching clinics for players and referees and offers of scholarships for American players to train in the UK. Before the main match, Oxford University will face the Collegiate All Americans. Still, bums on seats count. The former Bath, Leicester and US Eagles No8 Dan Lyle, now director of the promoter, AEG Rugby, said: “We’ve shifted another couple thousand of tickets in the last couple of days. It’s partly a timing thing: week three of the Premiership, a week after kids go back to school both in the UK and the US. In year two we’ll learn the lessons from this.” Irish-Sarries was a hard sell too. In its favour it took place in March, away from the NFL and college football, and it was close to New York, a bigger tourist draw. More importantly, little American rugby was played that day. In the crowd at the Red Bull Arena, as when 22,000 watched USA v Ireland in June, many wore the colours of school, college or club. Rugby in the US is largely participatory, played in autumn and spring. On Saturday, from the Potomac Exiles in Maryland to Mystic River in Massachusetts, many who might have bought Premiership tickets will play their own games instead. Alexander Diegel, a writer who plays for Old Gaelic near Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital, said Newcastle-Saracens “would be right down our alley. Except that it’s also the day of our home opener. Most guys, if not all, they’ve opted to play our match. And with the 5pm kickoff it doesn’t really afford enough time to rush over and catch the game live in Philly.” Lyle said: “When they designated this weekend as the best for broadcast and for the Premiership, it wasn’t looked at in terms of what’s best to galvanise crowds. “There are a lot of rugby players and fans but they may not yet know who Owen Farrell is, who Maro Itoje is. We’re in the beginning of year two of the Premiership being on US TV. These are hand-in-glove strategies we will have to develop.” It should be pointed out that in the ordinary run of things, 10,000 for Newcastle v Saracens would be an encouraging figure. Newcastle, the home team, are the second-lowest-supported Premiership club. Their Kingston Park opener this month, a 35-8 win over Worcester, attracted 5,875. Saracens’ home, Allianz Park, holds 10,000. Furthermore, the game will be broadcast across the US and its promoter is working hard. Sarries’ Chris Wyles threw out the first pitch at a Phillies’ game against the Miami Marlins; the Newcastle coach, David Walder, went to Geno’s Steaks to learn how to make – and eat – the city’s cheesy signature dish. Some Philly sportswriters were even introduced to rugby skills, rules and terminology at a special AEG clinic. They needed the primer. As the former USA head coach John Mitchell said this week, Philly is not a rugby city. Jonathan Tannenwald, the Major League Soccer writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer, said: “If you try to do much of anything in this town during football season, it risks getting drowned out.” The Eagles are in Missouri to face the Chiefs on Sunday but the bars and backpages are awash with debate about the head coach, Doug Pederson. “There isn’t a lot of brand recognition for rugby here,” Tannenwald said. “It’s different if it’s the US national team, because they have a travelling fan base plus the fan base of the other team. In November of 2013, the US played the Maori All Blacks here … and sold the building out.” From the moment a typical Philly crowd greeted the haka with jeers and shouts of “U-S-A”, the Maori were given a fright. Bigger events followed in Chicago with the All Blacks, Australia and Ireland. In Europe, commercial directors took notice. This week, reports resurfaced of Pro14 plans to place a team on the east coast. “I know they have been looking for a long time at how to develop the Pro14 footprint here,” Hayes said. “The key is to make sure you work in conjunction with the other union and with American players.” The USA Rugby chief executive Dan Payne is in Philly this weekend, to see a fascinating game. Newcastle have beaten Worcester and Sale, but Sarries are a big step up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/17/mother-review-a-full-house-of-horrors-darren-aronofsky-jennifer-lawrence","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T08:00:35Z","webTitle":"Mother! review – a complicated labour for Jennifer Lawrence…","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/17/mother-review-a-full-house-of-horrors-darren-aronofsky-jennifer-lawrence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/17/mother-review-a-full-house-of-horrors-darren-aronofsky-jennifer-lawrence","fields":{"headline":"Mother! review – a complicated labour for Jennifer Lawrence…","bodyText":"“Nothing is ever enough – I couldn’t create if it was!” You have to admire writer-director Darren Aronofsky’s almost religious devotion to the parable-like possibilities of hyperventilating, surrealist cinema. Having caught critics’ attention with the cult low-budget sci-fi oddity Pi and proved his gritty mettle with Requiem for a Dream, Aronofsky gave us time-straddling cosmic madness in The Fountain, combined ballet with metamorphic fantasy in Black Swan, and conjured gigantic rock-monsters in the quasi-biblical babble-fest Noah. Now with Mother!, a paranoid nightmare that starts out like Polanski’s Repulsion and winds up closer to Apocalypse Now, he has stretched the envelope of outrageous mainstream cinema to breaking point – and beyond. We start and end in flames, with an image of a fiery face giving way to a mysterious crystal, which breathes life and light into a charred, blackened house. This is the home of Javier Bardem’s “Him” (all characters are unnamed), nurtured anew by Jennifer Lawrence’s devoted wife. Octagonal in shape, the house variously resembles a vast temple and a panopticon prison, with a sinister hint of the haunted lair from The Amityville Horror. It is a living presence, with a heartbeat that thrums through its walls and floorboards, umbilically linked to Lawrence’s barefoot “Mother” who harbours as-yet-unrealised dreams of parenthood. Within this Edenic idyll, Bardem’s jaded poet is failing to write his masterpiece – until the arrival of a mysterious stranger (Ed Harris) and his glamorous, garrulous spouse (Michelle Pfeiffer) tickles his egotistical fancy. Seemingly blind to his wife’s nesting instincts, the poet revels in the adoring chaos these outsiders bring. Gradually, Mother!’s anxieties about breach of privacy turn to something closer to home invasion horror, with the narrative straying into the territory of Graham Greene’s short story The Destructors. And then things start getting wild at heart and crazy on top. Aronofsky has said that the first draft of Mother! poured out of him in a five-day “fever dream” and it’s tempting to review the result in similarly spontaneous fashion. Yet more than any other of Aronofsky’s works, this is a film that demands distance and decompression. In the screening room I found Mother! an increasingly exasperating experience – a claustrophobic exercise in ghastly black comedy; relentless, ridiculous, and occasionally panic-inducing. Yet give it time to settle, and the labour pains of watching Mother! produce something that you could grow to love. The narrative can be read in any number of ways: as a Rosemary’s Baby-style expression of antenatal paranoia; as a war-of-the-sexes fable about older men feeding upon the support of younger women; even as a simple tale of marital breakdown. Yet there’s clearly an overarching allegory here about impending eco-catastrophe and the mistreatment of Mother Earth. Aronofsky is understandably cagey about specific meanings, but he’s spoken of the film as “a snapshot of the world” threatened by overpopulation, climate change, poisonous politics and war. For him, this is a tale of “a woman who is asked to give and give and give until she can give nothing more”. This is familiar territory for Aronofsky, who cast Russell Crowe as a fundamentalist eco-warrior in Noah, but then left it up to Jennifer Connelly’s nurturing Naameh to lend an engaging human face to his antihero’s swivel-eyed ravings. Indeed, one might see Mother! as a sister movie to Noah’s “Father!”, a revisiting of the Genesis myth with its own Cain and Abel in the shape of Domhnall and Brian Gleeson, and featuring Bardem as an insufferably smug divinity. It’s certainly a tale of false messiahs, evoking the recurrent chant from the third act of Tommy (“there’s more at the door”) with the declaration that “The poet says it’s everyone’s house!” Throughout this escalating madness, cinematographer Matthew Libatique keeps his widescreen lens close to Lawrence, peering over her shoulder, pushing into her face, capturing her singular point of view in long takes that echo Maryse Alberti’s pursuit of Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler. This is first-person cinema, a subjective sensory experience, part waking dream, part walking nightmare. Unsurprisingly, Aronofsky cites Buñuel’s The Exterminating Angel as influential, although horror fans may find themselves recalling the insane grotesqueries of Ruggero Deodato, along with the pulsating plastic realities of David Cronenberg’s Videodrome. As for me, the further away I get from Mother!, the closer it moves to my heart. It’s a delirious, disgraceful experience – just make sure you give it space to breathe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/15/arunachal-pradesh-india-tribes-antonia-bolingbroke-kent-book","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T12:45:56Z","webTitle":"‘Tribes and shamans become your hosts’ – India’s remote Arunachal Pradesh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/15/arunachal-pradesh-india-tribes-antonia-bolingbroke-kent-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/15/arunachal-pradesh-india-tribes-antonia-bolingbroke-kent-book","fields":{"headline":"‘Tribes and shamans become your hosts’ – India’s remote Arunachal Pradesh","bodyText":"Arunachal Pradesh feels very removed from the rest of India. It rises up like a sheer green wall from the flat Assam valley. Foreigners have been allowed in since 1998, but it’s still not an easy place to get around. Many of us think we know India but this remote, far north-eastern corner is a blank space in the popular imagination. Often, there is very little evidence of civilisation as we know it. From remote villages you just see an endless landscape of green hills, creasing and rippling away to the horizon. When you’re in a smoky bamboo hut deep in the jungle, it’s hard to believe this is the same country as New Delhi. Its human and animal diversity is huge. The state is home to 26 tribes, including the Adi, Idu Mishmi and Khampa, who are culturally distinct from the rest of India. But it’s also an amazing destination for wildlife: tigers and clouded leopards both live here. Tribes and shamans become your hosts. Near the Tibetan border, in Idu Mishmi territory, I sat drinking whisky in a bamboo hut with my host, Kormu. We had a joyful evening, swapping stories, sleeping around the fire and waking with a terrible hangover. A shaman I grew to know, Sipamelo, told extraordinary tales of calling on spirits, creating storms and communing with tigers. It may sound far-fetched but it’s easy to believe in this setting. There is real joy in many of the villages. Considering the hardships of dangerous wildlife, extreme weather and the challenge of growing food, there’s a surprising amount of infectious, thigh-slapping humour. Every tribe makes its own rice or millet beer and wine. The local moonshine tends to be strong: one glass is fine, but indulge in three and you’ll be crawling to bed. Tourism is almost non-existent. The Tawang Buddhist monastery sees some foreign visitors as it is the largest monastery in India and second-largest in the world after Potala Palace in Tibet. So there are guesthouses and hotels in Tawang but in the jungles and highlands it’s a case of your guide finding you a place to stay with a family each night. Be prepared to get wet. In summer it rains unbelievably hard and the hot months also see an abundance of snakes and leeches. In winter, the state experiences the kind of cold you get where you have 7,000-metre peaks. October is the best month to go. Festivals and clan gatherings happen all the time. The Hornbill festival in Nagaland (south of Arunachal Pradesh) is the most famous but because there are so many tribes, festivities happen almost every week: stumbling upon one is quite likely. • Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent’s latest book is Land of the Dawn-Lit Mountains (Simon &amp; Schuster, £9.99).

Miguel Maduro, sacked as Fifa’s governance committee chair in May after only eight months, said that Fatma Samoura, Fifa’s secretary-general, had argued with him that barring Vitaly Mutko from the council could jeopardise next year’s World Cup in Russia and Infantino’s own presidency. In an outspoken appearance at parliament’s culture, media and sport committee, Maduro said that Infantino failed to uphold the independent reforms against resistance from powerful figures inside Fifa. “He chose to politically survive,” Maduro said. “I think he made the wrong choice.” Maduro said that a fellow former member of the governance committee, Joseph Weiler, had made a formal complaint to Fifa’s ethics committee about the alleged interference with its work. Fifa, Maduro argued, is incapable of abiding by its own new anti-corruption structures and needs “outside pressure” to reform. The governance committee’s decision to bar Mutko, made in March this year, was the key confrontation, Maduro said, in his short tenure as governance committee chair. The committee was implementing Fifa’s own rule that it must be politically neutral and that national associations remain free from government interference. Maduro said Infantino personally argued with him that the rule should not apply to Mutko, then that Samoura flew to see him in Brussels, accompanied by Tomaz Vesel, chair of Fifa’s audit and compliance committee. Maduro said Vesel called him from the airport to say he felt “very uncomfortable” but that Infantino had asked him to go. “The secretary-general made it clear [the Mutko decision] was extremely problematic and we needed to find a solution to declare Mr Mutko eligible,” Maduro told the parliamentary committee. “She said that the World Cup would be a disaster and that as a consequence the continued presidency [of Infantino] would be in question.” Maduro said he was “very clear” in his response that his governance committee was following Fifa’s rules on political neutrality and exercising its judgment independently as required. He said Infantino himself then responded by email to the committee, upholding its conclusion. “The president expressed great concern with that decision,” Maduro said. Infantino argued that they were misapplying Fifa’s rules, Maduro told the committee, but said that he held firm and maintained the decision was correct. Asked about Infantino’s attitude to him and the reforms, and whether Maduro believed his firm stance on Mutko led to the decision to end his tenure at the Fifa congress in Bahrain, Maduro said that he and Infantino had stopped talking after the Mutko decision. “I never talked to him again,” Maduro, director of the global governance programme at the European University Institute in Florence added. He told the MPs that Fifa has a “deeply embedded” culture which is “extremely resistant to independent scrutiny, transparency and accountability”. Maduro argued that it derived from self-interest and a lack of good governance at national associations and the regional confederations, and is “systemic” so that it would be difficult to challenge even if a president were determined to do so. He cited other instances in which he faced resistance, including over the appointment of more women to senior positions at the Asian Football Confederation, and over complaints his committee was investigating alleged irregularities in an election to the Confederation of African Football council. “The way we exercised our independence created a lot of opposition from the main stakeholders of the presidency,” he said. “[Infantino] had to choose between the independent bodies and preserving his own presidency. The problem is that it – opposition to independent scrutiny – is so deeply embedded in their culture that in practice they do not accept the consequences of reform.” The reforms were introduced following an unprecedented series of corruption scandals involving long-standing senior executives, but Fifa’s commitment to them has been seriously questioned following the ending of Maduro’s tenure, and those of the two independent committee chairmen, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, in Bahrain. They protested that Fifa had “incapacitated” the ethics committee, which they said had hundreds of investigations ongoing. It has since emerged that Infantino was the subject of two preliminary investigations, into alleged interference in the election of a new CAF president, and into his declaration of a €500,000 election budget when in fact Uefa had authorised €1m for his campaign. Fifa has argued that as the chairmen’s terms were up and due for renewal, they were not officially dismissed, only replaced, and that correct procedures were followed. David Gill the FA’s and Uefa’s representative on the Fifa council and former Manchester United chief executive, voted in favour of Maduro’s and the other chairmen’s replacements, saying at the time that he had raised no objections to the process. Fifa said in a statement on Wednesday that it was committed to reform and rejected Maduro’s claims. “Exchanges between the administration and Fifa’s committees … are logical and even desirable, so for these exchanges to be portrayed as undue influence is factually incorrect,” it said. It added that it “has never put the competencies of previous committee members into question and has always respected their decisions”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/13/travellers-racism-hate-speech-discrimination-irish","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T13:52:46Z","webTitle":"We Travellers must take a stand against racism, for the sake of our children | Patrick O’Leary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/13/travellers-racism-hate-speech-discrimination-irish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/13/travellers-racism-hate-speech-discrimination-irish","fields":{"headline":"We Travellers must take a stand against racism, for the sake of our children","bodyText":"It is almost 17 years to the day since I won a historic case that established in law that Irish Travellers are an ethnic minority and entitled to the same protections as other ethnic minorities in Britain. After the ruling, I stood on the steps outside the court and said: “For the first time in our lives we feel we can proudly and publicly tell everyone we are Irish Travellers.” When I said these words, I believed we would finally be free from the discrimination and prejudice that my people had suffered for so long. But as research published this week by the Traveller Movement shows, that couldn’t have been further from the truth. My people continue to suffer, on almost a daily basis, the same injustices I fought to end. The people who took part in the research told stories of experiencing prejudice and discrimination in doing things most people take for granted. In schools, our difference is always highlighted and our children are treated by teachers as if they will always fail. When our children are bullied or called racist names, rarely is anything done. One Traveller said that when they reported being bullied to the headteacher, they were told to “tone down the Traveller thing and maybe it would stop”. It didn’t stop. It never does. When we try to register with doctors, we are wrongly told we cannot if we do not have a fixed abode. When my wife and I used to take our children to the doctor, they wouldn’t let them lie on the bed when they examined them and instead made them lie on the floor. Because we were Travellers – and that must mean we were dirty. In the workplace we are regularly refused a job because of who we are. Many of us are fired once our employers find out our background and sometimes colleagues refuse to work with us. Just because we are Travellers. Even when we go on a family trip to the pub for a Sunday roast or to the pictures, we are told we are not welcome. Again, just because we are Travellers. People often ask me why Travellers have widespread distrust for institutions or authorities. But if your experience of these services was marked by ridicule and an overwhelming sense that you were not welcome, would you trust them to help you? Four out of five of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people who took part in the research said they had experienced hate crime or hate speech. But, as the government acknowledges, few incidents are reported by these communities. Instead of reporting racism to the police or seeking legal help, most Gypsies, Roma and Travellers said they try to hide their ethnicity: 77% said they had never sought help when they experienced discrimination. And that is what breaks my heart most of all. Too many of us still see this racism as a fact of life – something we can do nothing about. Instead of taking legal action, we tell our children to not to let people know who they are because otherwise we will be told we can’t go swimming or to watch a film. Too many of us think, “what’s the point?”– or, as one Traveller said: “It will never stop, so why bother?” To that I say: this is the point.

Labour’s motions passed on Wednesday without being pushed to a vote after it became clear the government had no majority to oppose the call for an end to the public sector pay cap for NHS workers nor the £250 a year increase in student fees. It is the first example of the DUP breaking with May since they struck a confidence and supply agreement to vote together on crucial legislation after the general election. The motions fell outside the Tory-DUP deal as they were not binding, but their passage was nevertheless a symbolic victory for Labour and a sign that there is no longer a majority in the House of Commons for many of the austerity policies introduced by the Conservatives. The DUP spoke out in favour of the pay motion and MPs also indicated the party backed a second motion tabled by Labour opposing a £250 a year rise in the cap on tuition fees to £9,250, which the Conservatives have passed by statutory instrument without a Commons debate despite protests from the opposition. The DUP’s decision to side with Labour forced the Conservatives to abstain in an attempt to take the sting from the situation. It will have no direct effect on policy, but is a sign that Labour may be able to exploit differences between the Conservatives and the DUP in the future in order to inflict more meaningful defeats on May. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said the refusal to allow a binding vote on tuition fees had created a constitutional crisis. She said: “The government had no mandate to increase fees to begin with and if they do not now reverse the fee hike they will be defying the will of parliament in blatant disregard for our democracy”. The DUP’s move is in line with its longstanding approach to wanting to lift the pay cap; it backed a similar early day motion earlier this year. The party is also opposed to higher student fees, having voted against lifting the cap to £9,000 under the coalition. Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP MP for Lagan Valley MP, denied that supporting Labour on NHS wages and opposing tuition fees put the party’s deal that props up May’s government at peril. “No, not at all,” Donaldson told the Guardian. “We made clear to her majesty’s government on issues like this we reserve the right to vote on the basis of our own manifesto. This doesn’t threaten the deal at all.” Ian Paisley, the DUP MP for North Antrim, said he hoped the vote would be a “clarion call” from the Commons for fairer pay for NHS workers. Downing Street has already signalled it will be “flexible” over the public sector pay cap in future, after coming under huge pressure over the issue since the election, when May lost her majority. The prime minister initially held out against changing the policy but some Conservatives MPs in marginal seats lobbied for an end to seven years of austerity. May will need DUP votes in order for the budget to get the approval of parliament this autumn, so ending the cap may have been a political necessity. Earlier this week, No 10 said the pay cap would end for prison officers, who will get a 1.7% pay rise, and police, who get a 2% pay increase next year, while signalling that the overall cap of 1% is likely to be eased at the next budget. However, Labour and the unions have criticised the promised end to the pay cap as insufficient. In the Commons, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the rise amounted and amount to a pay cut with inflation is running at 2.9%. “If the government are indeed abandoning this cap, let us put them on notice,” he said. “It must apply to the whole of the public sector, including the 55% of workers who are not covered by the pay review bodies. “And we also put them on warning: we will not accept a divide-and-rule approach. We will not accept playing one set of public sector workers off against another.” Ashworth said it “wasn’t good enough” for ministers to grant more flexibility over pay and expect hospitals to fund a wage increase for staff from existing budgets. MPs told the House of Commons about examples of public sector workers, including ambulance technicians and nurses who are struggling to get by, being forced into debt or to take second jobs. Following the debate, Ashworth called on May to abide by the wishes of the House of Commons and deliver higher pay for NHS workers. “The real question is, will the government now ignore the clear will of the house or will it take action to end the pay cap in the NHS?” he said. Unison, the trade union for public sector workers, said the passage of the motion showed the Conservatives had lost the argument on public sector pay. “Ministers must know they’re in the wrong when even their quasi-coalition partners in the DUP have turned against them, and backed pay rises for NHS workers,” said Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison. “Theresa May is losing her majority on public sector pay, and we know there are Conservative MPs sympathetic to our calls for real pay rises for all public service workers. “It’s now time for the prime minister and the chancellor to deliver those proper pay rises, and not drag this out a day longer. We’ll be keeping up the pressure on all MPs until the vote, and until all public servants get the pay rises they deserve.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/13/george-osborne-criticised-for-gruesome-remarks-against-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T12:23:49Z","webTitle":"George Osborne criticised for gruesome remarks against Theresa May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/13/george-osborne-criticised-for-gruesome-remarks-against-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/13/george-osborne-criticised-for-gruesome-remarks-against-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne criticised for gruesome remarks against Theresa May","bodyText":"George Osborne told colleagues at the Evening Standard that he would not rest until Theresa May was “chopped up in bags in my freezer”, according to a profile of the former chancellor. Osborne, now editor of the Evening Standard, is said by Esquire magazine to have mentioned the phrase to more than one person at the London newspaper. It would not be the first time he has used gruesome language about May, who sacked him as chancellor when she succeeded David Cameron after the EU referendum. He has previously described May as a “dead woman walking” who is on “death row”, while an Evening Standard leader compared the prime minister to the “living dead in a second-rate horror film”. Since Osborne became editor, the newspaper has carried scathing news articles and leaders about May’s approach to Brexit and her stewardship of the Conservative party. Osborne has not commented on the claim although he was active on Twitter on Wednesday. His office has been contacted for comment. His remarks provoked criticism from some of his former Conservative colleagues. Nadine Dorries, a Tory MP who once described Osborne and Cameron as posh boys who did not know the price of milk, said it was “a brief insight into how his mind works and always has”. Nick Timothy, May’s former co-chief of staff who resigned after the election, highlighted the quote on Twitter, along with remarks by an ally saying: “He’s got a gun now. One thing people in the Conservative party will realise is ‘you mess with George Osborne at your peril’.” In an apparently sarcastic follow-up tweet, Timothy added: “Not sure why he worries people think he’s an arsehole.” Asked for the prime minister’s reaction, her official spokesman said: “The contents of the former chancellor’s freezer are not a matter for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/13/tennis-drug-cheats-anti-doping","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T11:52:46Z","webTitle":"Tennis drug cheats do exist, but it’s too easy for them to slip through the net | Marina Hyde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/13/tennis-drug-cheats-anti-doping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/13/tennis-drug-cheats-anti-doping","fields":{"headline":"Tennis drug cheats do exist, but it’s too easy for them to slip through the net","bodyText":"In tennis, cleanliness is next to wealthiness. Announcing record levels of sponsorship deals back in 2015, the ATP chairman Chris Kermode explained: “People see [tennis] as a clean sport, it’s a great product with great athletes and I think tennis is in the best place it’s ever been.” Why do people see tennis as a clean sport? The simple answer is that very few players ever test positive for banned substances. Except in faintly glamorous ways, like when Richard Gasquet ingested cocaine from kissing a lady all night in a Miami nightclub. Richard, you’ve tested positive for being a Mr Loverman. Of course, Kermode’s statement was made before Maria Sharapova, then the highest profile star in tennis, was caught taking the banned substance meldonium for … hang on, I always want to get this right … diabetes symptoms and heart problems. If you are of a certain age, you may only be able to say those words in the tone adopted by Ferris Bueller’s headmaster when he is told of a student’s excuse for not being in school. “Dead … grandmother?” inquires Ed Rooney, his eyebrows hovering somewhere near his hairline. Diabetes symptoms and … heart problems? Happily, that little local difficulty is all over now. Maria is back in the game, and her stint at the US Open saw her popped straight back onto Arthur Ashe. When Caroline Wozniacki had the temerity to ask why she was being showcased in the circumstances, Sharapova mocked her. All that was left was for the synchronised release of Maria’s autobiography Unstoppable, in which the woman who US sportswriter Kavitha Davidson has majestically dubbed “Tennis Becky” opted to bang on about Serena Williams’s “thick arms” and “thick legs”. And not the fact that Serena found her eminently stoppable. Anyway, the above should be plenty to draw some lively correspondence from Sharapova’s fandom, who are slightly quicker to death threats than even 12-year-old One Direction fans. As for the sport of tennis in general, one can’t help feeling it nurses similar levels of delusion. Amongst all the sports classed under the World Anti-Doping Agency’s code as summer Olympic sports, including swimming and track and field, tennis is by far the least curious. For a long time, tennis chose the absolute cheapest level of screening available in Wada-accredited labs. According to the latest Wada figures covering 2010-14, 80 per cent of samples analysed come from in-competition testing, widely derided by those serious about anti-doping. Tennis players are tested at the levels of athletes in sports which rake in just that bit less cash and coverage. The likes of handball. And kayaking. Tennis samples result in a positive for any sort of banned substance at one third the rate of other summer Olympic sports – and only 40 per cent of the players these tests relate to are suspended. The biological passport has not produced a single instance of doping. A certain stripe of tennis fan would insist that’s because tennis players don’t cheat, though those remotely acquainted with the scale and methods of modern doping would be more inclined to cavil that tennis players don’t get caught. And the authorities do make it easy not to. Experts regard the testing methods on which tennis relies as highly questionable, primarily because the sport doesn’t chase with any determination after EPO and synthetic testosterone, the two substances thought most likely to be used by modern dopers and to produce the biggest benefits. Last year, an excellent investigation by ESPN laid bare the scale of – how to put this? – the insouciance. A supplier of PEDs to “12-15 current and former pro male tennis players” scoffed that the sport’s entire anti-doping programme was “Mickey Mouse” and “something [only] to appease.” A defensive ITF anti-doping chief Stuart Miller told ESPN it would cost between $1.2m (£900,000) and $1.6m a year to test every sample for EPO or HGH. As it is, the ITF spends $4m a year on anti-doping. Over $50m is awarded in prize money at the US Open alone, with each champion this year taking home $3.7m. Given how much financial value is placed on the appearance of cleanliness, you can see why the sport might think this economic model works. And yet, Ferris Bueller’s headmaster was of course quite right to suspect that the students in question were neither ill nor recently bereaved, and that they were simply having – spoiler alert – a day off. He wasn’t thanked for his persistence in doubting them, however, and his doomed pursuit of the truth would see him attempt to break and enter, get attacked by a dog and suffer the final indignity of having to board his own school bus – bleeding and dishevelled – and clock the graffiti above the rear-view mirror which read: ROONEY EATS IT. Fair enough. We’re all rooting for Ferris. If you question the integrity of tennis, you will be issued plenty of invitations to eat it. It’s difficult to escape the conclusion that an awful lot of people simply do not want to know. Neither tennis fans, nor tennis administrators. Quite how long the latter can maintain this stance is unclear, but the Sharapova scandal has been effectively ridden out. Even so they, like their counterparts elsewhere, are presiding over a sport where commentators repeatedly – and increasingly – find themselves using words like “unbelievable” and “unprecedented” and phrases like “just doesn’t get tired”. I envy the authorities for apparently believing their sport is clean –but curse them for progressively ruining the enjoyment of those who know it simply can’t be. This article was amended on 15 September 2017 to clarify that the 80-20 split between in-competition and out-of-competition testing was based on Wada figures covering 2010-14. The ITF claims the current figure is around 50-50."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/18/the-villainess-review-thriller-south-korea-world-cinema","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T14:18:46Z","webTitle":"The Villainess review – rampage through the criminal underworld in sensible heels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/18/the-villainess-review-thriller-south-korea-world-cinema","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/18/the-villainess-review-thriller-south-korea-world-cinema","fields":{"headline":"The Villainess review – rampage through the criminal underworld in sensible heels","bodyText":"In what must be a micro evolution for female action heroes, Kim Ok-bin’s deadly assassin in The Villainess hacks her way through South Korea’s criminal underworld while remaining fully-clothed and wearing a low heel appropriate for bringing down a wardrobe-sized goon.

Hill made her statement in a series of replies to her followers on Twitter. “Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself [with] other white supremacists,” she wrote. “The height of white privilege is being able to ignore his white supremacy, because it’s of no threat to you. Well, it’s a threat to me,” she added. “... He is unqualified and unfit to be president. He is not a leader. And if he were not white, he never would have been elected.” On Wednesday, the White House condemned Hill’s comments. “That is one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make and certainly is something that is a fireable offence by ESPN,” said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “I’m not going to speak for that individual but I know that the president has met again with people like Senator Scott who are highly respected leaders in the African American community. He’s committed to working with them to bring the country together. I think that’s where we need to be focused; not on outrageous statements like that one.” Hill’s attack on the president caused ESPN to issue an apology on Tuesday, with the broadcaster saying her views “do not represent the position of ESPN.” And “she recognizes her actions were inappropriate”. On Tuesday night, Kaepernick sent a tweet addressed to Hill, saying “we are with you”. Kaepernick is currently without an NFL team, something that is widely seen as due to his protest against racial injustice in the US. As part of the protest, Kaepernick chose not to stand during the national anthem last season. ESPN has long faced attacks from figures on the right, who accuse the broadcaster of liberal bias. In a blog earlier this year, Fox Sports’ Clay Travis attacked ESPN because it has “given awards to Caitlyn Jenner for becoming a woman, celebrated Michael Sam’s bravery in coming out gay like he was a modern-day Jackie Robinson, and covered Colin Kaepernick like he’s a modern-day Rosa Parks.” Hill, who is black, received significant amounts of racist abuse from Twitter users following her comments. She has been with ESPN since 2006. In February this year she was appointed co-host of the broadcaster’s flagship 6pm edition of SportsCenter alongside Michael Smith. Last month Hill discussed politics and Twitter with Sports Illustrated. “I don’t tweet a lot about politics,” she said. “I do tweet more about social issues, which I consider to be issues of morality. Racism isn’t politics. Racism is an issue of right and wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/16/beavers-uk-flood-defences-forest-of-dean","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T21:00:22Z","webTitle":"Meet the latest recruit to the UK flood defence team:  the beaver","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/16/beavers-uk-flood-defences-forest-of-dean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/16/beavers-uk-flood-defences-forest-of-dean","fields":{"headline":"Meet the latest recruit to the UK flood defence team:  the beaver","bodyText":"Beavers could be put to work building dams to stop a village from flooding in the Forest of Dean, in what would be the first such scheme on government land. The Forestry Commission has been an enthusiastic advocate for the release of a family of beavers into a large fenced area surrounding Greathough brook above the village of Lydbrook, on land owned by the commission. Experts predict that the beavers will rapidly create dams, canals and ponds, slowing the stream’s flow and potentially holding back 6,000 cubic metres of water to prevent huge floods inundating Lydbrook, a village that suffered badly from flooding in 2012. Villagers are mostly supportive, hoping the scheme will not only protect the village but boost local wildlife and tourism. “It’s a brilliant idea,” said Stuart Aken. “There were about 100 people in the village hall when they made the announcement and there wasn’t a single dissenting voice. People are in favour because of the potential to help against flooding and most are interested in the increase in wildlife that it will bring to the area.” One villager spoke of concerns that the beavers would escape the enclosure and pose similar problems to those caused by the burgeoning wild boar population. But Sid Phelps, a Green councillor who lives close to Lydbrook, said beavers would not stray far from the watercourse. They will also be tagged, so if they escaped they could be recaptured. “This seems to be an innovative idea to deal with both climate change and the risk of increased flooding,” said Phelps. “There’s a little nervousness in the Forest of Dean because of the boar but the Forestry Commission did an excellent job of assuaging any fears.” But despite the beaver scheme not costing the taxpayer a penny – it would be funded by landfill taxes – it was abruptly postponed last month. A source close to the project said it had been blocked by a minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – and the Forestry Commission was “hopping mad”. A spokesperson for Defra denied that the scheme had been blocked by a government minister and said that the Forestry Commission would announce the next steps in the coming weeks. Derek Gow, a beaver expert who has worked on reintroductions in Scotland and England, said: “This is a tremendous opportunity. The science suggests these animals will hold back 6,000 cubic metres of water. “This has the potential to prevent a once-in-30-years flood event. These animals will also open the forest canopy to light and create a biodiversity jewel in this forest.” Landowners, ecologists – and according to some insiders, the environment secretary, Michael Gove – are increasingly interested in the potential of using beavers as a cost-effective form of natural flood defence. The government is overseeing a trial to assess whether the beaver, which was driven to extinction more than 400 years ago, should be allowed back as a native species into England. The Scottish government last year recognised the beavers on its waterways as a native species, giving them legal protection. At an experimental site run by Devon Wildlife Trust on farmland, a pair of beavers have been shown to hold back 1,000 cubic metres of water, with their dams and canals drastically slowing the flow of floodwater. In Cornwall, a farmer linked up with the Cornwall Wildlife Trust earlier this year to release beavers on to fenced land above the village of Ladock, which has been hit by severe flooding in recent years. Within two weeks of two beavers being released there, newly created waterways were holding back 1,000 cubic metres of water. Gow said he was hopeful that Gove would approve the Lydbrook scheme. He said: “Many ecologists were very apprehensive when Michael Gove was appointed [as environment secretary] but his approach has been overwhelmingly positive and really quite visionary. “He’s obviously very knowledgeable about and sympathetic towards the natural environment. We’re all waiting with bated breath to see what the man is going to do.” Lydbrook would set a precedent for dozens of similar schemes in western British river systems, Gow says, particularly in upstream areas where beaver dams act as a giant sponge, lessening peak flows of water and slowly releasing more during times of drought. But Gow said that beavers were unlikely to be allowed back into Britain’s easterly arable landscapes, where their activity can flood valuable agricultural land. HOW BEAVER DAMS PROTECT THE LAND Beavers prefer to live in deep water so if they are released into a small upland stream, they quickly build a series of dams and canals they can use. These dams store water and the land close to the stream in effect becomes a giant sponge. At a 2.8-hectare test site in Devon, two beavers have created 13 ponds that hold 650 cubic metres of water. Floodwater has been drastically slowed. The dams also remove pollutants and create a rich habitat for rare invertebrates and plants. If the dams are washed away by floods, these busy engineers rapidly rebuild them. Ecologists say the trial in Devon can be replicated at other sites. This “natural” flood defence works only in small streams in upland areas. In deeper rivers, beavers do not need to rapidly create dams. In lowland areas, beaver activity can also cause flooding. But those in favour of their reintroduction to England and Wales say beavers can be returned to western river systems and will not spread to low-lying eastern areas, such as the Fens, where their activity could cause valuable agricultural land to flood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/13/londons-most-polluted-schools-to-be-given-air-quality-audits","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T13:42:47Z","webTitle":"London's most polluted schools to be given air-quality audits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/13/londons-most-polluted-schools-to-be-given-air-quality-audits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/13/londons-most-polluted-schools-to-be-given-air-quality-audits","fields":{"headline":"London's most polluted schools to be given air-quality audits","bodyText":"The most polluted schools in London are to be audited as part of the mayor’s drive to clean up toxic air across the capital. Earlier this year a Guardian investigation revealed that hundreds of thousands of children are being exposed to illegal levels of damaging air pollution from diesel vehicles at schools and nurseries. Sadiq Khan said on Wednesday that air pollution was “the biggest public health emergency of a generation”. He announced the first 50 schools to undergo a pollution audit, and said the results would be followed by “hard-hitting measures” to minimise the damage being done to children. “It is shameful that children across London are breathing in toxic air simply by going to and from school and I am determined to do everything in my power to safeguard their health. “These air quality audits are a big step towards helping some of the most polluted schools in London identify effective solutions to protect pupils from toxic fumes but, of course, this is only part of the solution.” The audits will be completed by the end of the year and recommendations may include: moving school entrances away from busy roads green infrastructure such as ‘barrier bushes’ along busy roads and in playgrounds to help to filter toxic fumes ‘no engine idling’ schemes to reduce harmful emissions during the school run minimising emissions from boilers, kitchens and other sources changes to local road systems and restrictions on the most polluting vehicles round schools The Guardian’s investigation used the government’s own pollution modelling from 2015 to identify the scale of the problem. It found that pollution from diesel traffic was not limited to large metropolitan centres but threatened the health of children and young people in towns and cities across England and Wales. Khan said today’s move was part of a package of measures his administration was pursuing. “Next month, I will be launching my T-charge to rid central London of the oldest, most polluting vehicles and before the end of the year I will be announcing a decision on my plans to bring forward and extend the Ultra-Low Emission Zone along some of our busiest roads.” He claimed he was “making great strides in London” but said ministers must do more. “The government must match my ambition in tackling the biggest public health emergency of a generation.” Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green party, said: “While it’s great to see Sadiq Khan taking action on air pollution, his plans are narrow minded in the face of the scale of the crisis. Children don’t only breathe our dirty air at school. “The mayor’s plan to expand the low emission zone and reduce emissions near schools are welcome. But if he is serious about cleaning up London’s air he must ban dirty diesel vehicles from the capital. We also desperately need to see proper investment in safe and accessible walking and cycling routes so people are able to leave their cars at home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/07/princess-nokia-1992-deluxe-review-freewheeling-mc-asserts-ownership","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T20:45:20Z","webTitle":"Princess Nokia: 1992 Deluxe review – freewheeling MC asserts ownership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/07/princess-nokia-1992-deluxe-review-freewheeling-mc-asserts-ownership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/07/princess-nokia-1992-deluxe-review-freewheeling-mc-asserts-ownership","fields":{"headline":"Princess Nokia: 1992 Deluxe review – freewheeling MC asserts ownership","bodyText":"This “Jewish, Puerto Rican, and a little bit Italian” rapper from New York, a “nerdy girl with nymphomanic tendencies”, who refers to Emily the Strange as well as cooking crack, delivers on her potential as one of 2017’s most exciting new MCs.

Enough useful players are on the roster to generate sporadic mild chuckles – MVP Wyatt Russell, as Glatt’s thunderous bad-boy rival, inadvertently nails a major issue (“The world isn’t watching … just Canada, and maybe three or four states”) – but nobody lands the one knockout punchline to elevate matters above tolerable mediocrity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"housing-network/2017/sep/11/council-housing-officers-refuse-homeless-people","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T06:23:00Z","webTitle":"Housing officers do all they can to refuse homeless applications | Derek Bernardi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/sep/11/council-housing-officers-refuse-homeless-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2017/sep/11/council-housing-officers-refuse-homeless-people","fields":{"headline":"I see housing officers do all they can to refuse homeless applications","bodyText":"As a solicitor-advocate who practises in housing law, I have done this work long enough, and seen the same outcomes in dozens of cases, not to notice that while homeless applicants struggle for a roof over their heads, housing officers will, without fail, use every tool at their disposal to refuse a homeless application. This is not to suggest that housing officers have any ill-will towards homeless people or that they deliberately take a malevolent approach. But many local authorities have developed techniques that are actually quite clever to uphold their assumed roles as gatekeepers. While few countries do as much as the UK to assist homeless people, there is still a substantial weakness in our system, which is the approach taken by the judiciary in England and Wales. Back in February 2009, Lord Neuberger stated that a “benevolent approach” should be adopted when courts looked at review decisions. Many people probably believe that while local authority housing officers may not be perfect, they are at least benevolent when considering applications by homeless applicants. But those of us who fight on behalf of clients in need of housing know the reality on the ground is far more stark. Most homelessness appeals do not turn on minor, technical errors of law. Far more common are appeals based on the persuasiveness of medical evidence, or questions as to whether someone can reasonably be expected to continue living in their own home. These type of cases hinge on the court’s discretion, usually to the effect of assessing whether a vulnerable person is significantly more vulnerable than an “ordinary person”. In isolation, this can look like an honest effort at reaching a difficult but fair decision, by a person whose job it is to make judgments. But over time, it is impossible not to notice that the so-called “benevolent approach” too often leads to support for questionable decisions, especially for county court judges, who may be unfamiliar with challenges under the 1996 Housing Act, and who are perhaps more naturally inclined to prefer the arguments posited on behalf of an overworked housing officer. Take, for instance, the case of a single homeless woman who has been living on the streets for four years, who approaches her local housing authority with a letter from her GP that makes clear her severe mental health issues, her high risk of suicide and the risk of relapse into drug-taking and reoffending if she is not re-housed. Even though her GP describes her as extremely vulnerable, the council says she is not significantly more vulnerable than an “ordinary person”, because she doesn’t need any overnight care, she can use public transport, and she can continue to visit her GP even while homeless. She appeals. An independent reviewer upholds the initial finding that she does not have priority need. She appeals to the county court. The county court judge appears quite critical of the council, questioning its interpretation of the medical evidence and some confusing wording in the review decision. But in his judgment, he finds for the council. He says that although some parts of the review decision are contradictory, when viewed as a whole and when applying a “benevolent approach”, the council is entitled to make its decision. That hardly seems benevolent for this particular woman, nor for the 4,134 rough sleepers in the UK. Of course, the real answer is to expand the supply of social housing. But a more attainable solution might be for the judiciary to have a more realistic understanding of how the Housing Act is being applied, and to appreciate the need for a more truly benevolent approach towards homeless people.

The former British No1 Greg Rusedski, who took six weeks out with a damaged shoulder towards the end of his career, was among those who welcomed Murray’s decision to let his painful hip injury heal slowly. “The more time you take out the better you recover,” he said on Wednesday. “[Doctors] said if you have surgery there’s a 5% chance it’ll get better, 45% chance it could stay the same and 45% chance it could get worse. He’s doing the right thing taking the rest of the season off.” Murray said in a statement: “Unfortunately, I won’t be able to compete in the upcoming events in Beijing and Shanghai, and most likely the final two events to finish the season in Vienna and Paris due to my hip injury which has been bothering me the last few months.” Murray, who has not played since his defeat against Sam Querrey at Wimbledon, intends to fulfil an obligation to appear at a charity event in Glasgow on 7 November but will almost certainly delay his full‑time return to the Tour until January in Australia. In the meantime he and his wife, Kim, are expecting their second child in October. Tennis, for once, will not be at the top of his agenda for the next few months, as he continues his rest and rehabilitation, rather than opting for surgery. “I will be beginning my 2018 season in Brisbane in preparation for the Australian Open and I’m looking forward to playing in Glasgow later this year against Roger [Federer] for Unicef UK and Sunny-sid3up. I have a fantastic team working alongside me to help me through this process and appreciate the support from them and all of my fans over this difficult period.” Miles Maclagan, who once coached Murray and now shares commentating duties with Rusedski on Eurosport, said Murray should ignore the inevitable slip in rankings that will follow, and follow the example of Federer, Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka. “There’s all sorts of wear and tear on tennis players’ bodies, especially the hips and backs because of all the stopping and starting. But also the training they have to put in to get to the level of fitness that they compete at takes a huge toll. Also, knowing what Federer did, he probably thought: ‘I’m going to get myself in the best shape I can for next year.’” That would seem to be Murray’s obvious intention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/06/suspected-ringleader-charged-modern-slavery-offences-nigeria-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T10:48:09Z","webTitle":"Suspected ringleader charged with modern slavery offences","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/06/suspected-ringleader-charged-modern-slavery-offences-nigeria-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/06/suspected-ringleader-charged-modern-slavery-offences-nigeria-europe","fields":{"headline":"Suspected ringleader charged with modern slavery offences","bodyText":"A woman suspected of being a ringleader of a criminal network involved in trafficking young women from Nigeria to Europe for sexual exploitation has been charged with modern slavery offences. Josephine Iyamu, 50, a British national, was arrested after she landed at Heathrow on a flight from Lagos, Nigeria, on 24 August, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Iyamu, from Bermondsey in London, was charged with arranging to facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation – an offence under the Modern Slavery Act – and was remanded in custody. She will appear at Birmingham crown court on 22 September. Senior investigating officer Kay Mellor said: “Criminals involved in modern slavery see their victims as a commodity that can generate income over and over again. They are adept at hiding their activity and often exploit individuals who are vulnerable and may not be missed. “The NCA, with our partners, is turning over stones, seeking out the individuals who are profiting from this trade, prosecuting them and safeguarding the vulnerable people they exploit.” A 59-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering. He was released and remains under investigation. Last month, the NCA said modern slavery and human trafficking was far more prevalent than law enforcement previously thought with potentially tens of thousands of victims in the UK. Will Kerr, the NCA’s director of vulnerabilities, said the figures were far higher than those identified by the system set up by the government to identify victims of trafficking, which stood at about 3,800 in 2016. “It’s likely in the tens of thousands,” Kerr said. “The more we look for modern slavery the more we find evidence of the widespread abuse of the vulnerable. The growing body of evidence we are collecting points to the scale being far larger than anyone had previously thought.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/08/the-work-review-prisoners-therapy-documentary-folsom-prison","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"The Work review – prisoners dig deep in wrenching therapy doc","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/08/the-work-review-prisoners-therapy-documentary-folsom-prison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/08/the-work-review-prisoners-therapy-documentary-folsom-prison","fields":{"headline":"The Work review – prisoners dig deep in wrenching therapy doc","bodyText":"This empathic documentary follows an experimental programme that helps convicts at Folsom state prison in California and volunteer citizens confront their darkest feelings through group therapy. Shaped by recent therapeutic approaches aimed at men with issues involving violence, substance abuse and childhood trauma, the programme gets the guys all chanting, crying, screaming, raging and, above all, talking about what happened to get them where they are now. In the case of the prisoners, that’s often a lot of bad luck and poor decision-making. But what is really fascinating is watching how the ordinary joes – aware of being there but for the grace of God – learn from the inmates, inspired by their courage to “jump in the fire” and expose their deepest fears and anxieties. The constant therapy-speak may be squirm-inducing for more uptight British viewers, and risks confirming suspicions about the huggy-feely nature of Californians of all classes, but for the open-minded this is moving, even wrenching viewing that might inspire similar approaches in British institutions. The dry, strictly observational shooting style means the doc stays in the moment and rarely ventures out of the room where the programme unfolds, adding immediacy. It’s also essential viewing for aficionados of intricate tattoo art."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/06/us-open-quarter-finals-pliskova-vandeweghe-nadal-rublev","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T20:13:40Z","webTitle":"US Open quarter-final: Rafa Nadal beats Andrey Rublev – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/06/us-open-quarter-finals-pliskova-vandeweghe-nadal-rublev","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/06/us-open-quarter-finals-pliskova-vandeweghe-nadal-rublev","fields":{"headline":"US Open quarter-final: Rafa Nadal beats Andrey Rublev – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all from me tonight. But there’s more to come from New York. Do join Bryan Armen Graham for live coverage of Roger Federer versus Juan Martin del Potro later. It could be special. Bye! Nadal is asked about a potential semi-final against Roger Federer - what will he be doing during his great rival’s match against Juan Martin del Potro tonight? “I’m going to be having dinner probably. In Spain we have a late dinner. They play at 9, no? So it is our time for dinner. But it is a match I will pay attention to. Two great players, a great show. It’s strange we’ve never played here. It’s something we missed. It would be more special if it could come back in a final, but it is not possible for that to happen, so we’re going to come back next year to see if we can make it happen.” Rafa Nadal speaks. “It was a good match. For Andrey it was his first quarter-finals, so of course he played with more mistakes than usual. But winning two matches with straight sets is important for me. This year has been an emotional year. I have been playing very well almost every tournament after some years with some problems in terms of injuries and others from not playing so well. So you appreciate it. Especially late in my career it’s something six or seven years ago I didn’t think about. I’m very happy to be in the semi-finals.” One hour and 37 minutes. Ouch. Andrey Rublev has had an excellent tournament, but he’ll want to put this one behind him in a hurry. Nadal doesn’t have to hang around for two match points. He can’t take the first, netting a backhand. Rublev idolises Nadal so much, though, that he nets a backhand on the next point. It’s all over. It didn’t take long. A low-tension quarter-final comes to a forgettable end. Nadal is into his first US Open semi-final since 2013. Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 5-2 Rublev* (*denotes server): Nadal bangs a forehand away for 0-15. Rublev nets a backhand. Somehow he fights back to 30-all. A big serve down the middle makes it 40-30. He holds to 30. It’s belated resistance, but Nadal is about to stamp it out. Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 5-1 Rublev (*denotes server): Nadal holds to love. “Few players can live with Nadal when he’s in this mood,” says Simon McMahon. “Though Federer is one of them. That’s a mouthwatering prospect. As is a fully fit Andy Murray returning at the Australian Open. The game has missed him, and Djokovic too. With Nadal and Federer rolling back the years I’m looking forward to the Australian Open already. It’ll be like a Beatles comeback tour. In a manner of speaking of course.” Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 4-1 Rublev* (*denotes server): Rublev pummels a few forehands at Nadal, who eventually seizes control of the rally and leaves the Russian floundering. Before long Nadal has two break points. He can’t take them. A third comes and goes. Rublev keeps scrapping. He’s desperately trying to fend off Nadal. Facing a seventh break point, though, he double-faults. Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 3-1 Rublev (*denotes server): Nadal just refuses to lower his intensity for a second. Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 2-1 Rublev* (*denotes server): Nadal’s unlikelier to have had an easier run to a grand slam semi-final. His opponents simply haven’t been capable of coping with him - and you wouldn’t have expected anything of them to have been able to. He’ll be nice and rested before a possible semi-final against Federer. Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 2-0 Rublev (*denotes server): Nadal holds to 30 and consolidates the break. Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 1-0 Rublev* (*denotes server): Barring a Del Potro-esque comeback from Rublev, I’m afraid this is over as a contest. Despite hard running during the first exchange of this set, he loses the point. It’s not long before Nadal has three break points. Rublev double-faults. Wince. A vintage forehand from Nadal, who appears to be in a hurry, closes out the set. Poor Rublev. He’s been utterly overwhelmed. There’s no shame in it. Not against this guy. Second set: Nadal 6-1, 5-2 Rublev* (*denotes server): “Uh oh,” says John McEnroe on Eurosport - Nadal’s just whistled a forehand down the line for 0-30. Rublev fires a forehand down the line for 15-30, but another error hands Nadal two break points. Nadal fluffs two returns, but he gets another chance when Rublev nets a forehand. He takes this one. Or, more accurately, Rublev gives it to him, netting a backhand. Second set: Nadal* 6-1, 4-2 Rublev (*denotes server): Nadal saves two break points to force deuce. He holds with an ace. This is remarkably stress-free. Second set: Nadal 6-1, 3-2 Rublev* (*denotes server): But Rublev, being young and inexperienced and overawed, gives too much away. Struggling to play the percentages, he nets a weak backhand to make it 15-40. At which point he double-faults. The applause is sympathetic. Second set: Nadal* 6-1, 2-2 Rublev (*denotes server): Nadal gives so little away for free. He holds to love. Second set: Nadal 6-1, 1-2 Rublev* (*denotes server): Rublev fizzes a forehand out of reach for 30-15. A double-fault makes it 30-all. Nadal quickly earns a break point. Nadal surprisingly nets a forehand, though. Deuce. From where Rublev stubbornly holds. Progress. Second set: Nadal* 6-1, 1-1 Rublev (*denotes server): Down 15-0, Rublev shows off his potential with two searing angles to clamber to 15-30. The fans love those. Nadal doesn’t. No problem, though. He narrows his eyes and holds to 30. Second set: Nadal 6-1, 0-1 Rublev* (*denotes server): Rublev didn’t hold once in the first set. Naturally he begins this one by holding to love with an ace. Nadal quickly seizes three set points. Rublev nets a forehand. That didn’t take long. First set: Nadal 5-1 Rublev* (*denotes server): Rublev has hit some outstanding shots so far. Problem is he lacks consistency, as you’d expect from someone so raw, while the bloke on the other side of the net is capable of wizardry of his own. Nadal begins the game with an awesome backhand from right to left and it’s not long before he leads 0-40. These are set points. Nadal fluffs the first, butchering a forehand. Not the second, though. Rublev drops a volley shot, Nadal rams a backhand down the line. First set: *Nadal 4-1 Rublev (*denotes server): A much better service game from Nadal, which has Rublev all over the place. He holds to love. First set: Nadal 3-1 Rublev* (*denotes server): Both players have been guilty of some bad unforced errors (are there good unforced errors?) Rublev volleys wide at the net early in the game. Entertainingly, the umpire has a world weary voice, which makes her sound like she has contempt for the previous shot whenever she announces the score - very chucklesome after a bad error. Another loose shot from Rublev and he’s broken again. First set: *Nadal 2-1 Rublev (*denotes server): Rublev has the frame of a young Andy Murray and the dagger glares to his team in the players’ box too. An angry crosscourt forehand helps him to 15-30 on Rafa’s serve. Then a bad miss from Rafa - he dumps the ball into the net with the court wide open - gives Rublev with two break points. An ace rescues the first one bur he can’t save the second! Rafa is broken and we’re back on serve! First set: Nadal 2-0 Rublev* (*denotes server): Rublev shows why he’s here as his service game opens with two strong forehands that are too good for Nadal. Rublev looks a little like a young Andy Murray - skinny and tall. If he can put on muscle, like Murray did, he can hopefully bulk up his serve, which isn’t causing Rafa too many problems (admittedly 100mph faster than mine). And he is broken straight away after a long forehand. First set: Nadal* 1-0 Rublev (*denotes server): Rafa serves first. And wins the first point: Rublev’s backhand down the line turns into a backhand into the net. The Russian does little to trouble his opponent for the rest of the game and hits a few wayward shots as the No1 seed holds to 15 - the only worry for Rafa is his serve - he gets just one first serve in. Rublev has, of course, faced a No1 seed in a grand slam this year - Andy Murray at the Aussie Open. It didn’t end well: The two players are warming up - Rafa looks pretty rusty in the early stages of the tournament but was his old self in the last 16. As good as Rublev has been so far, he’s the youngest player to have reached the last eight here since Andy Roddick and the former champion should be too good. The Russian doesn’t have the kind of huge serve that can sometimes trouble Rafa. And they’re out on court. This is the 19-year-old’s Rublev first ever match on Arthur Ashe. It’s Rafa’s 55th. We’re still waiting for Nadal and Rublev to make their way onto Arthur Ashe, but these two have met before. Although not technically in a match: Next up on Arthur Ashe: Rafael Nadal versus Andrey Rublev. Tom Lutz will #helm the blog while I fry some tuna. Coco Vandeweghe, who beat Angelique Kerber in Australia when the German was world No1 speaks. “When I won this event as a junior at 16, I always dreamed about being on the real stage. I did expect it overnight when I was 16, but it is a process and now here I am and I couldn’t wish for anything better. I watched the match last night with Venus. She said it best, we have to admire Serena and Venus, Lindsay and Jennifer, they all inspired me as an American coming up, and let’s make it four for four.” Over to you, Madison Keys. All of which means Karolina Pliskova loses her No1 ranking. Garbine Muguruza will be the new world No1. A few whoops and cheers from the crowd. Some applause. Vandeweghe swings her right arm, loosening it up before preparing to go in for what she hope will be the kill. She starts well, serving precisely, waiting for Pliskova to miss a backhand. Then she nets a forehand at the end of a tense rally, though. 15-all. Pliskova spies an opening. She goes for broke with her forehand and, although Vandeweghe hangs in there, she wrongfoots the American to make it 15-30. Vandeweghe responds by rattling a forehand down the line ... Pliskova challenges. It hit the line. Pliskova is out of challenges. But she does have a break point, Vandeweghe netting a backhand. Vandeweghe makes Pliskova run, though, and the Czech nets a forehand for deuce. Soon, after smacking a forehand away, she has her first match point. Whooping. Whistling. Cheering. Deuce. The net’s in the way of a Vandeweghe forehand. Silence. Then more cheering: Vandeweghe finds the mark with a forehand. She gets her first serve in ... and Pliskova nets a forehand! Falling to her knees, Vandeweghe is ecstatic! She’s knocked out the world No1 to reach her first semi-final at her home slam! Second set: Pliskova* 6-7, 3-5 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the match, Pliskova races into a 40-0 lead. She holds to love. Vandeweghe will serve for it. Second set: Pliskova 6-7, 2-5 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Pliskova challenges during the rally, thinking a Vandeweghe shot was long. It was not. 15-0. From there, Vandeweghe stomps into a 40-15 lead. Pliskova tries to detain her, but it’s looking an increasingly forlorn task. Vandeweghe holds to 30. She’s a game away from victory. Second set: Pliskova* 6-7, 2-4 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Now she has nothing to lose, Vandeweghe is going for it again. Life of the mind, eh? At 15-30, it’s Pliskova who shortcircuits, spooning a dreadful backhand past the baseline to give up two break points. Pliskova saves the first with a powerful serve out wide, but then a nothing volley allows Vandeweghe to move forward and steer a forehand away to break again! Second set: Pliskova 6-7, 2-3 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): But now the match is hers to lose, doubt intrudes on Vandeweghe’s thoughts and she gives up a break point with a tentative forehand. She recovers well, slapping a forehand away for deuce, but she’s got to deal with another break point after netting a straightforward forehand. She saves it with an ace. But then she nets a backhand. Then another. Pliskova’s back in it. Second set: Pliskova* 6-7, 1-3 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Pliskova is teetering here, double-faulting for 0-30. This is a huge opportunity for Vandeweghe, who earns two break points when the world No1 drags a skittish forehand wide. She only needs one, walloping a forehand return back to Pliskova’s forehand, which drifts long. A semi-final place is hers to lose. Second set: Pliskova 6-7, 1-2 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): There’s no sign of Vandeweghe losing her focus just yet. Another impressive, untroubled hold. Second set: Pliskova* 6-7, 1-1 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Pliskova reminds everyone that it won’t be easy breaking for her, gliding into a 40-0 lead. Vandeweghe musters brief resistance with a rollocking forehand return for 40-15, but Pliskova holds easily. Second set: Pliskova 6-7, 0-1 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): A confident start to the second set for Vandeweghe, holding to love, serving with supreme poise. You fancy this is going to be tough for Pliskova. First set tie-break: Pliskova 4-7 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Vandeweghe finds a first serve and Pliskova, so sloppy, dumps another forehand return long! The 20th seed is a set away from knocking out the world No1 and reaching the semi-finals. First set tie-break: Pliskova 4-6 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Pliskova wildly puts a forehand long. Two set points for Vandeweghe. First set tie-break: Pliskova* 4-5 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Vandeweghe puts a forehand wide. First set tie-break: Pliskova* 3-5 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Pliskova serves well. First set tie-break: Pliskova 2-5 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Pliskova nets a backhand. First set tie-break: Pliskova 2-4 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Vandeweghe overpowers Pliskova with a huge forehand. First set tie-break: Pliskova* 2-3 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Another error from Vandeweghe. First set tie-break: Pliskova* 1-3 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Vandeweghe lifts a forehand past the baseline. First set tie-break: Pliskova 0-3 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Pliskova nets a forehand return. First set tie-break: Pliskova 0-2 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Pliskova sends a forehand return long. First set tie-break: Pliskova* 0-1 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Pliskova serves accurately out wide, but Vandeweghe jumps on to it and batters a forehand down the line. First set: Pliskova 6-6 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Vandeweghe begins with a forehand winner for 15-0. She holds to 15. Tie-break. First set: Pliskova* 6-5 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Pliskova unfussily holds to 15. Vandeweghe will be under pressure again. First set: Pliskova 5-5 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Vandeweghe is pleased with herself after a serve doesn’t come back over the net on the first point. At 15-all, she gobbles up a short ball to punch a forehand away, only to net a forehand for 30-all. Vandeweghe is two points from a hold, but Pliskova is two points from the set. Vandeweghe is relieved when a Pliskova forehand is called out. Pliskova challenges to no avail, but the game goes to deuce after a potentially costly double-fault from Vandeweghe, who’s facing a set point after netting a weary backhand. Pliskova attacks. Vandeweghe clings on, though, and then rams a backhand from left to right. It lands just inside the line and Pliskova nets a slice. From there, she holds with a crunching backhand down the line, which is enough to raise the volume in the stands. First set: Pliskova* 5-4 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): “Come on!” Vandeweghe cries. She’s so pumped up. Her emotions betrayed her in that previous sloppy game, but they help he here, as she overpowers Pliskova for 0-15. Feeling the pressure, Pliskova proceeds to double-fault for 0-30. She composes herself, though, and at 15-30 she volleys beautifully for 30-all. She holds to 30, slicing a volley from right to left, and Vandeweghe will serve to stay in this highly intriguing opening set. First set: Pliskova 4-4 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): This is the first test for Vandeweghe, who’s down 0-30 after overcooking a forehand, a consequence of Pliskova’s firmer hitting. Vandeweghe responds by laying down two big first serves to force Pliskova to net her returns. The game goes to 30-all. Vandeweghe makes it 40-30 with an ace out wide. Then she double-faults. Deuce. Steam’s starting to come out of her ears. Another one hands Pliskova a break point, causing her emotions to spill over as she smashes her racket into the ground. She walks to her chair to collect a new one, gathers her thoughts and saves the break point with a huge backhand, but she’s facing a second after netting a forehand. Pliskova can see her opponent’s struggling here and she pulls a forehand out of reach to cancel out the break. First set: Pliskova* 3-4 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Pliskova holds to love. First set: Pliskova 2-4 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): The first two points are shared, but Vandeweghe continues to dominate in the baseline exchanges, moving into a 40-15 lead. She closes out another accomplished service game with handy play at the net. The slight worry for Vandeweghe might be that Pliskova seems to be playing within herself at the moment. First set: Pliskova* 2-3 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Pliskova settles down a little, holding to 30 without much of a challenge from her spiky opponent. First set: Pliskova 1-3 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): Vandeweghe’s serve is causing more damage than Pliskova’s at the moment. She’s quickly into a 40-0 lead, Pliskova unable to get into the rally. She holds to love when the world no1 nets a return. First set: Pliskova* 1-2 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): Vandeweghe has a good read on that venomous Pliskova serve in these early stages and she’s feeling perky after racing into a 0-30 lead. Then comes a baseline exchange. Vandeweghe is solid, Pliskova is wobbly. The Czech pulls a forehand wide to give up three break points. She saves the first with an ... ace. Vandeweghe goes on the attack on the second, though, punching a forehand return down the line, Pliskova nowhere near it. It’s called out - it’s worth a challenge. Because that ball caught the line and HawkEye confirms the early break for the home favourite, who has made a mighty start. First set: Pliskova 1-1 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server): A confident start from Vandeweghe, who nails a forehand for 40-15 before rattling an ace out wide to hold. First set: Pliskova* 1-0 Vandeweghe (*denotes server): It’s the big-serving Czech who gets this US Open quarter-final underway. She loses the first point, netting a backhand, but rattles through the next three to lead 40-15. Vandeweghe hits back with a big forehand return for 40-30, but Pliskova holds with a solid serve. Here come the players. A fine reception for Coco Vandeweghe, a respectful one for Karolina Pliskova. The roof is covering Arthur Ashe; it’s a wet day in New York. Earlier today Andy Murray announced that he is unlikely to play for the rest of the season. Here’s Kevin Mitchell’s full report. This is the fifth meeting between Pliskova and Vandeweghe. Their head-to-head is tied at 2-2 - it’s 1-1 on hard courts, while Vandeweghe won their only previous grand slam meeting, beating the Czech in two sets at Wimbledon two years ago. It wouldn’t be a shock if the American wins this. Hello. What a thrill it must be to be an American at the moment. Well, it is if you’re a tennis fan. The locals who fill the stands on Arthur Ashe haven’t had it this good in years, the exploits of Serena Williams notwithstanding. We already have confirmation that the women’s draw will feature one all-American semi-final – Venus Williams versus the resurgent Sloane Stephens – and today we discover whether it’s going to be a clean sweep in the last four. The night session begins with Madison Keys taking on the unseeded Kaia Kanepi - but before that our attention will be on the day’s first match, which features the powerful Coco Vandeweghe, who has already reached an Australian Open semi-final and a Wimbledon quarter-final this year. But it’s not going to be easy for the 20th seed. For standing in her way is Karolina Pliskova, the world No1 and a beaten finalist in New York last year. Vandweghe has made it this far after seeing off some tough opponents, but Pliskova, with her crisp groundstrokes, imposing frame and booming serves, represents a major step-up in class. The Czech might not have been entirely convincing in the first week, especially during three-set duels with Nicole Gibbs and then Shuai Zhang, and she’s yet to win a grand slam despite sitting at the top of the rankings, but that was one mighty show of intent on Monday, when she allowed the USA’s Jennifer Brady only one game during 46 brutally one-sided minutes. This promises to be a fine match - and once it’s done, whenever that’ll be, it’ll be time for the men’s No1 to make his entrance. Roger Federer awaits us later, ready to face the mighty Juan Martin del Potro, but not before Rafael Nadal takes a closer look at Andrey Rublev, the young Russian teenager who’s rather stolen Denis Shapovalov’s thunder this week. Play begins at: 5pm BST and 1pm in New York."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/07/african-governments-actions-push-people-into-extremism-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T13:00:10Z","webTitle":"African governments' actions push people into extremism, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/african-governments-actions-push-people-into-extremism-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/07/african-governments-actions-push-people-into-extremism-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"African governments' actions push people into extremism, study finds","bodyText":"Hundreds of violent extremists in Africa have told researchers that government action aimed at countering terrorism and insurgency across the continent was the “tipping point” for their decision to join an extremist group. The finding, in a United Nations study published on Thursday which is one of the largest of its kind, is likely to prompt controversy. Authorities are battling jihadi groups such as Boko Haram in west Africa and al-Shabaab in east Africa, as well as Islamic State and al-Qaida offshoots in the Sahel, often with the support of the US and other western powers. Violent extremism in Africa has killed more than 33,000 people over the last six years and caused widespread displacement, creating or aggravating humanitarian crises affecting millions of people and hitting economic prospects across the continent. “In a majority of cases, paradoxically, state action appears to be the primary factor finally pushing individuals into violent extremism in Africa,” the new report, Journey to Extremism, says. Of more than 500 former members of militant organisations interviewed for the report, 71% pointed to “government action”, including “killing of a family member or friend” or “arrest of a family member or friend” as the incident that prompted them to join a group. “State security-actor conduct is revealed as a prominent accelerator of recruitment, rather than the reverse,” the report says. The often heavy-handed tactics adopted by authorities have frequently drawn criticism from human rights groups and many security experts. Kenyan authorities are reportedly responsible for scores of extrajudicial killings of suspected militants, while Amnesty International has accused the Nigerian military and police of systematic human rights violations. Researchers who worked on the report stress, however, that many factors lead individuals into extremism and that the strategies states have employed cannot explain the spread or the attraction of extremist ideologies. The interviews, conducted over the last three years in west and east Africa, pointed to political and economic marginalisation as key. The majority of recruits to violent organisations come from peripheral areas and frontier zones that have suffered generations of marginalisation, the report says. Most expressed frustration at their economic conditions, naming jobs as their most acute need at the time of joining a group. Some were paid salaries by extremist groups that were substantially higher than the average locally – even for the few who had formal jobs. Recruits also revealed an acute sense of grievance towards governments: 83% believed their government looked after only the interests of a few, and more than 75% placed no trust in politicians or state security agencies. Other factors included low levels of educational achievement, absent fathers during childhood and a minimal understanding of the fundamental tenets of Islam. The findings highlighted some differences between Africa and other regions such as the Middle East and Europe. In part because of low levels of internet use in many areas affected by violent extremism, recruitment in Africa occurs mostly at the local, person-to-person level, rather than online. This may change, however, as connectivity improves, said Mohamed Yahya, lead researcher on the report. Some cite Africa as a “new front” for global jihadist organisations. Despite claims by Nigerian authorities, Boko Haram appears far from defeated. It has killed nearly 400 people in a spate of suicide bombings, often using women and children, since April, double the figure of the previous five months. In Kenya, counter-terrorist agencies have struggled to overcome al-Shabaab networks. In recent weeks, more than 20 people have been killed in the country’s restive north-eastern coastal province of Lamu. “This study sounds the alarm that as a region, Africa’s vulnerability to violent extremism is deepening,” said the UN Development Programme’s Africa director, Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, at the launch on Thursday. About 80% of recruits interviewed for the UN’s research joined within a year of introduction to the violent extremist group – and nearly half of these joined within just one month. The most common emotion when joining was “hope/excitement”, followed closely by “anger”, “vengeance” and “fear”. Those who join extremist groups tend to have lower levels of religious or formal education and less understanding of the meaning of religious texts, Yahya said. Although more than half of the respondents cited religion as a reason for joining an extremist group, 57% also admitted understanding little to nothing of the religious texts or interpretations, or not reading religious texts at all. “Our work suggests that actually understanding one’s religion can strengthen resilience to the pull of extremism,” Yahya said. Many analysts and policymakers have blamed religious education for the spread of violent extremism. Yahya and his team found, however, that receiving at least six years of religious schooling reduced the likelihood of joining an extremist group by as much as 32%. The idea that their “religion is under threat” was found to be a common perspective among many respondents. “The success of the ideology is that it gives the individual a chance to fight back against their conditions, which are portrayed as due to the government or some global conspiracy,” Yahya said. Around a third of those who joined extremist groups voluntarily said they had never visited cities as a child, and reported less mixing at school than their reference group counterparts. This suggests that “in some instances, a higher level of mobility and exposure to others may generate a greater confidence in others, and resilience to future radicalisation”, the researchers concluded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/07/christian-tetzlaff-bach-sonatas-and-partitas-cd-review-ondine","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T14:15:12Z","webTitle":"Bach: Sonatas and Partitas CD review – the pinnacle of the violin repertoire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/07/christian-tetzlaff-bach-sonatas-and-partitas-cd-review-ondine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/07/christian-tetzlaff-bach-sonatas-and-partitas-cd-review-ondine","fields":{"headline":"Bach: Sonatas and Partitas CD review – the pinnacle of the violin repertoire","bodyText":"This is Christian Tetzlaff’s third recording of Bach’s solo Sonatas and Partitas, the pinnacle of the violin repertoire, but don’t fear that he has run out of things to say. His sleeve note explaining his approach to the cycle is as thoughtful and personal as you would expect from him, and his realisation of it in performance does indeed hang together as a journey from solemnity towards acceptance and joy, with the lengthy Chaconne of the D minor Sonata perhaps representing a very personal bereavement. Within this, the movements can be not only unpredictable, as one expects from Tetzlaff, but uneven, and the odd one doesn’t come off – the second Double of the first Sonata, for example, which races by in short, springy bow strokes, so fast that it sounds gabbled.

A new play is to celebrate the life of Martyn Hett, the Corrie superfan who died in the Manchester Arena bombing. The production, called #BeMoreMartyn, will be based “word for word” on memories of the 29-year-old shared by his closest friends. Hett was one of 22 people killed in the suicide attack at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester on 22 May. His name trended worldwide in the 24 hours after the bombing, as people revelled in the colourful life of a social media enthusiast who once appeared on ITV1’s Good Morning Britain to celebrate his “unashamedly unclassy” favourite Corrie character, Deirdre Barlow, whose face he had tattooed on his calf. Since his death, Hett’s friends and family have encouraged people to celebrate his zest for life. The play, produced by the Hope Theatre Company, will ask the question: “How do we be more Martyn?” It will feature stories involving some of Hett’s favourite divas, including the Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus, who performed at his funeral in June, and Audrey Roberts, the Coronation Street character who was the focus of one of Hett’s biggest social media hits. His video compilation of the “Audrey Roberts noise” has been watched more than 580,000 times on YouTube. Adam Zane, artistic director of Hope Theatre Company, said: “This is a unique event celebrating Martyn’s extraordinary take on popular culture. “I wasn’t fortunate enough to meet Martyn during his life, but having spoken with so many of his friends and family during the research for this production, I couldn’t think of a more fitting way to share their memories of him than word for word.” #BeMoreMartyn will run at Hope Mill Theatre in Ancoats, Manchester, on 22 and 23 October at 7.30pm. Tickets will be priced £20 and all profits will be donated to Martyn’s favoured charities, Beacon Counselling, Beechwood Cancer Care Centre and Kidscan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/06/endometriosis-agony-doctors-women-guidelines-nice","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T11:35:28Z","webTitle":"Endometriosis left me in agony.

Now doctors must take women seriously","bodyText":"I am writing this while lying in a semi-foetal position with a cold cloth on my forehead and a heat pack on my abdomen. This is not an ideal position from which to do any type of work, but for me and the other 176 million endometriosis sufferers worldwide, it’s often all we can manage. This is why the updated guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), released today, are to be commended. These guidelines emphasise the importance of doctors believing their patients when they tell them about their menstrual pain and other attendant symptoms. This seems like obvious advice, but the average time it takes to diagnose endometriosis is seven to eight years. That’s seven to eight years of mind-numbing pain, clotting, diarrhoea, chronic bloating, self-medicating and, often, extremely low moods and anxiety. It’s seven to eight years of potential damage to your chances of conceiving. It’s estimated that endometriosis affects one in 10 people with uteruses worldwide and yet when I was diagnosed a decade ago, I knew no one else with the disease. I was 20 and had been in chronic pain since the age of 13. While the pain would reach its peak during menstruation, leading to me vomiting and passing out, it affected me all the time. There was sharp, stabbing ovulation pain, dragging, relentless back pain, stinging rushes of pain through my legs and arms. I medicated, then medicated some more, then went to bed for days with nausea and misery, wondering why my body had betrayed me. Despite all this, I was comparatively lucky because my parents and my GP took my pain seriously. By the age of 20, I had tried every non-surgical treatment available and all that was left was a laparoscopy, an invasive procedure that remains the only effective way of treating endometriosis. I went under for four hours and when I woke up I was shown pictures of my insides, which had been scraped and lasered and prodded about. It was not a pretty sight. My endometrium – the stuff that’s supposed to stay in your uterus until it exits your body – had spent seven years attaching itself to my bladder, fallopian tubes and bowel. It had scarred my right ovary. If left unchecked, this could have rendered me infertile, not to mention further destroyed my quality of life. I spent a difficult month recovering, during which I suffered from a severe bout of depression (a common side-effect of the surgery) and needed help walking until I could rebuild my abdominal strength. I experienced around 18 months of reduced symptoms before they began to build up again. I have had surgery once since then and now have a piece of mesh behind my right ovary to prevent it from being trapped against my pelvic floor. When I decide to have a child, there is a strong possibility that I’ll need a third surgery if I hope to conceive naturally. I have structured my life and my career around this disease. I’ve missed more social events than I can count and recently went to a wedding so medicated that I had to ask the friend next to me to keep me upright during the ceremony. I am the only person I know who doesn’t own a pair of jeans, but what seems like a kooky style choice is actually a result of my near-constant painful abdominal swelling, rendering anything with a tight waistband unwearable. I work as a freelance writer and editor partly because I need a job that I can do from home as there are days when I am physically unable to get out of bed (or, even worse, off the bathroom floor). I spent my early 20s working minimum-wage jobs in bars, theatres and shops and the only way I got through shifts was by taking double the recommended painkiller dose and secretly throwing up in the staff toilets. Most sufferers are not as fortunate as me. They’re still doubling their doses and throwing up in your workplace because they don’t have any other options. They may not even know what’s causing their pain because the last doctor they saw recommended ibuprofen and sent them on their way. This move from Nice is so welcome because endometriosis sufferers need to be believed. Treatment is a long road and it only gets harder the longer the disease is left unchecked. From my foetal position on the floor, I hope fervently that these guidelines make a difference. • Brydie Lee-Kennedy is an Australian-born, London-based columnist and writer for TV and theatre"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/06/the-suitcase-review-hull-truck-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T11:38:09Z","webTitle":"The Suitcase review – Masekela's music drives desperate apartheid drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/06/the-suitcase-review-hull-truck-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/06/the-suitcase-review-hull-truck-theatre","fields":{"headline":"The Suitcase review – Masekela's music drives desperate apartheid drama","bodyText":"The suitcase on stage is old and battered, with a fraying rope handle. It is unremarkable, but the way it is burnished by the light makes it glisten like something precious. It is as tempting as gold to Timi (Siyabonga Thwala) who is down on his luck in 1950s South Africa after moving from a rural village to the city with his young wife, Namhla (Masasa Mbangeni). When these bewildered country bumpkins arrive in Durban, their eyes grow round as saucers. They react to the disembodied voice of the train-station announcer as if it is God’s. They are dependent on the kindness of strangers, and initially their luck holds, but soon their dream begins to tarnish. As the daily toll of seeking work during the brutal apartheid regime starts to affect their relationship, Timi feels more and more humiliated and Namhla’s optimistic chant that “tomorrow the sun must rise” sounds not just hollow but taunting. So he takes a chance and seizes an opportunity that may well be their salvation. Es’kia Mphahlele’s 1954 short story was born out of the horrors of apartheid but is a hymn to people living on the edge and dreaming of a better life. Threaded through with the exquisite music and songs of Hugh Masekela – sometimes joyful, often keening and sorrowful – this simple piece of storytelling theatre speaks to anyone who has ever felt that they have failed themselves and their family. It is a show that curls back on itself like a snake, and if James Ngcobo’s production for Johannesburg’s Market Theatre is sometimes overly leisurely and a little too studied, it makes up for it with an appealing, uncluttered directness. What initially appears charming turns out to have a real, if not totally unexpected, sting in the tail. The leads are touching, and there is fine support from Desmond Dube and Nhlanhla John Lata but one of the pleasures of the evening is Wesley France’s moody lighting, which conjures temptation glinting in the despairing shadows.

The subject is Newcastle United and the manner in which his club drives the rhythms of his city. The relationship is fierce and emotional – for good and for bad, and everything in between – and he has pretty much seen it all from his childhood as a Newcastle fan to the 14 seasons he spent at St James’ Park as a first-team player. Is there another place in England quite like it? “The club is the pulse of the city,” Ameobi says. “The result on a Saturday determines the vibe for that week. It can be great at times but, on the flip side, when things aren’t going your way, I’ve seen players who just can’t deal with it because it is that intense. I loved it – that friction of wanting to do well and, also, having to do well. I always cherished living in that bubble. “It is important people understand it is not just about what the team does; it is how you do it. Ultimately, if the fans see you putting in the effort, they’ll always take you to heart. The club is bang in the centre of the city and it being a one-club town plays a big part, too. All you will see all week is Newcastle shirts. You don’t get that in many cities.” Ameobi has changed his black-and-white stripes; at least, on a professional level. Having left Newcastle in 2014 and bounced from Gaziantep BB in Turkey’s second division to Crystal Palace, from Bolton Wanderers to Fleetwood Town, the striker who is 36 next month has found a way to Notts County in League Two. He joined English football’s other Magpies in February of last season and signed a new one-year contract in June. The obvious difference to Newcastle is that Notts County must vie for prominence in their city with Nottingham Forest but, in many other respects, Ameobi has found a home away from home. “The size of the club is massive,” Ameobi says. “It’s the oldest professional club in the world and there’s a lot of prestige there. With them playing in black-and-white and being called the Magpies, I’ve always been aware of them and the history was a big draw for me; the fact they are a very proud club in the centre of the city. “When I came in and I saw the influence the team had on the city, there was a parallel with Newcastle – in terms of how much the clubs are the heartbeat of the city. When we started winning, there was an upturn in how people viewed the club. People started coming back and building that momentum was immense for me. That was a big reason why I decided to come back [in June] because we’ve got a lot of unfinished business.” Ameobi goes a long way back with the Notts County manager, Kevin Nolan, having played with him at England Under-21 level; the pair later became team-mates at Newcastle. When Nolan first called him, the sales pitch could not have been easy. He had taken over in January, with the club on a 10-match losing streak in the league and teetering just above the cut-off into non-league football while off the pitch they were the subject of a winding-up petition brought by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. It was a mess. Alan Hardy had become the owner on 11 January – one of his first moves was to appoint Nolan – and he said the club was losing £1.6m per year. Hardy helped to stabilise the finances, allowing Notts County to emerge from a transfer embargo and take Ameobi as a free agent. He had been without a club for the first half of last season, when he was working at Newcastle to maintain his fitness. Nolan has overseen a remarkable improvement. He won 10 of his 21 league matches last season, with four draws, to hoist Notts County from 22nd place in the 24-team division to a finish of 16th. Ameobi was on board from the fifth game onwards. This time out, Nolan’s team have so far taken 10 points from an available 15 to sit fifth. Ameobi, a fixture in the starting XI, scored four goals last season, including a left-foot volley against Colchester United that was voted the club’s goal of the year. He has yet to score this season. “The club was on its knees. The first time I came into the dressing room, I could sense that,” Ameobi says. “The players had played four games under Kevin, winning one and drawing one but, before that, they had lost 10 in a row. It is hard to escape that rot. “It’s been about trying to get the honour back. It’s important that we build something positive for the city; build a winning, positive culture. The players have to have respect for the club they’re playing for. That’s what I’m all about – making sure you’re wearing the shirt with pride and giving everything. We’ve been able to do that in the short space of time I’ve been here.” Ameobi says he feels as fit as he has ever done; that he “still has a lot to give on the field”. But the attraction of Notts County also lay in the chance to serve as a mentor to younger players, as he considers a move into coaching. He has completed his Uefa A Licence, did some coaching at Newcastle’s academy over the first half of last season and it is a measure of his dedication to the work – and his boyhood club – that he has continued to do so since his move to Notts County. “I’m still helping out on days off [from Notts County],” Ameobi says. “Newcastle is home and it’s where I live, even if I stay down in Nottingham during the week. I work with Newcastle’s academy players, the schoolboys; from 12s to 16s. It’s doing sessions and working with the strikers. I am doing it when I can. It’s something I’m passionate about – I have been all my career – and it’s helped me, as well. It lets me see the game from a coach’s perspective. It’s really broadened my horizons. “When I was in the Newcastle youth system, I was inspired by the guys in the first team and that’s what I want to do for these younger players. I feel there haven’t been enough players coming through the academies, certainly at Newcastle and, if I can improve the players there by one or two per cent, it’s something I feel obliged to do.” Ameobi is intelligent, easy-going company and it is no great stretch to imagine him as a popular coach, particularly as he has the playing experience to command respect. Equally, it is clear his heart would be set on Newcastle. “I love the place, I’m from there and it’s what I’ve always known. In the future, I’m certainly open to it. It’s something I’m working towards now. I’m helping the young kids and, even if I’m not an official part of it, I will always be there to try to help the younger kids coming through. Newcastle is a club that will always be a part of my life.” Ameobi achieved cult status during his years at Newcastle, mainly because of his penchant for Mackem-slaying. In 16 appearances against Sunderland, he scored seven goals; only Jackie Milburn has scored more for Newcastle in the derby. Ameobi broke through at the club under Sir Bobby Robson as an 18-year-old and he scored in the Champions League against Barcelona at the Camp Nou at 21. He remembers that as a “pivotal moment” but his goals against Sunderland are even more special, his favourite being the half-volley in the 5-1 home win from 2010. “For every Newcastle fan, it is the pinnacle to beat the Mackems,” Ameobi says. “And for me to score that many goals against them – it endeared me to the Newcastle fans and I am forever grateful for that. I didn’t do anything different for those games. It was just destiny. The volley in the 5-1 stands out. It was just the occasion, the atmosphere and the technique was very hard. To be able to produce that in such a setting was very fulfilling.” It is fun to listen to Ameobi’s old stories while he tugs at the heart strings when he talks about Robson, whom he describes as a “father figure” and a man-management “genius”. What shines through, however, is his maturity and sense of perspective. “Being from Newcastle, I was always keen not to get myself immersed in it all because it’s very easy to lose your head,” Ameobi says. “I was always able to detach myself from everything and look at the bigger picture. That’s why I had the longevity I had at Newcastle. “As a young player, it’s very easy to get wrapped up in the whole business of: ‘This is you.’ I find my identity not in what I can do but who I am.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/06/the-truth-about-wages-and-immigration-emerges-at-last","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T19:14:42Z","webTitle":"The truth about wages and immigration emerges at last | Philip Inman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/the-truth-about-wages-and-immigration-emerges-at-last","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/06/the-truth-about-wages-and-immigration-emerges-at-last","fields":{"headline":"The truth about wages and immigration emerges at last","bodyText":"The impact of immigration has been a running sore inside government ever since Tony Blair waived the right in 2004 to restrict access to workers from 10 new members of the European Union. Self-employed builders were the first to complain. They argued that rates of pay in the construction industry plummeted in the years that followed and failed to recover after the 2008 crash in line with other industrial sectors. Across other sectors where migrant labour made a big impact, such as agriculture and the care industry, many workers took the same view. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat MP and former business minister in the coalition government, said nine studies crossed his desk that attempted to assess the impact on wages across the economy, all of which he claims were suppressed by the Home Office. They were kept from public view, he said, to avoid sending out the message that immigration had “very little impact” on wages or employment. “I remember it vividly. Overwhelmingly it has been the case that overseas workers have been complementary rather than competitive to British workers,” he said. Blair’s government was responding to an ageing and declining population of UK-born workers. Without seeking to replace them, there was the likelihood that the economy would stagnate or shrink, much as Italy’s had for the previous 20 years. There were two answers: encourage the over 65s to stay in work and allow the number of immigrants to outstrip the flow of Brits quitting to live abroad. Since the financial crash of 2008 the number of UK-born workers aged 16 to 64 has declined by around half a million, according to the Office for National Statistics labour force survey. At the same time the workforce has increased by about 2 million to a record high. Older workers make up a significant minority of extra people in employment. There were 1.2 million workers aged 65 or older in 2016, up from 700,000 in 2008 and 500,000 in 2003. But the focus has been on migrants, who have secured a disproportionate number of the full-time jobs on offer over the same period. To emphasise the point, since the jobs market began to recover in 2012, around two-thirds of the improvement in the UK’s employment rate can be attributed to migrant labour. UK-born workers, on the other hand, were less likely to be in full-time employment in 2016 compared with 2008. The gains they made were in self-employment or working part-time, whether that was in a staff or self-employed position. Surely this trend justified the view that migrants marginalised UK-born workers? The studies seen by Cable showed that migrants rarely supplanted UK-born workers, but went into expanding industries where there were simply not enough people to do the jobs or UK-born workers willing to do them. The biggest employment growth was in sectors, such as hospitality and leisure, transport and logistics and the care industry. Professional firms in London were also more likely to hire the over-qualified diaspora from the continent who found themselves unable to break into a moribund jobs market. But even here, firms were expanding their work, not substituting migrants for UK-born workers. It meant that essential job vacancies were filled rather than left open for months or years. Businesses that might otherwise have put their expansion plans on hold, from coffee shops and supermarket delivery services to fintech start-ups, were able to meet a growing demand. Yet the sense that Britain was adopting the easy – and cheap – way to fill the gap left by an ageing workforce, is borne out by GDP per head figures showing virtually no improvement in the past 10 years and data from industry and commerce. Last month the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) said real wages were likely to continue falling after finding that employers were receiving an average of 24 applications for each low-skilled job. Firms expect to increase wages by just 1% next year, less than half the 2.6% inflation rate in June. The CIPD said restrictions on EU migrants would change the picture and possibly push up rates of pay. A Brexiter would obviously conclude that businesses were saving themselves the cash they would otherwise spend on productivity-enhancing new equipment and processes by using armies of low cost labour. When it is an economic law that without crucial investments, each worker’s productive capacity remained the same and so did their pay, how could they conclude anything else. Even Cable admitted while business minister that Britain’s flexible labour market was getting out of hand. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is among those to argue that productivity figures are distorted by the expansion of low-skilled work, which drags down the average. It tells us nothing, he argues, about the investment in skilled labour, which continues, albeit at a slow pace. Productivity gains are also harder to achieve in economies with small manufacturing sectors. Britain’s national income is built on a thriving services industry that is fiendishly difficult to measure for possible productivity gains. It doesn’t mean they aren’t achieved. To muddy the waters further, the government’s austerity programme has cut the benefits available and therefore the incomes of lower paid groups. Are they blaming migrants when it is the government’s welfare cuts that hit their living standards? David Cameron responded to criticism of Britain’s low wage culture with an apprenticeship levy to encourage skills training. Chancellor Philip Hammond plans to overhaul further education and increase public investment. These are all measures lacking in the post-crash era. Had they been put in place, tensions over EU migration might have dissipated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/06/suffragette-banner-charity-shop-emmeline-pankhurst-peoples-history-museum-manchester","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T12:35:23Z","webTitle":"Rare suffragette banner hidden in charity shop for 10 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/06/suffragette-banner-charity-shop-emmeline-pankhurst-peoples-history-museum-manchester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/06/suffragette-banner-charity-shop-emmeline-pankhurst-peoples-history-museum-manchester","fields":{"headline":"Rare suffragette banner hidden in charity shop for 10 years","bodyText":"One of the most important pieces of suffragette history has been bought for the nation after languishing in an obscure charity shop for 10 years. A banner that provided the backdrop for many of Emmeline Pankhurst’s most famous speeches had been tucked away in a cupboard in the Halton Moor and Osmondthorpe Project for Elders charity shop in Leeds. It had been donated as part of a house clearance, with volunteers unaware of its significance. Embroidered with the legend “Manchester – first in the fight”, the purple banner has been bought by the People’s History Museum in Pankhurst’s hometown of Manchester and will go on display next May for the centenary of women getting the vote. Pankhurst shared the platform with the banner at a huge rally in Manchester’s Heaton Park on 19 July 1908, when she spoke to a crowd of 50,000 people. It aimed to remind people that the Women’s Social and Political Union had started in Manchester in 1903, despite having by then moved its headquarters to London. The People’s History Museum, which charts the history of British democracy, had hoped to buy the banner when it came up for auction this year but was outbid by a professional dealer. Jenny Mabbott, the museum’s head of collections, was heartbroken to miss out on the first chance to buy a Suffragette banner for 30 years, but gave her card to the dealer “just in case we could change his mind”. He eventually agreed to sell up for £20,000, about a quarter of which the museum raised in just one week from a crowdfunding campaign, which saw supporters pledge amounts from £1 to £2,000 to the purchase. The rest of the cash came from an Arts Council England/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund’s Collecting Cultures programme. Mabbott said: “The significance of this banner to suffragette history cannot be overstated. Such pieces rarely come up for sale and this combined with its quality is what prompted our campaign to acquire it. “What makes the banner even more special is that it witnessed some of the key suffragette rallies that took place in Manchester, where the movement began. Having the Manchester suffragette banner as part of our collection will help us to illuminate to visitors this important chapter in the story of Britain’s struggle for democracy so we thank everyone who has supported our campaign.” Mabbott and colleagues were able to establish the authenticity of the banner with the help of the Manchester Guardian. An edition from 20 July 1908 carried a report of the Heaton Park rally, which mentioned the banner alongside an anecdote about a suffragette being heckled by someone shouting: “Why don’t you get married?” Miss Woodcock of Liverpool replied: “I am kept so busy advocating women suffrage that I have no time to think of it. But just give votes to women and then I may consider my wedding.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2017/sep/06/time-and-place-masterclass-with-cambridge-university-creative-writing-tutors-fiction-course","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T10:03:12Z","webTitle":"Time and place: A masterclass with Cambridge University’s creative writing tutors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2017/sep/06/time-and-place-masterclass-with-cambridge-university-creative-writing-tutors-fiction-course","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2017/sep/06/time-and-place-masterclass-with-cambridge-university-creative-writing-tutors-fiction-course","fields":{"headline":"Time and place: A masterclass with Cambridge University’s creative writing tutors","bodyText":"This course has now passed – but we have now launched the new version of this course.

Prospective students will be full of excitement, but for many it will also be a testing time. Universities already have plenty of initiatives to support their students in place – but they could be strengthened through a transition strategy that prioritises mental health and wellbeing. With higher study costs and increasingly competitive job markets, there is greater pressure than ever on this year’s new cohort of students. Our annual Student Experience survey shows that almost nine in 10 (87%) of first year students find it difficult to cope with social or academic aspects of university life. Students are unsure of what to expect, and a large proportion say that the transition from school to university is a source of considerable stress. The stress of studying is a key area in which students struggle, with almost six in 10 reporting that this made it difficult for them to cope. Other troubles that featured significantly included isolation (44%), balancing work and study (37%), financial difficulties (36%) and living independently (22%). When we dig deeper into the data on coping with the transition to university, there is a notable gender imbalance. Female students find it particularly difficult to cope, with 91% reporting to have struggled with one or more of the above issues, compared to 82% of male students. The stigma around mental health has thankfully diminished in recent years, which has perhaps led to higher rates of reporting. New Institute for Public Policy Research analysis found nearly five times as many students as 10 years ago disclosed a mental health condition to their university. This means demand for university mental health services is growing, and institutions will have to ensure they are equipped to deal with it. Now is the time for universities to assess how the growing demand for mental health services can be met. The recent publication of Universities UK framework on mental health has highlighted the need for student mental health to be a strategic priority, embedded across all university activities. While the efforts made so far are considerable, mental health and wellbeing services in universities have for too long been seen as an add-on. Students must feel they are supported through the transitions and milestones of university life in a holistic way. There are many instances of best practice across the sector, but the requirement for collaboration cannot be understated. Our own teams in student accommodation are trained to understand the pressures students face and recognise the signs of isolation, anxiety and depression to ensure that either we and/or the university can intervene, when required. We tested the effectiveness of this approach through a pilot project at Nottingham Trent, which resulted in a student mental health guidance pack (pdf) published earlier this year. The project underscored the need for collaboration and auditing across sectors; to improve the level of understanding about mental health across the whole university community, including accommodation teams; and to embed a sustainable and resourced strategic approach. One policy initiative I would like to throw into the mix would see more universities adopt the formalisation of a pro vice-chancellor for transition. Were this more widespread, it could provide a still greater focus on guiding new students through the challenges of independent study and living. Now that we have a framework that provides a step change in how universities can approach mental health provision, we should grab it with both hands. A more joined-up approach between the academic and social/residential elements of university is essential to this. While signposting of existing services must be improved, a wider understanding of the pressures students face is vital if we are to ensure that mental health provision meets their growing needs.

Le Tombeau de Couperin develops as a glittering, gently looping piano motif that slowly stretches over an emerging drums groove, becomes a sublime pizzicato bass reverie, and finally ascends to a percussion tumult reminiscent of another European supertrio, Phronesis. Lähns explores the Violin Sonata with a cello-like grace, and the 16-minute Boléro is a tour de force of rhythm-layering minimalism compounded by Sheppard’s improv with a sax-and-brass quartet. Elsewhere, 5 O’Clock Foxtrot is a canny conversation of glancing piano figures and hip-hop patterns.

Luca Cumani’s three-year-old won off a mark of 79 on his handicap debut at Newmarket in June and has suggested in both his runs since that a win from a new mark in the mid-80s is not beyond him. He got going too late at Salisbury last time out before finishing strongly to get within a length of the winner, and the horse that followed him home was a winner next time out. The small field on Wednesday is a slight worry as Rigoletto looks like a horse who will be best when closing on a decent pace, but a couple of his rivals have raced prominently in the past and there is little else to discourage a bet at around 7-4. Starshell (5.10) is lightly raced and has improved significantly this year for a step up to a mile-and-a-half, and his two starts on the all-weather this season suggest he is well handicapped off 64 for his debut on turf. Mouchee (6.25), who improved to finish second in a strongly run race last time out, catches the eye on the card at Kempton Park this evening along with Morello (5.20), while On Alberts Head (3.00) and Tynecastle Park (4.30) stand out over the jumps at Southwell.

The inquiry into the government’s broad-ranging overhaul of the welfare system delivered its report late on Wednesday. It recommended the legislation, introduced in June, be passed. The changes include the controversial drug-testing plan for welfare recipients. But they also introduce major changes to the compliance regime for jobseekers, through a demerit point-style scheme the government says will save it $204.7m. The legislation also abolishes the wife pension payments for about 200 women living overseas and removes “intent to claim provisions”, which protect people who are entitled to welfare but are unable to lodge a full claim due to personal circumstances. It also reduces the overall rate of a bereavement allowance designed for low-income families by about $1,300, which will save about $1.04m. Dissenting reports from Labor and the Greens both urged that the bill not be passed. “The measures proposed in this bill will further disadvantage vulnerable Australians and contribute to growing inequality,” Labor’s report said. “The committee has heard overwhelming evidence from medical specialists, community sector leaders and representatives of job service providers that the implementation of measures in this bill will have serious, negative consequences for many Australians.” The plan to drug test 5,000 welfare recipients across three trial sites – south-western Sydney, Logan in Queensland and Mandurah in Western Australia – met fierce opposition from the medical community and drug and alcohol sector. The government argues the trial is unlike anything attempted before and will help welfare recipients deal with drug and alcohol addiction by tying their income support to their participation in drug counselling or rehabilitation. A first failed test will see a welfare recipient placed on income management, via a basics card, and a second will see them referred for treatment. If they fail to engage in treatment, they will face sanctions including a possible loss of income support. Drug and alcohol researchers, frontline workers, physicians, psychiatrists and policy experts all warned that taking a punitive approach to drug and alcohol addiction would not work. Many warned it would drive people away from the welfare system, forcing them to find other means to support their drug and alcohol problems. The inquiry was warned that drug treatment services were already overstretched and wouldn’t be able to meet the extra demand. The Department of Social Services said it only expected between 100 and 120 people to test positive a second time and be sent for medical assessment. The government is also giving $10m to boost the capacity of drug treatment services, although that amount has been described by the sector as “a drop in the ocean”. The Greens, in their dissenting report, said the legislation “completely [ignored] the advice and evidence from both medical professionals and social security experts. “The Australian Greens are deeply concerned by the government’s repeated rejection of the expertise and evidence given by stakeholders in their continued pursuit of harsh cuts to income support.” The Greens senator Rachel Siewert, who sat on the inquiry, said the evidence of experts had been ignored in the final report. “During the inquiry into the bill we were told extremely clearly by medical professionals and social services providers that the drug testing income support recipients is flawed,” Siewert said. “The minister has disregarded this evidence despite comparable overseas measures and local experts making it crystal clear that this is going to be a costly and ineffective endeavour that just stigmatises people struggling with addiction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/05/star-wars-episode-ix-colin-trevorrow","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T23:12:28Z","webTitle":"The force isn't with you: Colin Trevorrow departs Star Wars: Episode IX","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/05/star-wars-episode-ix-colin-trevorrow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/05/star-wars-episode-ix-colin-trevorrow","fields":{"headline":"The force isn't with you: Colin Trevorrow departs Star Wars: Episode IX","bodyText":"Colin Trevorrow has become the latest director to part ways with a Star Wars project after Lucasfilm confirmed he would no longer helm Star Wars: Episode IX.

Seven men from the Party for Freedom group waved placards and flags, shouted “Aussie pride, nationwide”, “shame” and “disgrace” through megaphones after they crashed the City of Yarra council meeting in Richmond at about 7pm on Tuesday. “The ones who should call Australia home are Australians,” one protester shouted. Mayor Amanda Stone said: “It was disruptive and it was disappointing ... eventually they left after a few minutes and one even apologised for disrupting the meeting,” Stone said. Police were called and stayed at the hall for some time after the disruption but no arrests were made. Last month, the federal government stripped Yarra council of the power to hold citizenship ceremonies after it voted unanimously to stop referring to 26 January as Australia Day and end its tradition of holding citizenship ceremonies on that date in recognition of it being a day of distress for many Indigenous people. At the time, Stone said: “People can still have their barbecues and parties on the January 26 public holiday but I hope our stance encourages people to stop and think about what this date really means in the history of our nation.” After the move, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said: “An attack on Australia Day is a repudiation of the values the day celebrates: freedom, a fair go, mateship and diversity.” Days later, Darebin council followed suit and voted to move its citizenship ceremonies to another date. The deputy mayor, Gaetano Greco, said: “We’re trying to have a party on a day where it basically was a day of invasion and Australia’s brutal colonisation,” he said. “New migrants who become aware of January 26 will not want to become an Australian citizen on that particular day.” Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/05/england-under-21-latvia-european-championship-qualifier-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T20:58:36Z","webTitle":"England Under-21s serve up exhilarating fare in easy victory over Latvia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/05/england-under-21-latvia-european-championship-qualifier-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/05/england-under-21-latvia-european-championship-qualifier-match-report","fields":{"headline":"England Under-21s serve up exhilarating fare in easy victory over Latvia","bodyText":"A truly slick performance, full of pizzazz and vigour, earned England their first victory of the Euro 2019 campaign on Tuesday night. Goals by Demarai Gray, Tammy Abraham and then Kasey Palmer lit up the most routine of wins over Latvia on a chilly summer’s evening in Bournemouth. It was almost inevitable Gray would shine on the south coast. He was left out of Aidy Boothroyd’s starting lineup against Holland on Friday, with the England Under-21 manager saying that he had been affected by transfer speculation linking him with a move to – ironically – Bournemouth. Gray relentlessly toyed with the Latvia full-backs, and will have doubtless impressed the watching Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, who has coveted the winger since he was a teenager at Birmingham City. “At one point I thought he [Gray] was going to play every single position, he was running around that much,” said Boothroyd. “He has enormous amounts of ability. His goal was terrific; he could have scored an even better team goal really but the goalkeeper’s made a save and punched it out. Him and Sheyi Ojo did really well. I’m really pleased with their performances.” Ten of Boothroyd’s squad were making the step up after helping England lift the World Cup in South Korea over the summer, with four players – Kyle Walker-Peters, Fikayo Tomori, Tom Davies and Ojo – making their under-21 debuts. There were nine changes from England’s draw in Doetinchem on Friday but the captain Joe Gomez, a Liverpool defender, and the Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook, who captained that team to a history-making victory in June, retained their places. This, in fact, was Cook’s first appearance in front of the Bournemouth locals this season after failing to feature in any of the club’s opening three fixtures. He impressed, too, with Boothroyd saying Cook was the best player on the pitch. Just as Gareth Southgate had preached patience after England made hard work of dispatching of Malta, Boothroyd had urged his team to retain their composure and calm in breaking down Latvia, who had drawn their first two qualifying matches. His players started with an electrifying urgency, though, with Ojo skinning Vladislavs Sorokins within the opening seconds. At times the Liverpool winger virtually used the Latvia left-back as a training mannequin, exhibiting his tricks and flicks before leaving him on his backside. After 12 minutes Ojo slid in Abraham, who made an explosive run forward before unselfishly squaring the ball for Gray, who forced the goalkeeper, Vladislavs Kurakins, into a smart stop. A minute later Abraham again laid the ball off for Gray, who jinked inside on to his right foot before emphatically blasting his effort home. Ojo then tried the same formula, darting in from the right before curling a left-footed effort just wide of goal. England did not have to wait too much longer for a second. Abraham, described by his manager as a “bundle of enthusiasm”, powered home after unleashing a shot that proved too powerful for Kurakins, who really ought to have kept it out. Boothroyd tweaked personnel but little else changed, with England dominating from start to finish. There was the odd lapse of concentration, with 18-year-old Trent Alexander-Arnold, the youngest England player selected here, guilty of running the ball out of play. But these were merely a few blemishes on a perfect evening’s work for England, which was rounded off with Palmer’s simple tap-in after a helping hand from a butter-fingered Kurakins. “I remember reading things about our players not being as technically good as others in the world, well we are now,” Boothroyd added. “Our next step has got to be making sure we’re as tactically aware as every other nation we play against: particularly at the top end.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/sep/05/trump-ends-daca-young-immigrants","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T21:31:38Z","webTitle":"Trump turns on Dreamers | The minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/05/trump-ends-daca-young-immigrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/05/trump-ends-daca-young-immigrants","fields":{"headline":"Trump turns on Dreamers","bodyText":"Donald Trump announced that a Barack Obama-era program to protect undocumented people who arrived in the US as children would end in March, exposing 800,000 young people to deportation.

Trump accused Obama of an abuse of power and said Congress should legislate on the issue. Who are the Dreamers?

Now more than ever I need to continue working.” The Trump administration’s termination of the policy that protected “Dreamers” – undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children – from deportation will affect nearly 800,000 young people. Five years after Barack Obama’s implementation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) allowed recipients to get driver’s licenses, attend college, begin careers, purchase homes, and do all the other things that US citizens take for granted, Dreamers now face the reality that it could all be taken away. For Solis, that means preparing for a future without her well-paid job at an insurance company and her rent-controlled apartment in her hometown of Oakland. “My work permit expires in September, so I have until September,” the 30-year-old Daca recipient said. “I need to work as much as I can right now and save as much money as I can.” Among Solis’s most pressing concerns is the fact that she provided the federal government with extensive information about herself in order to receive Daca in the first place. “Immigration has my address,” she said. “So come September, what’s going to happen? “I can’t stay there, but where am I going to go?” Montoya, a Daca recipient and the founder of a grassroots immigrant rights organization in Phoenix, Arizona, was concerned not just for herself but for the people who work for her. “I have as an employee a US citizen,” she said Tuesday. “What does it mean if I get taken away?” For Angelica Hernandez, a mechanical engineer at an energy efficiency company in Chandler, Arizona, the stakes are incredibly high. Hernandez was born in Mexico, but came to the US at the age of nine. She received Daca when she was studying for a master’s degree at Stanford. She bought a house, married another Daca recipient, and has two children who are US citizens. “Because of all of the rumors, you kind of mentally prepare for what could happen, but you’re never actually fully prepared,” she said. “I don’t qualify for any type of way for me to become legalized. We’re definitely looking at a plan to protect my daughters in case we are deported.” Trump’s decision to rescind the program puts the onus on Congress to address the situation of the Dreamers – and all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US – legislatively. It also raises the prospect of unsavory negotiations pitting one group of immigrants against another: White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that Trump would not support a standalone bill granting legal status to Dreamers. On Tuesday night, more uncertainty was thrown into the mix when Trump tweeted cryptically that if Congress did not act, then he would “revisit this issue”. For activists like Sheridan Aguirre, a Daca recipient and organizer with United We Dream, political dealmaking would be untenable. “We will not be used as bargaining chips,” Aguirre said Tuesday morning from outside the White House, where he had joined a rally and protest. “We do not want any legislation that throws our parents under the bus and results in them being criminalized, or adds more money for border enforcement.” The recision of Daca was met with outrage from Democratic lawmakers, business and technology leaders, and immigrant rights advocates. Protests erupted in cities across the country, including Denver, where thousands of high school students walked out of school. Belen Sisa, 23, a Daca recipient and senior at Arizona State University, joined one of those protests, marching with fellow immigrant rights activists to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) office in Phoenix after Sessions’ announcement Tuesday morning. But as the march continued, Sisa had to peel away to go inside. She had a 12pm appointment to have her fingerprints taken – one of the steps she must fulfill to have her Daca status renewed for two more years. “I feel very happy that I’m going to be able to fit into the window of people who are going to be able to renew, but it also makes me a little bit mad,” Sisa said. “I’m going through this entire application process, paying fees, and doing all these things that they expect of me, when the message is really clear that I’m not valued as a human. “They just go about business like nothing happened. The person who was taking my fingerprints asked me how my morning was.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/05/john-motson-football-commentator-ready-to-retire","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T23:01:15Z","webTitle":"John Motson almost ready to hang up his sheepskin and end the boys’ own story","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/05/john-motson-football-commentator-ready-to-retire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/05/john-motson-football-commentator-ready-to-retire","fields":{"headline":"John Motson almost ready to hang up his sheepskin and end the boys’ own story","bodyText":"An era will end next summer when John Motson retires from his role as a commentator and pundit on the BBC. Motson, known for his longevity, his sheepskin coat and his excitable boys’ own way behind a microphone, will call it quits in 2018 after half a century at the national broadcaster. Motson came to prominence in the early 1970s when he provided the TV commentary for what began as a run of the mill FA Cup third-round replay. But not only did Hereford’s victory over Newcastle become a celebrated shock, the 35-yard shot from Ronnie Radford that turned the match on its head itself became an iconic moment in televised sport. “The FA Cup as a tournament was very good to me,” says Motson, in an interview to commemorate his final year at the BBC. “I’d like to think I can still have some association with that because it was the Ronnie Radford goal for Hereford against Newcastle which really put me on the map in 1972.” His commentary on Radford’s Rocket was notable less for the words Motson chose – “Ronnie Radford … What a goal … And the crowd have invaded the pitch” –than the tone in which he delivered them. Motson’s apparent excitability behind the microphone echoed the experience felt by fans in the stands and it was this quality that soon saw him rise up the ranks of BBC announcers to become a fixture on Match of the Day and live commentary, especially England internationals. By Motson’s own calculations, he has commentated on over 2,000 matches during his career, including 10 World Cups, 10 European Championships, and an astonishing total of 29 FA Cup finals. Over recent years, the 72-year-old has stepped back from frontline commentary duties, with Guy Mowbray again taking charge of the FA Cup final which Motson last covered in 2008. As part of his final season Motson will get an as yet unspecified role at the final, and will also commentate on 18 Premier League games for Match of the Day. “I just thought my 50th year in the BBC is 2018 and it has to end some time and I thought that would be a good note to go out,” he said. “I also don’t want to go into the area where people say: ‘He’s been there too long, he’s lost it, he’s not what he was.’ I wanted to go out while I was still commentating as well – or as badly – as I have for all those years. I didn’t want to carry on and then people say: ‘Oh dear me, we’ll have to get rid of him.’” Motson was first hired by the BBC in 1968, with a contract to work as a sports presenter on Radio 2. He quickly graduated to TV commentary and directly replaced the BBC’s original star commentator, Kenneth Wolstenholme, on Match of the Day. In 1977 he commentated on his first FA Cup final as a late replacement for the then No1 commentator at the BBC, David Coleman. Coleman stepped aside in the 1980s and for the next 20 years there was a perceived rivalry for the top job between Motson and Barry Davies. If success is measured in World Cup finals, then Motson won, commentating on six in total, breaking the record previously set by Wolstenholme. His career also took in some of the darkest moments in the national sport. In 1989 Motson was at Hillsborough as the disaster unfolded at the stadium. It was his voice that accompanied much of the news footage of that day and he subsequently gave evidence to the coroner’s inquest into the tragedy in 1991. Motson covered most of the biggest matches involving British teams for over 30 years on the BBC. The corporation, however, never secured broadcasting rights for the Champions League and missing out on one particular match in that competition is his biggest regret. “The way the contracts have worked meant I’ve never done a Champions League match,” Motson said. “I’ve never had the opportunity because it has always been a Sky or ITV event but Manchester United against Bayern Munich [in the 1999 Champions League final] is the one I’d have liked to have done. “My opposite number at ITV, Clive Tyldesley, did Manchester United winning the Champions League with two goals in the last minute,” he went on. “I was proud of the way he did it but I would have loved to have done it myself, although I wouldn’t have done it as well as he did.” Motson’s self-effacing and sometimes bumbling manner, often accompanied by images of him drowning in his famous sheepskin coat, have no doubt also contributed to his popularity with the British people. He was awarded an OBE in 2001. Stepping back from frontline commentary in 2008, Motson has continued to work across the BBC, including returning to radio, but he has also attracted a new generation of fans thanks to his voiceovers on the children’s TV show Footy Pups. He says he now has plans to makes full use of his retirement. “I might feel a little bit empty and it might get to me for a short time,” he said, “but I’m hoping to keep my association with football and with broadcasting – I’m not retiring from everything, I’m retiring from the BBC. I’m certainly not going pipe and slippers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/05/donald-trump-daca-end-barack-obama-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T20:33:56Z","webTitle":"'Cruel and wrong': Obama condemns Trump's end to Dreamers program","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/05/donald-trump-daca-end-barack-obama-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/05/donald-trump-daca-end-barack-obama-statement","fields":{"headline":"'Cruel and wrong': Obama condemns Trump's end to Dreamers program","bodyText":"“Wrong”, “self-defeating” and “cruel”. In an extraordinary 850-word statement, Barack Obama sharply criticized Donald Trump’s move on Tuesday to strip protections from young undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers”. It was Obama’s most significant foray in public life since he left the presidency. He had previously issued a brief statement, through a spokesperson, criticizing Trump’s attempted travel ban, and a lengthy written statement on Republican attempts to repeal his signature healthcare law. He also tweeted a series of Nelson Mandela quotes after racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month. In the statement, which was posted to his Facebook page, Obama blasted Trump’s move to repeal the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or Daca, calling it “a political decision”. Earlier on Tuesday, the Trump administration branded Daca “unilateral executive amnesty”. “Let’s be clear,” wrote Obama. “The action taken today isn’t required legally. It’s a political decision, and a moral question.” To be eligible for the Obama-era program, applicants needed to have arrived in the US before age 15 and before 2007. The program granted protection from deportation and made work permits available and was billed as a way of bringing its 800,000 enrollees out of the shadow economy and recognizing their American identities. “But today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again,” Obama said. “To target these young people is wrong – because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating – because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. “What if our kid’s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn’t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?” Obama urged congress to pass legislation replacing protection for young migrants who arrived as children. “I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel,” he said. “Ultimately, this is about basic decency.” The White House did not have an immediate reaction. Trump earlier sought to shift responsibility on the issue to Congress, which he exhorted in a tweet in advance of his policy announcement to “do your job”. Trump justified the policy shift by describing a constitutional misstep on the part of the Obama administration. “The legislative branch, not the executive branch, writes these laws – this is the bedrock of our constitutional system, which I took a solemn oath to preserve, protect and defend,” the president said in a statement defending a decision he did not announce, instead sending out attorney general Jeff Sessions. Obama rejected the analysis, saying the Daca policy was based on “well-established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion” and saying Congress had failed to act to address the problem. “For years while I was president, I asked Congress to send me such a bill,” Obama said. “That bill never came.” Former vice-president Joe Biden also criticized the Trump policy, tweeting earlier on Tuesday: “Brought by parents, these children had no choice in coming here. Now they’ll be sent to countries they’ve never known. Cruel. Not America.” Obama suggested in the final news conference of his presidency that he might speak out if Trump sought to undo the Daca program. “The notion that we would just arbitrarily – or because of politics – punish those kids when they didn’t do anything wrong themselves, I think would be something that would merit me speaking out,” Obama said. The statement came days after the text of a letter Obama left for Trump on inauguration day was revealed. In the letter, Obama urged Trump to protect national institutions and act in the presidency as a caretaker of the office. “We are just temporary occupants of this office,” Obama wrote. “That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions – like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties – that our forebears fought and bled for. “Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it’s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/06/morning-mail-turnbull-trump-and-shorten-tackle-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T21:17:21Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Turnbull, Trump and Shorten tackle North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/06/morning-mail-turnbull-trump-and-shorten-tackle-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/06/morning-mail-turnbull-trump-and-shorten-tackle-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Turnbull, Trump and Shorten tackle North Korea","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 6 September. Top stories Bill Shorten has said he and Penny Wong will travel to South Korea and Japan to discuss North Korea’s nuclear threats, as Malcolm Turnbull awaits a call from Donald Trump to discuss the crisis. Shorten welcomed the call, scheduled for Wednesday morning, saying North Korea’s open defiance of China was “the clearest example of the contempt it shows for all nations” regardless of whether they are allies. Turnbull has gradually ratcheted up diplomatic pressure on China, saying Beijing must step up and contain Pyongyang economically, including by cutting off the regime’s oil supply. The government’s science agency, the CSIRO, has paid tens of thousands of dollars to the Minerals Council of Australia, which fights against government action on climate change. The CSIRO has been listed as an “associate member” of the Minerals Council since at least 2004 and new documents obtained by the Australian Institute, under freedom of information laws, show that in 2017 the “annual subscription” for membership was just under $10,000. The mining lobby group plays a vocal role in Australian climate change policy debates and has pushed for more coal power stations to be built. The Socceroos will face Syria in a World Cup play-off after missing out on automatic qualification for the finals. They beat Thailand 2-1 in a frustrating game in Melbourne last night, which meant Saudi Arabia needed only a win against Japan seven hours later to move above the Socceroos in group B and go through to next year’s finals in Russia on goal difference. Saudi Arabia duly won 1-0, consigning Australia to a two-leg match-up against Syria, where the winner will then face the fourth-placed team from central and North America – which will be Panama, Honduras or perhaps even the US – for the last spot at the finals. Australia’s fraught and fractious campaign has left coach Ange Postecoglou under some scrutiny. Energy regulators have told Malcolm Turnbull’s government to create a reserve of emergency power to ensure there is enough available during heatwaves and storms. The recommendations are contained in a new report from the Australian Energy Market Operator that suggests an additional gigawatt of incremental dispatchable power will be needed in the system when the ageing coal-fired Liddell power station closes in 2022. The Coalition has confirmed it is in talks with AGL to extend the operating life of Liddell after a conversation, but in a statement AGL insisted its plan was to close the plant in 2022. The UK plans to end the free movement of EU labour immediately after Brexit and deter all but the most highly skilled EU workers, documents leaked to the Guardian show. The Home Office document reveals for the first time the government’s plan to dramatically shift its focus on immigration to put British workers first. The proposed measures to discourage low-skilled migrants include offering them residency for a maximum of two years (while offering “high-skilled occupations” work permits for three to five years) and making it harder to settle long term and bring family members into the country. The revelations are likely to enrage many in Europe who will feel the UK is intending to treat EU nationals as second-class citizens, and could invite retaliatory action by the 27-country bloc.

Mark Sampson, the England women’s team manager who was accused of making racist remarks to two players, said his “conscience was clear” in the Eni Aluko case, and that he had been through a “difficult and upsetting time” and wanted to move on. In his first interview since the allegations surfaced, Sampson insisted Aluko’s 11-year, 102-cap England career had not been ended as retaliation and reiterated that he had been cleared by an internal FA inquiry. Of the allegation that he told Aluko to make sure her Nigerian relatives did not bring Ebola to Wembley, Sampson said: “I’m very disappointed the allegation has come up. I understand it; all I can say is I didn’t say that to Eni.” Thinking time Every night for the past few weeks, the twin towers at the Waterloo public housing estate have begun to light up. Slated for demolition, the 30-storey buildings loom over the rest of the estate, and at 5.30pm each day new windows have started blinking on like fairy lights – blue, magenta, yellow; some fading through the colour wheel while others strobe or flash. The effect is beguiling but the public art project behind it, We Live Here, has a more serious goal: to communicate to the outside world that real people are living there – and to remind the New South Wales government of their duty to protect them. Is Peter Dutton a fit and proper person to wield such awesome powers? Dutton is already in a league of his own with the discretionary powers he can exercise as immigration minister – without accountability or transparency, writes Richard Ackland. While we don’t yet know for sure what new powers he will exercise as home affairs minister, we know the range and reach of his discretions over people’s lives will expand alarmingly. “There is a real question whether someone so devoid of empathy is a fit and proper person to be handed wide, discretionary and unreviewable powers as the new minister for home affairs.” Belvoir’s current production Hir – pronounced “here” – reminds us of theatre’s potential: to be a brilliant conduit that makes ideas alive and accessible. Hir doesn’t merely explore themes of gender fluidity, queer theory and the subversion of toxic masculinity, it lightens the weight of concepts that many find foreign or fraught and places them in a family setting where they detonate with wonderful dramatic power. Our reviewer Kate Hennessy, gives Hir a round of applause, and five stars. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has brought to an end the Obama-era “Dreamers” programme, revoking the right of 800,000 young, mostly undocumented migrants to live and work in America. Obama called the move “self-defeating” and “contrary to basic decency”. The former president said a “shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again”.

Alli was caught on camera immediately after the French official, Clement Turpin, had waved away his appeals for a free-kick 13 minutes from time in the win at Wembley. The Tottenham Hotspur man subsequently told his manager, Gareth Southgate, that the gesture had been made towards his former club-mate, Kyle Walker, and reiterated that explanation for his actions on Twitter late on Monday night. He apologised “for any offence caused”, with Walker also suggesting on social media that he had seen the funny side of the incident. One long-distance camera angle of the incident appears to support Alli’s version of events. However, Fifa indicated on Tuesdaythat it was “gathering evidence” before deciding whether or not to launch an investigation. The FA has already unearthed a closer camera shot, which has not been made public, which would back up Alli’s explanation and, if requested, will make it available to world football’s governing body in an attempt to prevent Alli being sanctioned. However, there remains the possibility Fifa could still charge the 21-year-old with acting against the spirit of the game, an offence which most likely carry a fine or, at worst, a short suspension. “Kyle and Dele were mucking about, and Dele’s made a gesture towards Kyle,” explained Southgate on Monday. “The pair of them have a strange way of communicating, but that’s what they’ve said when it’s been raised.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/05/kate-middleton-privacy-royal-magazine-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T19:29:57Z","webTitle":"I’m sorry, but Kate Middleton’s privacy victory isn’t much of a victory at all | Afua Hirsch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/05/kate-middleton-privacy-royal-magazine-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/05/kate-middleton-privacy-royal-magazine-pictures","fields":{"headline":"I’m sorry, but Kate Middleton’s privacy victory isn’t much of a victory at all","bodyText":"When I became the Guardian’s legal affairs correspondent, in 2008, one of the first cases I wrote about was that of Max Mosley, the former Formula One boss who’d faced tabloid revelations about his sex sessions with prostitutes. The court agreed with him that the fact that the public was interested in his sex life didn’t make it in the public interest. But Mosley wasn’t satisfied with this or the £60,000 he got in damages. He wanted a new, codified law of privacy to prevent that ever happening again. English law, however, is pretty resistant to legislating privacy, a fact that always contrasted neatly with the situation in France. Even if Britain had had a written constitution – which we don’t – privacy would not have been in it. France, on the other hand, not only has a privacy law but criminal sanctions for those who break it. Things have changed, however. The French courts are taking freedom of expression more seriously, and have been consistently more relaxed on tabloid abuses. Into this changing landscape strolled a topless Kate Middleton in 2012. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were relaxing in a Provence chateau owned by the Queen’s nephew, Viscount Linley, when they were snapped by the paparazzi. The royal couple found the publication of the photos in Closer magazine “particularly shocking because it reminded us of the harassment that led to the death of my mother, Diana, Princess of Wales”, Prince William told the court in a letter read by his lawyer. Not surprisingly, given the French respect for privacy, William and Kate have just won their case. But the €100,000 (£90,000) of damages, plus €45,000 each to be paid by the editor and publisher, were a fraction of what the couple demanded. This is relevant because Closer presumably knew it was breaking French privacy laws – but on a cost-benefit analysis of the increased circulation versus ultimate fine, reckoned it was still on to a winner. And it was probably right. Morally, it’s a pretty mixed picture. With the judgment timed just after the anniversary of Diana’s death and the announcement of a new royal baby, it’s easy to feel that the royal couple were wronged. On the other hand, they happily use the press as PR agents for their, albeit good causes, when it suits them. Topless photos are fairly easy to categorise on one side of the divide between right and wrong, but there will doubtlessly be future infringements that sit in a much blurrier place. The pain of lost veginity As a former vegan and now occasional meat eater, I’ve basically been disowned by the vegan community. Or, as a vegan with an above-average sense of humour said, I have lost my “veginity”. But five years of obtaining competence in the art of tofu cheesecake-making or brewing my own soya milk – as I sometimes had to do when I lived in west Africa – made veganism part of my identity. So I feel proud to see it reach the upper echelons of the political establishment, now that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn admits all that’s standing between him and veganism is a love of Somerset brie. I bet he doesn’t know about cashew brie, or cheddar Sheese. Unfortunately the vegan community abandoned these genius monikers and decided to rename all vegan cheese “Gary”. I did say vegan humour needs working on. Biology-altering T-shirts I nearly choked on my chia pudding when I saw the backlash against John Lewis for introducing gender-neutral clothing. Shoppers began ranting about “T-shirt segregation” and accused the retailer of “trying to change biology”. If they’re right, and John Lewis has stumbled on a scientific breakthrough that allows biology to be radically altered by the simple wearing of a dinosaur dress, I imagine selling clothes is going to be the last thing on its mind. • Afua Hirsch is a writer and broadcaster.

This enabled the British to severely dent the impact of these war-changing weapons. She was deported to the women’s concentration camp of Ravensbrück, which she barely survived. After the second world war she said almost nothing about her exploits and only latterly gained the recognition she deserved. In 1943 Rousseau was working in Paris for a public relations agency liaising between the German occupying forces and French industrialists who were tied into the German war economy. She had regular meetings with the German military command at their headquarters at the Hotel Majestic, Avenue Kléber, near the Arc de Triomphe. Young, attractive and fluent in German, she was regularly invited to the Germans’ drinking parties, where they talked indiscreetly about their work. She never played what she called “Mata Hari games” – selling sex for secrets – but she used her wits and false naivety to winkle military secrets out of them. “I teased them, taunted them, looked at them wide-eyed,” she said in 1998, “insisted that they must be mad when they spoke of the astounding new weapon that flew over vast distances, faster than any aeroplane. I kept saying, ‘What you are telling me cannot be true!’ I must have said that a hundred times. ‘I’ll show you,’ one of the Germans said. ‘How?’ I asked, and he answered, ‘It’s here on a piece of paper.’” He showed her a plan of the experimental station of Peenemünde, on the Baltic island of Usedom, which was being used to test the V-2. She had a photographic memory and conveyed to her resistance network details of what she called the “stratospheric bomb” and the team of Colonel Max Wachtel developing it. The “Wachtel report” found its way to the Oxford physicist and military intelligence expert Reginald Jones, and thence on to Churchill’s desk. In October 1943 Rousseau reported on the V-1 launching ramp at Bois Carré in the Somme, and in December on the transfer of Wachtel’s HQ to Creil in northern France. Jeannie was born in Saint-Brieuc on the north coast of Brittany, the only child of Marie (nee Le Charpentier) and Jean Rousseau. Her father was a foreign office official and mayor of Paris’s 17th arrondissement. She attended the elite École Libre de Sciences Politiques (Sciences-Po) and finished top of her class in 1939. When the Germans invaded France in 1940 her father evacuated the family to their country house in Dinard, Brittany, confident that the Germans would never get that far. They arrived in weeks, and Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau established a base there to plan the invasion of Britain. When the local mayor looked for an interpreter to liaise with the French administration, her father volunteered Jeannie. As if to express her independence, she began to gather intelligence, and forwarded it to a resistance network. Arrested by the Gestapo in January 1941, she was interrogated in the prison at Rennes. Nothing could be pinned on her, but she was obliged to leave the sensitive coastal area. Back in Paris, Rousseau found a job liaising between French industrialists and the German military, which was placing orders with French firms for its war economy. By chance, on a night train in 1941, she encountered Georges Lamarque, a mathematics graduate working for the Alliance network, which was headed by Marie-Madeleine Fourcade. She had asked him to set up a sub-group, called the Druids, specialising in military intelligence, and he recruited Rousseau, under the codename Amniarix. In the light of her subsequent reports the British wanted to bring her to London for debriefing, but her attempt to escape by boat from Tréguier, on the Breton coast, was foiled on 28 April 1944, and she was captured. She was deported to Ravensbrück, and then to the work camp at Torgau, where she refused under the Geneva Convention to make ammunition, to a punishment camp in Königsberg, and then back to Ravensbrück. When Rousseau was rescued from Ravensbrück by the Swedish Red Cross on 23 April 1945 she weighed only 31kg (70lb). She was suffering from tuberculosis and was sent to recover in a Swedish sanatorium. There she met Henri de Clarens, a resister who had survived Buchenwald and Auschwitz. They married and she became the Vicomtesse de Clarens. She went on to work as an interpreter for the United Nations. After the war, those who had done least in the resistance often spoke the most, while those who had done the most spoke the least. Female resisters were particularly modest, and Rousseau claimed that “others did much more. I was a small stone.” While Lamarque, who had been shot by the Germans in September 1944, was named one of de Gaulle’s thousand-strong Compagnons de la Libération, Rousseau – described by Fourcade as “the most remarkable young woman of her generation” – received only the Resistance medal and the Croix de Guerre. “Amniarix’s reports stand brilliantly in the history of intelligence,” wrote Jones in Most Secret War (1978). He and she were jointly awarded the Seal Medallion by the CIA in 1993. The French made her a Commandeur of the Légion d’honneur in 1996 and a Grand Officer in 2009. Henri de Clarens died in 1995. Jeannie is survived by a daughter, Ariane, a son, Pascal, and four grandchildren. • Jeannie Yvonne Ghislaine Rousseau, French resistance agent, born 1 April 1919; died 25 August 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/10/gavin-osborn-the-comment-section-echo-bridge-one-to-watch","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T08:30:32Z","webTitle":"One to watch: Gavin Osborn & the Comment Section","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/10/gavin-osborn-the-comment-section-echo-bridge-one-to-watch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/10/gavin-osborn-the-comment-section-echo-bridge-one-to-watch","fields":{"headline":"One to watch: Gavin Osborn & the Comment Section","bodyText":"What happens when the world moves on and leaves you behind? It’s the key question behind Echo Bridge, the first release from the endearingly earnest folk collaboration Gavin Osborn &amp; the Comment Section. It’s a record about being frustrated, angry, bewildered and aware of the utter ridiculousness of a world that has moved past your point of understanding. Singer-songwriter Osborn, 40, has seen the soft-corporate power of chain-stores swamp the West Country town of Keynsham where he lives; he’s tried to make it in the bohemian paradise he imagined in the big city, and abandoned it as too cynical and expensive; he’s tried to hang on to his values: left-leaning, pro-immigration, pro-arts, and seen the world rush forward and leave them behind. And he really doesn’t know what to do next. It makes Echo Bridge one of 2017’s most relatable releases. Up to this point Osborn’s career hasn’t exactly been marked by seriousness. In 2004 he was struggling on the London open-mic folk circuit when his old school friend, the comedian John Oliver (now a hugely successful talkshow host on America’s HBO) invited him to a regular Tuesday afternoon football match with a group of friends, mostly comedians, now almost all famous. Among them was the fanatically worshipped cult comic Daniel Kitson, who was impressed by Osborn’s warm storytelling and enlisted him as tour support. Kitson’s devoted fanbase took to Osborn straight away and he became a sort of accidental comic, appearing at comedy clubs and festivals, working with Robin Ince and Alun Cochrane and writing a series of acclaimed storytelling collaborations with Kitson, which the pair toured as support for Belle &amp; Sebastian. Echo Bridge is the first time the jokes have taken a backseat to the music and the message. “Even when it’s funny, I don’t think I could do many of these songs at a comedy club,” Osborn explains. “There’s funny bits – I can’t help putting witticism in – but I don’t think it’s laugh-out-loud. If it’s funny, it’s wry. It was time to be more earnest.” The album was sparked by a conversation with friend and collaborator John Hare (the “Comment Section”). “John’s a music teacher and told me about a class at his school that got an Ofsted inspection,” says Osborn. “The teacher was told there was too much music, that the kids were picking up instruments too much.” In his head, Osborn began to fast forward through the kids’ and their teacher’s lives: if you love poetry, art, music and you’re told it’s not important enough, what happens next? What kind of world are we building? Part of Osborn’s appeal is the way he processes his anger into a kind of likably grumpy bewilderment and uses it to unite his audience. We may feel lost and alone in a cynical world that no longer fits our values, but we can be lost and alone together. Osborn wanted to create a comfort blanket for post-Brexit alienation. One of the album’s key songs is Don’t Know Enough About That, about the very 21st-century tendency to bluff your way through important conversations using information you’ve gleaned from headlines. Osborn knows the damage this can do, but also knows it’s something we’re all guilty of. “That’s true right down to David Davis trying to do the Brexit negotiations,” he says. “He’s that guy, wandering into a room with people much cleverer than him and pretending he knows something. That’s all of us.” Osborn doesn’t have the answers, but that’s not really the point. “When Bob Dylan used to sing Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right, people would ask him what it was about, and he’d say it’s just a song to make him feel better,” he explains. “That’s how I feel about this record. It’s a sense of catharsis for me and the audience. Even on the record I’m telling myself that it’ll all be all right. We need this, we need to know that other people are feeling it, even if it’s more out of hope than expectation.” Echo Bridge is out now (My Little Owl Records). The band is on tour until 28 September; for more information, see Gavin Osborn’s facebook page This article was amended on 11 September. Echo Bridge is not Gavin Osborn’s debut album, but his debut collaboration with The Comment Section."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/09/the-push-tommy-caldwell-review-dawn-wall","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"The Push by Tommy Caldwell review – the hardest rock climb ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/09/the-push-tommy-caldwell-review-dawn-wall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/09/the-push-tommy-caldwell-review-dawn-wall","fields":{"headline":"The Push by Tommy Caldwell review – the hardest rock climb ever","bodyText":"In January 2015, Tommy Caldwell and his partner Kevin Jorgeson completed the first ascent of El Capitan’s Dawn Wall in Yosemite National Park, California, arguably the most difficult rock climb in history. The two attracted global media attention as they reached the summit. Caldwell in particular was already famous among rock climbers, but the Dawn Wall captured imaginations across the world. The clamour was perhaps unsurprising. The project took seven years of planning, training and strategising, and the successful attempt required 19 days of living on the wall, sleeping on “portaledges” suspended from the rock face. The climbing was so difficult that most considered the Dawn Wall impossible to ascend “free” (using nothing but hands and feet, with ropes and gear employed only to halt deadly falls). During the building media excitement, it was common to hear that the edges Caldwell and Jorgeson were using in their climb were “no bigger than a dime”. In fact this was selling them short. Think instead of the blunt edge of a razorblade for fingers and grape-seed sized bumps for feet. In the context of Caldwell’s fame, a book deal is no surprise. The result would perhaps be expected to be a collection of the usual platitudes and cliches, the sort of kitsch that characterises many sporting biographies, but this is not what we get at all. The Push stands out as a genuine achievement in its own right – and is about much more than just climbing. Presumably Caldwell’s co-writer Kelly Cordes deserves credit for how well written the book is, but even so the authenticity of Caldwell’s voice comes through clearly in passages of well crafted prose. The Push is also intelligently structured, each chapter interspersed with flashes forward or back, layering the narrative of his life, from awkward childhood to climbing phenomenon. The book is ostensibly divided into four parts, but it is better to see it as a three-part work, capped with a final culminating act – the Dawn Wall ascent – and with each revolving around a significant relationship in Caldwell’s life. The first concerns his father, a former competitive body-builder who introduced the young Tommy to rock climbing and nurtured his talent. Yet after Caldwell won a competition aged 16 (one he entered at his dad’s insistence), doubts and fears crept in to the father-son relationship. Did his dad love him for who he was, Caldwell wondered, or only for his climbing achievements? Among hyper-masculine sporting men, who can find it difficult to speak about emotions, such questions are liable to fester. Much of the rest of the book is about Caldwell’s working out what kind of son he was, in order to decide what kind of man he wanted to be. The second part centres on his marriage to his first real girlfriend, Beth Rodden, an elite climber in her own right. A major trauma seems retrospectively to have doomed their union from near the start. On a climbing trip to Kyrgyzstan in 2000, Caldwell, Rodden and two others were taken hostage by Islamist rebels, who murdered a Kyrgyz soldier in front of them, before force-marching the Americans in circles for days. Eventually they escaped, after Caldwell pushed one of their captors into a ravine. The incident left them deeply affected. Rodden in particular – who had tried to break up with Caldwell a few weeks before the trip – fell into depression. She felt smothered by his love, and eventually left him for a mutual friend. The third part of the book is about the relationship Caldwell developed to come to terms with the subsequent divorce, and an estrangement from his father. Here the relationship is not with a person, but a 3,000ft face of sheer granite in central California. It was by taking on the apparently impossible Dawn Wall that he found a way, he writes, to work through his pain. Over the seven years of preparation, he grew and matured, became reconciled with his father, met his second wife and became a father. His wife and son become star players in the story. The Push is not simply a book about rock climbing, then, but about human relationships and the ways in which we can hurt each other while trying to be kind. Caldwell, for all his magnificent achievements on stone, reminds us that in the end, the only really serious enterprise is living. • The Push: A Climber’s Journey of Endurance, Risk, and Going Beyond Limits is published by Michael Joseph.

If Del Potro, still struggling physically, somehow rises to the occasion a second time in three days, and if he repeats his win over the No3 seed that delivered him his only slam title here in 2009, he will have to ride the love of the crowd who roared him on to his impossible victory over Dominic Thiem on Monday night. It is asking a lot for a Federer opponent to win over the fans, but “Delpo”, who has that gentle-giant mien, a kind face and unbending will, might just do it. If the No24 seed does, he will own this tournament. He has done it before. He was just 20 then, long before his left wrist gave up on him, and he was still wondering if he should have pursued a career as a footballer. But he beat Rafael Nadal and Federer back to back when they were at the zenith of their powers. Nadal was unbeatable on clay and Federer was the master of the other surfaces, arriving in New York as not only a new father to twin girls but Wimbledon champion. The five-set final, in which Del Potro showed early signs of his fighting spirit to grind down Federer over four hours and six minutes, was their last confrontation in the Arthur Ashe Stadium. As they acknowledge, much has changed in eight years. But this is a culture of dreams, of impossible challenges and unlikely triumphs. Americans almost demand a Hollywood finish to their sporting jamborees, and they might yet get one. The odds are impossibly long for Del Potro. He took three hours and 35 minutes to subdue Thiem after winning only three games in the first two sets, and he resembled a blood-drained zombie at the end. But he has the love of the crowd, and that is an incalculable factor. “I think the people love my effort to come back,” he said. “They know what I have been through with my wrist problems. They like a guy who never gives up. I was thinking to retire in the middle of the second set because I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t move well.” He said the turning point arrived when he broke quickly and took the third set in 31 minutes to keep the match alive. “I started to see the crowd. I took all the energy from the fans. That’s what I did in the end.” Federer, meanwhile, could hardly have had an easier preparation: he did not face a break point in the hour and 49 minutes it took him to dismiss the disappointing Philipp Kohlschreiber, his serve in a groove with 11 aces among 39 clean winners. That stroll completed a hat-trick of awesome statistical proportions: Federer has stretched his career domination over Mikhail Youzhny to 17‑0, 13‑0 against Feliciano López, and 12‑0 over Kohlschreiber. That’s 42 matches unbeaten against three of the sport’s most accomplished operators. Nevertheless, he struggled at times against Youzhny over five sets, having also gone the distance in the first round against the young American Frances Tiafoe, stirring concerns that the back pain that struck in the Montreal final against Alexander Zverev last month and then kept him out of the Cincinnati Masters remains a concern. Federer revealed he had treatment to his back in the locker room during a brief interlude in his demolition of Kohlschreiber, and did his best to downplay the seriousness of it afterwards. “I just ran straight to the physio. I was done in three minutes and back again. I didn’t want Philipp to wait. It was more precaution. It’s all good. No problems there. I’m not worried about it.” All that said, they will now drag themselves back to the main stage convinced they can overcome both their own problems and their opponent. But this will not be a match similar to their 2009 final. As Federer outlined, with precise analysis, “We’re different players today.” He observed: “We both play differently. Because of his surgery, his backhand has changed. He uses his slice much more. Just alone because of that, the game would be different. And I’m playing more aggressive, as well, on the return. I play shorter points. I don’t use my slice as much, whereas he does now. It’s a bit of a change. “We played each other in Miami [in March, when Federer won 6-3, 6-4], so I did get a sense of how it is to play him now. But the forehand and the serve is still identical, in my opinion. He maybe even creates more power now, just because years went by, better technology has come around. I think we’re both more laid back today. It won’t be a final, it will be a quarter-final. Obviously there’s not as much riding on this match like it was in 2009.” Fans might not see it like that. Those are memories to cherish, part of the game’s history. What they crave now is more drama. As will the tournament organisers and the host broadcaster. From day one, they have all had their fingers crossed that the men’s draw – after the late withdrawal of Andy Murray, added to a missing roster that included the defending champion Stan Wawrinka and last year’s losing finalist, Novak Djokovic – would not disintegrate. As much as it has been intriguing to see the rise of unfamiliar contenders – especially on the seriously weakened bottom half of the draw which was left with quarter-finals of Sam Querrey (17) against Kevin Anderson (28) and Pablo Carreño Busta (12) against Diego Schwartzman (29) – any major sporting event needs its stars. None shines brighter in the New York firmament than Federer, who has missed only one quarter-final here since his first here in 2004 and has been champion five times. They love him as much as anywhere across the sport. But they embraced Del Potro with equal enthusiasm on Monday night. It will be a love-fest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/10/catalans-celebrate-national-day-independence-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T11:52:50Z","webTitle":"Catalans to celebrate their national day with independence protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/10/catalans-celebrate-national-day-independence-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/10/catalans-celebrate-national-day-independence-protests","fields":{"headline":"Catalans to celebrate their national day with independence protests","bodyText":"On Monday afternoon, hundreds of thousands of people will gather across Catalonia to remember a disastrous defeat. Many among them, however, will be hoping that an equally momentous victory is not too far off. Although Catalonia’s national day, the Diada, commemorates the fall of Barcelona in the Spanish war of succession in 1714 – and the region’s subsequent loss of institutions and freedoms – it recently has come to serve a rather different purpose. Since 2012, the event has become an overtly political affair for those seeking Catalonia’s secession from Spain – a celebration that is part carnival, part rally and part protest. This year’s Diada, which comes less than a month before the regional government stages an independence referendum that it insists is legally binding but which Madrid views as a clear and illegal breach of the Spanish constitution, will be even more charged than usual. Last week, pro-independence Catalan MPs defied the Spanish government – and many of their fellow parliamentarians – by passing the so-called referendum law that lays the foundation for the vote on 1 October. The legislation was quickly suspended by Spain’s constitutional court and state prosecutors are looking into whether the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, and other members of his government should be charged with disobedience and abuse of power. On Friday, police investigating preparations for the referendum searched two regional newspaper offices and a printer’s shop in Catalonia. Puigdemont tweeted: “They weren’t looking for ballot papers; they were looking for a fight.” Despite the Spanish government’s repeated insistence that the referendum will not go ahead, the president is adamant that the vote will take place and has urged pro-sovereignty Catalans to take to the streets to show their support. “On Monday we will overwhelm them peacefully and democratically, as always,” he said. Jordi Sànchez, the president of the leading independence organisation the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), said the proposed October vote had given this year’s Diada a special significance. “What we’re going to see is a commitment to sovereignty through the referendum and a desire to resolve this argument or conflict – whatever you want to call it – that’s been going on quite openly now for six years,” he said. “The Diada is a historic day of self-affirmation and expression; it’s about the symbolic remembering of the freedoms that were lost 300 years ago. “But I think that romantic idea is becoming less and less important; the Diada got stronger after Catalanism itself got stronger and began looking to the future. That’s the key point: today, for a lot of people, the Diada is the day when you can show your unequivocal support for a future that’s different from the past and the present.” It is not a view shared by all Catalans. Álex Ramos, vice-president of Societat Civil Catalana, a group that opposes independence, says the ANC and others have coopted the Diada for their own propaganda purposes. “We see the Diada as a day of historical commemoration, but it’s been interpreted by the secessionist movement as an example of victimhood and used as a motor to drive the movement,” he said. “They explain it their own way. But it was a war for monarchical succession and not a war against Catalonia, which is how they try to portray it.” Ramos conceded that the independence movement had a talent for mobilising people and getting its message across, but he said Catalans – including secessionists – were growing tired of the whole process. “There’s also a sense of boredom,” he said. “We want to get this resolved without any problems and then there will be the huge task of winning back people’s trust and rebuilding bridges. “At the end of the day, it’s like a family quarrel. This isn’t a problem between Spain and Catalonia; it’s a problem between some Catalans and others. As far as the majority of us are concerned, independence wouldn’t do anything for us, either economically or emotionally.” Antonio Barroso, an analyst at the political risk advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, said the separatists would use this year’s Diada as way to get their message out to Catalonia, Spain and the world as loudly as possible. “It’s going to be completely monopolised by the pro-independence movement,” he said. “It’s a preamble to a referendum that will probably not happen; they’re going to try to make it a show of force and numbers, which is one of their biggest strengths. But it’s not about the number of people on the streets, it’s about the fact that they’re about to mobilise a lot of people.

While there are some small signs that the improved performance of economy is flowing through to workers in the form of more hours of work, the amount of wages going to workers continues to grow at very low levels. In the June quarter the economy grew by 0.8% in seasonally adjusted terms – a marked improvement on the 0.3% growth in the previous quarter. But even if the seasonally adjusted figure jumps around a bit, the trend growth of 0.7% is pretty decent – if not exactly stunning: The economy grew by 1.8% in the past 12 months in seasonally adjusted terms, although a slightly better 2.1% in the more stable trends figures. But even this growth, while better than 1.9% of last quarter, is a demonstration of what passes for good news nowadays. The June quarter marked the 19th consecutive quarter of annual GDP growth being below 3% – more than a year longer than the previous such low growth streak: The growth sees us in the middle of the pack for the June quarter among OECD nations, though rather more at the lower end in annual growth terms: But while the economy grew at a solid clip in the June quarter, the reasons for it paint a more mixed picture of how things are going. Nearly three quarters of the 0.8% quarterly growth is due to public investment – and a large proportion of that was due to the timing of the transfer of the recently completed Royal Adelaide hospital from the private sector. Take away the 0.64 percentage points of growth generated by “state and local government” investment and suddenly the growth is looking pretty pathetic. After a good fortnight of the government lambasting the ALP and Bill Shorten for being “socialists”, it was rather ironic to hear the treasurer, Scott Morrison, boasting of the contribution of defence spending on economic growth. National government defence investment grew by 26% in the June quarter, which contributed another 0.1 percentage points to growth. But the purchase of the hospital also detracted from private investment. If we take away the effect of the purchase of the hospital, business investment actually contributed 0.1% points to growth: Exports also contributed 0.6 percentage points of growth in the quarter and household spending 0.4 percentage points – offsetting the ongoing decline in non-dwelling investment: Over the past year household spending has been the biggest driver by far on economic growth – contributing nearly two thirds of the entire growth of the economy. Generally this is not surprising – around 53% of our GDP is made up of household spending, but it is a bit odd given the annual growth of household spending remains very much subdued compared to the period before the GFC: That we have been able to keep spending going at those levels is due not to improvements in our wages but through us saving less. In June Australian households saved on average 4.6% of their disposable income – the lowest level since the start of the GFC and the 13th quarter in a row without a rise – a run not seen since the heady spending days of the mid 1980s: Households of course are having to reduce their savings because wages growth remains particularly pathetic. Oddly, in the past year there has been a nice uptick in the amount of hours worked, which normally results in improved wages growth, and yet wages growth has been falling. While nominal GDP grew at a very strong 7.6% (the best for six years), wages and salaries – which normally follow nominal GDP growth – grew in the past year by just 1.5% in trend terms: The reason for the disjoint is that while corporate profits account for just a quarter of GDP they contributed to 60% of the growth of nominal GDP in the past year. In the past year, corporations gross operating surplus (a proxy for profit) grew by 21.1% – the best result for nine years: It would seem the economy is massively out of whack – with profits not leading to wages growth. Profit growth and a quarterly or even annual increase does not necessarily lead to an increase in wage growth. Over time it does flow through, but it can take 3 years and so one hopes that this current boom in profits will in time lead to an increase in wages. One problem is that the past three years have featured very low profit growth, so even with the 21% growth of the past year, the gross operating surplus has only grown on average by 3% during that time. Unless the strong growth continues, it is unlikely that wages will improve: If you are looking for some positive signs, at least the growth of wages and salaries improved in seasonally adjusted terms – up from 1.3% to 2.0% – but in the long term context it doesn’t look like much of a corner being turned: The added wrinkle is that the big boom in corporate profits has come via a massive surge in export prices, with the terms of trade up 21% in the past year. Now that normally flows through into a big upturn in mining investment, and thus a demand for workers and in turn better wages. But the mining industry is currently in the production phase of its boom – and that is not a phase that needs a growth in jobs. The worry is the mining industry might continue to be a powerhouse of economic growth, but due to profits rather than investment, and thus the stronger profits won’t lead to stronger wages. And so the economy continues to tick along due in part to exports, household spending and timely government investment. While exports should remain solid, the government investment is mostly a one-off. That means the ongoing strength of the economy comes down to household spending. Given the low wages, growth is dependent on people reducing their savings. That is hardly sustainable and why the government – and the rest of us – will be hoping the good noises in parts of the economy soon begin to be echoed in our wages.

He was found by a neighbour at his apartment, converted from Can’s old studio in Weilerswist near Cologne. The cause of death is currently unknown. His wife Ursula had died in July, while his former bandmate Jaki Liebezeit – with whom he created Can’s fabled driving rhythm section – also died this year, in January. Can were part of a 1970s movement rather insensitively dubbed “krautrock” by the British music press, alongside bands including Neu!, Faust and Tangerine Dream, who paired the strident rhythms of rock’n’roll with psychedelic, exploratory new forms. Following a period of study under composer Karlheinz Stockhausen in the early 1960s, Czukay played on nine of Can’s albums as well as engineering them, including their celebrated Tago Mago and Ege Bamyasi, before leaving in 1977 to go solo. He went on to collaborate with numerous celebrated musicians – he and Liebezeit played on the Eurythmics’ debut album, while he recorded the Balearic disco classic Snake Charmer with New York DJ Francois Kevorkian, U2 guitarist The Edge and Public Image Limited’s Jah Wobble, and also made a pair of collaborations with Japan singer David Sylvian. Czukay is also celebrated for his experiments with sampling before the advent of digital samplers, cutting up and splicing tape into recordings. He also pioneered what he called “radio painting”, using shortwave radios to record random snippets of sound and pasting them collage-style into recordings; “rhythm boxing” was his description of how he used drum machines. His most recent solo album was Eleven Years Innerspace in 2015. Can partly reformed in April without Czukay – Irmin Schmidt and Malcolm Mooney performed with the London Symphony Orchestra, Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore and others as The Can Project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/06/oxford-vice-chancellor-louise-richardson-salary-tuition-fees","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T08:13:24Z","webTitle":"Oxford vice-chancellor denies rising salary is linked to tuition fees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/06/oxford-vice-chancellor-louise-richardson-salary-tuition-fees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/06/oxford-vice-chancellor-louise-richardson-salary-tuition-fees","fields":{"headline":"Oxford vice-chancellor denies rising salary is linked to tuition fees","bodyText":"The vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Louise Richardson, has insisted that any link between a sharp rise in the salary for her post and an increase in tuition fees is “spurious” as she came under pressure to justify her £350,000-a-year pay. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Richardson said Oxford University, which recently secured the top slot on the international university league table, with Cambridge second, was operating in a “global marketplace” and competing with high remuneration packages offered at institutions overseas. Her appearance on the flagship BBC Radio 4 show came after Richardson accused a “mendacious media” and “tawdry politicians” of attempting to undermine the higher education sector with claims that increased tuition fees had been used to inflate the pay packets of senior academics. In 2002, the Oxford vice-chancellor was paid £100,000 a year. Richardson is on more than three times that amount before pension benefits are taken into account. Asked if the rise in salary for the post was linked to a increase in tuition fees, she said: “That’s correlation without a causation. I’ve no idea what the operating budget was for Oxford in 2002 but I can guarantee you it was not anything like £1.4bn. The link with fees is a spurious one.” Richardson said it was right that the pay packages of vice-chancellors were scrutinised. “We’re bound to be transparent in our practices. I think it’s entirely legitimate we’re questioned on these issues,” she said. Explaining her earlier comments, she added: “In referring to some mendacious media, I was referring to media who report things that are false. Talking about tawdry politicians I was referring to individuals who are using their own private political agenda to try and bring down the great universities in Britain.” Richardson did not name the politicians or media outlets she was criticising. But the universities minister, Jo Johnson, and the former Labour minister Lord Adonis – both Oxford alumni – have been vocal in their concern about the issue. “We have an extraordinary higher education sector in this country,” she said. “What other sector can you point to in which Britain has the number one and two spots? “To try to hurl accusations at the leaders of these great institutions is damaging the sector. It doesn’t matter because it might be embarrassing individually to us; it matters because I worry it hurts the entire higher education sector.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/06/punk-pioneers-the-saints-to-be-immortalised-with-60000-brisbane-mural","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T07:39:22Z","webTitle":"Punk pioneers the Saints to be immortalised with $60,000 Brisbane mural","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/06/punk-pioneers-the-saints-to-be-immortalised-with-60000-brisbane-mural","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/06/punk-pioneers-the-saints-to-be-immortalised-with-60000-brisbane-mural","fields":{"headline":"Punk pioneers the Saints to be immortalised with $60,000 Brisbane mural","bodyText":"The Queensland government is bankrolling a $60,000 mural project to honour punk pioneers the Saints, continuing Brisbane’s penchant for venerating its rock bands via city landmarks. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced the funding on Wednesday for a large-scale mural to “immortalise” the Saints at Upper Roma Street, a stone’s throw from its onetime share-house cum rehearsal room and live venue in Petrie Terrace. The mural, to be launched with a concert and recording by the band’s former guitarist Ed Kuepper, will mark the 40th anniversary of their album (I’m) Stranded, now widely considered a watershed release of punk. “This exciting project will create a rich addition to public art in Queensland and will fittingly celebrate a home-grown band revered worldwide as one of the most influential punk rock bands of all time,” Palaszczuk said. It follows the renaming of a park in Oxley near Kuepper’s childhood home as Ed Kuepper Park, which the Brisbane city council approved in July after a local resident’s petition. In 2010, an inner-Brisbane toll bridge opened as the Go Between Bridge, a celebratory nod to another influential local band, the Go-Betweens. The Saints mural and music project was driven by former Go-Betweens bassist John Willsteed, who is now a Queensland University of Technology creative industries lecturer. The Saints’ origins lay in 1973 when singer Chris Bailey and drummer Ivor Hay joined forces with the German-born Kuepper, writing many of their classics in the Kuepper family’s Oxley garage. Bailey, born in Kenya to Irish parents, grew up in nearby Inala, an area that Palaszczuk now represents as the local MP. Initially ignored by local record labels, the Saints’ first recordings coincided with the very beginnings of punk as a worldwide musical movement. Their first single, (I’m) Stranded, was recorded in June 1976 – two months after the Ramones cut their debut in the US and a month before the Sex Pistols played what would be their first single, Anarchy in the UK, live. The Saints released the single independently in September, with a review in a UK magazine prompting EMI in London to order its Australian arm to sign the band. The album (I’m) Stranded was released in February 1977. The band split in late 1978 with two other acclaimed albums under its belt. Palaszczuk, who made the announcement at the opening of Brisbane music industry conference Bigsound, said many of the 150-plus acts in the city for the event would “acknowledge the huge influence of the Saints”. They not only helped “change the face of rock music worldwide in the 1970s but [showed] that a Queensland band could have a big impact on the world stage, paving the way for many of the great Queensland musical acts to follow”. Palaszczuk said the large-scale mural would be “situated on the north side of Upper Roma St, close to the Saints’ original practice room, share house and live music venue at 4 Petrie Terrace, known as Club 76”. Kuepper in concert would “reimagine songs from the first three Saints albums” in collaboration with Robert Davidson of Topology, she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/06/lamb-ad-insensitive-and-disrespectful-say-hindus-and-anglicans","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T07:13:05Z","webTitle":"Lamb ad insensitive and disrespectful, say Hindus and Anglicans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/06/lamb-ad-insensitive-and-disrespectful-say-hindus-and-anglicans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/06/lamb-ad-insensitive-and-disrespectful-say-hindus-and-anglicans","fields":{"headline":"Lamb ad insensitive and disrespectful, say Hindus and Anglicans","bodyText":"A spring lamb campaign full of deities feasting on meat and making religious jokes has been condemned by Hindu and Anglican representatives as insensitive and disrespectful. Created by the Monkeys, the television commercial plays on the idea that anyone can enjoy lamb no matter their background, religious beliefs or dietary requirements and was designed to be playful but not offensive. The Hindu Council of Australia called for the ad to be banned, saying it was a “crude and deplorable attempt by Meat and Livestock Australia to use images of Ganesha to promote lamb consumption”. Balesh Dhankhar, a spokesman for the Hindu Council of Australia, said the ad had angered a large number of Hindus in Australia. The council said Ganesha celebrations were in full swing and it was a special time for the Hindu community in Australia. Melbourne Anglican bishop Philip Huggins said Anglicans shared the disappointment and anger of Australia’s Hindu community. The Advertising Standards Board had received 30 complaints about the ad by Wednesday, a spokeswoman told Guardian Australia. The advertiser would be asked for its response to the complaints and a meeting to discuss banning the ad would be held within a fortnight, she said. If the ad was deemed to have breached the self-regulatory code of ethics for advertising it would be withdrawn. The US-based president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, Rajan Zed, said linking the highly revered Lord Ganesha with meat was disrespectful and called on Meat and Livestock Australia to withdraw the ad and apologise. Lord Ganesha was “meant to be worshipped in temples or home shrines and not to be used in selling lamb meat for mercantile greed,” Zed said, as news of the offending commercial was reported in the Indian press. Huggins said the advertisement not only portrayed the vegetarian Hindu God Ganesha eating meat, but put “Jesus Christ at the same table as L Ron Hubbard and trivialises one of Jesus’s most beautiful miracles”. “The advertisement is cleverly disrespectful,” he said. “It seems that for an ad to stand out there has to be some bizarre or shocking component. Otherwise the fear is it will not be noticed.” The ad features Scientology founder Hubbard dining with gods, goddesses and prophets including Aphrodite, Zeus and Buddha during which Jesus performs a “reverse miracle” by turning wine into water so a Grecian goddess who is “designated driver” can safely drive home. Hubbard jokes that he gave up a meal with celebrity Scientology adherent Tom Cruise to attend. Huggins said he risked drawing attention to the ad but he could not ignore the insulting portrayal. It is not the first time the industry has offended sections of the community. In recent years vegans and Indigenous groups have complained of being mocked and degraded by the campaign to sell more lamb. The only major religious figure to be absent from the table is the prophet Muhammad who excuses himself from the occasion by telephone because he has to pick up a child from daycare. A 2016 Australia Day ad, starring SBS newsreader Lee Lin Chin was cleared by the Advertising Standards Bureau despite attracting more than 600 complaints. The group marketing manager at Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, Andrew Howie, said the campaign was designed to “push the creative boundaries”. “In this latest campaign we are showing no matter your beliefs, background or persuasion, the one thing we can all come together and unite over is lamb,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/06/aung-san-suu-kyi-blames-terrorists-for-misinformation-about-myanmar-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T07:17:06Z","webTitle":"Aung San Suu Kyi says 'terrorists' are misinforming world about Myanmar violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/aung-san-suu-kyi-blames-terrorists-for-misinformation-about-myanmar-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/06/aung-san-suu-kyi-blames-terrorists-for-misinformation-about-myanmar-violence","fields":{"headline":"Aung San Suu Kyi says 'terrorists' are misinforming world about Myanmar violence","bodyText":"Aung San Suu Kyi has blamed “terrorists” for “a huge iceberg of misinformation” about violence in western Myanmar that has forced more than 140,000 Rohingya refugees into neighbouring Bangladesh. The de-facto leader of Myanmar is under growing pressure to halt “clearance operations” by security forces in Rakhine state. The United Nations secretary-general has warned that the operations could verge on ethnic cleansing. Senior Myanmar officials said on Wednesday the country was lobbying powerful allies to ward off a UN security council resolution on the issue, as accusations emerged that security forces have been laying landmines along the Bangladesh border to prevent fleeing Rohingya from returning. A post by Aung San Suu Kyi’s office on Facebook – her first statement since violence resumed in the state nearly a fortnight ago – said she had spoken with Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan about the crisis. The government “had already started defending all the people in Rakhine in the best way possible and expressed that there should be no misinformation to create trouble between the two countries,” the statement said. She referred to “fake news photographs” posted on Twitter by Turkey’s deputy prime minister that purported to show dead Rohingya in Myanmar, but in fact were taken elsewhere. “That kind of fake information … was simply the tip of a huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to create a lot of problems between different communities and with the aim of promoting the interest of the terrorists,” the statement said. The Rohingya are a Muslim minority in majority-Buddhist Myanmar, nearly all of whom live in Rakhine state. The government does not recognise them as citizens, and they are often described as “the world’s most persecuted minority”. About 146,000 Rohingya people – an estimated 80% of them women and children – are now thought to have crossed into Bangladesh since 25 August, when militants from the ethnic Muslim group attacked dozens of security sites. Authorities responded with a crackdown that UN officials in Myanmar say may have killed up to 1,000 people. Satellite images show evidence of arson and Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh have claimed their villages are being burned en masse. UN agencies have been barred from providing humanitarian aid in the state and journalists are prevented from entering. Hindu and Buddhist villagers have also reported being targeted by Rohingya insurgents but the Muslim-minority group, who are denied citizenship and access to basic government services in Myanmar, make up the vast majority of those displaced. Rare video footage smuggled out of Rakhine state showed strings of villages in flames over several days in late August, with fires often accompanied by the sounds of gunshot ringing through the air. One survivor said military and locals, armed with swords, spears, sticks and guns had arrived in his village just after Friday prayers, shooting into the air and setting the village ablaze. “As soon as they arrived they began to burn houses, starting with Shukur’s,” he said in footage taken in a village where the homeless survivors have taken temporary shelter. Some people were allowed to leave to the east of the village, but not everyone escaped with their lives, he said. They had to swim to safety through shrimp farming ponds flooded by high tides, and some never made it out of their houses. “People lost their lives in the attack. some drowned while crossing the water, some could not get out of their homes and died in the fire. Our whole village was burned down.” In one small hamlet, a brief inspection by two soldiers lulled residents into a false sense of security. “After walking around and checking inside the village, they left, taking a cow from a widow. We thought they would become calm but after some time they surrounded our village from all sides and started shooting at the villagers, men, women, children even infants,” said one woman featured in the footage. She estimated that around 300 people were killed and another 55 injured, among them many small children. “We lost our husbands, our children our small babies. Some of us who could flee through the rice fields came here, everyone who remained in the village was killed.” Video footage showed mass graves where victims had been buried by relatives, and at least one body left to rot in the fields. But there were also reports that attackers were depriving survivors even of the right to bury their relatives. “When they went to get the bodies, the attackers drove them away with shooting, only some people could collect the dead bodies of their loved ones,” says the activist filming graves that hold between 10 and 20 bodies retrieved from a burned village. When they returned the next morning, they found bodies had already been doused in petrol and burned, and were told the attackers “have cleared them all.” Myanmar has been laying landmines across parts of its border with Bangladesh in recent days, government sources in Dhaka have told Reuters. The sources speculated that mines have been placed to prevent Rohingya refugees from returning to Rakhine state. Bangladesh is reportedly preparing to lodge a protest against the placement of the mines so close to the border, but a Myanmar military source told the agency the explosives had been in place since the 1990s. Myanmar National Security Adviser Thaung Tun told a press conference in the capital, Naypyitaw, that the country was lobbying China and Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council, to block any potential UN resolution on the crisis. “We are negotiating with some friendly countries not to take it to the Security Council,” Tun said. “China is our friend and we have a similar friendly relationship with Russia so it will not be possible for that issue to go forward.” Tun also accused international media, including the Guardian, of misrepresenting the violence, naming specific journalists and publications and pointed to several “fabricated” stories he said were “published with the intent to deceive the public”. The UN chief, Antonio Guterres, issued a rare letter on Wednesday appealing to Myanmar authorities to “put an end to this violence that, in my opinion, is creating a situation that can destabilise the region”. Asked if the violence could be described as ethnic cleansing, Guterres told journalists on Tuesday: “We are facing a risk, I hope we don’t get there.” His intervention was part of a chorus of appeals by world leaders for Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel peace prize winner, to exercise influence over the military leaders that controlled the government for decades until 2015. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said in a statement earlier this week: “Aung San Suu Kyi is rightly regarded as one of the most inspiring figures of our age but the treatment of the Rohingya is alas besmirching the reputation of Burma.” Aung San Suu Kyi on Wednesday met the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose government is competing with China for influence in the south-east Asian state. The Modi government says it is setting up a taskforce to identify the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to be taking refuge in India. A cabinet minister, Kiren Rijiju, said on Tuesday that Rohingya people in India were “illegal immigrants and need to be deported as per law”. Human rights lawyers in Delhi are challenging the government plan and the supreme court this week ordered the Indian government to explain its position by 11 September. After the meeting Modi issued a statement saying he shared the Myanmar’s government’s “concerns about extremist violence in Rakhine state and the violence against security forces and also how innocent lives have been affected”. “We hope that all stakeholders together can find a way out in which unity and territorial integrity of Myanmar is respected,” the statement said.

The court also unanimously dismissed the case brought by senator Janet Rice and Australian Marriage Equality. The judges ordered the plaintiffs to pay costs. The survey will be sent out from 12 September and the result announced on 15 November 2017, ministers George Brandis and Mathias Cormann said after the judgment was announced. In parliament Malcolm Turnbull said every adult Australian will be able to have their say on the issue of same-sex marriage. “Lucy [Turnbull] and I will be voting yes and I will be encouraging others to vote yes, but ... above all, I encourage every Australian to have their say because unlike the leader of the opposition I respect every Australian’s view on this matter.” Brandis, the attorney general, and Cormann, special minister of state, said the government would “move swiftly” to enact new legislation adding additional safeguards to the postal survey process. That bill, seen by Labor and the Greens but not yet publicly released, would extend electoral law provisions on authorisations of ads and banning misleading information, fraud, bribery and intimidation to protect the survey. However the Australian Electoral Commission’s chief legal officer, Paul Pirani, told a Senate committee on Thursday the ban on “misleading information” only applies to misrepresentations about the process of voting and the source of material, not its content. Those challenging the survey over two days of hearings at the high court in Melbourne argued the government acted inappropriately in allocating $122m to the ABS to conduct the vote; that the question of same-sex marriage is not within the scope of statistics collected by the ABS; and that it was wrong to ask people to sign up to the electoral roll for the vote because the issue could not be considered an electoral matter. Over Tuesday and Wednesday the court heard two separate challenges to the vote combined into one hearing. Ron Merkel QC, representing the plaintiffs, said the postal ballot was “unique and offensive”. It was “putting to the public a vote on [Felicity Marlowe’s] family unit”. Barrister Kathleen Foley also told the court on Tuesday that the ABS did not have the power to ask people for an opinion. But the question to be asked in the postal vote – “Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?” – would do exactly that, she said. But outlining the government’s response on Wednesday, the solicitor general Stephen Donaghue told the court the survey “in no way” cast aspersions on Marlowe’s relationship or that of other same-sex couples. Rather it was the Marriage Act as it currently stood, along with third parties engaged in an anti same-sex marriage campaign, that called the validity of LGBTI relationships into question, he said. “[The postal vote] will ask electors who receive it whether the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry,” he told the high court in Melbourne, led by chief justice Susan Kiefel. “A consequence of the existing law imposes a distinction on same-sex couples and other couples. Asking whether the distinction should be removed doesn’t cast the aspersion being suggested.” Senior counsel Kate Richardson, acting for the case brought before the court by Janet Rice and Australian Marriage Equality, focused on the Appropriation Act. The act states that the finance minister – in this case Cormann – only has the power to unlock funds for a matter like the same-sex marriage postal survey in urgent and unforeseen circumstances. Cormann used the act to allocate $122m to the ABS to conduct the voluntary postal vote. Richardson said Cormann knew there was a pre-election commitment to hold a compulsory plebiscite on same-sex marriage, which the government costed at $177m. She said cabinet made a decision that if the 2016 plebiscite bill failed to pass, the issue would go to a voluntary postal vote. “What we say is that it’s not the government decision [to hold a postal vote] that needs to be unforeseen, it’s the expenditure,” she said, adding that, given a vote was an election promise the expenditure was foreseen. But Donaghue responded that the government was entitled to allocate the money under the Appropriations Act. He put it to the court that natural disasters and military interventions should not be the only matters that met the “urgent” criteria. Government policy could also be considered a matter of urgency, he said. But he also argued regardless of where the money to conduct the survey came from, the Australian Bureau of Statistics had a legal obligation to comply with the government directive to conduct the survey, and the funding to do that could possibly be appropriated from elsewhere. While opponents to the postal vote have argued that the fact that parliament could pass same-sex marriage without the need for an expensive postal survey removed the urgency, Donaghue said the relevant legislation did not expressly state “if it is possible to return to parliament one must do so”. The act should have been written more clearly if that was what it meant, he added. Lawyers for the government also argued the plaintiffs had no grounds for bringing the government to court. After the decision Brandis and Cormann encouraged all Australians to take part in the postal survey and to show respect. They thanked Donaghue for his “hard work and skilful advocacy”. In question time, Bill Shorten asked Turnbull if he would now commit to write a joint letter to all Australians recommending a yes vote. But the prime minister questioned the assumption that the opposition leader “joining his signature to mind would actually increase the case for the yes vote. The leader of the opposition can make his case and I’ll make mine”, he said. Turnbull accused Shorten of having done “everything he could” to stop the plebiscite. “Much to his disappointment now every Australian will have their say.” Brandis told the Senate: “The effect of the decision of the court is that there is now no legal impediment to that postal survey proceeding and all Australians having their say on this important social question.” Elaine Pearson, director of Human Rights Watch Australia, said parliament should uphold rights and allow same-sex marriage, given the survey outcome won’t be legally binding. “Fundamental rights should never be put to a popular vote. The nonbinding costly postal vote on same-sex marriage is already proving to be incredibly divisive. It’s painful for LGBT people to endure a protracted public campaign where every day they are exposed to campaign materials peddling lies to discourage people from voting for marriage equality.” Australian Marriage Equality had two advertising campaigns ready to launch immediately after the decision; one in case of the postal vote being deemed unlawful and one in case of the postal vote being given the go-ahead. The campaign in response to the vote going ahead includes a video featuring a series of Australians posting their voting form and explaining why they will vote yes. After the decision was announced Tiernan Brady, executive director of the Equality Campaign said: “We are in it to win it [the survey]. We are committed to doing all in our power to ensure that the long-held wish of the Australian people for marriage equality for all Australians is reflected in the results of the survey. “This must be a campaign of millions of respectful conversations that unites the country. We haven’t a moment to lose and we are hitting the ground running with hundreds of thousands of supporters talking about why marriage equality matters. “This is a vote about the worth, dignity and status of members of our family, friends, workmates and neighbours, and across the country people are standing up for them. “We know that the Australian people support marriage equality but no one can be complacent – it is all about the getting as many surveys returned as possible. We call on everyone to participate and to talk to their family and friends to make sure they do too. Together, lets get this done.” Jacqui Tomlins representing Rainbow Families has a wife, Sarah, and three kids age 10,12 and 14. They have been together 25 years and were married in Canada 14 years ago. Tomlins was in tears outside of the court. “I think I’m still reeling from the shock a little,” she said. “I never in my heart thought we’d have to go through this. Of course we will survive it and get through it and after falling in a heap tonight I’ll get up tomorrow and fight. We need to look after our community, each other, our LBGTI young people and our trans and gender diverse people. “The strongest impact will be on LGBTI kids and kids of LGBTI people who will now have to endure eight weeks of campaigning against this. We need Australians to support us and play a significant part in supporting us by being our allies and returning a yes vote.” First day of high court hearing – as it happened Second day of high court hearing – as it happened"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/06/post-brexit-immigration-plan-leak-theresa-may-return-pmqs","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T08:39:37Z","webTitle":"Post-Brexit immigration plan leak to dominate May's return to PMQs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/06/post-brexit-immigration-plan-leak-theresa-may-return-pmqs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/06/post-brexit-immigration-plan-leak-theresa-may-return-pmqs","fields":{"headline":"Post-Brexit immigration plan leak to dominate May's return to PMQs","bodyText":"Theresa May’s return to the House of Commons for the first PMQs since the summer is set to be dominated by questions about the leak of the Home Office’s post-Brexit immigration plan. The leak, dated from early August, reveals draft plans to end freedom of movement immediately after Brexit and offer low-skilled EU migrants two-year work permits, with high-skilled workers receiving visas for three to five years. The Home Office also envisages a much tougher regime for families who want to join each other in the UK. On Wednesday the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, defended the motivations behind the leaked document. “We’re getting immigration down. It’s already falling. We’ve committed to this in manifesto after manifesto,” he told Sky News, though he said “firm proposals” would be published later in the year. Fallon said the UK still wanted migrants to come to work in the UK, but said firms had to be encouraged to train British workers. “There’s a balance to be struck. We want to attract to this country highly skilled people to come here and make a contribution to our society and put down roots here,” he said. “We also have to make sure British companies train up British workers and give opportunities to our college leavers.” The defence secretary said a decline in net migration was what the British public had voted for in the EU referendum. “British people want to see immigration managed downwards … they also want to see implemented the result of the Brexit referendum, where we take back control of our immigration system,” he said. Earlier, the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called the document “a blueprint for strangling London’s economy”, but other senior figures in the party have been more reluctant to directly criticise the plan. The party’s official response to the document from the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, was muted, saying it was “not yet government policy” and Labour would judge the final outcome. “Labour wants fair rules and reasonable management of migration in accordance with the needs of our economy and our values as a party,” she said. The Institute of Directors’ deputy director of policy Edwin Morgan said businesses would hope that the leaked plan “had moved on several drafts since this version” and the economy would be hit by a sharp decline in immigration. “Unemployment is below 5% and the simple question of where people are going to come from if we suddenly rapidly decrease people coming from the EU is a massive unanswered question,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Some people defined as lower skilled could be because they fall under certain salary thresholds, so it could be nurses, teachers, careworkers, people most of the country would say we need.” Sam Bowman, executive director of the neoliberal thinktank the Adam Smith Institute, called the plans “a disaster” and said the Home Office had shown it was incapable of dealing with non-EU immigration effectively. “Extending this sort of system to EU immigration will massively drive up waiting times, uncertainty and bureaucracy facing businesses and public services who need to hire foreign workers,” he said. “Curbing their numbers substantially will mean higher taxes or deeper spending cuts just to keep the public finances at their current level, and public services that rely on foreign workers – like schools and the NHS – will face shortages of key workers and need to cut spending on frontline services to fill in the gaps.” Alp Mehmet, the director of Migration Watch, welcomed the plan, however, saying it could lead to a reduction in net migration of 100,000 or more over the next 10 years. “British firms have now got three or four years to start thinking seriously about training our own workers,” he told the programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/06/ryanair-priority-boarding-carry-on-bags-cabin-luggage","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T09:34:31Z","webTitle":"Ryanair: pay £5 for priority boarding to carry on wheelie bags","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/06/ryanair-priority-boarding-carry-on-bags-cabin-luggage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/06/ryanair-priority-boarding-carry-on-bags-cabin-luggage","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair: pay £5 for priority boarding to carry on wheelie bags","bodyText":"Ryanair customers will have to pay £5 for priority boarding from 1 November if they want to carry a wheelie bag on board, as the airline attempts to reduce boarding and flight delays caused by a shortage of overhead cabin space. Priority boarders will still be able to carry on two bags, but all other passengers will be allowed to take only one smaller bag on board the aircraft. A second, larger, wheelie bag will have to be placed in the hold free of charge at the boarding gate, to be collected at baggage reclaim on arrival. Ryanair is also lowering checked bag fees – a move that will cost the airline €50m (£46m) a year – and increasing the weight allowance to encourage more customers to check in luggage. From 1 November, the check-in bag allowance will increase from 15kg to 20kg, while the fee for luggage in the hold will be reduced from £35 to £25. Kenny Jacobs, the airline’s chief marketing officer, said the changes to its baggage policy still mean passengers will be able to travel with two bags for free, but under the current rules too many passengers were taking two bags on board busy flights, resulting in insufficient overhead space and causing delays. He said that on a typically busy flight, about 186 seats of a total of 189 will be occupied, with space for about 90 bags in the overhead lockers. But some people were bending the rules by bringing on board a wheelie bag and a large rucksack that will not fit underneath the seat. “We’re making these changes because our flights are so much busier,” he said. “A number of people will have two very large bags, taking up someone else’s space. They’ll hope they’ll get away with it and generally they have, but we don’t want to go back to policing bags at the gate.” When the second bag allowance was introduced in late 2013, average Ryanair flights were 82% full, Jacobs said. That rose to 97% in August, when a record 12.7 million passengers flew with the airline. “These bag policy changes will cost Ryanair more than €50m a year in reduced checked bag fees. However, we believe offering bigger bags at reduced fees will encourage more customers to consider checking in a bag,” he said. “We hope that by restricting non-priority customers to one small carry-on bag – their wheelie bag must be placed in the hold, free of charge at the boarding gate – this will speed up the boarding of flights and eliminate flight delays being caused by not having sufficient overhead cabin space on busy flights to accommodate over 360 carry-on bags.” Priority boarding costs £5 at the time of booking. It can be added to a booking for £6 up to one hour before scheduled departure. The changes will mean more passengers will have to collect their luggage from the baggage reclaim carousel at the arrival airport, potentially holding up passengers at their destination. However, Jacobs said bags were often available as soon as passengers had cleared security, partly because security checks were taking longer. “More than 90% of the time your bag will be on the carousel when you get there,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/07/greater-gliders-fears-of-catastrophic-consequences-from-logging-in-victoria","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T18:00:38Z","webTitle":"Greater gliders: fears of 'catastrophic' consequences from logging in Victoria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/07/greater-gliders-fears-of-catastrophic-consequences-from-logging-in-victoria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/07/greater-gliders-fears-of-catastrophic-consequences-from-logging-in-victoria","fields":{"headline":"Greater gliders: fears of 'catastrophic' consequences from logging in Victoria","bodyText":"Logging has begun in trees inhabited by the threatened greater gliders in a forest also inhabited by Victoria’s faunal emblem, the threatened Leadbeater’s possum. Protections for the remaining Leadbeater’s possum population – believed to be fewer than 2,500 breeding individuals left in the wild – mean logging will be halted within 200m of known colonies. But no such protection exists for the greater gliders, which have been listed as threatened by both state and federal governments. On the evenings of 18 and 19 August, citizen scientists recorded the presence of seven greater gliders in an area of the Toolangi state forest in the central highlands of Victoria, which was earmarked for logging by VicForests. The report was emailed to VicForests, as well as relevant Victorian ministers and departments on 28 August. It is understood that logging had started in the area by then, and has continued with no regard given to the known greater glider population. A spokeswoman for the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning replied to the email about the sighting, saying: “DELWP is still determining our interim protection measures for greater gliders and your report will help inform this work.” Danya Jacobs, a lawyer at Environmental Justice Australia, said the government was required to make an “action statement” as soon as possible after an animal is listed as threatened. Greater gliders were listed as threatened under federal law in May 2017, with habitat loss listed as a major threat with “catastrophic” consequences. Timber production in particular was noted as a threat, since “prime habitat coincides largely with areas suitable for logging”. “The government can and should use powers that are available to it to urgently prohibit logging where this species occurs,” Jacobs said. Lilly D’Ambrosio, Victoria’s minister for energy environment and climate change told Guardian Australia the Victorian government was working on protecting the greater glider “as a priority” and interim measures were being finalised to be put in place while longer-term protections are developed. She said the draft action statement would be published in early 2018, with the public invited to comment on it. Sightings of Leadbeater’s possums by the same group of citizen scientists in the area has resulted in a buffer of 200m around the known colonies, a legal requirement made to protect the threatened species. A government analysis found that even with these protections, the Leadbeater’s possums had only a 45% chance of surviving. But a new independent assessment of that protection measure by John Woinarski from Charles Darwin University found the population is still very likely to be wiped out, since that calculation assumed “an implausible future scenario of 200 years without bushfire”. “When a single bushfire is factored into the analysis, the population within the conservation reserve system, including [timber harvesting exclusion zones policy], is far more likely than not to become quasi-extinct,” Woinarski wrote. (“Quasi-extinct” is defined as when the population drops below a viable threshold.) The report has been published by the Victorian government, which says it is considering it “and will respond in due course”. Jacobs said: “Gambling the future of Victoria’s faunal emblem on the slim hope that the central highlands might go 200 years without a bushfire is completely irresponsible.” While the 200m logging exclusion zones around known colonies can stop those individual possums from being killed immediately, the surrounding logging leaves the possums vulnerable to bushfires, with less habitat to escape into. “Leadbeater’s possum was hit very hard by the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009,” said Jacobs. “The effort to prevent the species’ extinction is directly linked to protecting its remaining habitat. “While the government cannot guarantee 200 years without bushfires, it could greatly improve the survival chances of Leadbeater’s possum by prohibiting logging in the possum’s home forests.” A joint RSPCA-WWF report finds tree clearing in Queensland is the state’s biggest animal welfare issue, killing 34m animals each year in the state, many of which die a painful death. “Nothing else in Queensland causes as much suffering and death among animals as the escalating destruction of bushland habitat by bulldozers and other machinery,” said Mark Townend from the RSPCA. “This is due to a gaping hole in our legislative safeguards allowing huge areas of forest to be bulldozed with no requirement to consider or reduce the impact on the animals living there,” Townend said. The report found that between 2009 and 2014, more than 10,000 koalas were admitted to the four south-east Queensland wildlife hospitals, out of a population of only 15,000 estimated in 2010.Dermot O’Gorman, chief executive of WWF-Australia, said bulldozing of habitat was a major factor in the 80% decline of koalas in Queensland’s Koala Coast. “Even if they escape the grinding bulldozers and crashing trees, native animals face deprivation and death crowding into remaining habitats that are already full.” The two organisations called for stronger restrictions on land clearing, mandatory relocation of wildlife in tree-clearing projects, and enhanced funding for wildlife rescue services."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/06/run-clean-litter-free-race","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T12:06:10Z","webTitle":"Run clean: making sure you have a litter-free race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/06/run-clean-litter-free-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/06/run-clean-litter-free-race","fields":{"headline":"Run clean: making sure you have a litter-free race","bodyText":"I ran the London Marathon this year, and witnessed some amazing sights. I shared a train carriage with a stormtrooper and a lobster and I saw runners and supporters overwhelmed by the emotions of the day. But I also saw the odd runner lobbing their water bottle far into people’s gardens, while right next to them volunteers diligently collected all of the discarded water bottles on the road, using a special super-efficient bottle shovel. As far as I’m aware, there aren’t any prizes awarded for “distance you can throw your bottle” in races, but I’m sure that the locals who find them in their gardens, trees or perhaps on their balconies are very impressed with the effort. I have run Windermere Marathon a few times, which, as the name suggests, takes place in a very beautiful area and the organisers go to great lengths to avoid runners littering. They have huge bins set up at the water stations, others about 100m further on, as well as a team of marshals who pick up any litter. It’s a pretty foolproof anti-litter system – and yet every year I see somebody chuck a plastic bottle into a hedge, where, if it isn’t found, it will remain for approximately another 450 years. The London Marathon provides 750,000 bottles of water for runners across 23 water stations. Penny Dain, head of communications for the London Marathon, explains that any pallets of unused water are collected and brought back to their storage depots for use at future events. So, no waste there. And “all used bottles, and other waste items from the London Marathon, are collected by waste service teams from the relevant London Borough. All the bottles (together with other recyclables) are split out and recycled.” And if you’re wondering why the London Marathon goes for bottles, Penny also had the answer: “There are a myriad of interconnecting reasons that the London Marathon uses bottles rather than cups. Our experience shows that in hot conditions, water distributed from cups, rather than bottles, is an untenable solution for runners. The difficulty in drinking from cups while running, combined with the greater quantity of water required by runners in hot conditions, the greater length of water station required if cups are used, the logistical challenge of delivering the water to the 23 water stations, the time of our road closures, the clean-up operation we have to undertake and the huge number of spectators means that bottles are the best solution.” It’s a slick operation in London, with no trace left behind – and everything that can be recycled is recycled. That is, if somebody hasn’t chucked their plastic bottle 30 metres into a bush. Gel wrappers are another all-too-common form of litter left lying around by runners and cyclists. Last year there was an attempt to raise awareness of the effect of gel wrappers on wildlife as it was discovered that deer in Richmond Park have died from eating litter. There are other, less obvious ways in which the running community litter our landscape. I was course-marking for a race earlier this year on the Thames path and, as I went along putting up signs with arrows on, I found myself taking down many others that had been there for months. I live on the Ridgeway, a popular National Trail, which is used for a lot of races, and many signs go up at the weekends, but they don’t all come down. And big orange arrows that are brutally stapled to fences and trees really don’t look attractive enough to be a permanent feature. The vast majority of race directors, particularly those who want to stage the race again the following year, are highly responsible. The company I was course-marking for take all its signs down within 24 hours of the race, and then get a course sweeper to double check everything has been removed. But evidently, there are less responsible race organisers out there, too. So what can we do about the minority of the running community who are litterbugs? There are a lot of lessons we can learn from races that take place in parts of the world where large amounts of litter simply can’t be dealt with. Races held in environments such as mountains, deserts and jungles, where it is hard to get skips full of runner detritus picked up by the local waste management company, have to have zero tolerance. It’s very common for European ultras to require runners to bring their own cup as part of their mandatory kit. This obviously negates the use of plastic cups and bottles altogether. At the Ultra Trail Du Mont Blanc (UTMB), it is estimated that this saves the organisers 100,000 disposable cups a year. The Montane Lakeland 100/50 and Centurion Running races have adopted this policy and it would be great if more in the UK started doing it. The only downside is that, towards the end of a long race, your drink may start to taste of a mix of coke, squash and soup – but by that point you won’t be very discerning and all calories are gratefully received. The UTMB also uses tap water as much as possible, which saves around 8,000 plastic bottles per year. It even has special containers at aid stations in which to deposit your used batteries from head torches for recycling. Some races in the mountains give you a small mesh rubbish bag to attach to the waist belt of your backpack, to make sure you have no excuse to drop any litter. Some even give you small black bags, which will be very familiar to dog owners. These are to bag up any toilet roll you may use on the trail, should you need to “go” al fresco. The ultimate in leaving no trace behind must be the Marathon des Sables, where, as Damian Hall delights in reporting, you are required to “poop in a bag”. These inaccessible environments mean that organisers need to be inventive if they want to stage their races ... Most races do have a rule saying that if you are caught relieving yourself in public, or dropping litter, you will be disqualified. But despite seeing hundreds of runners doing both at pretty much every race I’ve ever done, I’ve never been aware of a disqualification. Organisations such as Good Gym carry out community projects such as litter picking, and I’ve known race organisers tell runners to pick up any litter they see while out on trail races. But at the end of the day, it is up to race organisers and runners to find ways to eliminate mindless littering in the first place. If you take it out running with you, you bring it back or put it in a bin. Tour de France riders might feel the need to jettison that extra water bottle weight before their sprint finish, but an empty gel wrapper in your pocket probably won’t disadvantage your half marathon time too much."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/10/natural-selection-andy-peter-holden-artangel-newington-library-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"Andy Holden & Peter Holden: Natural Selection review – artfulness is egg-shaped","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/10/natural-selection-andy-peter-holden-artangel-newington-library-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/10/natural-selection-andy-peter-holden-artangel-newington-library-review","fields":{"headline":"Andy Holden & Peter Holden: Natural Selection review – artfulness is egg-shaped","bodyText":"The swallow sculpts its nest out of mud. The horned coot works with pebbles in streams, an avian Andy Goldsworthy. The weaver bird is famous for its elaborate globes and sheaths conjured out of grasses; but the bowerbird surely takes the biscuit, decorating its lavish pavilions with flower petals, shells and shards of shining plastic. It has even been known to use masticated berries as paint. A magnified bower dominates the opening gallery of Natural Selection. An enormous assembly of reeds with a central eye-like hole, it’s so suggestive of art as to strike the mind first as some sort of sculpture. Which is both true and exactly the point. For everything in this marvellous Artangel exhibition – a show of marvels in itself – turns upon the astonishing connections between ornithology and art, or more precisely between birds and their visions, whether their nests and even their eggs can be seen as expressive creations rather than just evolutionary imperatives. The argument is played out using eggs and nests from all over the world, as well as paintings, sculptures and films. These are the work of Andy Holden, sometimes in conjunction with his father, Peter. Holden senior is a household name: national organiser of the RSPB’s Young Ornithologists’ Club and former “bird man” on Blue Peter; Andy is an artist, animator and musician with the Grubby Mitts. Posters for Peter Holden’s first book featured infant Andy reading bird magazines in his highchair. This show is also about the evolution of their relationship. Here, for instance, is the blackbird’s nest Andy once found in the tree outside his childhood home. A perfect circle, it turns on a revolving disc, emphasising the lovely roundness of the bird’s creation; whereas for Peter the design is about cupping the eggs as safely as possible. Swallows are equally security-minded to the father, nesting in high eaves. But a greater wonder for the son is their ability to sculpt in a medium as quick-drying as renaissance terracotta using only beaks and claws. Andy shows photographs of the bird that even built its home on an emblematic trowel. Bark, nests and branches are all used in quasi-scientific displays, as well as installations and depictions (a vast collection of stolen eggs, subject of a famous crime, is recreated in spectacular facsimile). But the dialogue between father and son has its principal focus in a split-screen film where they give a brilliant two-headed lecture on nests, taking in, inter alia, the homicidal cuckoo; the tailorbird, stitching leaves together with spider’s silk; the massive airborne apartment blocks of the sociable weaver bird; and the mute swans that work together in pairs. For Andy, the swans’ nest measures the strength of their marriage. Knowledge from the father, poetry from the son: that seems to be the pattern. Except that Peter Holden opens your eyes to beauty too – to nests as exposed pockets, fragile cradles or invisible cities, as he refers to rookeries. He may be sceptical of Andy’s chicken and egg claims – did mankind really make mud huts in imitation of the swallows, as Pliny says – but he points out just how astonishing it is that young long-tailed tits can make their bottle-shaped nests without ever having seen another bird do it. Downstairs in the disused Victorian library (formerly the Cuming Museum, a father-son ethnographic collection) is Andy Holden’s latest film installation. Ostensibly narrated by a cartoon crow that once starred in his father’s RSPB magazines, now grown into a wise old animatronic bird, this is an enthralling history of egg collecting from eccentric pastime, when aristocrats swam Scottish lochs with eggs in their hands, to childhood hobby, competitive pursuit and eventually – after the 1954 Protection of Birds Act – organised crime. The crow flies through landscapes by Turner, Ravilious and Hockney (this is a concise history of English art en route), hops in and out of a mist-rolling Paul Nash, enters into documentary footage of egg robbers discussing their crimes. Most unforgettable are the stories of Colin Watson, who cut down the tree in which endangered ospreys were nesting, in protest against the 1954 Act, then died while clambering up for an egg. And Matthew Gonshaw, jailed in 2011 for egging, who speaks on camera of his addiction, and the romance of it, betraying a forlorn desire to return to the innocence of childhood. Andy Holden twines the strands together like a weaver bird himself, subtly suggesting all sorts of parallels – between the cuckoo forging other birds’ eggs and his own artfully faked collection; between the tailorbird’s lacing and the shoe tying learned from his father (what’s learned, what’s instinctive?); between egging and art collecting. Egg thefts might almost be construed as a kind of art crime, except that to steal an egg is to steal a bird’s life. And what is an egg but a perfect creation, a masterpiece of form and beauty, removed from the flow of time. Look at the owl’s moonlight egg, known as an immaculate. Or the guillemot’s eggs, laid directly on the rocky ledge, and apparently painted to resemble it. Each is different in its graphic abstraction; this one like a Henri Michaux ink work, this one like a Jackson Pollock. How are they even made? The show circles back in the end to the bowerbird, making its nest for fun, or love, a free invention in which no eggs will ever be laid. This bird, the Holdens agree, has a singular sensibility. For the father, this is a triumph of natural selection; for the son, it’s the essence of creativity. The bird has a concept of beauty that precedes and governs his creation. It is by definition an artist.

The South Africa scandal reflects its toxic culture","bodyText":"It was lunchtime on 31 July 2013, and I had suddenly realised how toxic the corporate culture at Bell Pottinger – the disgraced PR firm currently at the centre of a race relations scandal in South Africa – really was. One of the many TVs that dotted the office had announced that Doreen Lawrence, mother of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, was to be made a peer. A male director spluttered and choked out his outrage to all within earshot. “What’s she ever done to deserve it?” he jeered, contemptuous that a black, progressive woman had been given such an honour. “She’s done a lot of campaigning work,” offered a junior colleague mildly. “So have I!” he responded with obnoxious self-belief. In another life I was a corporate lobbyist, and I started my career in the most notorious of PR houses – Bell Pottinger. The company now looks to be in its death throes, after being expelled from the Public Relations and Communications Association, the industry regulatory body, for whipping up racial hatred in South Africa on behalf of its client, the Gupta family. The scandal has forced Bell Pottinger’s chief executive, James Henderson, to resign, and there is a mass exodus of clients. No one could have foreseen what would be happening now in 2012, when I joined the company. But even then the writing was on the wall, if you cared to look. Bell Pottinger was, and is, a company full of smart, kind, decent people – some of the best in the industry. It is unfair that many of them will lose their jobs, through no fault of their own. For a young graduate, it offered an unparalleled introduction to the world of corporate lobbying, and many used the skills they learned there for good – entering the charity or political worlds, as I’d intended to do. But underneath it all, there was a toxic, Machiavellian working culture. The company had a history of taking on the clients no one else would want: in fact, it cultivated an image of sailing close to the wind in order to attract them. I worked for a tobacco company (other firms won’t touch tobacco), a “legal loan shark” that charged impoverished clients obscene interest rates, a commodities house linked to a toxic spill, and an oil company trying to drill in a world heritage site. The work we were doing was immoral, though not illegal. It’s in this context of accepting the clients that other firms wouldn’t touch that the Gupta scandal should properly be viewed. But my main criticisms weren’t with the clients, but the culture. Sure, I didn’t like representing a tobacco firm; but I smoked, didn’t I? It was the atmosphere in the office that ground me down, day after day. As a young, minority woman who also voted Labour in a firm with close links to the Tories, working there was often unbearable. Male colleagues would sneer at me in meetings, calling me “Polly Toynbee” – the ultimate term of contempt to Tory activists looking for safe seats, who spent their free time drinking in the Strangers’ Bar with the backbenchers of the 1922 Committee. One morning I woke up to find that members of the committee had followed me – a young graduate with a tiny following – on Twitter in the middle of the night. It didn’t take a genius to work out I had been a figure of fun during a late-night conversation. It was a boys’ club, and we never forgot that. An office party was held at the Playboy Club, and female attendees were told to wear high heels. Female partners were rare, and didn’t last long – I saw two senior women pushed out within months of joining. A male partner took me to lunch and kindly explained that I needed to be better at hiding my emotions, because being emotional would hold me back. Another told me to let it go when one of his newly hired ex-army pals cheerfully assumed I was an intern. Hiring practices looked nepotistic. I’d entered through the now-defunct graduate scheme, which offered no promise of a job at the end of a year-long contract, despite being hugely competitive. Multiple other people were hired while I was there into permanent, entry-level roles – bypassing the scheme – seemingly thanks to family connections. There were very few fellow minorities, and all the ones I worked with subsequently left. I watched a male director scream in outrage at one woman of colour because she had dared to query his expenses. A year after I left, I went for coffee with my former director, a man of south Asian descent, one of the few nonwhite directors. Looking morose, he told me about a high-level meeting in which a racially offensive jibe had been made about him by a colleague. He had also now left. Towards the end of my time at the company, I was asked to assist on a pitch led by the Doreen Lawrence critic. I overprepared: I didn’t trust him, and I’d never worked for him before. I was right to do so. During the pitch, the client team tossed us a difficult question. With a smile, the director – who was clearly winging it – passed the grenade to me, despite it being on a topic I’d been told not to research. I answered, raging internally at his attempt to set me up to fail. Afterwards he emailed me, congratulating me on my performance. Perhaps I had won him round, I wondered. Weeks later, the same director pushed me out. I received a bungled phone call one morning at my desk from the HR manager, asking about my leave date. It was the first I’d heard of it. Blinking back tears, I asked my ally, the South Asian director, what had happened. He had vouched for me, he explained gently, but the other director said my work was substandard and I didn’t fit the values of the company. “But the only piece of work I ever did for him he congratulated me on!” I responded, throat gravel-coarse. The implication felt clear: I wasn’t right for Bell Pottinger, because of who I was, not how hard I worked or what I’d done. Bell Pottinger was, and is, a place where good people struggled to have their voices heard about the din or were pushed out. But what today’s scandal shows is that what is rotten will eventually come unstuck."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/07/supersize-us-upselling-is-fuelling-the-obesity-epidemic-warns-report","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T05:45:52Z","webTitle":"Supersize us: upselling is fuelling the obesity epidemic, warns report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/07/supersize-us-upselling-is-fuelling-the-obesity-epidemic-warns-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/07/supersize-us-upselling-is-fuelling-the-obesity-epidemic-warns-report","fields":{"headline":"Supersize us: upselling is fuelling the obesity epidemic, warns report","bodyText":"One in three people buys a larger coffee, more fries or added cream each week as a result of “upselling”, which experts say is fuelling the obesity epidemic. Most people in the UK – 78% of those questioned in a survey – say they are asked in restaurants, fast food outlets and stores at least once a week if they want to “go large”, opting for more food or bigger portions, according to a report. Those who succumb to upselling get an extra 55% more calories on average by paying just a fraction more: scaling up the meal or the coffee or buying a cut-price larger chocolate bar raises the cost by an average of 17%, says the report. Those calories add up to a weight gain of about 2.2kg (5lb) every year, it estimates. Young people aged 18-24 are the most likely to experience upselling, consuming an extra 750 calories a week that could potentially lead them to put on 5kg (11lb) of extra weight in a year. The report comes from the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), together with Slimming World, who say upselling is a routine technique used to persuade customers to consume and spend more. Public health experts have called on the government to take action against buy-one-get-one-free promotions in supermarkets, but upselling has gone under the radar. Upselling, says the report, is the act of persuading a customer to buy something additional or more expensive. “The term is a relatively new concept that has only been widely used since mass-marketing was introduced during the 1980s,” it says. “Studies have shown that when people are presented with larger portion sizes, they consume more and increase their calorie intake.” Restaurant staff, speaking anonymously, describe in the report how they are trained and incentivised to upsell. One cafe worker says that if they are asked for a latte, “I will reply with ‘large?’ The confidence of insinuating that a large is in fact what a typical customer orders often nudges the customer into [ordering] the bigger and slightly more expensive drink.” If somebody asks for a cake, the response is: “Is that with cream or ice cream today?” A fast food worker says staff are trained always to ask if the customer would like a meal. “We often get reminded of hourly goals of how many large meals we’re expected to sell.” A pub worker alerts customers to offers, such as “would you like a portion of chips? They’re half price” and three starters for £12 or three desserts for £7. A table of two people will often end up with an extra plate. “The major incentive for upselling is a team competition, with a prize for the winning team,” the worker says. The report urges the government to cut business rates for outlets that undertake not to train staff to upsell unhealthy food and drink nor to link staff payments to upselling. “Obesity is the public health challenge of our generation and if not addressed urgently could tip over the point of no return,” said Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the RSPH. “Incentivising businesses to help keep their customers healthy by offering reduced business rates could be a positive step to help reduce the burden placed on our health care system by obesity-related illness. It also gives businesses the opportunity to step up to the plate and take their fair share of responsibility for the public’s health and wellbeing. “Almost everyone can relate to the feeling of being pressured into buying extra calories through upselling. Our latest report shows the extent to which these extra calories can really add up, often without us noticing. We hope that through this work the public can become more aware of how businesses target them with upselling and help people to maintain a healthy weight.” Caroline Cerny at the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of over 40 organisations with an interest in the issue, said: “It’s all too easy to eat more than we need when we are encouraged to buy larger sizes, add unhealthy extras or take advantage of special offers when it comes to unhealthy food and drink. There is clear evidence that marketing techniques persuade us to eat and drink more of the wrong types of food and this is driving the obesity epidemic. The food industry can play a vital role by helping to make healthier choices the easy choice and creating a healthier food environment for us all.” Sharon Hodgson MP, shadow public health minister, said: “The promotion of unhealthy food has clearly infiltrated our society and is contributing significantly to the burgeoning obesity crisis we see today. Alongside the many actions to address obesity, it is crucial that consumers are empowered to make healthier choices at the checkout rather than being bombarded with junk food marketing or encouraged to upgrade to a larger drink or meal than the one originally ordered.” Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “The last thing people need is to be coaxed into consuming more calories – people on average consume 200-300 calories too many a day, so we need the opposite. Upselling is bad for our waistlines and bad for our health, and we are pleased to see action discouraging these practices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/06/faced-with-nuclear-annihilation-what-would-you-do-my-father-stockpiled-death-pills","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T17:51:53Z","webTitle":"Faced with nuclear annihilation, what would you do?

My father stockpiled death pills","bodyText":"How did fear of nuclear holocaust fade so fast? I was brought up at a time when we thought the world would probably end before we got old. But here we still are, the people who were young in the 60s, and so are the H bombs that terrified us. If anything, we are less safe now than back in the heyday of our CND demonstrations. My father was one of the early founders of CND: a former communist who had left the party at the time of the Hitler/Stalin pact; he launched a peace march across Europe to Hungary in the 1950s. He was by nature a millenarian, living in fear of the end of the world in one way or another – and his fears were well-grounded. I went on my first Aldermaston march at 13, after hearing him speak in Trafalgar Square. Unfortunately, as was his wont, he stopped at The Bunch of Grapes pub before the march left Belgravia, and never got any further. But I went for the whole four-day trip, and every year after that, Aldermaston was the great social event for me and my friends. My father’s fears of nuclear annihilation were so serious that halfway to a holiday in Wales, the family car had to be turned around because he had forgotten the large jar of death pills he had accumulated to mercy-kill everyone in the event of nuclear war. We had read Nevil Shute’s On the Beach. We knew what was coming. We knew exactly what Strontium-90 fallout did to you. We knew that RAF Fylingdales’ early-warning system would give us just four minutes to say goodbye. I carried banners on CND marches listing what you can do in four minutes: boil an egg, run a mile … The songs of those marches have stayed with all who were there: “Don’t you hear the H bombs thunder / Echo like the crack of doom? While they rend the skies asunder / Fallout makes the earth a tomb.” There were many verses. “Time is short; we must be speedy / We can see the hungry filled / House the homeless, help the needy / Shall we blast or shall we build?” The refrain ends “Ban the bomb, for evermore!” But it never happened and the bombs are still here, bequeathed now to our grandchildren. In fact, the world’s armoury has become even more unstable, in the hands of countries not officially sanctioned by the UN to possess them: Pakistan, Israel and now North Korea. Nothing about the replacement of Soviet communism by nationalist dictatorial Putinism makes the rusting Russian nuclear arsenal feel any safer than it was back then. Trump’s tiny finger on the button is terrifying. The risk of terrorists getting their hands on enough nuclear material to make lethal dirty bombs is growing, not shrinking. Already not just nuclear material, but ready-made bombs, have gone missing, or are unaccounted for. No one knows how or when or where. The fear was rekindled with the arrival of cruise missiles at Greenham Common in 1983, launching a second wave of CND activism. But that too faded. Why? The ecological collapse of the planet took over, because it’s actually happening, right now, in the global floods, droughts and forest fires, the hottest years accelerating on the graphs. My father’s end-of-the-world anxiety turned to sustainability - he became an early climate-change campaigner, setting up a commune to grow its own produce, though it was never self-sufficient. He was only half joking when he wagged a finger at me and warned that I would arrive at his door from London, begging for a cabbage, as civilisation collapsed around us. What should we fear most? Which will get us first – nuclear obliteration or the planet boiling? There are many kinds of complacency: the right, by nature, tends to trust that some notional global establishment will somehow sort things out before catastrophe strikes. Or science will fix it just in time. Maybe, as the risks rise, there is a limit to the amount of fear you can feel at any one time, and you are left to shrug helplessly at whatever insanity Kim and Trump may commit. Astronomers know without doubt the world will end, many millennia hence. The question is whether we end it all now, out of sheer human idiocy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/07/black-voices-rural-suburban-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T09:54:55Z","webTitle":"Where are the black voices of rural and suburban Britain?

We need to hear them","bodyText":"If you’re a member of a minority in a rural or suburban area of Britain, there’s every likelihood that you will have been made aware of your race in school, in the local supermarket, by your neighbours and perhaps by the local authorities. Without many real-life examples of blackness in close proximity, besides immediate family, young black people can be driven to seek role models within the media. But the lack of varied and different black British experiences portrayed on screen – it’s nearly entirely London-based – can ultimately do more harm than good, especially when black people so often aren’t the creators. The first realisation of race, as a black person living around few other black people, often comes from being reminded of your “otherness” – and it’s not usually in an empowering way. Ultimately, you’re left with two options: assimilate, shrink and internalise the racism that you experience; or reject it, and take pride in your blackness despite being the only black person around. However, the reaction of white people to such displays of unapologetic blackness is seldom warm. Smaller communities tend to be more cautious of outsiders. And when your race is the first marker, it makes relating to your peers that much more difficult. For all of us, this starts in the classroom, where many black people first encounter that which makes us different. In these instances, black people often risk ostracism and, as they become adults, the loss of employment, housing and academic opportunities. Figures from the 2011 census indicated that only 3% of the population of rural areas were Black and minority ethnic (Bame), compared with 17% in urban areas. If we’re seeing less of people who look like us the further away we are from London and other major cities, increased exposure to whiteness can have a lasting impact on how black people see themselves. Code switching, where subtle changes in language are used to distance oneself from being instantly labelled black, often takes place in the workplace. It is far easier to pull off if you’ve regularly found yourself around white people, so much so that by the time you’re a teenager you’re already adept at picking up on those subtle cues that point to racial micro-aggressions. In my case, that meant heavy use of slang towards me and teachers tending to assume that I was more likely to be rowdy and a distraction in the classroom. Although there are nuances to living in London as a working-class black person, economic status does so much to influence your understanding of the world, from education to health, that race alone isn’t enough of a commonality when seeking to understand the complex nuances of black Britishness. Essentially, black Londoners have more in common with other Londoners than with black people elsewhere in the country. This geographical bias is especially true in the arts, and for a long time was the case in grime. For a while, it felt as though there was a romanticisation of grime due to its association with London. It goes without saying that grime culture itself, from pirate radio to reloads, found its roots in London, but culture can never remain confined to one region for long – especially when other marginalised people engage with it. Elsewhere in the media, especially those made for the white gaze, we very rarely see inclusive representations of black Britishness. The homogenising of such representations, which often depict black British people as existing only in the country’s cities, erases those that aren’t seen as inner-city youths in need of saving. It’s why the FX show Atlanta has been well received for its precise and sharp account of inner-city blackness, showing what this may look like through the eyes of the city’s inhabitants. Unfortunately there is a huge lack of access to information and education on black British history. Although institutions such as the Black Cultural Archives in Brixton exist, there is still a preference to look outward to America, in order for Britons to gain an understanding of race from the perspective of black people. Stories such as the 1963 Bristol Bus Boycotts, led by Paul Stephenson, which influenced the passing of the Race Relations Act 1965, and the elections of Smethwick in 1964, which saw Malcolm X visit the West Midlands town following extreme racial tensions, are not only a reminder of Britain’s history of race outside of London but a sobering reminder that this “history” isn’t too long ago. Failing to acknowledge how events such as these have shaped communities and attitudes across the country since the mass arrival of black people in postwar Britain has stifled actual steps towards dismantling discrimination. The more we begin to see these events documented in the curriculum, museums and galleries, as well as on screen, and as the numbers of Bame people in rural areas and towns continues to rise, the more it will become difficult to ignore the problems of racism in our country today. It’s not about one experience – city or rural – being worse or better than the other. It’s about amplifying a wide range of black British voices that exist not only in large, urban areas but also the farthest corners of the country. These are important stories, and if we continue to overlook them, it will damage any attempts to tackle how racism affects our society. • Jesse Bernard is a journalist and writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/06/tinder-gold-app-robot-swipe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T15:06:25Z","webTitle":"Tinder Gold takes us nearer to the app’s grim endpoint: robot-style dating | Roisin Kiberd","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/06/tinder-gold-app-robot-swipe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/06/tinder-gold-app-robot-swipe","fields":{"headline":"Tinder Gold takes us nearer to the app’s grim endpoint: robot-style dating","bodyText":"“We know you. You live in a world where every moment counts – where speed equals success, you’re always on the go, and you can’t let anything slow you down.” This not a line from the new Blade Runner sequel. It’s a statement issued by Tinder explaining its new product, Tinder Gold, which launched on 29 August, becoming the highest grossing product in Apple’s App Store several days later. This isn’t the first iteration of the dating app’s paid-for offerings: Tinder Select was launched in March, a version for “elite” users invited by peer nomination only. Back in 2015 there was also Tinder Plus. Tinder Gold, however, ups the ante for luxury Tinder, and has been promoted with gleefully gaudy, elitist rhetoric. Available for £4.66 a month, or £3.50, if you buy a year’s membership, it’s described as a “first-class swipe experience”, a “members-only service, offering our most exclusive features”. For every user, Tinder Gold will curate a buffet of partners waiting to be liked back (an option called “likes you”). It removes ads and offers unlimited likes, five “super likes” a day (for when you’re really, really thirsty), “passport” (location changes), and “boost” (your profile becomes more visible). There’s also “rewind”, the backtracking option for users who dismiss potential matches too quickly. There’s something funny and a little bit grim about this feature; for a fee, it lets customers undermine the flippant premise offered by Tinder in the first place. Tinder has inserted itself into daily life and has rewritten the rules of everyday behaviour. Now it is offering a chance to restore a little humanity to the experience of dating – but only to those who pay. Tinder’s appeal, like that of rival dating apps, hinges on the promise of instant satisfaction: its ease of use (a simple swipe for yes or no), the minimal personal commitment (users submit only pictures and a 500-character bio) and the promise of near-instantaneous sex, or at the least a flirty chat with the person you’ve “matched” with. The idea is to sift through people quickly; one ad for Tinder Plus depicts a young, attractive female user escaping her office job by bed-hopping her way around the world using Tinder, an oddly twee sex odyssey that declines to show the mornings-after, the inbox dross and the dick pics she probably had to sift through to facilitate her tour. What is never mentioned is Tinder’s subtly dehumanising effect, how it turns relationships – already fraught with neurosis – into a transactional game played by the atomised and lonely. This overlaps with a more sinister trend within tech culture for the “gamification” of life, traceable to self-improvement and business books, dating manuals such as The Game, and more overtly misogynistic online movements such as The Red Pill, where it’s implied that dating – and women themselves – can be “hacked” like operating systems to do men’s bidding (Angela Nagle links this thinking with the rise of the far-right movement the “alt-right” in her recent book, Kill All Normies). The idea of the “Tinder closer” speaks directly to this trend – someone with a “killer line”, which frames seduction as a Glengarry Glen Ross-style marketingselling manoeuvre. Meanwhile Tinder hacking has become a cottage industry, giving rise to sites such as Swipe Helper and TinderHacks.com, Tinder for Experts ebooks, and a litany of supposed tricks to score 80% more matches and date models. It’s little surprise to learn how this same logic works within Tinder itself; the company maintains an internal ranking system of its users, called the Elo score (a term derived from chess player rankings), which grades users according to their “desirability”. Other high-grossing apps take a similar approach, encroaching on “real life” in ever more inventive ways. There’s Netflix, the streaming platform whose chief executive admits their main competitor is sleep. There’s Candy Crush Saga, the addictive mobile game that turns escapist pleasure into a kind of gruelling, repetitive work. These apps deliver instant satisfaction in excess, until the “fun” is so relentless it’s not fun any more. On Tinder how many users are “ghosted”, “breadcrumbed” or led on without ever actually meeting? We are taught to flirt, to love, like robots; then are surprised when we feel nothing. It’s tempting to view Tinder as entertainment rather than a means to real life hookups and relationships, not least in this latest Tinder Gold iteration. Instead it might just be a game designed to fill the gaps in life, the lunch breaks and solitary moments, with a series of Tamagotchi partners who can be switched off when they get annoying. • Roisin Kiberd is a writer based in Dublin focusing on technology and culture"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/08/this-week-best-tv-jk-rowling-strike-silkworm-strictly-come-dancing","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T11:00:37Z","webTitle":"This week’s best TV: JK Rowling’s Strike is back on the case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/08/this-week-best-tv-jk-rowling-strike-silkworm-strictly-come-dancing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/08/this-week-best-tv-jk-rowling-strike-silkworm-strictly-come-dancing","fields":{"headline":"This week’s best TV: JK Rowling’s Strike is back on the case","bodyText":"Strike: The Silkworm Following the success of the first of the BBC’s Robert Galbraith/JK Rowling adaptations, The Cuckoo’s Calling, here’s another.

OK, let’s get Paul McCartney and That Song out of the way straight off the bat. Millions of lives were tragically blighted in the 70s by Mull Of Kintyre, number one in the pop charts for about 47 years. Watching the video with wiser, middle-aged eyes, though, I appreciate it anew. Not the dirge. That still plods like a knackered horse. But the place. Look behind Paul and the bagpipers: that’s Saddell Bay, north of the Mull. Gorgeous, isn’t it? No wonder McCartney bought High Park Farm up here in the 60s to escape Beatlemania, grow a beard, learn how to milk sheep and love mud, like some kind of proto-downshifting-hipster. He doesn’t come much any more, but the Kintyre peninsula – 20 miles of heather, oystercatchers, astonishing beaches and a fair few whisky distilleries dangling from Britain by a thread – still feels the perfect place to escape the universe.

Born in East Yorkshire, he trained at the Royal Ballet School in London and joined the Royal Ballet in 2005. Five years later, while still in the corps de ballet, Parish was talent-scouted by the Mariinsky’s then deputy director, Yuri Fateyev, and became the first British dancer to join the St Petersburg company. There’s something not quite real about your whole Russian adventure. It has a storybook, Cinderella quality. In fact to start with I turned Yuri’s offer down. It all just seemed utterly impossible. But I wanted people to notice that I’d been asked, so I spoke to Monica [Mason, then director of the Royal Ballet]. She told me that the Royal wanted to hang on to me but couldn’t offer me any solo parts for the time being. She said: “Think it over for a month.” That night I sent Yuri an email accepting his offer. Let’s go back to the beginning. I grew up in North Ferriby, a village outside Hull. I was very close to my younger sister, Demelza; people thought that we were twins. She did ballet, but for me it was always sport, especially cricket. I was taken to a ballet class when I was four but spent most of the time playing with my fire truck underneath the piano. And then, when I was eight, the Skelton Hooper ballet school put on a show, and I was so incensed that Melzie was up on stage dancing, while I was down below, that I started going to ballet myself. Were you serious about it? I auditioned for White Lodge [the Royal Ballet lower school] when I was 10. I was offered a place but didn’t take it up because I wanted to be a cricketer. I waited a year, went to cricket summer school, and then changed my mind and went to White Lodge when I was 11. What was it like being at boarding school? I was very homesick. I knew one boy there, who also came from Yorkshire, but that was it. There were no mobile phones then, just payphones, and I felt a long way from home. I was also significantly behind my classmates, always the boy at the back of the class. In the end I got used to White Lodge. It was a magical place in many ways, and after two years Melzie joined me there. But there was pressure. You got your results at the end of every term, and if you got below 50% you couldn’t return the following term. By the end of my third year I was 9% away from expulsion. Yet you made it into the Royal Ballet upper school, and into the company. We all started doing auditions at the end of our graduate year. I was offered an apprenticeship with Stuttgart Ballet and turned it down because it didn’t pay enough to live on. This prompted the Royal Ballet to offer me a contract. I was 18 and I couldn’t believe my luck. That I should have been chosen out of all my classmates, of whom I was far from the best, seemed incredible. I’d have cleaned the windows if they’d asked. I would have worked for free. That feeling didn’t last for ever, I’m assuming… Three years in I was frustrated. Fed up of just carrying a spear. So I told Monica I was thinking of entering the Varna international ballet competition in Bulgaria and, to my horror, she said OK. There was no one at the Royal available to coach me, but one of the senior dancers, José Martín, trained me for two hours every day after rehearsals. It was incredibly kind of him and he was a great teacher. We ran through all the big classical solos – Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty – and, eventually, off I went to Varna. I got kicked out in the first round. But I was a better dancer. And then off to Russia. It was hard telling Melzie I was going. We’d grown up together, been through the Royal Ballet school together, shared a flat and been in the company together. We were really close. When I got to St Petersburg it was like going to White Lodge again. I was so far from home. Most of the other dancers at the Mariinsky were icy. They wouldn’t look at me and clearly felt I was invading their space. In class, I couldn’t understand the corrections. I just had to try and cope. One day at a time. Yet you progressed. I worked hard. Yuri is an extraordinary teacher. I could do steps in the classroom but he taught me how to do them on stage. We spent hours breaking down grands jetés. How to get height, how to hang in the air. The roles came – Albrecht in Giselle, Siegfried in Swan Lake, Romeo – and when I was promoted, the friends I’d made in the corps were supportive and honest. “Bad show,” they’d say, if I was off-form. Not to criticise, but to help. And now you speak Russian. The language was terribly difficult, but it came. I often use Uber in St Petersburg and I always talk to the drivers. One told me he’d been given a ticket to the ballet a couple of nights before. He pulled out his phone and there was a picture of me taking a curtain call. I feel adopted by the Russians. I like the culture and I feel very comfortable there. I’m single now, but if I met the right girl I might settle there. You’re performing at the Royal Ballet gala to reopen the Hull New Theatre next week. How does that feel? It was the first stage I stepped on as a child – I was an urchin in The Pickwick Papers when I was eight – so I’m coming full circle. I’m very excited. • Royal Ballet: Opening the New is at Hull New Theatre on 16 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/06/brexit-leak-may-immigration-eu-migrants-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T11:22:21Z","webTitle":"This Brexit leak shines a light on our collective lunacy about immigration | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/06/brexit-leak-may-immigration-eu-migrants-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/06/brexit-leak-may-immigration-eu-migrants-britain","fields":{"headline":"This Brexit leak shines a light on our collective lunacy about immigration","bodyText":"Whoever leaked this document has done us all a great service. True, we don’t know what motive led the UK government blueprint for post-Brexit immigration to be handed to the Guardian. It could have been done by an enthusiast for the plan, keen to ensure that there’s no backsliding and that ministers stand firm. Or, more likely, the leaker was appalled by a document that sees migrants as a menace to be repelled – and hoped public disclosure might generate enough opposition to kill the plan off. Either way, and regardless of where this leak sits in the continuing internal government battle between those obsessed with migration – a group that includes the prime minister – and those who seek to prevent Brexit from wrecking the UK economy, its publication is a service. Along with the Trump administration’s announcement yesterday rescinding DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme – which allows undocumented migrants who came to the US as children (the so-called Dreamers) – protection against deportation, this document shines a bright, clarifying light on what opposition to immigration really means when translated from slogans into policy. Plenty of experts have already condemned the Home Office text for its myriad impracticalities and contradictions. To take just one, the government says it wants “no cliff-edge” exit from the single market and customs union on the day we leave, in March 2019. But this plan would end the free movement of people, which is a central plank of the single market. So, were this plan to be adopted, the UK would be out of the single market on day one, jumping right off that cliff edge. There are plenty more contradictions in that vein in the detail of the document. But it’s the overall tone that’s most striking. Each measure is clearly designed with the same objective: to deter would-be migrants from coming to Britain by making that process as difficult and unappealing as possible. So now you would need to show the right papers, have your fingerprints taken, register after a certain period, accept that your rights to “family reunion” have shrunk, and face the fact that in most cases you’ll be allowed to stay for only two years before being kicked out. (Seasoned May watchers say this seems to be constructed to satisfy a long-held May goal: breaking the link between migration and settlement, so that even if newcomers are temporarily allowed into the country they are stripped of any assumption that they might be able to stay.) The fingerprints requirement is especially telling. It implies that there is something vaguely criminal about being a migrant. Note how the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, when he announced the proposed scrapping of DACA on Tuesday, made a similar connection, suggesting that allowing the 800,000 Dreamers to remain in the country had “put our nation at risk of crime, violence and even terrorism” – even though that is wholly untrue (Dreamers lose all protection if they commit a crime, and can be deported instantly). Both Trump’s move and the UK Home Office document make the same two mistakes. First, they rest on a common delusion: that, somehow, it is the presence of migrants that is chiefly responsible for society’s current woes – as if globalisation, outsourcing and automation would all magically disappear if only there were fewer Romanians picking strawberries in Lincolnshire. This is the myth that Theresa May and Donald Trump are both selling, and it’s a con. As Barack Obama put it in a rare statement, issued in defence of the Dreamers: “Kicking them out won’t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone’s taxes, or raise anybody’s wages.” Or, in the rather more direct words of one Twitter commentator: “Deporting a great kid because he’s brown isn’t going to bring your job at the steel mill back.” But there is another folly at work. Doesn’t the author of that Home Office document realise that, in setting out to make Britain as unattractive as possible to potential newcomers – a mission already accelerated by Brexit’s devaluation of the pound – the government will also make the country less attractive to everyone else, including those born and raised here? It’s not just the harshness of tone, making Britain a country that slams the door in the face of the outside world. It’s more practical than that. Farmers warn that they need EU migrants to harvest their crops. Employers have already condemned the leaked plan, because they fear that it will not only turn them into unofficial immigration inspectors, but also deprive them of people they need, who often do jobs native-born Brits won’t do. Economists issue the same warning. Most telling are the pleas from the NHS, from care homes and from schools. If we keep out the migrants this Home Office plan aims to keep out, we will be depriving ourselves of nurses, care workers and teaching assistants. That’s the verdict of those bleeding heart liberals at the Institute of Directors. It’s a kind of collective lunacy. We’re becoming the gardener who, infuriated by the presence of unplanned wildflowers on the edges of his lawn, decides to drench the entire area in weedkiller. He gets rid of the wildflowers all right – but he’s left with a patch of barren, scorched earth where nothing will ever grow. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/05/shifting-australia-day-is-a-distraction-from-writing-an-honest-national-story","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T02:20:43Z","webTitle":"Shifting Australia Day is a distraction from writing an honest national story | Peter Lewis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/05/shifting-australia-day-is-a-distraction-from-writing-an-honest-national-story","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/05/shifting-australia-day-is-a-distraction-from-writing-an-honest-national-story","fields":{"headline":"Shifting Australia Day is a distraction from writing an honest national story","bodyText":"I have real issues with Australia Day. The idea of holding a joyous celebration on the day that Europeans first asserted control over this continent in order to establish an offshore detention centre lacks both sensitivity and context. Australia Day’s status as a day of national identity rightly causes hurt to our first peoples whose prior ownership was ignored by law for 200 years and is still not subject to a treaty. One of my earliest political actions was on the bicentenary marching from Redfern to the city as part of the Invasion Day challenge to the harbour festivities. Indeed, I have issues with the whole idea of celebrating the nation-state, undoubtedly the single biggest cause of death and destruction since humans cooked up the idea of sovereignty. Right now true patriots are threatening to add to this record. But I have even bigger issues with any campaign that would change the date of our national day. The Change the Date movement is based on a simple premise that Australia Day celebrates dispossession of Australia’s first peoples. It calls for boycotts of all Australia Day events, music festivals and for businesses to ask their staff to work. Currently there is a logjam of progressive causes with wide public support: marriage equality and climate action at the top of the list. Both these issues have shifted opinion over a sustained period of public campaigning by committed activists and built an inexorable movement for change. Today the conservative government is under intense political pressure to move on both these issues – indeed the prime minister’s inability to deliver is a central proof point in growing perceptions of his impotence. In contrast, as this week’s Essential Report shows, the idea of shifting Australia Day has muted support. There are a few points to note in detail. While it is true that a quarter of voters would support a change – and that is not inconsiderable – the number who oppose are not just double but heavily weighted towards strong opposition. At the very least these figures suggest that more work needs to be done by advocates for the change in engaging the public to garner support for an issue that will upset a large number of people. But the greater concern is in the partisan breakdown of these numbers. While Coalition and conservative “other” voters are strongly against the change, it is an issue that cleaves Labor and Green voters right down the middle. Just at the time the public is swinging in behind a broadly progressive economic agenda – one that reins in housing prices, backs in renewable energy and addresses the two-class tax system – here we have an issue that will split them all over again. Change the Date is the politics of boats, it is the politics of the republic, it is the politics of identity that distracts and divides the progressive side of politics to the advantage of the conservative and the powerful interests they represent. Is it any surprise that the most enthusiastic chroniclers of the Change the Date campaign is News Crop, the US-owned outlet committed to holding back any sense of progressive advance in this country? Just as with the confected outrage over the inscriptions on historical statues, these cultural battles are being prosecuted by those who would defend the status quo, not challenge it. None of which is to minimise the need to finally deliver a just accommodation with our first peoples or to address the entrenched inequalities in education, employment and health. A progressive government must advance constitutional recognition, including an official voice for Indigenous people while breathing life into Closing the Gap. And I would argue Australia Day should be used as a tool for anchoring that national effort, rather than being set up as a problem to be solved. That’s because like the majority of Australians I believe that Australia Day can (and should) be made more inclusive. Unlike statues, national days are not set in stone. I’m old enough to remember the 1980s and the way that Anzac Day was actually a day that highlighted the futility of war and questioned the need to bear arms. It wasn’t until John Howard came along and developed his set of counter-cultural myths that it became more of a celebration of armed conflict. To be fair, I believe that Australia Day has been undergoing a process of reinvention in recent years. The choice of recent Australians of the Year like Rosie Batty and Adam Goodes has celebrated those who challenge the status quo and speak up for those less powerful. Using this day to mark a treaty with our first peoples would be the next logical development. The national attention at the end of January that Australia Day creates is the perfect time for retelling the story of our nation, confronting hard truths of invasion and dispossession, writing an honest national story that reconciles our past with our future. But if we spend our time campaigning to Change the Date we do nothing to advance that project, in fact we make it harder.

It is of course the hope. As Marcus Rashford turned and spanked a low shot into the corner to put England 2-1 up, the Wembley crowd leapt and roared and basked in a moment of class from a wonderful attacking talent who had struggled initially here but improved significantly with a switch up front. For all the angst of the past few days, England have now all but killed off a mediocre World Cup qualifying group. A Russian summer looms. Gareth Southgate can begin scouting overpriced, over-thought-out training complexes in which England can stage their round-table symposia with leading corporate thinkfluencers, their team‑bonding primal scream sessions. And English football can look forward to nine months of worrying about injuries, team selections, the hand gestures of Dele Alli and the full range of pre‑tournament ritual. In the build-up to this game the Wembley crowd itself had been the subject of much discussion. After the travails of Malta, Southgate had called on England’s fans to create a furiously intimidating cauldron of hate. Presumably he has not been here much recently. Wembley can be noisy for Cup semis and finals. When it comes to England, with the heavy corporate presence, the deathly thunk of the band, the air of a slightly wan, end-of-tour Cliff Richard concert, well, perhaps not so much. Wembley had been a half-cocked thing at kick-off, with a scattering of red plastic seats in almost every section. The official crowd was 67,823, a low turnout for a qualifier. And at times, as the two teams fell back into a massed joust around the halfway line, Wembley was almost silent beneath the parpings of the brass section. This did at least represent progress. In the opening half-hour the stadium had been noisily misaligned as the narrow tranche of away fans twirled their shirts and scarves, buoyed by Stanislav Lobotka’s opening goal and by the craft of the Slovakia players up against the carved stone Easter Island heads selected to man England’s midfield. Slovakia’s third-minute goal was well worked. Rashford tried to dribble away from his own area, but was robbed. Adam Nemec played a lovely pass between two flat-footed defenders. Lobotka finished easily as Joe Hart produced his starfish-pose too early and without conviction, a supermarket own‑brand Peter Schmeichel. After which Wembley became a painful, sullen, lost-feeling place. For long periods England’s hulking midfield and central defence ranged themselves around the centre circle like a white-shirted Stonehenge, the ball rebounding pointlessly among them like a paper bag blown by the wind. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain sprinted 20 yards and punted the ball high over the posts and crossbar, a tribute perhaps to the All Blacks, whose “winning culture” has been one of the lecture subjects favoured by England’s hodgepodge of blue-sky thinkers over the past few months. Steadily though the game began to turn, and credit to Southgate’s men for that. It is important to point out England’s players were not overawed here, or particularly below-par. They tried hard in that opening period. The fact is, they are just not that good. Or rather they are talented and young, but not so good they can turn up and expect a team as competent and motivated as Slovakia to be brushed aside with ease. This seems an important point; and one still short of making its way into every corner of the English footballing delusion. As England settled Eric Dier produced a neat equaliser late in the first half. Rashford and Alli began to enjoy each other’s company. The winning goal was deserved, victory greeted with warm, conciliatory applause from a crowd seduced by the energy of the second half, and by a winning moment of incision. Rashford had started for England for the first time in place of Raheem Sterling. It looked a sensible move at kick-off, and by the end the most significant event of this narrow victory. At times Rashford has something princely about him, offering not just goals and pace but an ability to take the ball with his head up, a feeling of a player stretching out into the far reaches of his talent. The attackers he admires most are Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo, the elite inside-forwards of European club football, those who play right across the frontline. And in Rashford, Alli and Harry Kane England do have a frontline with talent and mobility, a peg on which to hang the slightly bruised hopes that will wax in the shadows for the next nine months. As ever, a reckoning up will come. But this was for now a moment, if not to dream; then to slip into an uneasy reverie at the best parts of another oddly fraught, oddly frictionless qualification."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/04/chris-froome-vuelta-a-espana-time-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-04T21:51:47Z","webTitle":"Chris Froome can take decisive step towards Vuelta victory in time trial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/04/chris-froome-vuelta-a-espana-time-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/04/chris-froome-vuelta-a-espana-time-trial","fields":{"headline":"Chris Froome can take decisive step towards Vuelta victory in time trial","bodyText":"The old saw has it that one can lose a stage race on any day but one can win it only on certain selected stages. The time trial on Tuesday at Logroño in northern Spain is one of the latter as far as Chris Froome is concerned in this year’s Vuelta a España, especially given his recent record in the discipline compared with those of his remaining rivals for the red leader’s jersey. Having won a time trial in last year’s Tour de France and come a close second in one this year, over the 40 relatively flat kilometres at Logroño, Froome can hope to carve out a decisive advantage to serve as a buffer through the four mountain stages that will take the race to its decisive point at the summit of the Alto de l’Angliru on Saturday afternoon. It could prove a vital staging post in his quest to become the first Briton to win the Tour of Spain and the first man to win the Tour de France and Vuelta in the same year since Bernard Hinault in 1978. Froome’s closest rival, Vincenzo Nibali, who lies 1min 1sec behind, can produce a more than respectable time trial on occasion – as he most notably did en route to victory in the 2013 Giro d’Italia – although he has rarely managed to do so in the three years since he won the 2014 Tour de France. Froome, on the other hand, has time trialled consistently at the highest level since making his breakthrough during the 2011 Vuelta, where he defied the odds to overcome his nominal leader of the time, Bradley Wiggins, against the watch. Of the danger men in the overall standings below Froome, the Italian is the only one who has managed to come through the many early mountain stages within reach of the Team Sky No1. His persistent attempts to dislodge the race leader have come to nought in the face of Sky’s collective strength and, if Froome gains as little as a minute on him on Tuesday, that will finally give him and his Sky team-mates room to breathe. Four more riders are grouped within three minutes: Russia’s Ilnur Zakarin, Wilco Kelderman, Esteban Chaves and Miguel Ángel López. But while López and Zakarin have looked the freshest in the weekend’s mountain stages – and Froome admitted on Monday that he would now have to take the Colombian Lopez into account – only the Russian has a time-trial pedigree as his country’s current national champion. “We start on a race track. Once we get out on to the road it’s just a straight long road,” Froome said of Tuesday’s test. “[It’s] 20km going up in steps and then pretty much 20km going down in steps. It’s fast. It’s very much a power time trial course. It’s not super technical. There’s quite a few time triallists here to contend with. Zakarin looks in very good shape [and] Kelderman [and] Alberto Contador have done some very decent time trials this year.” Froome acknowledged that in a tough final week, and with yet another summit finish on Wednesday at Los Machucos, there will be an element of calculation involved in Tuesday’s stage, and indeed with all the others up to Saturday. “Whoever leaves absolutely everything out there in the time trial will pay for it the day after on Los Machucos,” he said. “That’s not as long as [the] Angliru but the gradients are up there. There are pitches of over 20%. Every day has to be ridden thinking about what is coming up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/05/brexit-bill-government-negotiations-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T05:00:33Z","webTitle":"The Brexit bill is cataclysmic.

Only a swerve will save us","bodyText":"Today parliament returns, led by the most dangerously incompetent and decadent government in modern times. This parliament will seal the country’s fate permanently and, on current form, fatally: nothing in the conduct of Brexit suggests any understanding of the cataclysm ahead. Instead the summer has seen only callow jockeying for position between would-be Tory leaders of unbelievable unsuitability. Their frivolity was summed up by David Davis dismissing EU negotiator Michel Barnier as “silly”. But silliness is now Britain’s official position. Those who holidayed in the EU this summer will have met that amazement from taxi drivers, bartenders, students and old-timers alike: they think we are mad. And so we are. What else can they make of a country with Boris Johnson as foreign secretary? According to Sunday’s Survation poll, he is favourite to take over from Theresa May, with Jacob Rees-Mogg in second place. As if despairing of politics, many voters seem to prefer any alternative reality to the one we face. In just a year the deal must be done, in time to be ratified by the 27 nations by March 2019. Our government has approached it like a bunch of England football fans, shouting: “Who won the war?” Supposedly sober politicians boast loudly that they need us more than we need them: “We hold all the cards!” Those with delusions about Britain’s importance should note that in Sunday’s election debate between Angela Merkel and Martin Schultz, Brexit was not mentioned once. The EU faces many crises – migration flows across the Mediterranean, Ukraine at war with Russia, Donald Trump and North Korea – and the relentless burning and flooding of our planet. Of course, they’d like Brexit resolved painlessly, but frankly they’re not that bothered. Some are bemused: Germany’s ambassador to France pondered at a public meeting last week: “I am waiting for the big free-trade deals that a small island can conclude to its benefit with the rest of the world.” Every meeting between our beseeching ministers and potential trading partners in Japan, India or the United States leaves us asking that same question. Why can’t Barnier be more “flexible” and “imaginative”, David Davis asks, revealing he hasn’t grasped the basics. The memorandum signed by both sides at the outset clearly spelled out the EU 27’s overriding goal: “European integration has brought peace and prosperity to Europe and allowed for an unprecedented level and scope of cooperation on matters of common interest in a rapidly changing world. Therefore, the Union’s overall objective in these negotiations will be to preserve its interests, those of its citizens, its businesses and its Member States.” That’s it. Protecting the EU and its hard-won single market and customs union matters more than any British deal. That means no unpicking, no bending the rules, no “imagination”: it’s our choice to stay or leave. The UK’s realm of fantasy unravels embarrassingly fast. Only two weeks ago one policy paper proposed an “innovative” and “unprecedented” system to abolish customs checks by electronically tagging goods, cleverly passing on any dues to the EU. It was pure magic, as the EU protested. Only a fortnight later Davis had to take it off the table because no one has invented it: “It was a blue sky idea”, he said with that jovial nonchalance whose charm is fast wearing thin. The result? If we leave the customs union and single market, it’s a hard border, he admitted, with all goods checked and declared. For Northern Ireland, that’s a disaster – with no ingenious way round it, none at all: all the border constituencies are Sinn Féin seats, now facing hard border posts. Brexiters have a habit of brushing away such impossibilities as mere flies in their ointment, but there is no ointment, only flies. I have interviewed those in an overstretched border force who say already they often abandon customs posts to cope with passport queues: will it take gridlock on both sides of the Channel before Brexit doubts penetrate? Or Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary proving right, that EU flights will stop? Not a week goes by without some new sign of imminent Brexit-caused decline. The tumbril bearing the EU withdrawal bill rolls in for its second reading on Thursday. Dominic Grieve, the most influential Tory objector, writing in yesterday’s FT, warns of the bill’s draconian Henry VIII powers: “The electorate did not vote to ‘take back control’ to see our domestic constitution dismantled.” Vital amendments will be put, but experience warns that Tory rebellions have a habit of much bark and little bite. Labour MPs still pinch themselves at finding they are the parliamentary grownups now, watching an infantile government throw the nation’s toys out of its pram. How did it happen that the most radical Labour opposition in years is the sober-sided sensibles, the only hope for rescuing the country? Keir Starmer has steered the party adroitly towards staying in the single market and the customs union during a lengthy “transition”: that’s the place to be when no one can say in this wildly volatile political climate who will be in power, or what the country needs in five years’ time. Astonishingly, the party is growing more united by the week, as Starmer sticks it to Davis today in the Commons, taunting him for his fantasies being forced to give way to brutal reality. What will persuade the people to rethink? Barnier keeps warning that leaving the single market will have “extremely serious consequences”, and he’s right that that they haven’t been explained to those deceived by Brexit delusionists over the decades. But I hear too many remainers itch for disaster. Some yearn for the great “I told you so” vindication as trucks stack a hundred miles up on the M2 and “just-in-time” manufacturing and service industries grind to a halt, with unemployment soaring. Secretly they want dire consequences for all to see, to stop Brexiters claiming for ever more that staying in the single market, customs union and European Economic Area was a betrayal of the people’s will. Never wish for political revenge, however. The great hope must be that we swerve at the last moment and avoid the worst. When countries decline and fail, they don’t turn nicer. We are lucky that no serious demagogue has yet seized the chance of this perilous, fickle mood: so far we are only threatened by a leadership of jokers. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/08/artist-donates-part-of-bp-prize-money-to-greenpeace-in-oil-sponsorship-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T10:00:36Z","webTitle":"Artist donates part of BP prize money to Greenpeace in oil sponsorship protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/08/artist-donates-part-of-bp-prize-money-to-greenpeace-in-oil-sponsorship-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/08/artist-donates-part-of-bp-prize-money-to-greenpeace-in-oil-sponsorship-protest","fields":{"headline":"Artist donates part of BP prize money to Greenpeace in oil sponsorship protest","bodyText":"A painter who won a prestigious British portrait award sponsored by BP has donated part of his winnings to Greenpeace in protest at his art being used to promote the image of the multinational oil company. Henry Christian-Slane, an artist from New Zealand, won the BP young artist award at the National Portrait Gallery for a painting of his partner Gabi. The high profile prize, which was chosen out of 2,580 entries, came with £7,000 prize money, which was presented by BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley. Christian-Slane, 26, said he was happy to receive the accolade but was not comfortable “about being part of BP’s PR strategy”. He said as a “symbolic act” of defiance he was donating £1,000 of the prize-money to Greenpeace projects that directly protested against BP’s extraction of fossil fuels from the ground. “I hope this action will help keep the issue of BP’s role in climate change from being overshadowed by their contribution to the arts,” he said. “I was very uncomfortable with the idea that the portrait award was being used to improve BPs image. Big oil companies like BP have the power to prevent the fossil fuels in the ground from entering the atmosphere as greenhouse gases, and we need to keep pressure on them to accept this responsibility. The individual has a role to play in this.” Greenpeace and the alliance of campaign groups Art Not Oil have long protested against arts institutions accepting sponsorship from the oil giant, and previous protest actions have included climate activists spending 25 hours scrawling messages on the floor of the Tate’s Turbine Hall. Last year it was announced that BP’s sponsorship of the National Portrait Gallery portrait prize would continue for another five years, and the company announced it would invest £7.5m in other major cultural institutions such as the British Museum, Royal Opera House and Royal Shakespeare Company. The deals prompted an open letter of condemnation by figures such as Mark Rylance. Commenting on Christian-Slane’s gesture, Sara Ayech, oil campaigner for Greenpeace UK, thanked the artist for his his principled stand against “art’s co-option by the oil industry.” She added: “Purchasing a dominant position in London’s cultural scene is starting to become a bit of a double-edged sword for BP. As Henry has demonstrated, not everyone can be bought, and while BP are maintaining their brand’s relationship with the city’s elites, they are also providing a platform for the environmental damage they do around the world to be exposed in front of their home audience.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/04/remembering-john-ashbery-poet-professor-bard-college","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T06:00:34Z","webTitle":"Brilliant, irreverent, indefinable: my poetry class with John Ashbery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/04/remembering-john-ashbery-poet-professor-bard-college","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/04/remembering-john-ashbery-poet-professor-bard-college","fields":{"headline":"Brilliant, irreverent, indefinable: my poetry class with John Ashbery","bodyText":"Enigmatic, confounding, genius, funny, unnerving, stunning, gay, mysterious. Poet John Ashbery died this weekend and the descriptions of him and his work are as varied as poetry itself. Reading through these diverse adjectives, I’m left thinking how beautiful it is to not be defined and yet to be so profoundly revered. For Ashbery, poetry is not about definitions or pronouns or intentions or genres. It’s not about telling a story that has a proper conclusion. It’s about what it is to experience – experience anything. His work says you don’t need to decipher the words, just experience them. Is there anything more valuable than that? I first met Professor Ashbery, as I knew him, in the late 90s, when I was at Bard College in New York state, filled with my own hopes of being a poet. I applied to his poetry workshop and I can still remember the shock, the wonder at whether a mistake had been made, when I saw my name on the list of students tacked up to the wall. He was writing and publishing regularly, as he continued to until he peacefully died this past weekend. A few years after our class together, he published one of my favorite poems, Crossroads in the Past: That night the wind stirred in the forsythia bushes, but it was a wrong one, blowing in the wrong direction. That’s silly. How can there be a wrong direction? ‘It bloweth where it listeth,’ as you know, just as we do when we make love or do something else there are no rules for. I tell you, something went wrong there a while back. Just don’t ask me what it was. Pretend I’ve dropped the subject. In that workshop, it was almost as if Ashbery had asked us to drop the subject of his fame, his countless accolades, the Pulitzer Prize, the MacArthur Genius Grant, the art reviews, his time in Warhol’s Factory. With wonderfully irreverent curiosity, he listened and critiqued our work, and, with some of us, spent hours speaking in his home on campus, a place filled with books and with a de Kooning on the wall (the artist had made a piece in honor of what is most often cited as Ashbery’s best work, Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror). He taught me that poetry can be anything and with that comes great freedom. No, now you’ve got me interested, I want to know exactly what seems wrong to you, how something could seem wrong to you. In what way do things get to be wrong? In all our time together, he never gave me the answer to that question, never let me know whether I was wrong. I had unknowingly followed in his footsteps, choosing, by pure chance, to translate the poetry of surrealists Rene Char and Blaise Cendrars, just as he had translated French surrealists. Never once did he say my translations were wrong. I am sure the work was close to his heart and perhaps all translation is inherently wrong but I left Bard feeling that it was right-ish. I have since lost all those poems and translations, everything I wrote at Bard and in my classes with Ashbery. And I don’t remember the words. But what remains are his open eyes, his wry smile, a seeming promiscuity in thought and the sense of how blessed we were to be guided by one of the best poets of our time. I’m sitting here dialing my cellphone with one hand, digging at some obscure pebbles with my shovel with the other. And then something like braids will stand out, on horsehair cushions. That armchair is really too lugubrious. We’ve got to change all the furniture, fumigate the house, talk our relationship back to its beginnings. Say, you know that’s probably what’s wrong – the beginnings concept, I mean. I aver there are no beginnings, though there were perhaps some sometime. No beginnings. No end. Just this. Ashbery wrote in another poem for Conjunctions, a publication out of Bard College, “To have been loved once by someone – surely there is a permanent good in that.” Maybe above all else, he was a romantic, in love with life. Two years ago, I went to John’s apartment in Chelsea, New York, where he has lived for decades. I was going to interview him for the Brooklyn Academy of Music about translations he had done of poetry by Rimbaud. David Kermani, his husband, warmly greeted me at the door as if we had been friends, although he had never met me before. And there was John, reclined in a chair, surrounded by stacks of books, the light flooding in on this gorgeous NY winter day. Now a radio journalist, I was keenly aware of the banging of construction somewhere nearby in the building and Ashbery commented on how the building and the neighborhood was changing. He wasn’t upset about the change but was steadfast in the fact that he was there to stay. And magically, when the recording started, the banging stopped. I took it as a sign. We spoke of how he discovered poetry and what had drawn him to translate Rimbaud’s Illuminations. He said, “You have to see the poetry as well as hear it; even the shapes of the letters have something to do with it.” And after reading aloud some of his own translations, he modestly commented: “I wish I could be as sure of my own poetry as I am of these translations.” This was someone whom most of the literary minded world believed to be one of the greatest poets of the 20th century, and he too remained unsure. How wondrously brilliant, to be both unsure and brave, to create work that allows for the incessant contradictions of life and all that it beholds and to remind the reader, in the way in which you write, to not try to figure it all out, it’s life, moment by moment, experience by experience. It’s just life, it’s just poetry, everything and nothing. We’d stopped, to look at the poster the movie theater had placed freestanding on the sidewalk. The lobby cards drew us in. It was afternoon, we found ourselves sitting at the end of a row in the balcony; the theater was unexpectedly crowded. That was the day we first realized we didn’t fully know our names, yours or mine, and we left quietly amid the gray snow falling. Twilight had already set in.

Speaking on a visit to London, Rinkēvičs said there was increasing evidence that Russia was automating disinformation on social media. Pointing to new Nato-sponsored research showing more than five times the number of Russian language tweets sent in Latvia concerning Nato came from bots, instead of from individuals. The figure in Estonia was nine times as many. He described the tactic as ”very systematic and a new way to spread propaganda amongst young people”. He urged US Congress to press ahead with its inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 US election, saying “it is essential for all US allies to understand the mechanics of how you combine cyber attack and then use it as [an] information weapon to influence people’s opinions”. Rinkēvičs said: “If you have hacking, fake news with a purpose, it is very difficult to react. We can find out what happened, but it is very difficult to prove. The whole law in this area needs addressing.”Rinkēvičs was attending a new joint Nordic-Baltic-UK forum of eight foreign ministers in London that was convened by the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, the first such meeting to be held at foreign ministers level. He denied the meeting was designed to coordinate Brexit strategy among nations historically sympathetic to Britain, saying the EU negotiating position remained united. He said he would like to see the UK remain involved in EU foreign and defence policy after Brexit, but said the precise mechanism remained to be discussed. Johnson stressed Britain’s continuing role in Nato, as well as its leading military role sending 800 troops to lead a battlegroup in Estonia designed to deter Russian aggression in the region. The London meeting comes as a large Russian military exercise on Europe’s eastern flank is about to take place. Russia claims the Zapad 17 exercise will include just over 10,000 troops, with only 3,000 of those entering Belarus to help the Belarus army “quell” an imaginary separatist uprising supported by Nato member countries. Critics claim the exercise is in fact intended to simulate an attempted joint invasion of Poland and Lithuania with the aim of cutting the supply of Nato reinforcements. However, Rinkēvičs claimed the number of Russian troops involved would be closer to 100,000 once all the exercises under way were counted, and said it was likely to feature a “nuclear element”. “We have sufficient reason to believe this exercise will have a nuclear element. Later in September we will see what form, but last time it took the form of a preventative strike,” he said. Part of the preparation involves airlifting missiles to the tactical short range Iskander ballistic missile units."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/04/north-korea-tensions-ripple-through-global-financial-markets","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-04T19:03:40Z","webTitle":"North Korea tensions ripple through global financial markets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/04/north-korea-tensions-ripple-through-global-financial-markets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/04/north-korea-tensions-ripple-through-global-financial-markets","fields":{"headline":"North Korea tensions ripple through global financial markets","bodyText":"Escalating tensions between the US and North Korea have rattled the financial markets as they reopened, as the prospect for nuclear war drove investors into safe haven assets.

Naeem Asla, of Think Markets – a spreadbetting firm, said the troubles in Pyongyang did “not present a stable environment for investing”.

They are there, along with other visitors and trained facilitators, to experience and engage in group therapy over a “four-day intensive” with prisoners serving long sentences for violent and/or gang-related crime. Their interactions, conclusions and traumas are all chronicled in a new documentary called The Work, directed by Jairus McLeary and Gethin Aldous. For 17 years, New Folsom prison has shown the insight and intelligence to allow extraordinary therapeutic work to flourish within its walls. Like my experience in the UK of developing a new kind of therapy for violent and often gang-affiliated prisoners – on which I drew for my script for the 2013 David Mackenzie film Starred Up – it is dependent on creating very high levels of trust with people conditioned by betrayal from early childhood. We are told in an early title card that prisoners on the programme “agree to leave gang politics at the door, setting aside the racial segregation of the yard”. This bland statement belies the magnitude of the achievement shown in The Work. Some 50 or so long-term, maximum-security prisoners, a good many of whom might never be getting out and so have little to stop them, in a judicial sense, from acting violently, come together with no prison guards in a packed room for four days with unprotected outsiders. Instead of eating the volunteers alive, the prisoners deal with them in such a skilled, empathic and therapeutic way that each visitor appears to go through something not only healing, but also potentially life-changing. This is prison therapy of the most valuable kind, where the fruits of the internal work done by the prisoners are clearly visible in the way they reach out so adeptly and compassionately to help others. As one facilitator puts it: “This whole process of going down into the wound is not an end in itself. We’re looking for something – and we’re bringing something back out of that descent.” With no intrusion from a voiceover or from talking heads, the film-makers allow the audience to feel the power as the journeys unfold, as if we’re in the circle with everyone else. The visitors don’t know exactly what they are letting themselves in for and Brian, the teaching assistant, is initially sceptical: “I’m having, let’s say, an impossible time not judging what the fuck’s going on ...” To start with, I struggled with the therapy-programme CEO’s chanting at the opening session, with all the participants obediently responding on cue. It felt more like something you would find in a cult rather than a psychotherapeutic programme. But then the programme’s co-founder, an ex-convict called Rob, placed things in a context I could understand: “I have no idea what it’s going to look like. I would be lying if I said I did. All I know is that there are a bunch of really intense, dedicated, committed men sitting in this circle, who are willing to go anywhere with you, however you need to go, in whatever way that looks like.” Within male prison culture, the antidote to being shamed, humiliated or disrespected is to become violent, replacing the feeling of vulnerable exposure with one of apparent force and potency. In a pivotal moment, one of the facilitators – Bharataji – describes how as a teenager he confided in a trusted male role model about a significant sexual experience. The teenage Bharataji felt that what he had shared was “sacred” and “safe”, but the role model told everybody, and when Bharataji spoke to him, the man insulted him and dismissed his feelings as worthless. In a way that parallels the role model’s betrayal – taking advantage of the vulnerability Bharataji has shown in sharing – Brian delivers a cruel, knee-jerk response. Bharataji understandably responds in a way that could be seen as violent, albeit in an emotional, not physical, way: he castratingly calls Brian a “bitch”. Brian reacts. But the rest of the group, including Brian’s two guides – Vegas, a former Bloods boss, and a remarkable partner guide whose name we’re not given – maintain their focused presence. The only way you can achieve this in the heat of the moment is by having gone down deep into your own wound, found something, and brought it back.

It has never seemed so before, but judging by the reaction to the department store’s announcement last week that its own-brand children’s clothes will no longer be divided by gender, some people clearly see the retailer as radical. There will now be no separate sections in the stores, nor such binary labels on the clothes themselves; instead, the labels will read “girls and boys” or “boys and girls”. The conversation over whether clothing should be more gender-neutral does not just apply to childrenswear – over the past decade there has also been a marked rise in gender-neutral clothing for adults. Some high-end designers such as JW Anderson, Rick Owens and Rad Hourani have championed gender-neutral clothing, while a raft of smaller companies run by young designers, such as Rich Mnisi, are pushing the idea that men’s and women’s clothes should be obsolete categories. This approach has also filtered down to the high street – H&amp;M and Zara have both created non-gendered ranges. The British designer Katharine Hamnett has a long history of exploring non-gender-specific clothing, and her newly reissued collection features unisex shirts, sweatshirts and silk all-in-one suits. She says that, in the past, when women stepped on to more traditionally male sartorial territory – wearing military-inspired clothing, for instance – this “was about appropriating male power”. Now, she says, a move towards equality means women “may be feeling more comfortable with themselves”; in other words, they may have the freedom to wear what they like. (It is still far less common for men to seek out traditionally female clothing.) Chloe Crowe, brand manager for Bethnals, a London-based unisex denim brand, says that when they have run pop-up shops, men and women in couples have come in and bought jeans that they can share. The company was launched in 2014 by Melissa Clement, a former senior denim buyer for Topshop, who borrowed her partner’s clothes a lot and wondered why men’s and women’s categories had to be different. The core styles of her brand – skinny, straight and relaxed – are cut the same for men and women. “It’s just clever pattern cutting,” says Crowe. “With denim, it can vary so much depending on your body shape. One woman is not going to [fit in] the same pair of jeans as another woman. I think it makes things a lot more simplistic, and it’s about the style and design rather than your sex.” The growth of the brand follows more awareness and discussion around gender fluidity and what it means to reject the male/female binary. A study for the Fawcett Society last year found that 68% of young people believe gender is non-binary. “When Bethnals lauched, there wasn’t a lot [about gender],” says Crowe. “More brands have released gender-neutral clothing. It has filtered its way to the mass market. There seems to be a huge demand for it.” “You don’t look at food and say it’s going to be eaten by a man or a woman, so why should it be any different for clothes?” says Tanmay Saxena, founder and designer of LaneFortyfive. The clothing Saxena designs is mostly bespoke tailoring, including shirts and waistcoats; about 60% of his customers are women. The clothes are the same styles for men and women, in the same fabrics, and while the shirts and smocks are cut the same, only the fit for trousers is slightly different. He has been working on the label for about three years, but formally launched it last year. “I couldn’t find clothes that suited my own style. The basic idea was I would make something that I can wear but at the same time, it has to be irrespective of gender. That idea was always in my head.” The shirt company GFW Clothing – GFW stands for Gender Free World – has three fits, designed to fit different bodies rather than the broad terms “men” or “women”. Lisa Honan co-founded the brand online less than two years ago and opened a shop in Hove earlier this year. Initially, she says, it was borne out of frustration at not being able to find shirts she liked. “I’d look in the men’s aisle and see great patterns and short-sleeved shirts, and then you’d go to the women’s aisle and they were blousy, they’ve got puffs or are lacy.” The men’s shirts, she says, didn’t fit her “because I’ve got a woman’s body. It got me thinking why is [there] a man’s aisle and a woman’s aisle, and why do you have to make that choice? You’re not able to make many purchases without being forced to define your own gender.” Will we ever get to the point where we don’t have men’s and women’s sections in shops? “I would love that,” says Honan. “It’s about expressing your style and being able to choose what you want without having to be told that, because of your sexual characteristics, you have to shop in a certain way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/06/victoria-police-should-record-perceived-ethnicity-of-everyone-they-stop-says-legal-rights-group","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T02:36:37Z","webTitle":"Victoria police should record perceived ethnicity of everyone they stop, says legal rights group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/06/victoria-police-should-record-perceived-ethnicity-of-everyone-they-stop-says-legal-rights-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/06/victoria-police-should-record-perceived-ethnicity-of-everyone-they-stop-says-legal-rights-group","fields":{"headline":"Victoria police should record perceived ethnicity of everyone they stop, says legal rights group","bodyText":"Victoria police officers should be made to record the perceived ethnicity of every person they stop in order to tackle the force’s racial profiling problem, a report commissioned by a legal rights group says. “Racial profiling is a form of biased and discriminatory policing, and its implications and impacts of racial profiling are profound,” the report, compiled by a coalition of academic experts known as the Police Stop Data Working Group, states. “It is a key factor in the creation and perpetuation of a racial underclass and entrenching racial stratification in society ... unnecessary police contact undermines public support for police and undermines voluntary compliance.” Race tensions have been exacerbated in Victoria with much of the state’s media coverage of crime focussing on Melbourne’s so-called “Apex gang”, which some news organisations have wrongly described as being comprised of largely African youth. Police crime data released in April showed Sudanese-born offenders committed 4.8% of the aggravated burglaries in the state and that these crimes were increasing, but were still second to Australian-born offenders, who committed nearly 80% of such crimes. Dr Clare Land, a sociologist and race relations expert, said court proceedings had shown Victoria police stopped young African men at more than two-and-a-half times the rate that they stopped their white counterparts. In 2015, Victoria police became the first police force in Australia to explicitly define and prohibit racial profiling and identify it as a form of discrimination. But solicitor Tamar Hopkins, lead author of the Police Stop Data Working Group report commissioned by the Flemington &amp; Kensington Community Legal Centre, said the police force needed to do more to reinforce its own policy. Police do not fill out a field contact report every time they stop someone. They are required to complete a form only if the circumstances appear suspicious, or if their contact with a person is a result of a specifically identified situation. “We want police to start filling out these forms every time they stop someone for any reason,” Hopkins told Guardian Australia. “The information on that form is related to why they stopped that person, the basis the date the time, where it happened, and the perceived ethnicity of that person. But police have the option of recording perceived ethnicity, and we’re saying that now needs to be made mandatory. We don’t want police to ask the person their ethnicity, we want them to record their perception so that we can identify if police are responding to appearances and stereotypes.” Hopkins and the Police Stop Data Working Group also want the information recorded on these forms de-identified and made public. Melbourne youth worker Barry Berih described to the Police Stop Data Working Group how he had been repeatedly stopped by police because of, he believes, his appearance. “On one occasion four police stopped me in my car on my way to work and said it was a routine check,” Berih, who was born in Australia, said. His family is from Eritrea in north-east Africa. “After breathalysing me, searching my car and disposing of medication I had in the glove box, they continued on without explanation,” he said. “This weekend police stopped me when they saw me leave my house and get into my car in North Melbourne and again asked for my ID. When I asked why, they said it was because my car ‘could be stolen’. They also made my friends in the car provide identification, even though they weren’t doing anything. Just for sitting in my car. “I have been stopped so many times by police who say they are checking me to make sure that my car is not stolen that now I think I will just stop driving.” Guardian Australia has contacted Victoria police for comment on the report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/06/liddell-power-station-could-be-bought-by-delta-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T02:52:01Z","webTitle":"Liddell power station could be bought by Delta Electricity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/06/liddell-power-station-could-be-bought-by-delta-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/06/liddell-power-station-could-be-bought-by-delta-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Liddell power station could be bought by Delta Electricity","bodyText":"Delta Electricity, a company headed by the coal barons Trevor St Baker and Brian Flannery, has expressed an early interest in purchasing the Liddell power station. But Delta’s company secretary, Steve Gurney, has told Guardian Australia it is currently unclear whether the purchase is viable without “some sort of cash injection”. “Would we be interested? I think our position is ‘Yeah, we’d have a look at it’ but that’s as far as we would go at the moment,” Gurney said. “It’s very, very early days. We’re looking at other things as well, so it might be at the end of the day that our money is better put into other projects we’re working on.” St Baker and Flannery have previously bought struggling coal stations for low prices, in an attempt to turn them around. In 2015, the pair bought Vales Point, one of New South Wales’s largest coal-fired power stations, for the sum of $1m. Gurney said Delta had been in conversations with the federal government but those discussions were more general in nature, concerning long-term energy supply in Australia. He could not categorically say whether or not Liddell had been discussed. “There is interest at the moment but we are a long way from saying we are definitely interested … there would be a whole due diligence process just to understand the issues,” he said. Delta later issued a statement saying it had not been approached by the government over Liddell but was interested in a due diligence process to consider the purchase. The government is attempting to negotiate with owner AGL to extend the life of Liddell, Australia’s oldest coal power plant, beyond its slated 2022 closure. Malcolm Turnbull wants the plant to stay open for another five years but that idea was very publicly shot down by the AGL chief executive, Andy Vesey, on Tuesday. Origin Energy, one of Australia’s biggest power companies, ruled out buying the Liddell plant on Wednesday. “Origin has already announced plans to close our only coal-fired power station, Eraring, by early 2030s and is not looking to buy any new coal plant,” a spokeswoman said. The tussle between AGL and the Coalition continued on Wednesday. The government suggested that AGL had privately expressed a willingness to sell the plant. Josh Frydenberg, the energy minister, said AGL had made it “clear to us” that he’s prepared to sell to “a responsible party”. “That’s why we’ll have discussions with them on Monday and no doubt those discussions will be ongoing, because what we want to see is reliable and affordable power,” Frydenberg said. A spokesman for Frydenberg later said it was too early to consider potential buyers for Liddell. “We have only just started discussions with AGL following a report we got from Aemo [the Australian energy market operator] on Monday night,” he said. AGL issued a statement on Wednesday morning saying it had made “no commitment to sell the Liddell power station nor to extend its life beyond 2022”. “AGL will continue to engage with governments, regulators and other stakeholders to deliver appropriate outcomes but notes that the company has made no commitment to sell the Liddell power station nor to extend its life beyond 2022,” the company said. On Tuesday, Vesey took to Twitter to rule out extending the life of Liddell beyond 2022 and declare “we’re getting out of coal”. That prompted the former resources minister Matt Canavan to describe Vesey as “the biggest hypocrite walking around Australia”. Canavan said AGL was the country’s biggest producer of coal-fired power. “AGL should be operating with a modicum of the national interest in mind, not just trying to maximise their profits,” Canavan said. “If Andy Vesey wants to ease his moral guilt about producing coal, he’s welcomed to sell coal-fired power stations at book value – indeed I was talking to some investors tonight who would happily buy his whole coal-fired power fleet at book value,” he said. Canavan’s interjection came as the federal government entered negotiations with AGL, in an attempt to keep Liddell open. Frydenberg was asked whether Canavan’s remarks were helpful. Frydenberg described Canavan as a good friend and a good colleague. “He’s making the obvious point, which is that AGL still has a number of coal-fired assets that they own, and that this decision to close Liddell in 2022 will, according to Aemo, have an implication for the stability of the energy system,” Frydenberg said. “That’s why the prime minister, whose first responsibility is to Australian families and Australian businesses, has reached out to AGL to have discussions about them about keeping that power plant going for at least another five years.” Frydenberg said the costs of delivering stability to the energy market would also be borne by consumers. In a report released on Tuesday Aemo found the risk of electricity supply failing to meet demand drops in scenarios where more renewable energy is driven online by state-based renewable energy targets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/05/george-kruis-ben-teo-injuries-england-selection","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T21:18:29Z","webTitle":"Expected early returns for George Kruis and Ben Te’o ease England’s worries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/05/george-kruis-ben-teo-injuries-england-selection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/05/george-kruis-ben-teo-injuries-england-selection","fields":{"headline":"Expected early returns for George Kruis and Ben Te’o ease England’s worries","bodyText":"Eddie Jones has been spared an early-season headache with George Kruis and Ben Te’o set to return from injuries suffered on the Premiership’s opening weekend earlier than expected and in good time for England’s autumn internationals. It had been feared that Kruis would require ankle surgery for the second time in 12 months after he lasted only 15 minutes of Saracens’ thumping win over Northampton at Twickenham. The 27-year-old lock is due to see a specialist later this week but the initial scan suggests he will return in a matter of weeks. “It has been described to me as a bad yank to the ankle. It doesn’t look like it’s going to be overly serious. So that’s hopefully good news,” said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall. “It’s going to be weeks rather than anything longer. The good news is that it’s very early in the season and he’ll be back in time to play some big games for us before the autumn internationals.” Te’o, meanwhile, was taken off after 27 minutes of Worcester’s heavy defeat at Newcastle with an arm injury last Friday. He too was due to have a scan amid fears from the Warriors director of rugby, Gary Gold, that he had suffered damage to a plate in his arm. Worcester have confirmed however that Te’o is fine to return to training this week in preparation for Sunday’s visit of Wasps. Kruis’s latest knock comes after he missed the Six Nations following knee surgery, having already been sidelined during last season’s autumn campaign with an ankle problem. In between he suffered a broken cheekbone but he recovered from his knee injury to earn selection on the British &amp; Irish Lions tour and start the first Test against New Zealand. As with Te’o, however, he was dropped from the starting XV for the second two Tests. “We haven’t talked about it a lot. I just think the fact that he forced himself on to the tour with his performances at the end of the season, given all the challenges he had last year, tells you a lot,” added McCall. “George is just like the rest of our Lions players. He’s desperate to get better, George is in a competitive area in England, there are some very good second rows in the country. But George is keen to push on and prove himself.” While Kruis will miss out against Bath on Saturday, McCall also revealed that more of his Lions contingent will return. Owen Farrell, Mako Vunipola, Jamie George and Liam Williams were rested against Northampton but all four are due to play either at the Rec or the following weekend when Saracens take on Newcastle in Philadelphia. That is also expected to be where Billy Vunipola makes a return from the shoulder injury that ruled him out of the Lions tour. McCall suggested the No8 may even feature against Bath but that a return in the US was more likely. “They’re champing at the bit. We’ll probably bring a few more back in, one way or another, this weekend, and maybe a couple the weekend after,” he said. “It’s a brilliant thing for the club that we have players who want to play, and they’re not coming back looking to be rested. That doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t look after them. But I’d rather have it this way.” Along with Kruis, Maro Itoje also started on Saturday, but in the back row because Michael Rhodes was not ready to play from the off and Calum Clark was out with a calf injury. When Kruis went off at Twickenham, however, Itoje stayed at flanker with the 19-year-old Nick Isiekwe, a lock with a burgeoning reputation after making his England debut in Argentina, stepping into the second row. Saturday’s match is likely to come too soon for the Australian lock Will Skelton, who suffered a broken arm in pre-season, but McCall has no concerns over starting Isiekwe against Bath.“I thought Nick did a great job last weekend. I’m chuffed with his progress. He did a very good job off the bench for 65 minutes. He’s improving all the time,” added McCall. “His game understanding is good but as a 19-year-old you have to get better at mauling, better at defensive mauls. Just things that come with experience and time. But he’s pretty good at a lot of those things.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/05/coastguard-rescues-13-people-trapped-in-weymouth-tower","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T22:10:59Z","webTitle":"Coastguard rescues 13 people trapped in Weymouth tower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/05/coastguard-rescues-13-people-trapped-in-weymouth-tower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/05/coastguard-rescues-13-people-trapped-in-weymouth-tower","fields":{"headline":"Coastguard rescues 13 people trapped in Weymouth tower","bodyText":"Thirteen people have been rescued after they became trapped in the gondola of the Jurassic Skyline tower in Weymouth.

The failure of the Home Office to release the long overdue report by Dame Elish Angiolini into such deaths is appalling. According to the justice charity Inquest, since 1990 there have been 1,061 deaths in custody with barely a handful of prosecutions of any police officers involved. (I have supported a number of families in their quests to find answers). Needless to say there have also been no convictions of a police officer implicated in these deaths, even though several inquest juries have delivered verdicts of unlawful killing. The still unpublished report, which the Guardian has seen, says that there is “evidence of disproportionate deaths of black and minority ethnic people in restraint-related deaths.” And according to a statement from Inquest: “Black people are disproportionately more likely to die following the use of force by police.” Had the Angiolini report been published in the summer of 2016 – as promised by the then home secretary, Theresa May – and its recommendations acted upon, there is a possibility that lessons would have been learned that would have made deaths like that of Rashan Charles last July – while being apprehended by police – less likely: video footage shows the 20-year-old being wrestled heavily to the ground by a uniformed officer. We will never know, sadly, but what we do know is that since May left the Home Office there has been a change in position. Rather than seeking to hold the police to account, the Home Office now appears to be giving ever more support to whatever the police wish to do, particularly with the black community. It was only last month that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, backed the Met police’s increase in stop-and-searches on young black youths. For those of us who have been engaging with such issues for a long time, we know that this will not lead to less knife crime. More unnecessary stop-and-searches will only lead to a further loss of confidence in the police from the black community. The same goes for the failure to release the Angiolini report. It really is no surprise that relationships between the police and black communities across the country are at an all-time low. Black people are at least four times more likely than white people to be stop-and-searched; twice as likely to be Tasered; twice as likely to be arrested and charged; more likely to be convicted and to receive longer custodial sentences. Black people are even more likely, especially black women, to have the “spit hood” used on them by police. The home secretary should be holding the police to account instead of covering their backs by not releasing this critical report. Families who lost loved ones at the hands of the police may not have received what they considered to be justice through the courts, but they would want to know that there has at least been some institutional learning from their losses – that this won’t happen to anyone else again. Rudd’s reluctance to give them that meagre sense of justice is truly baffling – and while she sits on this report, the likelihood that someone else will die in police custody increases. Should this happen then the blood trail will lead all the way up to the Home Office, and the home secretary herself. • Stafford Scott was a co-founder of the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign in 1985, and is now a consultant on racial equality and community engagement"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/09/no-fascist-usa-how-hardcore-punk-fuels-the-antifa-movement","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"'No Fascist USA!': how hardcore punk fuels the Antifa movement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/09/no-fascist-usa-how-hardcore-punk-fuels-the-antifa-movement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/09/no-fascist-usa-how-hardcore-punk-fuels-the-antifa-movement","fields":{"headline":"'No Fascist USA!': how hardcore punk fuels the Antifa movement","bodyText":"“No Trump! No KKK! No Fascist USA!” When Green Day chanted the repurposed lyrics from Texan punk trailblazers MDC’s 1981 song Born to Die during the 2016 American Music Awards, it gave the burgeoning anti-Trump, anti-fascist movement the slogan it needed – and it would soon appear on placards, T-shirts and be chanted by protesters in their thousands in months to come. It was a tiny piece of punk history writ large on American cultural life – but it only gave the merest hint of US hardcore punk’s influence on the current political landscape. As political commentators struggle to nail down the exact nature of Antifa’s masked legions, they’ve overlooked one thing: Antifa has been critically influenced by hardcore punk for nearly four decades.From the collectivist principles of anarchist punk bands such as Crass and Conflict, the political outrage of groups such as the Dead Kennedys, MDC and Discharge, Antifa draws on decades of protest, self-protection and informal networks under the auspices of a musical movement. Mark Bray, author of The Antifa Handbook, says that “in many cases, the North American modern Antifa movement grew up as a way to defend the punk scene from the neo-Nazi skinhead movement, and the founders of the original Anti-Racist Action network in North America were anti-racist skinheads. The fascist/anti-fascist struggle was essentially a fight for control of the punk scene [during the 1980s], and that was true across of much of north America and in parts of Europe in this era.” “There’s a huge overlap between radical left politics and the punk scene, and there’s a stereotype about dirty anarchists and punks, which is an oversimplification but grounded in a certain amount of truth.” Drawing influence from anti-fascist groups in 1930s Germany, the UK-based Anti-Fascist Action formed in the late 70s in reaction the growing popularity of rightwing political parties such as the National Front and the British Movement. They would shut down extreme-right meetings at every opportunity, whether it be a march or a gathering in a room above a pub. Inspired by this, anti-racist skinheads in Minneapolis formed Anti-Racist Action, which soon gained traction in punk scenes across the US. Meanwhile, in New York, a movement called Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice sprung up. The term “Antifa” was adopted by German antifascists in the 80s, accompanied by the twin-flag logo, which then spread around Europe, and finally pitched up in the US after being adopted by an anarchist collective in Portland, Oregon. For Thomas Barnett, singer with popular hardcore punk band Strike Anywhere, his punk ethics and the direct-action philosophy of Antifa go hand in hand, and, with Trump’s presidency emboldening the extreme right, the stakes couldn’t be higher: “This isn’t just a raft of right-wing ideas – this is actual hate and violence, and the destruction of entire sections of humanity. Of course, I don’t believe in the false equivalence [between Antifa and the alt-right]. I think anti-fascists’ pre-emptive street violence against Nazis is righteous and important.” Many adopt direct-action tactics, whether it be the recent Antifa protests across the US, the black-block tactics employed during the WTO and G7 protests around the world, or even the decision made by Brace Belden to leave California to join the YPG, the far-left Kurdish guerrilla group battling Isis. “Punk itself wasn’t a direct influence on my joining a guerrilla group, of course, but punk did help to cement my radical politics. Being in a community with a certain degree of consciousness and solidarity between people helped immensely in that regard,” says Belden. Bands, record labels, zine writers and venues around the world have co-operated to create a network that exists entirely outside of the mainstream, providing an off-grid template for Antifa activists to draw from. In America, there is Appalachian Terror Unit, a young band with heavy Antifa leanings from the Trump heartland of West Virginia. In Oakland, Antifa-related punk/oi! band Hard Left have taken part in benefit shows for protesters involved in the events at Charlottesville. In Texas, Antifa are organizing community relief efforts for victims of the Houston floods. “There’s definitely an overlap between the leaderless politics and the DIY ethos and the notion that ‘if there’s a problem in our punk scene, we’re not going to be able to count on the mainstream to necessarily give a shit,’” explains Bray. Strike Anywhere singer Barnett says: “It’s also about community self-defence. The punk experience is like the flow of water. You can put up dams, you can run it underground – it will still get through. It also carries on the folk tradition that was speaking truth to power before there was even electric power.” If there was ever a person unafraid to speak truth to power, it would be Jello Biafra, former singer of the Dead Kennedys and the man responsible for their 1981 call-to-arms Nazi Punks Fuck Off. So it might come as a surprise that he is withering in his criticism of Antifa’s actions in recent months. “I’m not down with confronting [the extreme right’s] provocations of violence with actual violence. I mean, self-defence is one thing, but going to a Trumpist rally with the express purpose of beating up fascists – what does that accomplish? Who’s the fascist now? It plays right into their hands,” he says. “More than ever, we have to keep our heads right now. And I am all about freedom of speech, but I think protesting these people non-violently is the way to go, because it lets the targets of the fascist speakers know they’re not alone and lets the fascists who show up know that there’s an awful lot of people who are not down with them, and a chorus of raised middle fingers is better than showing up with some kind of a weapon. Escalating the violence is not the way to go.” With his current band, the Guantanamo School of Medicine, he has updated his 1981 song and called it Nazi Trumps Fuck Off, but it comes with a caveat: Trump is the target, not his supporters. “I usually talk about the song on stage for a while before we play it, pointing out that almost everybody in the audience, especially if we’re playing in Texas or Southern California, know people in their family, close friends, at school or work, whatever, who think that Trump is really cool. And I point out that the last thing we should do is to dismiss these people as rednecks or stupid or ‘I’m not going being your friend anymore, fuck you’ – that’s not going to persuade anybody of anything and it helps Trump divide the country. My point is that you don’t do that, you sit down and talk to somebody, not blog in an echo chamber. It might be stomach-churning, but you might plant a seed, and if someone wakes up three weeks, three months, three years later and thinks, ‘Wow, that person that called me on my bigotry was right.’ All this racist, anti-immigrant fascism isn’t getting us anywhere. I don’t want any part of it anymore.” Author and punk historian Jon Savage, a champion of the Dead Kennedys during his stint as a music journalist in the 70s, isn’t so sure: “It’s very idealistic and very laudable, but it’s like arguing with Brexiters over here (in the UK). You’re not going to get any change out of that. There is a proportion of people who can discuss things in a rational way, but here you’re talking about core beliefs and wishes and feelings, and these are irrational, and they are even less rational when they are tested against reality.” For Savage, Antifa’s direct action tactics are as legitimate a tool as Biafra’s more measured approach: “If you don’t protest the way things are, then nothing is going to change. You’re reacting to fascism and entropy. You need a variety of approaches, and in politics I wouldn’t discount any approach. It’s probably useful to have sensible people because they can say, ‘Well, look what happens when you don’t listen to me and see what the nutters are going to do.’ For Barnett, even the current terminology is under debate. “Calling it ‘Antifa’ is like calling it this weird exotic cult, instead of calling it ‘everyday life’. Every aspect of media coverage of it is insidious, turning public opinion against us, making us a violent spectacle that’s both something terrible and un-American, when this is the fucking Boston Tea Party,” he says. “If people want to talk about how the heritage of American culture and our patriotic destiny fits in [to anti-fascism] – it’s basic math to me, and to many, many others.” Biafra and Strike Anywhere’s Thomas Barnett at least find some accord on the rebranding of the right, however. “You know what they called the alt-right two years ago? Neo-fucking-Nazis!” says Biafra. “Now it’s alt-right, like alt-country or alternative pop music.” Barnett concurs: “They don’t get to be alt-right. They just get to be digital-age Nazis, or white supremacists or terrorists. And that’s what [the media] are doing to anti-fascist action.” Regardless, Barnett says the antifascist movement isn’t taking anything for granted. “These rallies, whatever the next one is, whatever form it takes, are Trojan-horse events to invite and welcome white terrorist groups, and are just platforms for them to go into communities to hurt and intimidate people. And that’s what anti-fascist action has always known, and that’s what the punks have always known.” Or, in the bald terms of someone who put his teenage years in a punk band called Warkrime behind him to go and fight in an actual war, former YPG militia member Belden says: “When I was younger my friends and I used to beat the shit out Nazis that would roll out to punk shows [in California]. And guess what? They’d leave and never come back. Violence works.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/07/from-nrl-premiership-to-souths-exit-door-the-downfall-of-michael-maguire","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T00:38:36Z","webTitle":"From NRL premiership to Souths exit door: the downfall of Michael Maguire | Nick Tedeschi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/07/from-nrl-premiership-to-souths-exit-door-the-downfall-of-michael-maguire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/07/from-nrl-premiership-to-souths-exit-door-the-downfall-of-michael-maguire","fields":{"headline":"From NRL premiership to Souths exit door: the downfall of Michael Maguire","bodyText":"On a chilly October evening less than three years ago, Michael Maguire led South Sydney to their drought-breaking 21st premiership after an agonising wait of 43 years that saw the club mired in mediocrity, devastated financially and thrown out of the league. To all at Redfern, Maguire was a hero, the architect behind the title win most thought would never happen. He galvanised a fanbase behind a team that played hard-nosed aggressive football, the kind of rugby league Souths diehards not only love but breathe. Paper heroes and false dawns came and went. Disappointment became the natural state. Trust was non-existent. Then along came Madge. Souths had started to assemble some talent under Shane Richardson. Jason Taylor and then John Lang had taken the Bunnies from the bottom of the table to being somewhat competitive. But there is no doubt the pursuit and eventual signing of Michael Maguire to coach Souths was the most important moment in Rabbitohs history since their return to the premiership. The importance of the modern coach should not be understated. They are the most important figures at a club and in the game. They define culture, develop talent, recruit, retain, become the voice of the club, set the style … they cast a shadow across the entire game. The Rabbitohs rolled the dice with Maguire. He had an outstanding resumé as an assistant to Craig Bellamy at the Storm and had immediate success with Wigan but he was untried at NRL level. Immediately South Sydney were a force. In his first season, Maguire took Souths to a 16-8 record, third on the ladder and a preliminary final. Not since 1989 had Souths won more than 12 games in a season. A year later Souths were back in the preliminary final having won 18 games. Twelve months on from that Maguire led Souths to the promised land, arguably the cardinal and myrtle’s most famous victory. He seemingly had a ticket for life at Redfern. Maguire was a genuine folk hero at a club steeped in tradition, lore and history. So it is hard to grasp where it all went wrong. Maguire was not even given the chance to undertake the rebuild, leaving Redfern this week “by mutual agreement”. Speculation started to grow just 18 months after the famous title. A pre-season camp at Russell Crowe’s property in northern NSW that saw Luke Keary walk out and catch a plane home reflected poorly on the coach at both ends of the spectrum. He was seen by the players to be unprotective and worked the players into the ground, relentless in his obsessive approach. Player burnout was the constant whisper out of Redfern. South Sydney have no doubt regressed over the last three seasons. How much blame can be attributed to Maguire though and how much should be chalked up to the natural decline of a premiership-winning team is debatable. Maguire has certainly made some mistakes. He has chronically underplayed Damien Cook over the last two seasons. He has failed to change South Sydney’s play stylistically. He has been a little too willing to tinker with his players and their positions. But he can’t be blamed for Greg Inglis’s injury. He would almost certainly not have been behind the decision to sign Robbie Farah. While he was certainly happy to have Sam Burgess back, if the final call was left to Maguire, he may have been happy to pursue the path to team harmony rather than bring back the former skipper. It matters little now though. His time at Redfern is done. He will walk into nearly any job he wants as he rates among the game’s elite mentors. His legacy at South Sydney though should never be forgotten. He took a once-noble club that was on its knees and returned the pride to the so-called “Pride of the League”. And of all coaching achievements over the last decade in rugby league, that might be the most astonishing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/07/afl-finals-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-week-one-matchups","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T23:57:55Z","webTitle":"AFL finals: all you need to know about the week one matchups | Craig Little","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/07/afl-finals-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-week-one-matchups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/07/afl-finals-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-week-one-matchups","fields":{"headline":"AFL finals: all you need to know about the week one matchups","bodyText":"Bertrand Russell said the world was full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper. But as we take shelter in the stupid waiting for the magic of the finals, our collective wit is dulled by a week of AFL filler –12 paragraphs on Patrick Dangerfield not going for a surf, a dreadful AFL promotion parodying Game of Thrones, and Brent “Boomer” Harvey unveiling the 2017 premiership cup, which barring the engraving is identical to every cup that has preceded it since 1959. Although, for those fortunate enough among us to be supporting a team that’s made it this far, September’s irritations are largely limited to futile arguments about All-Australian selections. Adelaide v Greater Western Sydney It all kicks off on Thursday night at the Adelaide Oval, where the minor premiers take on Sydney’s second-best chance at a flag. In the leadup to this game, Adelaide coach Don Pyke dabbled in understatement by saying “the intensity in the finals goes up another level”. It will be interesting to see which side cranks the dial to 11 first after both had a middling run into the game – Adelaide having lost its last two games as it conserved its energy and rested its stars, while the Giants seemed disinterested during their seven-goal loss to Geelong. The Crows have been slow starters on occasion this year, and this may be the Giants best opportunity to puncture the partisan crowd, rather than prop it up. Talking point: While much of Adelaide’s success this year has been accredited to their front half (they own the AFL’s best scoring average), what has caught the Giants’ coach Leon Cameron’s attention is that the Crows “are a contested ball machine all over the ground” – a claim supported by the data which shows they top the league for contested possessions and are only behind their hometown rivals Port Adelaide in contested marks. Geelong v Richmond The build-up for each team in this game has been an exercise in contrast. Geelong’s preparation has been subdued and controlled. Richmond has to no option other than to embrace the hype that accompanies their best regular season finish since 1995 – hype that figuratively roared “DUSTY!” after Dustin Martin refused North Melbourne, and literally screamed “10 PAGES OF TIGERS” at the top of the front page of the Sunday Herald Sun. But nothing to this point will compete with a raucous chorus of 97,000 at the MCG, most of whom will be on the Tigers barracking for hope to triumph over experience. You need to go back 11 years to when Richmond last beat Geelong, and a further seven years for the last time they defeated the Cats at the MCG. In their most recent meeting three weeks ago at Simonds Stadium, Geelong’s defensive pressure compensated for the loss of Tom Hawkins and Joel Selwood by restricting Richmond to 66 points, a total well below their season average. While Geelong will be stronger with both Hawkins and Selwood in their line-up, a vaster MCG will stretch the Cats’ defenders more than their Moorabool Street home. The consequences of this game are obviously great for Richmond and Geelong fans, but for neutrals it is the one game this weekend that provides the best shot at three hours where we lose ourselves completely in a full-hearted football experience with absolutely nothing at stake. Talking Point: Richmond. Win and the fervour will be Pentecostal. Lose and the Tigers will carry the neurosis of 70,000 members to a win or go home game against Sydney (likely) or Essendon. Join Kate O’Halloran who will be manning the Guardian’s liveblog for the big game at the MCG on Friday night. Sydney v Essendon For sportswriters, Saturday’s game is a battle to see which is more potent of the “nobody believes in us” narrative and the “team of destiny” narrative. According to bookies and the general football consensus, Essendon are this weekend’s greatest outsiders. This is despite the Bombers coming within 24 seconds of do-anything, joyful chaos of upsetting the Swans at the SCG in June. Essendon also has plenty of what ultimately beat the Swans in last year’s grand final, and that is outside run with David Zaharakis, Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti and County Tyrone’s Connor McKenna. But the Swans have a finals-hardened midfield, an 8-1 record since their close call against the Bombers, and Lance Franklin. Talking Point: Premierships may ultimately be what Franklin’s nine-year, $10m contract is measured on, and in the mood Buddy is in right now, that may be the Swans’ destiny. While Shakespeare said, “it is not in the stars to hold our destiny”, he didn’t see Buddy Franklin kick 10 in round 23. Port Adelaide v West Coast On destiny, it is difficult not to think West Coast’s place in this year’s final series is part of fate’s cruel joke lobbed at the Melbourne Football Club. Port Adelaide’s struggles against top eight teams have been well documented this year, and with two key defensive players in Jack Hombsch and Tom Jonas missing, there is an opportunity for the Eagles to create a mismatch for one of their dangerous forwards – Josh Kennedy, Jack Darling or even the elusive Mark LeCras. The Power’s best chance of limiting supply to the Eagles’ forwards will come at the centre square, where given the current form of Paddy Ryder, his match-up against Nathan Vardy is akin to T-1000 from Terminator 2 lining up against Matty J from The Bachelor. Talking Point: “The Portress” is anything but for the raiders from the west, who have won all three of their matches there against Port Adelaide. After last year’s dismal showing at home against the Bulldogs, the Eagles may enjoy being on the road for this one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/06/donald-trump-north-korea-arms-deal-japan-south-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"Trump offers to sell 'sophisticated' military gear to Japan and South Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/donald-trump-north-korea-arms-deal-japan-south-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/06/donald-trump-north-korea-arms-deal-japan-south-korea","fields":{"headline":"Trump offers to sell 'sophisticated' military gear to Japan and South Korea","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s offer to allow Japan and South Korea to buy “highly sophisticated military equipment” from the US has triggered speculation that Washington might be on the point of relaxing some of the few remaining restrictions on arms sales in the region, in the wake of North Korea’s sixth nuclear test. However, it was unclear on Wednesday whether the offer referred to specific deals. Trump vowed a month ago to respond with “fire and fury” to North Korean threats. But after a huge underground blast which Pyongyang claimed was of a two-stage thermonuclear warhead, the president put the onus principally on China to rein in North Korea. The US has drafted a United Nations security council resolution that would impose an oil embargo, but Russia has warned such a move would be “premature”. After a telephone conversation with Xi Jinping on Wednesday, Trump said the Chinese president “would like to do something”. “We’ll see whether or not he can do it,” Trump told reporters. “But we will not be putting up with what’s happening in North Korea. I believe that President Xi agrees with me 100%. He doesn’t want to see what’s happening there either. We had a very, very frank and very strong phone call.” The other element in Trump’s response was to suggest he would beef up the military capacity of US allies in the region. The president tweeted on Tuesday that he was “allowing Japan and South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States”. His administration has recently agreed with South Korea that it can deploy missiles with payloads of up to 1,000kg (2,205lb), removing a limit put in place in the hope of drawing North Korea into missile control talks. Seoul will also be given the capacity to use massive, bunker-busting bombs. Four US Thaad missile defence launchers were being deployed in South Korea on Wednesday, under an agreement dating back to the Obama administration. Japan is also building up its military, especially its missile defence systems, but there was no immediate confirmation that any limit on US arms exports to Tokyo had been lifted in recent days. The US restricts sales of its most advanced missile technology to a small number of allies. Any change would have to be approved by the Pentagon’s Defense Technology Security Administration and Congress, and is not in the immediate gift of the president. US allies in the region are reassessing their security posture in the face of North Korea’s advances in the development of nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles. The government of Shinzo Abe is considering whether Japan should acquire offensive strike capability for the first time since the second world war, reinterpreting constitutional limits on the acquisition of offensive weapons. The South Korean government of president Moon Jae-in is committed to building up its military until it is able to take over operational control of its forces in wartime from the current US joint command. That would require a significant boost in satellite communication systems. Seoul has expressed interest in a long-range precision air-to-ground missile called JASSM, but has been rebuffed by Washington. According to Reuters, Tokyo has asked for a powerful new radar, the Spy-6, that would boost the effectiveness of a land-based Aegis ballistic missile defence system it plans to install in the next few years. So far its requests have been turned down. “If we sell those kind of systems, then we’ll know that the Trump tweet meant something,” said James Schoff, a senior fellow in the Asia Programme of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The Pentagon said defense secretary James Mattis called his Japanese counterpart Itsunori Onodera on Wednesday and “underscored that the US commitment to defend Japan, including the US extended deterrence commitment, remains ironclad”. The Pentagon statement said Mattis “also underscored the United States would work with Japan to enhance its ballistic missile defense capabilities”. It was not immediately clear if the Spy-6 radar system was discussed. Mattis also called his South Korean opposite number, Song Young-moo, who this week called for US tactical nuclear weapons to be deployed on the Korean peninsula for the first time since 1991, as well as other strategic assets such as aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and B-52 bombers. The US has thus far opposed any redeployment of nuclear weapons. The Pentagon statement on the Mattis-Song conversation said only that the US defense secretary stressed that “any threat to the United States, its territories, or its allies will be met with a massive, effective, and overwhelming military response”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/06/roger-federer-v-juan-martin-del-potro-us-open-quarter-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T04:03:26Z","webTitle":"Roger Federer v Juan Martin del Potro: US Open quarter-final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/06/roger-federer-v-juan-martin-del-potro-us-open-quarter-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/06/roger-federer-v-juan-martin-del-potro-us-open-quarter-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Roger Federer v Juan Martin del Potro: US Open quarter-final – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us. Here’s the match report: Much of the stadium has cleared out. But the few thousand or so who remain are in full throat and it’s quite difficult to make out Del Potro’s on-court interview. Many of the Argentinian fans who were in the upper reaches of the stadium have rushed down to the lower promenade to cheer. Encore performances of ‘Olé, Olé, Olé’ and more. Amazing scenes in Flushing Meadows in the aftermath of a highly entertaining quarter-final that very much lived up to advance billing. Fourth set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 4-6 Del Potro Del Potro uncorks a vicious forehand winner from the baseline, then a 128mph ace for 30-love. He’s two points from the semi-finals. He then nets a backhand volley under duress from Federer and now the crowd is really making one final push behind. Then Del Potro sends a backhand long for 30-all and the crowd is going wild. Bear in mind: Del Potro had won 18 of 19 points on his serve in this set before that missed volley at 30-love. Now a short rally ends when Federer misses an elementary volley winner, one he’s deposited for a winner at least ten thousand times. Crushing! Match point for Delpo and he does it with a forehand winner! Fourth set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 4-5 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) Federer serving to stay in the match and off to a miserable start as Del Potro has just hit forehand winners on back-to-back points for love-30. The Swiss great is now two points from elimination. Delpo sends a return long, then Federer hits a pair of forehand winners for game point. Federer then ends it with a backhand winner that paints the line (and is upheld after a Delpo challenge). Now the pressure falls on Del Potro to serve for the match and a place in the US Open semi-finals. Fourth set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 3-5 Del Potro (*denotes next server) Service winner by Del Potro followed by a 130mph. Six points from the finish line. Federer sends a backhand return long for 40-love, then Delpo laces in another service winner for yet another love hold. He’s closing this one out with authority: he’s won 16 of the last 17 points on his serve. Fourth set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 3-4 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) Quick start for Federer: service winner, backhand winner, ace. He then mixes in a double fault, but another service winner gives him the hold. He’s rebounded quite nicely from the break in his previous service game, but he’ll need to make headway on Delpo’s serve at some point if he hopes to force a decider and he’s running out of time to do it. Fourth set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 2-4 Del Potro (*denotes next server) A glimmer of hope for Federer as he forces Del Potro into an error for love-15. But Del Potro answers with a 100mph second-serve ace for 15-all, then a 130mph serve that Federer manages to get a racket on but can’t return anywhere near the court. Now Federer blinks first during a lengthy baseline rally and puts a backhand into the net, followed by a 127mph service winner by Del Potro for the comfortable hold. No change of ends but after the even-numbered game but still enough time for the ‘Olé, Olé, Olé’ chant to ring around the arena once more! Fourth set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 2-3 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) Federer opens with a forehand winner. But he then follows with a pair of unforced errors, the first from the backhand side and the latter from the forehand and it’s 15-30. And he’s now made a third straight unforced error, this one on a forehand from the baseline, and Del Potro now has a pair of break-point chances at 15-40! Federer saves the first with an overhand smash after running his opponent ragged, then saves the second with a forehand winner and emits a huge “Come on!” as the crowd explodes. Deuce. Federer then hits an overhand smash early in the point that the gigantic Del Potro somehow lobs back into the court, but Federer inexplicably dumps it into the net! Oh my goodness! Another break-point chance and the third time is indeed the charm for Del Potro, who laces a pristine cross-court backhand winner that paints the line for a winner and the break. Fourth set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 2-2 Del Potro (*denotes next server) Del Potro forces Federer into an error, then hits a backhand winner. Then two more service winners and it’s another hold at love. Neither player has lost a point on his serve for three straight games now. Fourth set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 2-1 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) Federer answers with an economical love hold of his own: service winner, service winner, ace, service winner. At this pace we’ll be home before 1am. (Not really.) Fourth set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 1-1 Del Potro (*denotes next server) Federer misfires on a forehand again before Del Potro hits consecutive aces. Another service winner by Del Potro and he’s on the board in the fourth with a drama-free love hold. Fourth set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-7, 1-0 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) Federer forces Del Potro into an error to open the game. The Swiss then double-faults for 15-all, but hits a smash winner followed by consecutive aces of 115mph and 101mph for the easy hold. Fifty-one winners and 32 unforced errors for Federer compared to 36 and 31 for Del Potro, respectively. Third-set tie-breaker: Federer 8-10 Del Potro Del Potro blinks first, making an unforced error from the baseline after a long rally on his serve to give Federer a mini-break. Then Federer ends another extended rally with a cross-court forehand winner from the baseline. Federer tries a serve and volley again, but this time Del Potro negotiates a backhand winner across the court that lands inside the corner. They’re back on level terms with Del Potro serving a pair at 1-2. Another long baseline rally and this one ends when Del Potro puts a backhand into the net, immediately re-gifting the mini-break to Federer. Del Potro overpowers Federer on a baseline rally with Federer ultimately netting a forehand, but he’s still up a mini-break serving at 3-2 with two serves to come. Federer comes to net and hits a forehand winner to make it 4-2 entering the changeover and the crowd has been whipped into a frenzy. Federer then faults and Del Potro pounces on an 85mph second serve, getting in the rally early and forcing Federer into a forehand error from the baseline. They’re back on serve in the minibreak and the crowd’s broken out into the ‘Olé, Olé, Olé’ chant once more! Delpo serving at 3-4. He forces Federer into an error, but then nets a forehand and Federer is up a mini-break once more, serving a pair at 5-4. The set is on his racket and the Federer fans have come back with chants of “Rog-er! Rog-er!” that ring throughout Ashe! A fault by Federer and Delpo jumps on an 83mph second serve, getting his teeth in the rally but finally sending a forehand past the baseline and Federer has a pair of set points. Del Potro saves the first when Federer is unable to return a deep, penetrating groundstroke into the court. Now Del Potro serving at 5-6 – and it’s a 124mph service winner for 6-all. The players change ends and the atmosphere in the room is positively electric but simultaneously tense as hell. Oh dear! And now Del Potro has double-faulted! Only his third double of the night. What cruel timing. Federer with a pair of serves at 7-6 – and Delpo’s brought him him with a drop shot and Roger has botched the lob! It’s gone out for 7-all! Del Potro misses backhand on the next point but they’re back on serve with the Argentinian serving at 7-8. Del Potro ends a short point with a forehand winner for 8-all, then wins a point – well, he basically wins it three times – finally putting away a forehand volley winner. A set point for Delpo! Federer serving at 8-9 and Del Potro is all over the return, hits a big forehand and Federer has sent backhand volley long over the baseline! What a turn! What scenes! Third set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-6 Del Potro Federer opens with a 123mph ace down the middle, his 13th of the night (to Del Potro’s seven), beofre the Argentinian sends a backhand long for 30-love. A serve-and-volley by Federer works to perfection as he closes it out with a forehand volley winner, setting up three game points. He needs only one, serving-and-volleying again for a forehand winner and a love hold, setting the stage for a massive third-set tiebreaker. Bear in mind: Del Potro is 4-0 in tiebreaks at this year’s US Open. But none of those were against Roger Federer. Third set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 5-6 Del Potro (*denotes next server) Del Potro opens with a service winner, but makes an unforced forehand error for 15-all. Next, Federer fails to put a pair of backhand returns into the court for 40-15, followed by a badly missed forehand on the approach that gives Del Potro the hold. Federer again to serve to stay in the third. Third set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 5-5 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) A lengthy baseline rally to open the game ends when Del Potro sends forehand long, a close call that’s upheld by a challenge. A service winner by Federer followed by a smash winner makes it 40-love, but then Federer makes yet another unforced error, his 30th of the night, for 40-15. No matter. He closes out the hold with a 125mph ace as we creep ever closer to a tiebreaker. Third set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 4-5 Del Potro (*denotes next server) A long rally ends with both players at the net and it’s Delpo who ends it with a volley winner. Another unreturnable serve by Del Potro makes it 30-love, then Federer sends a return soaring past the baseline for 40-love. Del Potro then closes out the love hold with a 115mph and Federer will serve to stay in the third set after the changeover. Third set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 4-4 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) Federer opens with a service winner, but then runs onto a short return by Del Potro and crushes it into the net for 15-all. Federer then hits a 117mph ace, but puts another forehand into the net for 30-all. A nervous hush falls over the crowd, but it’s quickly replaced by cheers after a 122mph service winner for game point. Federer then sprays a backhand wide for deuce, but hits another tricky serve on the following point that Delpo can’t return into the court. Another game point. This time Del Potro sends a backhand wide and Federer has the hold for 4-all. Massive game forthcoming ... Third set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 3-4 Del Potro (*denotes next server) A big forehand winner by Del Potro to open, but he then sends a forehand from a step behind the baseline into the net and the crowd is buzzing at 15-all. Now another Delpo forehand finds the net and Federer has a half-chance at 15-30. The Argentinian uncorks a booming 125mph service winner for 30-all, then misses on a running cross-court backhand to give Federer a break-point look at 30-40. High tension! And now it’s Del Potro who double-faults on break point, sending his second serve caroming off the netcord as the roar of 23,771 souls echoes beneath the roof! We’re back on serve in the third set of this one with plenty more to come!

Third set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 1-4 Del Potro (*denotes next server) Del Potro opens with a backhand winner but mishits a forehand for 15-all. Now what looks to be a 127mph is challenged by Federer but upheld by Hawk-Eye. Lengthy rally here ends when Federer comes to next but Del Potro wrong-foots him and passes him with a forehand. Now Del Potro, who’s been so lights-out on his serve, double-faults for 40-30. But Federer dumps a forehand into the net, alleviating the pressure and giving the Swiss the hold.

Federer opens with a service winner, then Federer makes an unforced error with the forehand, which is momentarily in a state of rebellion. And now yet another unforced forehand error by Federer makes it 15-30, giving Del Potro another window of hope. Delpo makes an unforced error with a baseline forehand, but then comes to net and hits a gorgeous touch backhand volley winner for break point. What a beautiful shot! Now here’s a third break-point chance for Del Potro at 30-40 after successes on the first two, even if both were Federer double faults. Federer faults here but it’s a serve-and-volley on the second serve and he saves the break with a forehand volley winner. Then Federer hits an ace and follows it with a backhand winner for the hard-won hold. Third set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 0-3 Del Potro (*denotes next server) And Del Potro backs up the stunning break with authority and efficiency, rattling off four quick points from love-15 down and moving halfway to a two-sets-to-one lead. Third set: Federer 5-7, 6-3, 0-2 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) The players trade unforced errors from the baseline to open the game, but another miscue from Federer off the backhand sends the crowd into a swell. It’s 15-30 and the first time Delpo has made progress in a Federer service game in what feels like a lifetime. Federer answers with a forehand volley winner for 30-all, but Federer misses again with the forehand and Del Potro will have his first look at a break point since the first set. And – wow! – Federer has double-faulted again on break point! Third set: *Federer 5-7, 6-3, 0-1 Del Potro (*denotes next server) The first point of the third set is an entertaining one as Federer is yanked all over the court before chasing down a lob in full sprint toward the baseline and returning it only for Del Potro to calmly hit a forehand volley winner. Federer then makes an unforced error from the forehand side for 30-love, but answers with a forehand winner followed by a Delpo miscue for 30-love. A tight moment early, but Federer misfires on the forehand early in the next point and Del Potro dials in a 114mph ace for the hold. Second set: Federer 5-7, 6-3 Del Potro A forehand smash winner for Federer. Then backhand winner up the line by Federer to deftly pass an approaching Del Potro. He’s two points from the set. Now Federer comes to the net and Delpo is able to send a backhand past the Swiss just inside the court for 30-15. What a shot! Federer hits a 122mph service winner for a pair of set points but he needs only one of them, hitting a forehand winner to level the match at one set apiece.

The difference in body language between the first set and now is night and day. Second set: *Federer 5-7, 3-1 Del Potro (*denotes next server) Del Potro makes an unforced backhand error from the baseline.

This is as good as he’s been serving the entire tournament. But follows with a pair of unforced errors from the baseline, the first a forehand the latter a backhand, for 30-all. Federer then sprints to the net after returning Delpo’s 97mph second serve and pressures him into a missed forehand, setting up Federer’s first break-point opportunity of the night. Big cheers from the crowd. Del Potro faults, but Federer frames the second-serve return and the Argentinian bursts forward to put it away for deuce. A warning from the chair umpire to not call out between the first and second serves. Now a forehand winner by Del Potro for game point, but Federer answers with an inside-out forehand winner that paints the line for deuce. Simply beautiful. A lengthy rally on the next point with Delpo sending Federer from corner to corner, ending finally when Federer sends a forehand long. Then a service winner by Del Potro and he’s held again. Second set: Federer 5-7, 1-0 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) Federer opens with an ace, but Del Potro answers with a forehand winner, his 14th of the night (as many as Federer).

First set: Federer 5-6 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) Federer falls behind love-15 but a pair of Delpo errors makes it 30-15. Then a blistering forehand winner by Del Potro levels the game. What a massive point here already at 5-all, 30-all! And – oh dear! – Federer has double-faulted! His first of the night and now he’s facing his first break point of the match. A serve-and-volley! But Del Potro rips a forehand winner into the small window of space needed to pass Federer but place it in the court and the first break is his! The Argentinian will now try to serve out the first set! First set: *Federer 5-5 Del Potro (*denotes next server) Del Potro’s easiest service game yet: a love hold capped by a vicious service winner. He’s made 21 of 27 first serves. It’s not even a changeover but the ‘Olé, Olé, Olé’ chant breaks out from the upper deck between games for the first time tonight. And probably not the last.

First set: Federer 2-1 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) A whiff of an early break for Del Potro as Federer drops the first two points on forced errors from the baseline.

First set: *Federer 1-1 Del Potro (*denotes next server) Federer misses on a forehand for 15-love then tries another drop shot but Delpo is all over it, showing great foot speed, only to dump the backhand into the net. A 128mph ace makes it 30-15. Federer tries another drop shot from the baseline but this one finds the net for 40-15. Clearly he’s testing the Argentinian’s feet early.

First set: Federer 1-0 Del Potro* (*denotes next server) Federer wins the opening point on an unforced error, but Del Potro responds with a booming forehand winner down the line early in the point. Ominous. Two quick service winners for Federer make it 40-15, then he closes out the easy hold after a lengthy rally with a pitch-perfect drop-shot winner. Federer won the toss and has elected to serve. We’ll pick it up with game-by-game coverage from here. The players are on the court for their warm-ups. Federer holds a 16-5 advantage in the all-time head-to-head, but all five of Del Potro’s victories have come on hard courts, including their seminal 2009 final. I must say the atmosphere on Ashe right now is electric. Wasn’t sure what to expect from the crowd tonight. Federer, always but especially in his late period, has New York City in his palm. Ask Djokovic. But Delpo connects like few other players on the tour and he’s a former champion here too. Early returns indicate a Federer crowd, but it will be interesting to see how it unfolds over the course of the night. Tonight’s big-ticket quarter-final under the roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium is rich with backstory. Del Potro was 20 when he rallied from a set and a break down to overpower Federer over five thrilling sets in the 2009 US Open final to dramatically end the Swiss master’s run of five straight titles and 40 consecutive match victories at Flushing Meadows, one day after seeing off Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals. As the first player ever to defeat Federer and Nadal in the same major, the 6ft 6in Argentinian appeared poised to tower over the sport for years to come. Eight years and four wrist surgeries later, Del Potro is back from the brink of quitting tennis and finally has a rematch with Federer on the court where their fates so memorably intersected. The winner faces Nadal in a semi-final on Friday. Should Federer win tonight, it would ensure the first time the sport’s iconic rivalry will be played out at the US Open. If Del Porto springs the upset, it would mark the sixth time a Federer-Nadal showdown was one result away from happening in Flushing Meadows ... only for either Roger or Rafa to lose. Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for tonight’s US Open men’s quarter-final between Roger Federer and Juan Martin del Potro. The first night-session match has just finished with Madison Keys seeing off Kaia Kanepi to book a place in Thursday’s semi-finals, making it a clean sweep for US women in the quarters. It will mark the sixth ever all-American women’s final four in the Open era after the 1979 and 1981 US Opens, the 1982 and 1983 Australian Opens and Wimbledon in 1985. High times in Flushing Meadows. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Kevin Mitchell’s match report from today’s first men’s quarter-final."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/07/corruption-olympic-movement-ioc","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T07:00:54Z","webTitle":"Familiar whiff of corruption continues to taint Olympic Games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/07/corruption-olympic-movement-ioc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/07/corruption-olympic-movement-ioc","fields":{"headline":"Familiar whiff of corruption continues to taint Olympic Games","bodyText":"For years the International Olympic Committee has insisted the wild west era of the late 1990s, when members’ votes were bought for vast sums during feverish races to host the Games, were a distant memory. But who would believe that now? How could they when Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the head of Rio’s 2016 Olympic bid, stands accused of orchestrating a scheme where members of the IOC were paid bungs days before the vote? Or, as the Guardian revealed last year, after the Tokyo Olympics bid team made secret €1.3m payments to the Black Tidings bank account in Singapore, which is associated with the same notorious fixer who is accused of using illegitimate means to help Rio? The levels of largesse appear smaller nowadays than during the bad old days, before the behaviour of Salt Lake City’s bid team during the 2002 Winter Olympics vote led to wholesale changes in how the IOC awarded the Olympics. But the whiff of corruption nowadays carries a familiar aroma. After our Tokyo story we received a message from a source with a close knowledge of the various investigations taking place. “Black Tidings is just a tiny part of one of the most corrupted networks in the history of sport,” they wrote, matter-of-factly. With each fresh revelation the impression there are more dodgy practices and individuals yet to be unearthed is strengthened. The intriguing question is where the story goes next. Already, the reports are damning enough for the IOC. Brazilian prosecutors say the businessman Arthur César de Menezes Soares Filho deposited $2m into bank accounts belonging to the former IAAF marketing executive Papa Massata Diack, whose influence among certain countries is legendary, three days before the vote to decide who would host the 2016 Games. They say the fee was paid at the behest of the former Rio de Janiero governor Sérgio Cabral, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison in June on bribery and money laundering charges. However, he is unlikely to be the only person facing jail given prosecutors say they have “vast documentation and robust evidence” Brazilian officials bribed Lamine Diack, the president of the IAAF between 1999 and 2015. The federal prosecutor Fabiana Schneider said: “Nuzman was the bridge that linked the criminal scheme together ... he was greasing the wheels to organise the payment of bribes from Cabral directly to African members of the IOC, which was done via Arthur Soares.” There was a crucial addendum. Schneider went on to say Diack Sr was influential with those African members. If anything, his son, Papa, was even more important when it came to ensuring votes for major sporting events were delivered, especially for those with the money and willingness to deal in the darker arts of the bidding process. Some sources do not believe Diack Jr was motivated primarily by cash, having married into significant wealth in Senegal, but rather for the immense power and prestige that came with being known as a major global power broker. By happy coincidence, his various wheelings and dealings made him very rich indeed. At the IAAF, Diack Jr was able to cream off money from contracts as well as taking money from Russians to make positive drug tests disappear. It was for his part in extorting €450,000 from the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova to cover up her doping violations that he was banned from athletics for life. For many who dealt with him on a day-to-day basis, his behaviour meant that particular judgment had been coming for a while. One source describes him as “a pig and a thug”. People shake their heads when talking about how he was allowed to get away with what he did at the IAAF for so long – the answer is because his father was the president. Diack Jr also had a lucrative sideline in securing African votes for cities bidding for the IAAF world championships and Olympic Games. As one observer told the Guardian: “Papa was available to everybody to do anything – for the right price.” In the hotel bars and lobbies where sports politicians congregate and unwind, Papa was known as a fixer with a dubious reputation. He would tell interested parties that if they wanted to hire him, they would need to provide a certain amount of money for fees, expenses and presents and parcels for voters. Often there was a sting in the tail, with potential clients also being warned: “If you don’t do the deal with me, I will do it for someone else and I will fuck you up.” French prosecutors allege Diack Jr received $2m from a British Virgin Islands company linked to Soares three days before the vote for the 2016 Olympics. His company, Pamodzi Sports Consulting, then transferred $299,300 to the offshore company Yemli Limited, which was linked to the former Olympic sprinter Frankie Fredericks, who was an IOC scrutineer at the vote in Copenhagen. Fredericks, who denies any wrongdoing, is awaiting the conclusion of an ethics investigation against him. Diack’s father, Lamine, preferred to operate in the shadows. Many in the IAAF had no idea he was corrupt until the French police arrested him in November 2015 for accepting more than €1m to cover up positive drugs tests. According to two sources who spoke to the New York Times, since then they have also found a secret bank account where money from the Brazil bid was funnelled to him. Last year, the Guardian revealed the presence of a secret email that suggested Diack Sr was working as a “special adviser” to help Qatar try to win the Olympics as far back as 2011. And that six individuals, referred to only by their initials but corresponding with six members of the IOC at the time, had requested “to have their parcels delivered through Special Adviser in Monaco” to support this bid. The Guardian understands some of these individuals are still part of the IOC executive committee. The corruption might be wider still. There was a reason the Diacks had a business that went on operating year in and year out – people knew it worked – and that the money given to them must have been delivered to those pledging their votes. Last year, the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted his organisation had “all rules and instruments in place to fight corruption with zero tolerance”, yet he has shown no great enthusiasm to get to the bottom of the scandal. However, there is hope among some in international sport that the French police may be about to step up their efforts to bring more of those involved to justice. According to this line of thinking, once Paris’s candidacy for the 2024 Olympics is confirmed in Lima next week, there will be no political reasons not to target potentially corrupt IOC members. There is also an expectation Tokyo’s bid for the 2020 Games will be scrutinised more closely too. After all, the holder of the Black Tidings account, Ian Tan Tong Han, a close associate of Diack Jr, was said by a Wada independent commission report into corruption at the IAAF to be employed by a Lucerne-based company called Athletics Management &amp; Services as a consultant. AMS was contracted by the Japanese media and marketing giant Dentsu. Might other Olympic bids have been manipulated by the Diacks? Given what we now know about the corruption at Samsung – the biggest company in South Korea and a major Olympic sponsor – can we be sure about the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang? Or that the Diacks did not use their influence in other sports? At least the pair will not be around to do more damage. Diack Jr is the subject of an Interpol red notice but remains in Senegal, where authorities have said they will not deport him. Diack Sr is expected to face trial early next year on charges of money laundering and corruption. Others remain in the shadows – holding their breath, and their wallets, tight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/06/ben-woodburn-liverpool-deal-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T21:30:42Z","webTitle":"Ben Woodburn set for long-term Liverpool deal after shining for Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/06/ben-woodburn-liverpool-deal-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/06/ben-woodburn-liverpool-deal-wales","fields":{"headline":"Ben Woodburn set for long-term Liverpool deal after shining for Wales","bodyText":"Ben Woodburn’s emergence with Liverpool and Wales is set to be rewarded with a new long-term contract at Anfield when the forward turns 18 next month. The teenager played a starring role for Chris Coleman’s Wales team during the international break, scoring a stunning winning goal within five minutes of his introduction against Austria before creating Hal Robson-Kanu’s crucial breakthrough against Moldova in the World Cup qualifier on Tuesday. Wales leapfrogged the Republic of Ireland into second place in Group D thanks to the 17-year-old’s contributions in the back-to-back victories. “We had to dig deep and keep the belief, and when you’ve got someone like Ben Woodburn anything can happen,” said Ben Davies, the Wales defender, following the win in Moldova. Woodburn is only 12 months into the three-year deal he signed after turning 17 last October – his first professional contract and the maximum length of time he could sign for at that age. However, the Liverpool academy graduate becomes eligible to sign a five-year deal on his 18th birthday on 15 October and the club are set to reward his progress under Jürgen Klopp with a lucrative new contract. The Chester-born forward, who has represented Wales from under-15s level upwards, became the youngest goalscorer in Liverpool’s history last season when he netted in a League Cup quarter‑final defeat of Leeds United. He made nine appearances in total for Klopp’s team last season but has yet to make a matchday squad this term. Liverpool will move to secure Woodburn’s long-term future as soon as he turns 18 with the new deal expected to be finalised shortly after his birthday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/06/london-2012-team-insist-bid-for-right-to-host-olympics-was-clean","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T19:43:25Z","webTitle":"London 2012 team insist bid for right to host Olympics was clean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/06/london-2012-team-insist-bid-for-right-to-host-olympics-was-clean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/06/london-2012-team-insist-bid-for-right-to-host-olympics-was-clean","fields":{"headline":"London 2012 team insist bid for right to host Olympics was clean","bodyText":"The London 2012 bid team have defended themselves against any suggestion of corruption, insisting they are “as close to certain as possible” the right to host the Olympics in the capital was won cleanly. A deepening of the bribery scandal engulfing the International Olympic Committee has led to questions about how the Sochi 2014, Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games were awarded. Sir Keith Mills, the former chief executive of London 2012, said he witnessed nothing untoward during 18 months of campaigning that culminated in London’s victory. “The IOC had a big problem in the late 1990s and as a result of that put in place some pretty draconian controls,” Mills said. “When we were bidding for London 2012 we couldn’t buy IOC members a coffee.” The IOC introduced new rules for bidding cities after the discovery in 1998 of widespread bribery associated with Salt Lake City’s bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Ten IOC members were expelled or resigned as a result of the scandal. “They were all so paranoid they would come under suspicion,” Mills said. “Whenever we met they made a big point of making sure it was in public and everything was seen to be above board. Whether that has evaporated over time I don’t know.” Sebastian Coe, who led London’s bid, told the Guardian he was confident “nothing embarrassing” would be uncovered and his views were echoed by Craig Reedie, the former chairman of the British Olympic Association. A joint investigation by Brazilian and French authorities this week led to the questioning of the Brazilian Olympic Committee president, Carlos Nuzman, a well-known figure in Olympic circles. The equivalent of £155,000 was said to have been found in his closet and seized during a raid on his home. Nuzman’s lawyer said on Tuesday that his client “did not commit any irregularity”. Prosecutors suspect the former Olympic volleyball player facilitated payments of $2m made by a prominent Brazilian businessman into the account of Papa Masatta Diack. They have alleged the money was intended as a bribe for his father, Lamine Diack, an influential IOC member and then the president of athletics world governing body, the IAAF. Questions about the London bid are unavoidable given Lord Coe’s closeness with Diack Sr, whom he referred to as his “spiritual leader” when he succeeded the Senegalese as the president of the IAAF. Diack, an IOC member from 1991 to 2013, was instrumental in organising the African bloc of votes. Mills said Diack was soon determined as a lost cause in the 2012 bidding process, contested by London, Paris, Madrid, New York and Moscow. “We identified Lamine Diack as a Paris bid supporter, so frankly spent very little time with him,” Mills said. “Seb knew him through athletics but I certainly didn’t have any conversations with him.” It is not known how Diack voted in the secret ballot, which was narrowly won by London in a run-off with Paris. The IOC will this month approve Paris and Los Angeles as the hosts of the 2024 and 2028 Olympics, respectively. The Guardian understands fresh information from the ongoing French and Brazilian investigations will only increase scrutiny on how voting has been conducted in the past. Reedie, a former vice-president of the IOC and now the president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said London was to his knowledge “a clean bid”. “Seb and I agreed right at the start that it was going to be done properly,” he said, “because if anything was even remotely improper it would kill the whole image of the Olympic movement in this country and besides, we didn’t have any money anyway. “I’m surprised at Nuzman’s links to everything that’s going on in Brazil,” he added, “My wife and I took him and his wife out to dinner in Singapore but that is it.

He also cut an unexpected deal with Democratic leaders in congress to combine a Hurricane Harvey relief package with raising the debt ceiling and funding the government for three months. Last weekend Amid reports that three key aides – defence secretary James Mattis, chief of staff John Kelly, and secretary of state Rex Tillerson – were clinging on to office out of a sense of duty despite their qualms about their boss, Trump prepared to get his presidency back on track as Congress returned from its summer break. The debt limit, major tax reform, government funding to avoid a shutdown and recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey in Texas were all on their plate. On Saturday Trump and his wife Melania returned to Texas, noting as he met families at a storm shelter in Houston: “As tough as this was, it’s been a wonderful thing, I think, even for the country to watch it and for the world to watch. It’s been beautiful.” In remarks that some saw as inappropriately ebullient, he shouted to reporters: “Have a good time, everybody!” His good mood was spoiled overnight when North Korea exploded its biggest nuclear bomb yet, deepening the most serious foreign policy challenge his administration faces. Trump posted a series of early morning tweets, chiding North Korea, accusing South Korea of appeasement, and claiming – in the passive-aggressive style he reserves for messages to Beijing – that the test of an apparent hydrogen bomb was an “embarrassment” to China, “which is trying to help but with little success”. During a trip to church, the president was asked whether he would attack North Korea. “We’ll see,” he replied. Mattis expanded this statement later, telling the press at the White House that any threat to the US or its allies would be met with a “massive military response” and adding: “We are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea,” but “we have many options to do so”. Trump later weighed in with a threat – widely seen as unrealistic – to “stop all trade with any country doing business with North Korea”. In 2016, the US imported $463bn worth of goods from China, including computer goods, clothing, TV and video equipment, and toys. In Russia news, Adam Schiff, a leading member of a congressional intelligence committee, threatened to subpoena the White House in order to obtain a draft letter that Trump reportedly wanted to send to James Comey when he fired him as FBI chief. And late on Sunday night, reports emerged that Trump had decided to scrap the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program – which gave work permits to 800,000 people brought to the US without documents as children – but would give Congress up to six months to find a legislative alternative. The decision was set be announced on Tuesday. Monday On Labor Day, the letter Barack Obama had left his successor when he vacated the White House was published by CNN. The letter – either patronising or remarkably prescient depending on your point of view – warned Trump to uphold the rule of law and not undermine the “international order”. Trump himself seemed to take it well at the time, calling it “beautiful” in January and saying he would cherish it. Tuesday Trump approved his most controversial immigration measure since his first, failed attempt at a travel ban in January, terminating the Obama-era program that protects the young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. Daca will be phased out by 5 March 2018, with Trump attempting to throw the issue to Congress, telling legislators they had six months to enact new protections for Dreamers through legislation. The timing was curious. It appeared Trump had allowed himself to be bounced into a decision now by a group of anti-immigration Republican attorneys general who were threatening to sue him. US attorney general Jeff Sessions had apparently told Trump he couldn’t defend the policy against such a suit. That seemed an arguable point, and it was perhaps a sign of Trump’s weakness politically that he was unable to put pressure on the state AGs to drop their suit. Trump himself seemed conflicted over the fate of the Dreamers, having frequently made mawkish statements about “loving” them since the election and implied they would be safe. Whatever his qualms, he decided to end the program – but notably sent Sessions out to announce the decision instead of doing it himself, with the attorney general delivering a hard-edged speech full of phrases such as “mostly-adult illegal aliens”. Trump’s attempt to force Congress to deal with the problem he had just created also seemed unlikely to succeed. Legislators have tried and failed to pass protection for Dreamers for 16 years. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did not mention Daca when he laid out his numerous legislative goals on Tuesday. There was some speculation that what Trump really wanted was to forge some kind of grand bargain on immigration, bullying rightwingers in Congress into voting for Daca and liberals into voting for the wall with Mexico. By Tuesday evening, Trump had muddied the waters further, posting a tweet saying that if Congress did not come up with a legislative solution, he would “revisit this issue”. This statement seemed to undermine not only any legislative strategy he might have had, but also his whole argument for scrapping Daca, which was that Congress should deal with this aspect of immigration, not the president. For the 800,000 Dreamers plunged into legal limbo, it meant further uncertainty about their lives in the US. Obama made a rare intervention to call Trump’s decision cruel and wrong. Wednesday As 15 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit challenging Trump’s Daca repeal, Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress, claimed the Dreamers could “rest easy”, saying legislators would figure out a way to regularise their status over the next six months. On Air Force One before a flight to North Dakota for a speech on tax reform, the president was asked whether he had sent mixed signals over Daca. “No mixed signal at all,” he said. “Congress, I really believe, wants to take care of this situation.” Asked specifically about his Twitter pledge to “revisit” the issue, he said: “I have a feeling that’s not going to be necessary ... I think Congress really wants to do this.” Trump met earlier in the Oval Office with Republican leaders Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Democratic Congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Referring to the Democrats but not to their Republican counterparts, he said: “Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I.” Trump overruled congressional Republicans and his treasury secretary and cut a three-month deal with the opposition party to fund the government and raise the US borrowing limit, combining those measures with an agreement to send aid to the victims of Hurricane Harvey. Thursday Senate Republicans overcame their nausea to approve a deal Trump struck with Democrats to raise the debt ceiling and provide Harvey relief. But Republicans wondered just how bipartisan Trump was meaning to get. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said that Trump had told her he would sign legislation to restore protections for young immigrants which he had removed earlier in the week. Trump took a decidedly more restrained tone than usual on the topic of North Korea during a Thursday press conference, saying “nothing’s inevitable” and that he “would prefer not going the route of military”. Trump added that “military action would certainly be an option” to deal with the crisis. Donald Trump Jr submitted testimony to the senate judiciary committee, including an explanation of why he took a meeting with Russian operatives at Trump Tower. Trump Jr suggested that he wanted that information as a concerned citizen, not as a campaign operative. “To the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,” Trump Jr told Congress in a statement. “Depending on what, if any, information they had, I could then consult with counsel to make an informed decision as to whether to give it further consideration.” After the interview, Democratic senator Chris Coons, who attended, pointed out to reporters the section of federal law establishing that “false statements to Congress are criminal”. Friday Trump began the day by urging Republicans to focus on tax reform. To try again to repeal Barack Obama’s health care law, Trump suggested, would be a “Republican death wish”. The White House spent much of the day messaging on Hurricane Irma, which was blasting through the Caribbean with Miami in the crosshairs. Trump warned of “a storm of absolutely historic, destructive potential”. Despite grumbling about a deal Trump had cut with Democrats to provide Harvey relief and raise the debt ceiling, Republicans in the House voted to approve it with a strong majority. Ninety Republicans voted against the bill. But when the White House pitched the deal before the vote, dissenters booed. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin was reportedly hissed at after he ducked out early, saying, “Vote for the debt ceiling for me.” At the end of the day, Trump was to depart for a weekend at Camp David.

Why anti-nuclear protests need an urgent revival","bodyText":"On Monday, I was idly interrogating my children about their anxieties, when my nine-year-old son raised the prospect of a third world war. Given the current tensions between the US and North Korea, I suppose this wasn’t too surprising. I explained that, were there a nuclear strike, the UK would be very unlikely to be its target, and he replied: “It’s so polluted, we may as well have been nuked already.” There seemed to be the lilt of a joke in this comment somewhere, but I couldn’t swear to it. I squeaked on a bit about how levels of lead have actually gone way down, and diesel cars – one of which we were actually sitting in – would soon be phased out, but thought: this is exactly how I remember life in 1982, the sense of an impending threat that everyone talked about but nobody explained in useful terms. Then it was nuclear war; now it’s pollution. When I was growing up, kids understood the broad concept of all-out nuclear war, but not what escalation would look like, or who had what capability. I used to think every plane that flew overhead had a nuclear capacity, and it was up to the pilot whether or not he used it. For those of us who reached majority with the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the coming of age is indivisible from the relief of an existential threat lifted, so that worrying about nuclear annihilation is filed as part of childhood, a monster in the wardrobe. It was real, until suddenly it wasn’t. A lacuna followed, a gap that remains. Where once we had a thriving peace movement – a muscular response to nuclear weapons, articulated by ordinary people with agency and resilience – suddenly, for the most part, the arguments went quiet. British anti-nuclear campaigns came in two waves, says David Fairhall, author of Common Ground: The Story of Greenham. The first big Aldermaston march took place at Easter 1958, demonstrators walking between London and the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, in Berkshire. These were calls for disarmament, “against a background of nuclear confrontation,” says Fairhall, “that had frightened people into thinking there might be a nuclear war next week”. This was quintessential cold war stuff, against the background of the establishment view that Russian ambitions to take western Europe as they had the east were real, and the US had to be kept onside at all costs. “Aldermaston was effectively a bomb-making factory,” says Fairhall. “That’s what people came out in duffel coats to protest against. Then that died down a bit.” The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, CND, was born in this era, and was at the root of the campaigns in the 80s; in that sense, this is all one peace movement. What pushed the nuclear issue into the common consciousness, nobody can quite agree. Certainly, there was a lot of very vivid description coming from the peace movement of what would actually happen to a person in the event of a nuclear war. This spurred discussion, as well as a lot of creativity, from Raymond Briggs’s painful graphic novel about apocalypse, When the Wind Blows, in 1982, to the gruesome TV drama Threads, in 1984. The government’s own public-information initiative, chilling in the recollection, was called Protect and Survive and imparted asinine advice from the early 60s until the 80s – for instance, remove your door from its hinges and lean it against a table in order to create a makeshift bomb shelter. This eventually spawned a playful citizenly response: Protest and Survive. But if the descriptions of nuclear war sometimes seemed lurid in a slightly gleeful way, they underpinned a real and trenchant moral case; that weapons capable of the indiscriminate massacre of hundreds of thousands of people were wrong in and of themselves, regardless of who was holding them and what their intentions were. This is the change that really shocks Mary Kaldor, professor of global governance at the London School of Economics; that you are now “not allowed to be a politician unless you can say you would use a nuclear weapon. There’s even a problem with Jeremy Corbyn saying he would be extremely cautious about pressing the button. Somehow, you have to be part of the lie to be part of the establishment.” The second wave of the anti-nuclear movement, says Fairhall, centred around the build-up of arms. “We had the Americans planting these cruise missiles [abroad], the Russians putting SS20s in eastern Europe, and we were just sucked into it.” In September 1981, after a government decision to allow cruise missiles at the US base in Berkshire, RAF Greenham Common, a protest camp was set up there. The camp became all-women in 1982, and lasted until 2000; protests included 30,000 women joining hands to Embrace the Base in December 1982; the following year, 70,000 protesters formed a human chain between Greenham and nearby Aldermaston. The successes of the Greenham protesters, and the peace movement more widely, range from the demonstrable to the nebulous, the hypothetical to the proven; the one thing the achievements all had in common was that they were all comprehensively denied afterwards. Kaldor, who was heavily involved with CND and was at the centre of END – the European Nuclear Disarmament campaign – has a letter from the historian EP Thompson, saying: “This is our moment; if we succeed, the politicians will take it over from us, and it will be as if we had never been.” Indeed, Margaret Thatcher left a small, poisonous trace of her feelings about Greenham; an anonymous source from the US Air Force noted her reaction, when she was given a list of the bases they planned to vacate at the end of the cold war. “You can’t withdraw from Greenham,” she reportedly said. “We can’t let them think they’ve succeeded.” In the 90s, it became de rigueur to concede that Greenham had had an effect on “the culture” while maintaining that it had had zero impact on the cold war. I think this had traction because, from the ground, certainly if you went to Greenham as a peripheral, weekend visitor, this is how it felt: a lot of scruffbags eating muesli, wrapped in foil blankets to protect against the unremarkable but unpleasant British weather, while completely impassive soldiers with shiny guns eyeballed you from the perimeter. I remember going as a child, getting the bus from the station, and another passenger wearing a badge that said, “RAGE – Residents Against Greenham Extremists”. This did not feel, frankly, like a movement that made much impact on the agendas of Ronald Reagan or the Soviet leader Yuri Andropov. It felt like a nasty British in-fight, lefties on the one hand, Daily Mail readers on the other; like Brexit, with extra armageddon. Yet this is wrong. The movement had distinct political impact, nationally and internationally. First, Fairhall says, the Greenham women “dragged discussion of nuclear weapons out of the dark world of SS20s and CTBTs [comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaties], all those acronyms and technical details, and forced people to discuss them in plain language. And that meant they had to be discussed in the House of Commons. There was a very important secondary issue of who would control these weapons: up until then, the Americans had just been landing wherever they fancied and putting up bomb sites ready to use in retaliation to a Soviet attack. We had no control, and that was a scandal.” But the impact went beyond British politics: Kaldor recalls an adviser to Reagan, Richard Burt, saying to her explicitly that they copied their so-called “zero option” (winding down nuclear capacity on both sides) straight off the women’s banners. They were trying to frame themselves as peace-seekers; they thought the suggestion would be so extreme that the Russians would have to refuse it, and therefore look like the warmongers. So much of the USSR’s control over its own dominions relied on the cold war and the fact that Russia offered the protection of its SS20s. Duly, Andropov did refuse the zero option; but his successor Mikhail Gorbachev had different pressures and priorities – economically, the arms race was unsustainable by then – and accepted the zero option as a sincere rather than tactical demand from the US. The end of the cold war started on the banner of a peacenik. A seismic cultural shift started only tangentially with CND; in 1980, Kaldor, Thompson and Ken Coates launched the call for European Nuclear Disarmament, partly with the aim of separating tactically from the communists – CND was calling for unilateral disarmament by the British and was seen, with suspicion, as a fellow traveller of the Soviets. Allying with human rights groups behind the iron curtain, END married the disarmament agenda of western Europe with the democracy agenda of eastern Europe. “We changed the discourse,” Kaldor remembers now. “Previously, peace came from above, from governments and treaties. The idea that peace and human rights were inseparable fundamentally changed things.” What worries Fairhall today is that while we used to worry about the arms race, it is now not a race so much as a pub brawl between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un – “an idiot and a lunatic” threatening one another with “fire and fury”, a reckless bravado never seen during the cold war, or since. Fairhall uses those terms not as insults, but almost as a technical military analysis. “Nuclear capability is relatively stable, so long as it’s a game of deterrence and diplomacy. They used to be a military insurance policy, or a status symbol. They have never before been in the hands of anyone who would actually use them – even with John F Kennedy, that was never the threat. So it does feel that we have drifted across a barrier.” Fairhall says this with an understatement not typical of the peace movement, but it does underline the message: we need a revival more than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/06/one-person-killed-in-plane-crash-at-caernarfon-airport","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T21:10:51Z","webTitle":"Pilot killed in plane crash at Caernarfon ​airport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/06/one-person-killed-in-plane-crash-at-caernarfon-airport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/06/one-person-killed-in-plane-crash-at-caernarfon-airport","fields":{"headline":"Pilot killed in plane crash at Caernarfon ​airport","bodyText":"The pilot of a light aircraft has died after it crashed into the runway at Caernarfon airport in north Wales.

In the rather verbose The Natural History of Oxfordshire of 1676, addressed to King Charles II, Plot systematically records his observations of the heavens, air, waters, earths, stones, plants, men, women, arts and animals of Oxfordshire. Chapter five of the book is about “Formed Stones” and it’s in this chapter that the “first dinosaur” is recorded. In a section describing formed stones reminiscent of the parts of humans, Plot describes and illustrates a stone in “... the figure of the lowermost part of the thigh-bone of Man or at least some other Animal ...” but larger in proportion than a horse or ox and different and smaller than an elephant. With some suspect deduction, Plot suggests that this must be from a giant man or woman and then gives an exhaustive account of giants known from history. Writing almost 100 years later, natural historian Richard Brookes copied Plot’s figure but gives it the name Scrotum humanum for its resemblance to the scrotum of a giant man, although this name was given to describe the form and not in the genuine belief that it was a giant’s scrotum (Weishampel and White 2003). Both of these illustrations would have to wait a further two hundred years until palaeontologist Beverly Halstead rediscovered these early works and recognised the giant thigh bone/scrotum as the femur of a theropod dinosaur and one of the earliest surviving depictions of a dinosaur fossil (Ibid.). Sadly the original specimen is lost. Plot’s illustration of a dinosaur bone is quite well known as a point of historical interest but the rest of his musings on formed stones is less explored but quite remarkable. The formed stones that Plot describes range from funnily shaped stones – that wouldn’t be out of place in a child’s collection of beach-combed stones – through to accurately described fossils of ammonites, echinoderms, bivalves and crinoids. Amongst some of the stranger inclusions from Oxfordshire is a stone from the quarries of Headington which resembles the head of a horse which Plot calls Hippocephaloides. Apparently these were found in abundance. Continuing on the theme of animorphic rocks, Lapis Bubonius is a stone which “has perfectly the head of an Owl’s head”. Other objects in Plot’s collection are organised by their resemblance to human body parts such as an ear, an eyeball, a heart (including arteries and veins), olfactory nerves and a human brain. A separate group relates to stones which resemble the human Paps or Duggs including the Mamma, Papilla and Areola, that is a human breast. Plot notes that he did have a better one than the one figured but it was lost in the “...portage betwixt my Chamber and the Gravers”. From the inferior specimen illustrated a sponge or coral is a more likely candidate. Plot also describes stones in the form of the Scrotum, Phalloides, glans and praeputium penis humani but “out of modesty” he didn’t figure it. In addition to the more exotic formed stones, there are a range of more recognisable animal fossils such as the bivalves, ammonites (which Plot notes are different to the nautilus), echinoderms, gastropods and belemnites. These caused Plot a bit of head scratching as they clearly resembled living forms which are found in the sea but he found them in the earth in Oxfordshire. In the introduction to the chapter, Plot compares these naturally formed stones to the stones which can be worked for human use and supposes that these stones were provided for the admiration by humans rather than use. In what we must presume is a case of sour grapes, he also chastises those “malicious scoffers” who deride the habit of “picking of stones’ for not admiring God’s creative work. This is not to suggest that Plot blindly accepts that these fossils and stones were distributed in the ground and he spends several pages theorising as to how the remains of sea animals ended up on land. He notes that some fossils seem to be endocasts of shells - where the whole animal has been replaced with rock - but then some fossils found inland had nacre or unmodified shell so could not be ancient. The great flood of the Noah legend, Plot notes, only covered Asia(?) so perhaps England was subject to later national floods in which marine animals were deposited on land, buried and replaced by stones in full or part. Alternatively the shells could have been transported by earthquakes which caused disruption and land uplift. It seems strange to have elements of mysticism and innocent observation of stones which look like owls and horses in The Natural History of Oxfordshire next to impressive conclusions and deduction about environmental change in the past with far less evidence than we have today, over 300 years later. Following the publication of The Natural History of Oxfordshire, Robert Plot’s insightful observations (for the time) were enough to lead to his election to the Royal Society of London and later he became the Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University.

The Irish document shows that Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, will call on the UK to work out “solutions” that avoid the creation of a hard border and guarantee peace on the island. The leaks come a day after the Guardian obtained a draft memo showing the British government’s position on post-Brexit EU migration, which has been denounced as “completely confused”, “economically illiterate” and “a blueprint on how to strangle London’s economy”. The Ireland paper is one of five due to be published by the European commission in the coming days. Each is dated 6 September and was drawn up by Barnier’s article 50 taskforce in Brussels. Together, the papers lay bare the complexity of disentangling Britain from the European Union. Each paper is focused on withdrawal day, 29 March 2019, delving into technical minefields not dealt with during the referendum campaign. EU proposals include: A demand – likely to inflame Brexiters – for the UK to legislate for the “continued protection” of special foods such as Parma ham and feta cheese, as well as French burgundy and Spanish cava. Brussels wants to ensure that more than 3,300 food and drink products are protected from British copycats after Brexit. Ensuring that any goods in transit on Brexit day would be subject to the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. In effect, British companies and the British government would be liable to fines from Brussels for breaking EU VAT and customs rules. A warning to the government that it must guarantee EU data protection standards on classified EU documents. If not, the EU wants these documents erased or destroyed. Asking Britain not to discriminate against EU companies which are carrying out state-funded infrastructure projects that began before Brexit day. Taken together, the five papers reinforce the EU’s determination to focus exclusively on the Brexit divorce issues, spurning Brexit secretary David Davis’s offer to be more “flexible and imaginative” and move to trade. The Irish border is the biggest conundrum caused by the vote to leave the EU, a point underscored by Brussels’ acknowledgment that the Irish document is “different from other papers”. Brussels intends to say the UK should shoulder responsibility for the border, spelling out that the Brexit vote has caused the problem. “The onus to present solutions which overcome the challenges created on the island of Ireland by the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union and its decision to leave the customs union and the internal market remains on the United Kingdom,” states the EU’s Brexit position paper on Ireland. The Ireland paper, which is to be discussed by EU diplomats on Thursday, heightens the pressure on Davis, whose plans to allow UK officials to manage the border for the EU were rejected as “magical thinking” barely a week after they were published. At the weekend, Davis appeared to ditch this “blue-sky” plan and said a “conventional approach” was more likely, without spelling out further details. Barnier, who was the European commissioner responsible for setting up EU funds to promote peace after the Good Friday agreement, is also due to set out his thinking on Brexit at a press conference on Thursday. The paper emerged days after Barnier met Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, in Brussels. Coveney told the EU negotiator that the UK’s decision to leave the EU had “potentially an extraordinarily negative impact on Ireland and on the island of Ireland”. The commission’s paper states that “there needs to be a political commitment to protecting the Good Friday agreement”, although it does not go as far as EU officials did recently when they warned against using Ireland as a “bargaining chip”. Irish politicians would prefer the UK to remain in the EU customs union, as the safest way to avoid the border posts that became targets for nationalist paramilitaries during the Troubles. But remaining in the customs union would mean the UK would lose the power to negotiate its own trade deals, a key demand for Brexiters. As such, Davis hopes the UK can remain in a customs union with the EU but in Brussels his plans are seen as vague or unrealistic. The latest tranche of documents comes a day after the Guardian published a leaked Home Office report that revealed a possible blueprint for a post-Brexit immigration policy. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said she would be demanding answers from ministers following the leak because it suggested the government was not prepared to wait and listen to independent advice on the issue. She argued that the government’s process for developing policy was “completely confused” and asked if any assessment had been made about the relationship between immigration proposals and any trade or single market deal. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said of the document: “It reads like a blueprint on how to strangle London’s economy, which would be devastating not just for our city but for the whole country.” The Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas described it as “economically illiterate and cruel”. The plans had a mixed reception in Brussels. One source said there was anger and real frustration that the UK is going for a “hardcore domestic immigration policy”. But many did not share this view. One usually outspoken politician, who closely follows Brexit, declined to comment, deeming the issue “a matter for the UK as a third [non-EU] country”. The issue came up at an internal meeting in the European parliament, where “there was a general sense that it was the UK’s sovereign decision to put in place a migration policy”, a source said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/07/morning-mail-a-monster-covers-us-irma-hits-the-caribbean","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T20:42:18Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: 'A monster covers us' – Irma hits the Caribbean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/07/morning-mail-a-monster-covers-us-irma-hits-the-caribbean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/07/morning-mail-a-monster-covers-us-irma-hits-the-caribbean","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: 'A monster covers us' – Irma hits the Caribbean","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 7 September. Top stories Hurricane Irma has wreaked havoc on the Caribbean Islands as it moves west towards the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Irma is the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, with category-five winds and rain ripping roofs from houses in St Barts, destroying government buildings in St Martin and bringing rolling power outages to tens of thousands of people huddled in shelters across the region. Michel Magras, senator for St Barts, wrote in a text message to French media: “I am shocked by the monster that covers us. The island is devastated ... It is apocalyptic, a lot of damage, many roofs destroyed.” So far, there are no reports of fatalities but the brunt of the storm is expected to be born by the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba and the southern Bahamas as the hurricane picks up pace and intensity as it travels westward across the warmer waters of the Caribbean. Meanwhile, in Florida, long lines continue at fuel stations and there are supply shortages of essential items as Americans prepare for the superstorm, which is predicted to make landfall on the weekend. Follow the Guardian’s live blog of Irma’s path here, where environment correspondent Oliver Milman has just posted a report on the increasing ferocity of hurricanes and how they are being influenced by climate change. The high court will announce its verdict on the same-sex marriage postal survey at 2.15pm this afternoon. The second day of hearings, on Wednesday, was dominated by the Turnbull government’s response to claims that the $122m for the survey was improperly appropriated. The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, acting for the government, challenged the right of plaintiffs to launch legal action against the survey and said the funding was lawful because it met the criteria of being unforeseen and urgent. Conservation groups are warning of “catastrophic” consequences for the threatened greater glider if logging proceeds unabated in Victoria’s central highlands. There are protections in place for the Leadbeater’s possum, which occupies similar areas, but not for the glider. Citizen scientists are warning that logging has already begun in areas known to be inhabited by the glider. The Victorian government says it is determining interim protection measures after the greater gliders were listed as a threatened species in May. The type of flammable building cladding that contributed to the Grenfell Tower disaster should be immediately banned in Australia, an inquiry has found. The use of polyethylene composite panels has been under scrutiny in the Senate since the London fire claimed 80 lives. The tower used a cheap but highly flammable type of cladding, which saves builders about $3 a square metre but puts residents at huge risk. A leaked New South Wales government submission suggested there were 2,500 buildings with the cladding in the state alone, the Senate heard. The inquiry released its report on Wednesday afternoon recommending an urgent ban. Fortune teller Pilar Abel has lost a 10-year campaign to prove she is Salvador Dalí’s only child and heir. DNA evidence taken from Dalí’s recently exhumed body has proved Abel is not related to the eccentric Spanish surrealist. In June the Spanish courts ordered a DNA test be conducted to settle the case once and for all and in July experts entered the crypt beneath the museum Dalí designed for himself in his home town of Figueres, Catalonia, to take samples from his hair, nails and bones. Abel had claimed that the resemblance between her and the artist was so marked that “the only thing I’m missing is a moustache”. Had the DNA evidence supported her claim, Abel would have been heir to a quarter of Dalí’s fortune. Scientists who entered the crypt said Dali’s famous moustache remains perfectly intact. Sport David Warner’s second successive hundred against Bangladesh helped Australia to a 72-run lead on the third day of the second and final Test in Chittagong on Wednesday. Australia had eclipsed Bangladesh’s first innings total of 305 by tea but a late collapse from the tourists left them on 377-9 at stumps, having been 298-3 at one stage, on a day where rain washed out more than a session’s play.

Thinking time The shortlist of Australia’s biggest literary prize is packed with navel-gazing, writes Jen Webb, with each of the nominated books featuring an author as a key character. But the novels – Last Days of Ava Langdon by Mark O’Flynn, Waiting by Philip Salom, An Isolated Incident by Emily Maguire, Extinctions by Josephine Wilson and Their Brilliant Careers by Ryan O’Neill – are also packed with compassion and are “the most heartwarming selection” in recent memory. The Miles Franklin awards will be announced at 8.30pm. Has David Lynch’s 40-year-career come to an end with Twin Peaks: The Return? The 18-hour star-studded series was awash with familiar Lynchian motifs: hapless criminals, crusading lawmen, slinky femmes fatale, coffee, pie and alternate dimensions. Tom Huddleston analyses the director’s latest work for clues the 71-year-old has wished his film-making career a fond farewell and is “setting aside the dense, violent, strangely comforting worlds he’s spent four decades creating” to step back into some “semblance of reality”. Think the latest GDP figures are good news for the Australian economy? Look a little closer, says Greg Jericho. Yes, the economy is growing but the elements propping up that growth are largely one-off government projects and increased household spending. “Given the low wages, growth is dependent on people reducing their savings. That is hardly sustainable.” What’s he done now? Overnight Trump has tweeted that tax cuts and tax reform are on the cards for Americans, a key campaign promise, as: “We are the highest taxed nation in the world – that will change.” The claim is patently untrue and tax experts have fired back at Trump on Twitter. “To repeat, the US has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world,” tweeted Richard Rubin, the Wall Street Journal’s tax reporter. “However, the US is a low-tax country overall.” Media roundup The Hobart Mercury splashes with renewed hopes that the elusive Tasmanian tiger lives on, and features a grainy still provided by a team of Tasmanian thylacine trackers, who say their videos and images taken from a secret location in southern Tasmania are the most reliable and convincing evidence provided so far that they still exist. The Daily Telegraph features a full-page picture of Lynette Daley, who was found dead five years ago on a remote New South Wales beach. Yesterday it took a jury just 32 minutes to convict Adrian Attwater of manslaughter, and him and Paul Maris of aggravated sexual assault. And the ABC has a report on the growing trend of “social cooling” in which the fear of online surveillance makes internet users self-conscious about what they click on, increasing the pressure to be “perfect” – even from behind a computer screen.

The chancellor asked Tory MPs to submit ideas for the budget to Kwasi Kwarteng, his parliamentary aide, as he drew attention to the difference between older people in a secure financial position and younger people saddled with huge debts if they are students. Senior Conservatives have been telling an internal review of the snap election that the party was left vulnerable by a lack of policies for younger people, who strongly backed Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. In a desperate hunt for ideas, Downing Street advisers have been touring Westminster thinktanks scouting for ideas to appeal to that demographic, after Corbyn won huge support for his policies on affordable housing, scrapping student fees, and a softer Brexit. Hammond spoke about the need to address the intergenerational gap at a private meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. One Tory MP who was present said: “There was a lot of stuff about students. He said look at us, no mortgage, everybody with a pension and never had more money in the current account. You compare that to the younger generation, if they go to university they are hit with debt … and there was a need to address that. Kwasi is his point man and we’ve been asked to submit in writing thoughts before the budget.” MPs will be expected to keep their contributions to 250 words each but were assured that their written submissions would be taken into consideration. The MP also described Hammond as being “incredibly barbed” on the subject of the Conservative election campaign, with the chancellor telling the gathering that he had only been “allowed out” to talk about the economy on rare occasions. “He talked about the fact that, in his opinion, in the election campaign not enough had been made of the economy,” the MP said. “But he basically sold how important the economy is going to be. He said if you want to see what a Corbyn Britain would look like, well, just get on the plane to Caracas.” At the end of the meeting, David Cameron made an appearance to receive his leaving gift from Tory MPs: an inscribed copy of My Early Life by Winston Churchill. The former prime minister joked that he had feared he was going to be given a copy of the biography of Churchill written by Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and former Vote Leave campaigner whose efforts cost Cameron his job in Downing Street. Johnson missed the joke as he turned up late to “pay respects” to his former leader but left the room again almost immediately, exclaiming: “Damn, I missed it.” A number of senior Tories have already been mulling over the problem of how to appeal to the young. George Freeman, the Mid Norfolk MP and chair of the Conservative policy forum, used a column in the Telegraph last week to ask: “Why would you support capitalism if you have no prospect of owning any capital?” Other senior figures, including the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, regard forcing open the housing market as key. Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, said: “The Tories have failed young people so on education, housing and living standards that it’s no surprise they were rejected so overwhelmingly at the election. “If Philip Hammond is looking for ideas to help young people, he could consult Labour’s manifesto For the Many not the Few for policies to scrap student fees, restore education maintenance grants, end the discrimination in the minimum wage and increasing it to £10 an hour for everyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/11/games-reviews-hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-matterfall-troll-and-i","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Games reviews roundup: Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice; Matterfall; Troll and I","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/11/games-reviews-hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-matterfall-troll-and-i","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/11/games-reviews-hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-matterfall-troll-and-i","fields":{"headline":"Games reviews roundup: Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice; Matterfall; Troll and I","bodyText":"Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice PS4, PC, Ninja Theory; cert: 18 ★★★★★ Mental health is poorly enough understood today, so how did people deal with psychological disorders before we even had the language to identify such conditions? That’s the central question in Hellblade, which follows Senua, a Pict woman, as she embarks on a quest to rescue a loved one from the Norse underworld. The mythology of gods and demons fits too easily with Senua’s troubled perceptions and the game does an exceptional job of conveying that to the player, questioning the legitimacy of what’s happening. Push deeper into this dark but stunningly realised world and the accompaniment is one of disembodied voices chattering near constantly, while environmental puzzles where runes are matched to open pathways could just as easily be explained as seeing things. Senua is no pitiable madwoman, though, and with solid combat mechanics, she stands her ground, even though her enemies may be but phantasms of her mind. While overly linear at times, this remains a complex and thought-provoking masterpiece. MK Matterfall PS4, Sony; cert: 12 ★★★ Finnish game developer Housemarque has made a name for itself crafting masterful modern interpretations of classic arcade forms, reinterpreting the likes of Asteroids and Defender with great skill and affection for the form. With its latest, Matterfall, the team have focused on the 2D run’n’gun template. Which makes for fast-paced platform jumping while letting rip with streams of firepower as enemies clutter the screen. Matterfall does manage to do an awful lot of things right. It plays with great flow and momentum. Sessions build in pace and energy naturally and gracefully, making for a remarkably exciting experience. There is, however, a disconnect between the title’s velocity and the intricacy of gameplay mechanics. Shooting, unleashing special attacks, altering level scenery and triggering bombs can feel a little too elaborate relative to the pure arcade pacing and, as such, what could be a finely crafted sleek affair occasionally feels ungainly. Housemarque’s effort will please genre devotees, but overall this is not the most refined work by a studio that has so often delivered truly brilliant experiences. WF Troll and I Nintendo Switch, Maximum Games; cert: 16 ★ Released on PS4, Xbox One and PC in March, Troll and I arrives on Switch, once again drawing on Nordic folklore to tell the story of a young boy, Otto, and his troll friend. Or, rather, it would if it were vaguely playable. Poorly received on other formats, the intervening months (of what one would presume to be additional development time) have done the Switch version no favours. Characters and objects are more jagged than you’d expect on the original PlayStation, let alone a 2017 console, while actually attempting to play reveals a frame rate of what feels like four per second, an unforgivably jarring experience even if everything weren’t offensively low resolution. There is the heart of an interesting The Last Guardian-esque adventure game here, as Otto and Troll use their singular skills to traverse the Scandinavian wilderness. Unfortunately, this is such a terribly optimised, blatantly rushed and ultimately unplayable mess that no one will ever know.

Medical professionals regard the practice, which sees homosexuality as a fixable “condition”, as scientifically discredited, unethical and harmful. When my first boyfriend came out, aged 15, his parents drove him to a pseudo-scientist to be cured of his homosexuality: consider this against a context of being bullied at school for being gay. Today, he is recovering from crystal meth addiction. This week, Good Morning Britain provided a platform for a “gay cure” quack named Mike Davidson. “On next we’ll meet the man who claims we can ‘cure’ homosexuality in men,” the show casually tweeted. “Any thoughts?” All of a sudden an abusive practice that inflicts horrendous psychological harm, that is rooted in extreme bigotry, in the very idea that being gay is a bad thing and that gay people should cease to exist, became an opinion worthy of national television. However much Piers Morgan harangued him, Davidson’s presence on air conferred on him a legitimacy he doesn’t deserve. There are different views, after all, on how much the rich should be taxed, or how high the minimum wage should be, or who should own the railways. But whether homosexuality should be erased by an abusive practice treated as a valid alternative perspective? Believing LGBTQ people to be inferior and desiring their disappearance from society is not simply a matter of opinion to be debated. It is bigotry – which causes profound damage to human beings. All LGBTQ people hear “gay” being bandied around as an insult from the earliest age; they may face verbal or physical bullying, from relatives, friends, people on the street; they may be rejected by family; they are relentlessly bombarded – even now – with the idea that there is something wrong with being lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or queer; they may be discriminated against in the workplace. The damage is long-lasting and profound: they have much higher rates of mental distress, of suicide, of alcohol and drug abuse. Imagine you were a teenager struggling with your sexuality – one of the loneliest feelings there is – and then saw a quack being given a platform to say you are effectively afflicted by a disease that requires a cure. We could dismiss Davidson as just a quack if it weren’t for the fact that many of our hard-won LGBTQ rights seem to be under threat. Only this week Oxford vice-chancellor Louise Richardson spoke of students who were uncomfortable “because their professor has expressed views against homosexuality”. Her job, she said, “isn’t to make you feel comfortable. Education is not about being comfortable. I’m interested in making you uncomfortable.” Apparently if students “don’t like his views”, they should simply “challenge them, engage with them”. And here is where the disingenuous “free speech” debate enters stage right. I share the Church of England’s view that “gay cure” abusive procedures should be banned in Britain. I am not proposing, however, that Davidson should be arrested or incarcerated for his reprehensible views. He should remain free to express them wherever he chooses: in his home, in a pub, standing on a soapbox in the street, distributing his own vile leaflets. That does not mean he should be granted a platform by broadcasters to disseminate his harmful bile. Being provided with a platform is not the same thing as free speech, however much it is falsely and disingenuously portrayed as such. If someone refuses to lend you a megaphone, they are not infringing your right to say what you believe: they are simply not offering you their own resources to amplify your views to a broader audience. The millions of people who never appear on TV or radio and are never provided with newspaper space to promote their views are not having their right to free speech undermined or attacked. The left is waging war on free speech, screeches the populist right on both sides of the Atlantic. Yet its interpretation of free speech is: “The right to say whatever I like about minorities without facing any challenge.” Any criticism of their expressed prejudices is treated somehow as an attack on their free speech. Like oppressors throughout history, they portray themselves as the ones who are really oppressed: they are free speech martyrs, besieged by an intolerant leftwing rabble. The one freedom they seem to truly care about is the freedom to incite bigotry; this freedom trumps the freedom of minorities to live unencumbered by prejudice, threats to personal safety, and discrimination. Words do indeed have consequences. The vilification of immigrants in the EU referendum led Britain’s small minority of abusive bigots to believe they had been legitimised and now had a mandate: hate crimes soared on Britain’s streets as a result. Perversely, it is these rightwing abusers of “free speech” who are the most chronically offended. While those on the left object to the hounding of minorities and women, the right are offended by critiques of privilege, attempts to come to terms with the past, or simply ideas that challenge injustice. When the journalist Afua Hirsch denounced Britain’s racist past and suggested Admiral Nelson’s support for slavery raised questions about whether his statue should remain, the rightwing self-professed “free speech” brigade did not rush to her defence. Quite the contrary: they frothed with outrage. When L’Oréal sacked model Munroe Bergdorf for demanding white people tackle a systemic racism bred from centuries of slavery, wars of oppression, colonial subjugation, and subsequent famines and genocides, the rightwing “free speech” brigade did not proclaim she was entitled to her opinion. Instead she was bombarded with abuse and threats of violence. Rightwing Brexiteers are continually offended and enraged by critics – scrutineers, even – of the Tories’ Brexit approach, smearing them as “saboteurs” and “enemies of the people”. Any attempt to scrutinise privilege – whether it be that granted by class, race, gender or sexuality – is greeted with paroxysms of fury by rightwing, well-heeled, white, straight male commentators who find the notion that they have been the lifelong beneficiaries of odds stacked in their favour as almost unbearably offensive. Today’s populist right is built on offence, on the twisted idea that the struggles of minorities and women for equality insults and attacks those who are white, male and straight. In an era in which prejudice and bigotry have been given renewed legitimacy, providing platforms for homophobes on national television is dangerous. Free speech is indeed sacred, a hard-won right extracted from the powerful at huge cost. It does not mean the right to incite hatred, not least on public platforms provided by others. But the bigots who clothe themselves in the garb of free speech have no real interest in it. They just want the right to hate without challenge. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/06/twin-megastorms-irma-harvey-scientists-fear-new-normal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T18:45:44Z","webTitle":"Twin megastorms have scientists fearing this may be the new normal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/twin-megastorms-irma-harvey-scientists-fear-new-normal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/06/twin-megastorms-irma-harvey-scientists-fear-new-normal","fields":{"headline":"Twin megastorms have scientists fearing this may be the new normal","bodyText":"One week after the record deluge in Texas, the biggest hurricane ever measured in the mid-Atlantic is tearing through the Caribbean. Hurricane Irma, a category-five storm, is destroying homes and threatening lives in the Leeward Islands with 185mph winds and 11ft coastal surges, and in the coming days it is forecast to hit Puerto Rico, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Florida. The governor of Florida has already declared a state of emergency. For Donald Trump, these twin megastorms are a source of awe. “Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!” he tweeted of Irma on Wednesday. “Even experts have said they’ve never seen one like this!” he posted of Harvey last week. But for many scientists they are a worrying sign of a “new normal” in which extreme weather events become more intense as a result of manmade climate change. Rather than expressing astonishment, they say policymakers need to strengthen long-term countermeasures and act more effectively on reducing carbon emissions. “Even I as a climate scientist am startled to see another potentially devastating storm in this region so shortly after Harvey,” said Anders Levermann, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Unfortunately, the physics are very clear: hurricanes get their destructive energy from ocean heat, and currently water surface temperatures in this region are very high.” Climatologists are careful to point out that rising greenhouse gas emissions are not the sole cause of hurricanes, which buffet the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico around this time every year. But there is strong evidence that warming temperatures and rising sea levels are increasing the destructive power of storms. “Higher than average sea-surface temperatures are fuelling Hurricane Irma, giving additional energy and moisture,” said Julian Heming, a hurricane expert at the Met Office. He said the impacts – intense rainfall, flash floods, extreme winds and a potentially lethal storm surge – would be felt far from the centre as Irma moves north-west. On Saint Barthélemy, Irma’s winds were measured at more than 150mph before they destroyed monitoring equipment in the island’s meteorological station. The US National Hurricane Center has said the “potentially catastrophic” storm could bring surges of up to 20ft along coasts in the southern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and between five and 12 inches of rain in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. Whether Irma will reach Florida at its current level of intensity is uncertain. Since records began in 1851, only three category five hurricanes have made landfall in the US. Following Harvey, which was a category four hurricane at its peak, a second major storm of this size in one season would be unprecedented, according to Weather Underground. But historically unusual weather is no longer freakish. The floods that hit Houston last week were described as a once-in-500-years event because records suggested there was only a 0.2% chance of such heavy rainfall. However, precedent is an increasingly unreliable guide in a changing climate. In the past three years, Texas has been hit by three 100- to 500-year events, according to local media. More could follow. The National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday it expected Tropical Storm Jose, which has formed east of the Antilles, to become a hurricane during the night. Its latest map also shows a third, smaller storm – Katia – in the Gulf of Mexico. The degree to which climate change affects the intensity of these weather events is being studied. But there is a growing sense of urgency for governments to reduce emissions and strengthen preparations for future disasters. “These events offer wider lessons on how prepared we are for a warmer future. It is likely that rainfall events, in general, will become more extreme, as will heatwaves and droughts. So events like Irma and Harvey also help us understand if we are prepared for them and who will be most affected,” said Dann Mitchell, a research fellow at the University of Bristol’s Cabot Institute. As well as better urban and emergency planning, he said, social policies would also play a part. “Increasingly, the evidence is clear that the poorest, being the most exposed to many climate risks and often being the least protected, will be most affected. Addressing this inequality is at the heart of not just the climate change discussion but all discussions about how we become resilient to risk and hazards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/07/britain-no-longer-civilised-un-disability-report","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T07:46:00Z","webTitle":"Britain is no longer a civilised country – the UN’s disability report confirms it | Frances Ryan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/07/britain-no-longer-civilised-un-disability-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/07/britain-no-longer-civilised-un-disability-report","fields":{"headline":"Britain is no longer a civilised country – the UN’s disability report confirms it","bodyText":"It’s often said that the mark of a civilised society is how it treats its most vulnerable citizens in times of austerity. And in the past week, Britain has had not one but two damning judgments – the first from a committee room in Geneva, the second in a courtroom in London. Last Thursday a United Nations inquiry into disability rights in the UK ruled that the government is failing in its duties in everything from education, work and housing to health, transport and social security. Presented with overwhelming evidence of a range of regressive policies and multibillion-pound cuts to disability services, it described the treatment of disabled people in this country as a “human catastrophe”. Less than 24 hours later, Luke Davey lost his appeal against his local council cutting his care package almost in half. I wrote about Luke in the Guardian last year, just as the then-39-year-old started his court battle. Luke is quadriplegic, has cerebral palsy and is registered blind. But in this climate of cuts to disability services, after 23 years of 24/7 support, his care hours have been suddenly gutted. Without enough funding for full-time personal assistants, his mother, Jasmine, is forced to fill in the gaps: sitting in the bungalow to ensure he’s not alone, and lifting her 14-stone son into a hoist. Jasmine, it’s worth noting, is 75 and has cancer. This is grotesque, but it becomes more grotesque still when we consider this situation is not rare. By this financial year, around 200,000 disabled people will have lost between £15,000 and £18,000 in income through a combination of cuts, from the bedroom tax to the abolition of disability living allowance. Meanwhile, 1 million disabled people now have to live without the social care they need to wash, cook, or leave the house. I am struck daily by the number of readers who tell me what’s being done to them by this government, simply because they have the nerve to be disabled and, often, poor. Grandmothers falling into depression and anxiety waiting to hear whether they’ll be deemed “fit for work”. Middle-aged men with arthritis sitting in a coat in their living room because they can’t afford to put the heating on. Young disabled women turning to sex work after having their Disability Living Allowance removed, and having no other way to pay the bills. Bit by bit, the abuse of disabled people in Britain is being normalised. This isn’t simply the result of newspapers and politicians dehumanising the “scrounging” disabled. It’s that the hardship being witnessed is now so common, so widespread, it’s as if it’s beyond comprehension. Resisting this becomes almost an act of defiance: to say that it’s not normal for a self-proclaimed global leader of disability rights to have to be shamed publicly by the United Nations over its treatment of disabled citizens; that it’s not economically necessary for one of the wealthiest nations on Earth to cut benefits and social care so deeply that disabled people are housebound, hungry, or suicidal. When the “most vulnerable citizens” line is used by well-meaning voices, there’s a secret second sentence that’s rarely uttered: disabled people, truth be told, do not need to be vulnerable. Contrary to the myth sold by years of austerity, to be afraid, desperate or isolated is not a normal state of affairs for people with disabilities. Vulnerability comes when politicians choose to pull the support disabled people need in order to live dignified, fulfilling, independent lives – knowing full well the misery it will cause. “I’m nervous, really nervous,” Luke had told me last year when I asked how he was feeling about his court battle. “But I have to do it. If I don’t, God knows what will happen to me or my mum.” This was the week this country lost the right to call itself civilised. If that doesn’t shame politicians to address its treatment of disabled citizens, surely nothing will. • Frances Ryan is a journalist and political commentator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/06/a-penal-system-suitable-for-the-21st-century","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T18:33:22Z","webTitle":"A penal system suitable for the 21st century | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/06/a-penal-system-suitable-for-the-21st-century","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/06/a-penal-system-suitable-for-the-21st-century","fields":{"headline":"A penal system suitable for the 21st century","bodyText":"Your letters (4 September) prompt me to respond, in the light of Thursday’s Lords debate on overcrowding in prisons, initiated by Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, a distinguished retired justice of the supreme court. There should be two immediate outcomes of the debate. First, a short-term plan so that courts can reflect that their lengthy sentences of imprisonment are no greater deterrent than short sentences. The advisory council on the penal system advocated as much in its report on maximum sentences in July 1977. The courts seem nevertheless to have ignored the precept. Second, in the longer term, the government should now establish an independent review of the penal system suitable for the 21st century, reporting in two years’ time.

They would require significant investment in the mental health services available to the police, but at a time when police chiefs are warning of a “perfect storm” due to staff shortages and budget cuts, alongside reported cuts in mental health services. One wonders whether the Angiolini review will face the same fate as frequent previous reports looking at deaths in state detention, including the 2015 Harris review on self-inflicted deaths of young people in prison, which saw the government reject 30 of its recommendations .

Stephen McConville, who trains Anseanachai Cliste near Portadown in Northern Ireland, and his son Michael, who is the nine-year-old’s owner and regular jockey, will face a disciplinary panel on 19 September to answer a series of charges relating to the alleged possession and administration of cobalt, which can boost a horse’s red blood cell count, and Adrenal Cortex, which is described by one online supplier of equine veterinary products as “a potent anti-inflammatory agent providing some analgesia along with a sense of euphoria to the horse”. The listing adds that Adrenal Cortex “works best when used close to the start of the event, because the duration of action is very short”. Anseanachai Cliste, a prolific winner in point-to-points, was a 33-1 outsider for the Foxhunters’, the race after the Cheltenham Gold Cup on 17 March. His sudden scratching on the day was explained at the time only by a report that “the stewards could not be satisfied he had been administered only normal food and water on race day”. Nine days after his withdrawal at Cheltenham, Anseanachai Cliste beat 11 opponents in the Ulster National at Downpatrick, winning a first prize of €15,375 (about £13,500). The gelding passed a subsequent dope test but reports emerged in early July that suggested Anseanachai Cliste had failed a test ordered by the stewards on 17 March and that a blood-covered syringe had been recovered from his box at the track. Both the substances involved and the circumstances and location in which they were allegedly discovered will ensure that it will be one of the most high-profile cases to come before the BHA’s disciplinary panel in recent years. It is the first in Britain to involve a positive test for cobalt, which is believed to increase endurance in racehorses. It was the subject of a series of positive dope tests in Australia in 2015, however, which led to high-profile disciplinary cases against trainers including Peter Moody, famous for his handling of the outstanding champion Black Caviar, and Danny O’Brien, whose Star Witness was placed in two Group One sprints at Royal Ascot in 2011. O’Brien and Mark Kavanagh, another of Australia’s leading trainers, were banned for four and three years respectively in January 2016 but won a court case to have their bans overturned having argued they were unaware their vet, Dr Tom Brennan, had administered the drug. Moody, who received a six-month ban in March 2016, has not renewed his trainer’s licence following his suspension. The maximum penalty for both the presence of a banned substance in a horse’s sample and the administration, or attempted administration, of a prohibited drug is a 10-year ban from the sport, though the “entry point” penalty is a two-year ban. Both Stephen and Michael McConville also face charges they misled, or endeavoured to mislead, stewards or officials investigating the incident, which carries a maximum penalty of a three-year ban. Saturday’s feature race in Britain, the Group One Sprint Cup at Haydock Park, has been moved to an earlier slot on the card to ensure it is run on the best possible ground. The six-furlong contest was scheduled to start at 4.10pm but will now be run as the third race on the card at 2.25pm. The dual Group One winner Limato is still unlikely to make the lineup, however, with the ground at Haydock expected to be too soft for the five-year-old. “I think the ground will be too soft and there’s more rain forecast,” Henry Candy, Limato’s trainer, said on Wednesday. “Unfortunately, I think the same applies to York on Sunday [where Limato is entered in the Garrowby Stakes] which is a shame, as that would have been a nice race for him.” Thursday’s tips, by Greg Wood Haydock Park 2.00 Line Of Beauty 2.30 Ginbar 3.00 Global Conqueror 3.30 Archie (nap) 4.00 Donjuan Triumphant 4.35 Azari (nb) 5.05 Diamonds A Dancing Salisbury 1.50 Nuits St Georges 2.20 Dandiesque 2.50 Blanchefleur 3.20 Clairette 3.50 Special Purpose 4.20 Under The Covers 4.50 Tomorrow Mystery 5.20 Ashazuri Sedgefield 2.10 Runasimi River 2.40 My Renaissance 3.10 Mont Choisy 3.40 Rough Justice 4.10 Gibson Park 4.40 Aristocracy 5.10 Nemean Lion Chelmsford City 5.40 Gold Filigree 6.10 Dream Of Delphi 6.40 Hidden Stash 7.10 Cloud Nine 7.40 Jufn 8.10 Maghfoor 8.40 Newstead Abbey 9.10 Airway"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/06/hidden-destructive-costs-of-a-vegan-diet","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T18:32:22Z","webTitle":"Hidden, destructive costs of a vegan diet | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/06/hidden-destructive-costs-of-a-vegan-diet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/06/hidden-destructive-costs-of-a-vegan-diet","fields":{"headline":"Hidden, destructive costs of a vegan diet","bodyText":"I predict the rise in vegan junk food (Yes-vegan!, G2, 6 September) will be followed by the realisation that vegan junk food is, after all, junk food. The global rise in obesity, metabolic disease and type 2 diabetes, now reaching epidemic proportions, has accompanied our increasing consumption of junk food, particularly of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates trigger insulin production and fat storage; on that score vegan junk food is no better than other junk food. Many adopt a vegan diet over concerns about animal welfare, but they conveniently overlook that there is no way of eating that does not involve death and destruction. Millions of acres of rainforest have been destroyed for soya production, leading to devastating loss of biodiversity. Modern crop production with its heavy use of pesticides has led to great losses in soil fertility, birds and wildlife. The human body is perfectly adapted to an omnivorous diet. Herbivores are adapted to a herbivorous diet. Many who have followed a vegan diet, even for many years, eventually realise that their health has suffered without supplementation. Without careful planning it is very difficult to obtain all the nutrients one needs in a vegan diet and this has to be a particular concern with children. When considering an ethical and healthy way to live, we should primarily aim to avoid overconsumption and also promote truly high standards of agriculture and animal welfare.

With substantial bipartisan support in a voice vote, the House approved the so-called Self Drive Act, which seeks to speed the introduction of self-driving vehicles on US roads by streamlining the regulatory process. A new law does not appear to be imminent, however, as corresponding legislation is yet to be introduced in the Senate. Recent terror attacks in Charlottesville,, London, Nice and elsewhere have involved vehicles being driven into crowds. Under the House bill, self-driving or autonomous vehicles would need to be equipped with defenses against hacking, “unauthorized intrusions and false and spurious messages or vehicle control commands”. “I am pleased that proper cybersecurity protections are in place in this bill … to prevent and tackle potential hacks and/or terrorism,” said Yvette Clarke, a Democrat from New York, in a floor speech. Proponents of autonomous vehicles say they will reduce highway deaths, provide greater mobility for seniors and disabled people and cut fuel consumption. Critics point out that truck driving is one of the most common occupations in the US. According to a May report from Goldman Sachs Economics Research, an estimated 300,000 driving jobs could be lost each year to self-driving technology. The House bill asserts federal regulatory authority over “highly automated vehicles” and limits state-by-state oversight. Preventing a patchwork of state regulations from cropping up before mass production of self-driving vehicles gets under way will help the market for the vehicles take hold, industry observers say. Consumer advocates have expressed concern about constraining the states. “The main concern is that it does away with the states’ ability to have any safety standards in place,” John Simpson, spokesman for the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, told the Mercury News. “All we’ve gotten is some loose guidance.” Safety on US highways under current rules is poor and deteriorating. Deaths in motor vehicle accidents in 2016 rose by 6% to 40,200, according to National Safety Council estimates. The legislation also requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to “identify elements that may require performance standards” including “human-machine interface, sensors, and actuators”. The conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute has criticized the bill, saying that the NHTSA is not equipped to write and enforce cybersecurity standards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/12/till-times-last-sand-review-david-kynaston-bank-of-england","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"Till Time’s Last Sand review – a bloodless history of the Bank of England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/12/till-times-last-sand-review-david-kynaston-bank-of-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/12/till-times-last-sand-review-david-kynaston-bank-of-england","fields":{"headline":"Till Time’s Last Sand review – a bloodless history of the Bank of England","bodyText":"The Bank of England was founded in July 1694 in Mercers’ Hall, with £1.2m raised in subscriptions from a group of gentlemen. A century and a half later, this is how the American writer Henry Adams described London, the capital of the most powerful nation on Earth: “Heavy, clumsy, arrogant, purse-proud, but not cheap; insular but large; barely tolerant of an outside world, and absolutely self-confident.” He added: “Everyone seemed insolent and the most insolent structures in the world were the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England.” Fifty years after this, in 1901, a similar insight is provided by a Spanish philosopher, George Santayana, who was invited by a friend for dinner at the Bank. The dining room, he wrote, had a “dingy Dickensian look of solidity grown old-fashioned, a bit shabby”. He noted the “superannuated butler” and a meal consisting of mock-turtle soup, boiled halibut, roast mutton, gooseberry tart, anchovies on toast and a bottle of claret and a bottle of port. Details such as these provide the foundation for David Kynaston’s commanding history of the Bank of England. This is the ultimate account of the mother of British establishment institutions, replete with detail, meticulously researched, based on a series of interviews with key players and historians, alongside primary source material research, all logged in the copious notes section at the end. From the South Sea Bubble to the Napoleonic wars via the two world wars, the author paints a picture of an organisation that sought, wherever possible, to insulate itself from the outside world. Only when turbulence threatens its own walls does it take up cudgels, such as in 1780, during the anti-Catholic Gordon riots or in 1848, the year of revolutions across Europe. Kynaston describes the scene: “The Bank took no chances. On Friday, 7 April, with the great Chartist demonstration due to take place at Kennington Common on the 10th, all able-bodied members of staff were sworn in as special constables.” For all the pomposity, the Bank was rarely sure of its place in the hierarchy. Over its first century, the 18th century, it was but one of many establishments that sought to issue and preside over the distribution of bank notes. As the British empire was gaining ascendancy, the Bank was sometimes seen as rapacious and gauche. David Ricardo wrote to John Stuart Mill in 1815: “I think the Bank an unnecessary establishment, getting rich by those profits which fairly belong to the public.” One of the great strengths of this 896-page, one-volume tome is the acute portrayal of each and every relationship between Bank governor and prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer. The arguments revolved around issues similar to today – liquidity, money supply, growth and borrowing. Yet no matter what era, economic circumstance or political party, that relationship depended on the personalities of the three and more often than not it was infused with tension. William Gladstone, for one, could not abide the Bank’s elite. He repeatedly sent them letters on the management of the national debt, requiring them to cut back on the Bank’s internal remuneration. In other words, they were paying themselves too much. Where have we heard that before? Sometimes, the Bank listened to its political masters; sometimes, it ignored them, convinced it was impervious to pressure. No matter how long they survived, each governor ultimately depended on the political relationship. One, in the modern era, was Gordon Richardson. His last day coincided with Margaret Thatcher’s first in office. She, like many prime ministers, wanted a new broom. He was, the author notes, “the last of the governors to be treated – and, in his case, sometimes to demand to be treated – as akin to an eastern potentate”. What sticks out about this last phrase is its rarity. For reasons I cannot fathom, Kynaston chooses to denude this book of emotion and opinion. For sure it is a reference book, an authorised history, and some in the financial world will pore over the “who said what to whom” and the micro-detail of a particular chief cashier. But for the general audience, this is a bloodless read, inexplicably so, from a master socioeconomic craftsman. Each war, each trend, is reduced to a sentence of two. Instead they could have been woven into the narrative with much greater colour and context without diluting the core focus. By the mid 1990s, as globalisation takes hold and Davos Man reigns supreme, the “cult of the central bank was gathering global momentum”. The stunning surprise of the first week of New Labour – granting independence to the Bank – is compellingly recalled. The book ends with the lessons of the financial crash, the recklessness and avarice of the bankers and the weakness of the Bank and the regulator, the FSA. These are my words, not the author’s. He monitors all the detail, but barely hazards a comment, except to say by way of conclusion: “For all our sakes, it is important that central bankers are seen neither as heroes nor villains.” I close the book, scratching my head. I am absorbed by the material, but I am not sure what to make of it. • Till Time’s Last Sand: A History of the Bank of England 1694-2013 by David Kynaston is published by Bloomsbury (£35).

Azerbaijan is particularly keen to present a positive image in Europe because it needs significant European support for its flagship project – the Southern Gas Corridor – despite the regime’s serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and election rigging. The corridor, one of the biggest infrastructure projects undertaken by the fossil fuel industry with a total cost of about $45bn, will carry gas from Azerbaijan to Europe. Powerful interests from fossil fuel corporations to European governments are pushing through this unnecessary project against the will of communities and threatening human rights and a safe climate. The Southern Gas Corridor and its importance to the Aliyev regime is the missing piece of the puzzle and partly explains why the Azerbaijani regime is so heavily involved in lobbying at the European level and related money-laundering activities.

In 2013 David Cameron, then prime minister, pledged to put an end to tax avoidance through tougher transparency rules in the UK and our overseas territories. Yet more than four years on, the government has still not managed to fully close loopholes that enable wrongdoers to hide money and multinationals to avoid paying their fair share of tax. Oxfam pushed for a review of Scottish limited partnerships and they are now required to publish details of company ownership, but these rules must be closely scrutinised and enforced to ensure there is no misuse of the system. UK-linked tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands are still sheltering corrupt money and untaxed profits by refusing to make public registers of company ownership. Tax avoidance – often through tax havens – costs developing countries billions of dollars each year that could pay for schools and life-saving healthcare. Until politicians take decisive action on these issues, the world’s poorest people will continue to pay the price.

They don’t know how deep it is, 6 September) suggests that the young’s progressive attitudes have arisen because those who influence them have left-leaning views and have taken over the institutions whose ideas are influential. He is wrong. The reasons are much more simple. The young are dissatisfied because they lack secure jobs and work for organisations that only care about shareholder value so don’t value staff who want to do a quality job, and who don’t make any real commitment to their staff’s training or work satisfaction, while demanding long hours. The young can’t get secure housing at a reasonable cost, are indebted to the hilt if they went to university and are faced with climate change, being poisoned by air pollution and plastic in the water and have a government that has no comprehension of ordinary people’s lives. All these issues stem from the glorification of the free market which underpins this government. So regulation – be it of companies, landlords or the banking sector – is considered basically unnecessary. Along with this is the idea that people are only motivated by money, hence benefit sanctions, together with the notion that those who use the service must pay (tuition fees and rail fares) rather than the collective taxpayer (except if it is banking, of course). The question Montgomerie should ask is, given the underlying Conservative ideology: what is in it for the young? Why would they vote for them?

It’s now clear that the concerns raised by students, graduates and their families need to be addressed. At the same time, the debate needs to be grounded in evidence – we need to understand what the issues really are, and what is the best way forward in resolving them. The current undergraduate funding system in England is not broken, and the evidence supports this. It allows all those who are qualified and wish to enter higher education to do so – there are no arbitrary restrictions on student numbers. It is a socially progressive system and supports students from all types of backgrounds to enter university. It feeds the current and future demand for higher level skills, and this is essential for the UK’s economy to grow, be internationally competitive, and to raise living standards for all. Yet concerns about the system have been mounting. Students are worried about meeting the costs of living, the burden of debt and the cost of servicing it. They fear that student debt will impact on life-changing decisions in the future. These concerns cannot go unheard or be ignored. Student loans are not like any other forms of debt; they act as a safety net whereby, if a graduate does not earn enough to repay their loan, the government forgives it. Yet the misperception that a student loan is conventional debt is pervasive and deep-rooted. We must act now so that the gulf between perception and reality does not adversely impact on the future decision-making of graduates. Living costs while studying are another area of concern. The evidence shows that students are most concerned about the money in their pocket while studying, more so than repaying loans once they are earning. England could learn valuable lessons from the recent review conducted in Wales which looked at this question. That review concluded that a fair and sustainable system would see students take out tuition fee loans, while the government provides maintenance support through a combination of loans and grants. Addressing these concerns is no easy task. Universities want to be part of the solution, working in partnership with the government and students. We want to retain all that is beneficial in the current system, but to see it become fairer for students. This is why we are proposing three areas where we would like to make improvements to the system in England. Firstly, the government should look at the option of providing targeted maintenance grants to students. While a system of maintenance loans currently operates, how could this be modified to make the system fairer and more transparent to students? It should also look at the amount of debt that low and middle-income earners have to pay back once they graduate. Could this be reduced through lowering the interest rate to targeted groups? Finally, we need a step change in how the current student funding system in England is communicated. The language of loans and debt has connotations of burden and restriction.The government writing off debt is an important source of support to graduates, not a burden. It is effectively taking responsibility for paying for one third of the cost of educating students. We must do more to ensure this is well understood. Amid all the intense public scrutiny, it is easy to forget that the current student funding system in England has opened doors for more students than ever before. The positive features of the current system should be acknowledged and further strengthened to ensure it can work even better for current and future students. At Universities UK, we look forward to working with the government and students to achieve this.

Her market would have VCs competing for the highest salaries while keeping the cost of employees as low as possible (experienced staff made redundant, zero-hours contracts and capped pay). Higher education in this country is still, in the main, part of the public sector and most universities are not-for-profit with charitable objectives. Student fees, underwritten by government, fund universities as a whole; VCs’ salaries are not separate from this. The 1992 Further and Higher Education Act reduced the size of boards of governors and simultaneously required a majority of members to be independent (in effect, drawn from business). Prior to this act, governors included a majority of elected students, academic and non-academic staff and local authority representation. This change effectively removed democratic accountability and shifted the balance away from education and research to that of business. The level of VCs’ salaries have since been determined by remuneration committees, made up of independent board members with little accountability. It would seem that many VCs’ priorities are financial and not educational, unlike the staff who, despite worsening conditions of service, continue to be committed to the production of knowledge through teaching and research.

But it proves impossible to implement effectively and fairly in practice for any complex role because measurable outcomes, and who is responsible for achieving them, becomes impossible to define and therefore fairly reward. Despite its popularity in business, it is based on the fallacy that reversing failure or, harder still, maintaining and constantly improving excellence can be attributable to one person. Performance is a function of motivation; in turn the outcome of good management. Ensuring good management is effective in achieving desired outcomes requires leadership. It is a self-serving myth of the HR industry that pay is the motivating force of good leadership: that is down to wisdom, insight, commitment and pride, which generate a common unity of purpose among all the members of an organisation. Palpably excessive reward of a CEO at the expense of the people who have achieved the results for which he is solely credited is as counter-productive as it is unfair. And expensive. To misapply this myth to the public sector simply compounds the mistake. Keith Farman St Albans, Hertfordshire • The vice-chancellor of Oxford University said that although her pay is “high compared to her junior colleagues at Oxford, when compared to a footballer, it looks very different”. Even if one accepts this non sequitur, disregarding the fact that, unlike publicly funded UK universities, footballers operate in a private sphere, an apt analogy would be that of a football manager and a lecturer at a university. The median salary differential for football managers compared to players in the English Premier League is estimated to be around 1.8 fold, in favour of the players. A similar calculation for highly paid vice-chancellors compared to a lecturer is a whopping eight fold in favour of VCs. It is somewhat irrelevant whether the rise in salaries of the vice-chancellors is incidentally or directly correlated to the rise in tuition fees. Whenever the high salaries of academics in publicly funded institutions is brought up, even if by “tawdry” politicians (who are paid less than a quarter of some vice-chancellors), the trope of “operating in a global marketplace” is resurrected. One doesn’t begrudge Professor Richardson her salary, but if salary was the sole criterion of competence and ability, than most UK vice-chancellors would be replaced by their US counterparts of private universities in the global marketplace. Dr Aamir Ahmed King’s College London • I don’t suppose Louise Richardson has had time to read Chaucer’s description of the Clerk of Oxenford; but his love of teaching and learning at the expense of worldly success wouldn’t cut much ice with vice-chancellors anyway. Nor with the head and bursar at St Olave’s, I guess (Head set up firm to trademark ‘St Olave’s’, 6 September). John Bailey St Albans, Hertfordshire • Could Sonia Sodha (Where do all the fees go, Vice-Chancellor?, 6 September)tell us the salary she deems appropriate for the head of the university only recently determined as the best in the world, and her basis for its calculation? Could she also calculate what percentage of the university’s turnover the vice-chancellor’s current salary amounts to, taking great care to get the right number of zeros in front of the first digit please? Jonathan Harris Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire • What the taxpayer is getting for Oxford University’s handsome remuneration of its vice-chancellor is all too transparent. For examples: T Blair, MA Oxon (Iraq and Afghanistan disasters, millions killed, injured or displaced, Middle East on fire, world destabilised); D Cameron, MA Oxon (worthless EU referendum blunder with drastic consequences); T May, MA Oxon (dismissed 20,000 police officers amid a terrorist onslaught); M Gove, MA Oxon (will education ever recover?) and B Johnson, MA Oxon (international statesman largely incapable of speaking without causing offence) to name but a few. Pro tanto quid retribuamus? (What can we give in return for so much?) Mere coin fails a grateful nation.

It was the first time I saw female characters allowed to be just funny: not having to facilitate plot, ask key questions, be a love interest; just be funny. One is an idiot, the other is more of an idiot, that’s it. The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten I had to eat spaghetti covered in egg and lettuce for an episode of Peep Show. I was sat next to David Mitchell, who had a lot of blue eyeshadow on which also made it uncomfortably funny. We filmed the one scene all day and I had to dig my nails into my hands to stop myself from corpsing. The funniest standup I’ve ever seen Harry Hill. I went to see him when I was 14 with my dad at the Watford Colosseum. He came on stage, kicked a toilet seat and said: “Is there another word for euphemism?” It was brilliant and I got a Stouffer to take home. The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen Two Soups by Victoria Wood. Everything about it, the timing, the walk, the unexplained blinking, the whack on the hearing aid, the near corpsing. I think that Julie Walters is a heroic talent; she disappears into her characters. The funniest heckle I’ve ever had Nancy Dell’Olio came to see my Edinburgh show, but clearly hadn’t been warned it mainly featured me dressed as a Moomin. Halfway through, she got up and said to her party, “I’m bored, let’s get champagne”, and left the venue. The funniest person I know It’s probably still my brother; no one can make me laugh as quickly as he can. I’m sure he’s the reason I do comedy: he used to tease me mercilessly and then encourage me to work on my comebacks. The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned I have a dress covered in 800 tampons for a documentary I did on period poverty for The Last Leg. It looks like a 1920s flapper dress until you get close and see it’s actually 800 tampons swinging away.

He is the one who refused to listen after being discarded as a youngster; the former factory worker who defied the doubters by becoming the unlikeliest of Premier League champions and England internationals. Now he is the one who wants to give others like him a second chance. It is Vardy’s belief too few professional clubs look hard enough in non-league football and his hope the academy he has set up with his agent, John Morris, will offer lost or overlooked players the opportunity to follow in his footsteps. The Leicester City striker speaks from a position of authority, having been released by Sheffield Wednesday at 16, and he is on a mission to prove English football’s backwaters contain a heavy flow of talent. “I don’t have to do any of it,” he says, “but I know what I had to do to get to where I am and from playing in non-league I was playing against players who should have had pro clubs.” The nascent V9 Academy has enjoyed early success. This summer Vardy’s scouts picked out 42 applicants to take part in a week-long programme at Manchester City’s Etihad Campus; four players, Danny Newton, Alex Penny, Lamar Reynolds and Blair Turgott, landed professional contracts. Newton, a 26-year-old maintenance engineer, has scored three goals in his first five matches for Stevenage after joining the League Two side from Tamworth. Because he never had an agent, he has never known if any scouts were looking at him. Newton did not rise through the academy system, despite spending time at Leicester’s centre of excellence when he was younger, and he has never had a trial anywhere. He still carries his boots to games and has heart, speed and finishing ability. Newton scored 29 goals for Tamworth in the National League North last season. “I’ve just played non-league,” he says. “I was at Hinckley United in the Conference North when I was 17. I broke into the first team and was playing every week for three years and they went bust.” Newton’s strike partner at Hinckley was Andre Gray, who joined Watford for £18.5m from Burnley this summer. “Luton took him and he’s progressed after getting that chance,” Newton says. “I’ve just left it a bit late. I’m 5ft 11in, I’m quite physical on the pitch, so it’s nothing to do with size. A lot of it’s right place, right time.” Vardy sank into the eighth tier of English football after being let go by Wednesday, joining Stocksbridge Park Steels. He had spells with Halifax Town and Fleetwood Town before Leicester signed him for £1m five years ago. Accustomed to the robust physicality of non-league, he had to adjust to the pace of the Championship. However his experience had steeled him, with his raw, sharp-edged style helping Leicester win the Premier League two seasons ago. Now Vardy surveys the money spent by Premier League clubs in the summer and argues there are smarter ways to find players. “With clubs now it is all about instant success,” he says. “They want it here and now.” Chris Ramsey, who coached at the academy, concurs with that assessment. “Jamie’s proved a lot of people wrong coming in through the back door,” the former Queens Park Rangers manager says. “Clubs need to be more patient with regards to people who are released, how long they stay in the club. Timing is a major factor. “If you bring in Jamie Vardy for £1m from non-league, or you get someone with an exotic name from somewhere else, sometimes fans do become a little bit snobby. Rather than giving one of these lads the opportunity to be developed, sometimes people want what they think will be successful straight away. “Owners are also in it for their egos, aren’t they? It’s like who has the most expensive car or flashiest house? There’s an avenue now for owners to be looking down as regards getting players in from the lower divisions. Sometimes the environment changes and the player flourishes.” Ramsey and Vardy wonder if the academy system provides youngsters with too much, too soon. “Some youngsters are overpaid because they don’t realise the opportunity they have been given,” Ramsey says. “They haven’t got the resilience of players who have been given a second chance.” Turgott also joined Stevenage but his upbringing contrasts with Newton’s. He was at West Ham from the age of nine and counted Nathaniel Chalobah and Raheem Sterling as team-mates in England youth teams but he bounced from one unsatisfactory loan spell to the next and found under-21 football lacked stimulation. “Going to Bromley last season gave me security and a platform just to show what you’re about for a whole season,” the 23-year-old midfielder says. “I benefited from it – not having the comfort of knowing I was going to play but having that consistency. You learn things about yourself.” Perhaps the simple truth is Turgott did not meet West Ham’s standards, that to criticise a club is to look past a player’s responsibility to control his destiny. Maybe there never will be another footballer who will experience a rise as meteoric as Vardy’s. There is a chance he is an outlier, an exceptional player who was always going to return to the top at some point. Yet his argument is that clubs will never know unless they go to the trouble of finding out. “The main aim was to get the lads into the professional game when they’re not getting the chance for whatever reason,” he says. “Either no one was going to watch them or they were dropped from the pro club and had just gone into non-league hoping straight away they’ll be back up but it doesn’t always work like that. “The thing we have changed is the fact we are getting the scouts there to run the rule over them. When the academy was on, a lot of the lads were coming up to me and saying: ‘Even if I don’t get signed, at least after this I will know.’” The Next Jamie Vardy starts on Sky 1 on Saturday 16 September at 1130am."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/15/how-to-eat-fried-chicken","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"How to eat: fried chicken","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/15/how-to-eat-fried-chicken","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/15/how-to-eat-fried-chicken","fields":{"headline":"How to eat: fried chicken","bodyText":"Attempting to identify Britain’s national dish is a mug’s game. It is a question too wrapped up in history, culture and emotion, rather than straight sales. There is no objective metric. But, by any criteria, fried chicken must surely be a frontrunner? “The chicken shop is London,” declared Munchies earlier this year and, with over 8000 in the capital – roughly one for every thousand Londoners – who could argue? Other cities may lack an identifiable scene star like Elijah Quashie, aka. the Chicken Connoisseur, or a dedicated chicken shop app, but there is a similar hunger for fried chook across the UK. And not just among teenagers. Bargain bucket joints may be flourishing, but so too are gourmet “dude food” diners pushing jazzed-up, buttermilk-marinated poultry to picky urban 20-somethings. Chicken shops are generally talked about in narrow terms of poverty and obesity, while their hip cousins enjoy rapturous reviews, but, in their appeal and viability, they have a lot in common. You may add kimchi to your fried chicken rather than ketchup, but, however you dress it up, fried chicken is thriving because people of all stripes love filthy food. As a nation, we have fallen hard for succulent meat in a crisp, spicy coating. Moreover, whether that chicken is factory-farmed in South America or reared free-range in Suffolk, it has taken off as a product – grown wings, so to speak – because it is a comparatively cheap protein, which you can easily train people to cook. Necessity is the mother of invention, and in an age of austerity when there is a dire shortage of skilled chefs, fried chicken is a simple, popular, cost-effective menu item. But what is the best way to eat it? Fried chicken or fried chicken? It is most closely associated with the US (where West African slaves or, possibly their Scottish oppressors, introduced it), but there are numerous global variations on fried chicken, particularly in Asia: Malaysian turmeric fried chicken served with nasi lemak; Korean fried chicken; Japan’s potato starch-powered karaage. In Spain, at A Fuego Negro, the kitchen coats its birds in what tastes like crushed, ready salted crisps, to create the finest chicken How To Eat has ever tasted. For the sake of brevity, however, we will concentrate here on what we understand as southern fried, post-KFC chicken, and menu items common in our new wave, US-inspired diners. Pieces and prep HTE does not cook but, in getting serious about fried chicken, there are certain issues it must address. For instance, there is a clear hierarchy of cuts. Thighs and drumsticks offer by far the best flavour and, unlike wings (more gristle and bone than meat; too much work, too little reward), justify the hassle of having to gnaw that brown meat from the bone. Chicken breast, be it whole or in dipping strips, is tolerable but dull: bland, woolly, dry. Beloved of unadventurous diners. HTE must also dip into marinades, seasonings and sauces, to make two points. Firstly, unless you have entered Satan’s Killer Wings 2017, this is not a competition. Cayenne heat is one of many seasonings that, if combined intelligently, should produce a moreish savoury complexity in your chicken – not a huge wallop of lip-numbing heat. Secondly, it may look attractive – often the primary concern in modern pro kitchens – but fried chicken should not arrive slathered in sauce. It turns the coating flabby, but it also removes choice for the diner. If they want to add a crazy hot sauce, they can, as they see fit. But pre-saucing leaves the public at the kitchen’s mercy. Never a good place to be. Burgers and sandwiches Creating an epic fried chicken sandwich is a bit like creating a communist utopia. Yes, it is theoretically possible (think: soft, durable bun; high-quality chicken in a coating with an audible crunch; Sriracha mayonnaise; pickles), but it has gone wrong so many times it is difficult to keep faith with it as a practical project. The world is awash with OTT burgers and sandwiches, based around a flavourless, rubbery slab of rapidly-cooling breast meat, which, to try and disguise that flavour void, come topped with all sorts of things (mulchy tomatoes; drab lettuce; bacon; hash browns; cheese; chorizo; hot salsa etc), that coagulate into a great wodge of texturally indistinguishable stodge of muddled flavours. All housed in a stale and/ or shrunken bun, which falls apart after two mouthfuls. Note: HTE refuses to lower itself by discussing fried chicken doughnut burgers. Grow up, world. Fried chicken meals By which HTE means fried chicken and chips. Because what else would you eat it with? Salad? If so, why? Perhaps it is feasible you could produce an impressive meal of fried chicken and salad but – the road to good intentions being paved with hellish moments – you are going to eat many terrible meals on that journey, while fried chicken’s perfect partner already exists. To be clear, when HTE says chips we of course mean fries: rustling, taut, tanned, glistening sticks of starch – each fistful a hot ‘n’ salty, blandly carb-y lull between mouthfuls of assertively savoury chicken. Accompaniments and sides Chicken and chips is a complete meal. But capitalism relies on selling you things you do not need. Restaurants cannot leave it there. You should. Sweet potato fries (enduringly vile) or galumphing potato wedges are, like triple-cooked chips, way too heavy in this context. Similarly, with the exception of corn-on-the-cob (a bizarrely healthy interloper of zero culinary merit), everything else regularly offered with fried chicken appears to promise hedonistic indulgence, but, actually, quickly tips this richly calorific meal over from being a satisfying blow-out, into an episode of chronic indigestion and fierce self-recrimination. Sweet potato mash? Waffles? Mac ‘n’ cheese? BBQ beans? Onion rings? All of these are too much of a bad thing. There are two exceptions: kimchi and coleslaw, as long as the latter tends to the zippy “Asian slaw” end of the spectrum, not the mayo-logged. Both offer a little clean, acidic punctuation, a brief spritz of freshness, in this otherwise deliriously greasy meal. Sauces With the honourable exception of chicken gravy, you are looking for a similar brief, bracing contrast from the sauces – some pep, heat or sharpness. As outlined, these must be served on the side and, crucially, not in tiny, fiddly pots, but in containers with a large aperture so you can comfortably dip your chicken pieces. Good sauces Ketchup; curry; acidulated or hot mayos (never plain unless on a sandwich); loosened gochujang; very garlicky aioli; hot sauces (at the sensible, not A&amp;E, end of the Scoville scale); Hollandaise for artery-hardening luxury; Thai-style, lime-spiked dipping sauces. Bad sauces Jammy BBQ or sweet chilli sauces (commercial versions are, invariably, appalling); anything involving honey, this is not dessert; blue cheese (a bully); soy-based sauces that add a fuggy, muggy layer of meatiness. Serving There are undoubtedly people (amassing BTL, as you read this), who regularly make fried chicken at home. Good luck to them. They must have a lot of time on their hands. For the rest of us, fried chicken is a takeaway or restaurant job. One that must not be served on plates, but in buckets, cartons, greaseproof-paper lined baskets or polystyrene trays. Both because it feels intuitively right and because everything gets cold too quickly otherwise. Fried chicken needs to be contained in some way to retain its heat. Use your fingers of course, not cutlery (how could you?), and stock-up on a sizeable wad of napkins. You will need them. When After midday and before 4.30am. Let’s keep this civilised. Drink Something fizzy that will periodically scrub your mouth clean, whose brash, bustling flavours (craft keg IPA, full-fat cola etc.), are sufficiently in-your-face to hold their own amid all that heat, salt and fat. Delicate still drinks – water, white wine – are not only ineffective, they will make the whole meal die in your mouth. So, fried chicken, how do you eat yours?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2017/sep/13/government-backtracks-from-finkels-clean-energy-target-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T09:10:18Z","webTitle":"Greens may have numbers to sink Dutton's citizenship bill – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/sep/13/government-backtracks-from-finkels-clean-energy-target-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2017/sep/13/government-backtracks-from-finkels-clean-energy-target-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Greens may have numbers to sink Dutton's citizenship bill – as it happened","bodyText":"The Senate is now due to sit most of the night debating the media reform legislation, so expect some tired and cranky senators when we return tomorrow. But given the number of people who want to speak on the legislation, the bill will probably still be on the agenda for Thursday. The government doesn’t look like shifting its focus off energy policy anytime soon and Labor doesn’t appear inclined to let it. I hope everyone is as excited by that prospect as I am. Summing up today: We learnt nothing concrete about the government’s position on its energy policy, other than it is still struggling with how to handle a clean energy target, which in itself, is also not new. The anti-vilification legislation, designed to place safeguards around the marriage equality campaign was passed, with support from the Coalition, Labor, Greens, Derryn Hinch and the Nick Xenophon Team. Pauline Hanson said she is concerned marriage equality could lead to people not being able to call parents ‘mum and dad’. The head of the ACL, Lyle Shelton gave the no case at the National Press Club and apologised for comments Christians made during the height of the Aids crisis in the 1980s, but did not apologise over his “stolen generation” reference in regards to children of same-sex couples. The head of the ABCC, Nigel Hadgkiss, resigned after admitting to breaching the Fair Work Act in the federal court on Tuesday. Employment minister Michaelia Cash admitted she was first aware of the allegations against Hadgkiss in October 2016, just months after the government went to a double-dissolution election over establishing the ABCC. The Greens, with the support of Labor and others on the crossbench, have scuttled Peter Dutton’s citizenship bill, unless he brings it up for debate within four sitting days. Josh Frydenberg returned to the chamber after question time to correct an assertion Labor has been making since Monday – that power bills in Sydney have increased by $1,000. He said the Australian energy regulator’s State of the Energy Markets report from May 2017 showed the average Sydney bill on standing offers, had varied from an increase of $1 to a decrease of $473. Olivia Newton-John was the cause of more than one dopey grin across the parliament. We’ll be back tomorrow for the last sitting day before October. A big thank you to Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens for the lend of their brains today and to everyone who played along. A massive pat on the back to Mike Bowers for being my eyes and ears across the hallways and beyond – you’ll find more on his Instagram and Twitter if you need a fix between now and tomorrow. You can reach me at @amyremeikis if you have a burning thought overnight. Have a wonderful evening and we will catch you tomorrow. Shadow minister for citizenship Tony Burke has explained Labor’s reasons for opposing Peter Dutton’s citizenship legislation: Labor has objected to the changes because: the university-level English language requirements are snobbery – it sends a message to all Australians that unless you have university-level English the government doesn’t want you here; and the proposed delays are harmful and unfair - leaving many potential citizens waiting for more than a decade before they are ever asked to pledge allegiance to Australia Citizenship is meant to be the way we build ourselves as a society, not the way we divide. The bill put forward by Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton is an absurd, snobbish mess that should be dropped immediately.” Things are going well this evening Labor is going to town on the Hadgkiss matter, but Michaelia Cash is still finding some humour in the day. Employment Minister Michaelia Cash has some context to put around her admission during Senate question time she had been aware of Nigel Hadgkiss, who has just resigned as the head of the ACCC after admitting to breaching the Fair Work Act, since October last year. Her spokesman said Cash learnt of the allegation then, but only learnt of his admission yesterday, with everyone else. “Minister Cash was first advised of the CFMEU’s allegations against Mr Hadgkiss in October 2016.” “Yesterday Mr Hadgkiss admitted to a contravention of the Fair Work Act. He has today submitted his resignation to the Government which the Government has accepted.” Peter Dutton now has four sitting days to put his citizenship bill up for debate, reports Gareth Hutchens: It is a major embarrassment for the Turnbull government, with a majority of senators – Greens, Labor, the Nick Xenophon Team, and Jacqui Lambie – supporting the motion on Wednesday. The motion passed 32 to 29. It was moved by Greens senator Nick McKim, with an amendment from Lambie. Lambie’s amendment gave the government until 18 October to bring the bill on for debate. The Greens originally wanted to strike the bill from the notice paper immediately. Labor has been making the ‘$1,000 increased power bill in Sydney’ claim all week, but Josh Frydenberg has just walked back into the chamber to address it. Mark Butler said the figure came from “the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission reported in the Australian newspaper”. But Frydenberg says “this is false”, returning to the floor of parliament to make his point. “The data published by the Australian Energy Regulator on May 2017 in the state of the energy markets report shows between the start of the Coalition government in 2013 prices across average Sydney households on standing offers varied from increasing by $1 to falling by $473. I call on the leader of the opposition to come to the House and correct the record.” If anyone’s power bill has dropped by $473, be sure to let us know. The Catholic bishop of Parramatta, Vincent Long Van Nguyen, has written a pastoral letter encouraging his flock to “exercise their consciences” in the upcoming postal survey, but making a crucial distinction between the religious and civil institution which appears to give the green light for people to vote yes. Van Nguyen: “It is important to remember from the very outset that the postal survey is about whether or not Australians want the legal definition of civil marriage changed to include same-sex couples. It is not a referendum on sacramental marriage as understood by the Catholic Church. “Many years ago, divorce was legalised in Australia but this change did not alter the law of the Church. Therefore, whatever the outcome of the survey or the eventual legislation by the government, the Church will continue to hold that marriage is a natural institution established by God to be a permanent union between one man and one woman, directed both to mutual companionship and to the formation of a family in which children are born and nurtured. “For many Catholics, the issue of same-sex marriage is not simply theoretical but deeply personal. These may be same-sex attracted people themselves or that may be the case with their relatives and friends. In such cases, they are torn between their love for the Church and their love for their same-sex attracted child, grandchild, sibling, cousin, friend or neighbour. The kicker is the suggestion that the vote “should not be a simple answer yes or no”. “It should be an opportunity for us to witness to our deep commitment to the ideal of Christian marriage. But it should also be an opportunity for us to listen to what the Spirit is saying through the signs of the times.” “Sign of the times” is somewhat cryptic ... is the suggestion simply: it’s time? Labor’s South Australian MPs have come together to release a statement in relation to Nick Xenophon – another SA MP – and media reforms. The government plans on debating those laws all night. A deal is imminent, but not yet signed, so Labor is taking advantage of that window to put a bit of pressure on Xenophon. South Australia is already an extremely concentrated media market that has seen too many media jobs go in recent times. We cannot afford further concentration of ownership, and further losses of jobs and news services interstate. Senator Xenophon must stand up for South Australia, stand up for media diversity, or be accountable for every media job lost in the state as a result of his latest deal with the Turnbull government. Malcolm Turnbull is not the only one excited to receive a visit from Olivia Newton-John The Greens’ (apparent) victory in striking off the citizenship bill from the Senate notice paper may go some way to explaining why Peter Dutton had a spray against Labor in question time today. Here is a little more on what he had to say about the citizenship bill: The Labor party don’t want this debate because they are torn internally in relation to it. You see what happens when the Labor party cuddles up beside the Greens. You know they are in a battle in seats in inner cities around the country where they’re desperate to stave off the attacks from the Greens. What does it result in? In relation to boats, when the Labor party cuddled up next to the Greens, 50,000 people came on 800 boats and1,200 people drowned at sea. You know what else? We know that when the Labor party cuddled up beside the Greens and they were in coalition with the Greens, you know what happens when that happens in relation to energy policy? The fact is we get blackouts and we get blowouts in electricity prices. The fact is that under the Labor party, particularly when you’ve got a weak, shifty leader like this leader of the opposition, you will know boats will always come under that Labor party and you will know energy prices will always be higher under that leadership.” The Greens flagged this yesterday, and it looks like they actually have the numbers. A majority of Senators will soon be voting on a motion to strike the Turnbull government’s controversial citizenship bill from the Senate notice paper. It will be a major embarrassment for the government if it happens, and throw their citizenship plans into further disarray. The Greens, Labor, the Nick Xenophon Team, and Jacqui Lambie will be supporting the motion, apparently. The motion will give the government until 18 October (which will be in the next sitting week to allow its citizenship bill to be debated in the Senate, otherwise it will be struck off. If that happens, the government will have to move a motion to restore the bill to the notice paper if it wants to put it back in the Senate, and the chances of that happening? The Greens say they are tired of Peter Dutton telling voters how crucial his citizenship bill is while simultaneously withholding it from the Senate so it can’t be debated, so that want him to put his money where his mouth is, as the saying goes. Here is a little more on what Kevin Rudd just tweeted Former prime minister Kevin Rudd has just sent this out. We are attempting to contact him to find out more information about what happened. It is all fun and games until someone ... well, in this case, breaks a leg. Queensland Labor senator Murray Watt got a taste of the ACT hospital system after a pre-parliament game resulted in a potential broken tibia. Watt told us it is a small break and hopefully won’t need surgery. I’d love to blame a Tory, but I think it was just aging bones,” he said with a laugh. We are told the deal is all but done, but the Senate is preparing to burn the midnight oil, with the media reforms to be debated well into the night. So clearly there are still some I’s to be dotted and T’s to be crossed before Mitch Fifield can relax. We didn’t learn too much more in that question time. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull cemented the government’s change in language focussing on ‘affordable, reliable power’. That’s not really new, but it is becoming a little more forceful in its delivery. Labor is sticking to its plan of pointing out just how long the Coalition has been in power, while attempting to wedge Turnbull on his views on a CET, given his previous support. So really, we got nowhere. One person who was not in question time today was Tony Abbott – he was granted a pair as he had firefighting duties to attend to. But he found time to retweet Wallabies star Isreal Folau Olivia Newton-John has been in parliament since last night, lobbying politicians for more money for brain and breast cancer research. It is a topic close to her heart – Newton-John’s sister died six weeks after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, while she herself has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer for a second time. But she has just told David Speers that if she could vote in the marriage-equality survey, it would be a ‘yes’. To me, love is love and I don’t see any debate in it.” Labor has seized on Michaelia Cash’s admission in the Senate that she had known about Nigel Hadgkiss’s breach of the Fair Work Act since October 2016. Hadgkiss resigned from the ABCC after making the admission yesterday. In a statement, Brendan O’Connor said Cash should have stood Hadgkiss down as soon as she knew. Over the past three years, the conduct of Mr Hadgkiss has been called into question time and time again, yet the minister has stood by him and his performance. The Commonwealth Ombudsman questioned the behaviour of Mr Hadgkiss, when he was director of the Fair Work Building Commission (FWBC), saying he breached the confidentiality of people he was interviewing and used questionable interviewing techniques. This is in addition to previous statements by a federal court judge and a Fair Work commissioner that Mr Hadgkiss was “unjustifiably vexatious” in his attack on the union movement and prone to “unsubstantiated hyperbole”. Unbelievably, the Turnbull government took the Australian people to a double dissolution election in order to reinstate a botched watchdog headed up by a dodgy commissioner that they knew about since day one.” Christopher Pyne was all of us as social services minister Christian Porter attempted to link Seinfield with Bill Shorten: What you do is you apply what public policy analysis will call the Costanza method of policy participation. In the famous Seinfeld episode, the notoriously shifty George decides the best way to make decisions is to do the precise opposite of what you think to do first. When you apply that method to the leader of the opposition, it is uncannily accurate. Tax cuts to decrease welfare dependency. First the leader of the opposition says, ‘friends, corporate tax cut reforms create jobs up and down the ladder, including people who might be on welfare’. He now says the same tax cuts are a crazy plan. The marriage plebiscite. First he said, ‘I’d rather the people of Australia could make their view clear on this than leaving the decision to 150 people’. Apply the method, now the 150 people are the only people who get their say, the Australian people get no say. On the cashless welfare card, the leader of the opposition had two opposing points of view in the same sentence, ‘There are some people who will probably benefit from this scheme’ and then said, ‘but it is a hard measure just to get a headline’. The only leader of the opposition shiftier than George Constanza.” What we can take from both Pyne’s earlier throwback to Muriel’s Wedding and now Seinfield is that it may be time for the Coalition to update its pop culture references. A picture really is worth 1,000 words Question time ends as it began, with a question from Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull on energy: What has been the net reduction of energy capacity in the national energy market since this government came to office in 2013? Turnbull turns it back on Labor over the $1,000 bill increase in Sydney power bills: Two statistical matters I want to conclude with. The first is that the opposition leader has claimed in the house that the Australian Energy Regulator has stated that the average price for electricity in Sydney has, since the date of the Coalition government being elected, four years ago, increased by $1,000 per household. That has been his claim. We have noted that. He has not produced any evidence for it but we have noted it. He has produced no evidence for it. He hasn’t cited any publication at all. In terms of the changing energy mix, I can refer the honourable member to AEMO’s advice to the government just a few days ago, in September this year, and it says, ‘Over the past decade, 5,199 megawatts has been retired and been replaced by 273 megawatts of hydro, 91 megawatts of liquid fuel, 2,965 megawatts of wind, 265 megawatts of largescale solar, 240 megawatts of coal plant expansion and 160 megawatts of other sources’. I encourage him to read the rest of the report.” Labor says the figures are “based on data from the government’s own Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission reported in the Australian newspaper”. Labor is sounding quite rowdy today. Especially after Tanya Plibersek asks Malcolm Turnbull: The prime minister used to say, ‘I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.’ Has the prime minister forgotten that when Labor was in government, not only did he support the policies he just ridiculed, he crossed the floor to vote for them? Turnbull mixes up his usual answer with an attack on Tony Burke mid-speech The member for Watson there is shouting his head off. What a pathetic display. Go redder. He is getting so red. He is settling down now. He is settling down now. That’s good. That’s good for his heart. Very important. Don’t overdo it. Don’t overdo it. We need affordable and reliable energy because the reality is, if we don’t have it, Australians will pay the blackout bill.” After another question on energy policy that goes nowhere, Peter Dutton answers a Dixer on Australian citizenship laws, making the point that the government has cancelled 2,800 visas over the past few years and pivots to talk about his bill which is currently stalled in the Senate. We have ramped up by about 1,200% the number of those visa cancellations and made Australia a safer place as a result of that action. The reality is that, under the Labor party, many of those people would have gone on to become Australian citizens. ... We have introduced a bill into the parliament which has passed the lower house and is in the Senate in relation to tightening up in relation to citizenship so we can make sure people who have abided by Australian laws, adhered to values and integrated into Australian society can become Australian citizens and those that haven’t do not become Australian citizens. The reality is that when you are looking at a Labor leader, you know he or she is most weak when he or she sides with the Greens. We saw it in Julia Gillard. We saw it in Kevin Rudd. We see it with this leader as well. The fact is that, in the Senate at the moment, the Greens have moved a motion to wipe off this citizenship bill from the notice paper and it has only been supported, you wouldn’t believe it, not by Nick Xenophon, not by Cory Bernardi, not by Pauline Hanson, not by anybody else except for the Labor party.” Sometimes the main event is happening away from centre stage Christopher Pyne takes a question, as the representative for Michaelia Cash in the House. Cash has been busy answering questions on the resignation of Nigel Hadgkiss in the Senate. Pyne gets a dixer on “why it is important for employer and employee organisations to act in away that promotes truthfulness,integrity and manages the potential for conflict of interest?’ as a way of addressing the Hadgkiss issue. I hear the members of the Labor Party cat calling about the head of the ABCC but I didn’t hear them say John Setka should be sacked for the terrible things he did. So they stand up for John Setka while they criticise Nigel Hadgkiss. Doesn’t it sum up the Labor Party of today? It sums up the modern Labor Party.” Pyne then talks about Bill Shorten’s AWU history and manages a Muriel’s Wedding reference: All these moments we have experienced with the Leader of the Opposition, all these amazing coincidences, they remind us of Muriel’s Wedding. It ended up catching up with Deidre and Bill. Eventually Deidre and Bill were undone by these coincidences. You can only be this shifty for so long before the public work you out. You can’t get away with being this shifty for this long.” A short break from QT for some birthday wishes Mark Butler picks up Labor’s attack over a clean energy target: Just over three months ago, the prime minister described the clean energy target this way. ‘It would certainly work. There is no question it would work and it has a number of virtues, very strong virtues and again it has a lot of merit. We will look at it very favourably.’ Will there be a clean energy target? Yes or no? Turnbull gives a short history lesson in response: As I made very clear, we are considering the 50th recommendation of the Finkel review, which is about a clean energy target. What we need to achieve in our policy is to ensure energy becomes more affordable, that it becomes more reliable and that we meet our emissions reduction obligations ... The fact is a clean energy target is an evolution of a refinement, if you like, of a renewable energy target. What the renewable energy target did not do, has not done, is provide support for the storage and the back-up that is required to make renewables reliable. This is not taken seriously by the Labor party. The problem is, however, blackouts and unaffordable power bills are taken seriously by Australians. They know that they’re the ones that have to pay for the blackout bill. They’re the ones that have to pay for ... Well, they do. They do have to pay. They do have to pay. Tony Burke calls the “blackout Bill” reference “too cute by half”. A quick dash to the Senate shows Michaelia Cash has been forced to answer questions about the resignation of Nigel Hadgkiss, who had headed the ABCC. Doug Cameron asks: Mr Hadgkiss has admitted to recklessly breaching section 503 of the Fair Work Act. When did the minister first become aware of the behaviour Mr Hadgkiss now admits to was a breach of the act? Cash gives a simple answer: I became aware of the behaviour in October 2016. Barnaby Joyce is enjoying his time being able to speak without the interruption of Labor attempting a gag order. He responds to a Dixer with an attack on Labor and its position on the Liddell power station, throwing in a couple of new nicknames: Now federal Labor do not stand by Liddell and we can see this because they’re all going for that great title that they now have in the Labor party. They used to sing Solidarity Forever, now they are fighting to be basket weaver No. 1. I think the member for Hunter did a good job last night, ‘Andy Vesey and AGL did us a big favour’. They are doing what no one else has ever done before, which is put the member for Hunter’s workers out of jobs, put more pressure on manufacturing industries and coal workers. Then we see the Labor party policy. Wind chime No. 2 ... Labor will introduce a framework to kick start coal-fired power stations. You can’t get any better than that. That is the Labor party. Can you believe question time is free? It’s the independent’s question – today it’s NXT’s Rebekha Sharkie and we leave energy for a moment to look at water. In a letter enclosing the interim investigation into New South Wales water management, Ken Matthews stated, ‘Compliance and enforcement arrangements in New South Wales have been ineffectual and require significant and urgent improvement’. He stated that individual cases of alleged non-compliance have remained unresolved for far too long and that a systemic fix is required. Given Ken Matthews’s findings and water theft allegations in at least two states, do you now agree with we need an urgent inquiry into the implementation of the $13m Murray-Darling basin plan? Barnaby Joyce takes the question: What I can say? It must be important that at this point they remain allegations and I am also aware of other issues that have been brought forward in regards to defamation cases so we have to be very careful we differentiate between allegations and proof. Julie Owens, the Labor MP for Parramatta, questions the prime minister: “The Liberal party promised families they would be $550 a year better off because of lower power prices. This government is in its fifth year in office. Can the prime minister confirm the average Sydney household is paying almost $1,000 more on power bills this year than when the federal Liberal government was elected in2013? Josh Frydenberg takes the question. She has just made that number up. Where is your evidence? There is absolutely no evidence for that. But what I can tell you is the evidence from the ACCC’s report from 2015, which said, ‘The commonwealth treasury’s estimated $550 cost savings to households is reasonable’. That is what came from the abolition of the carbon tax. I had a feeling this link would come in handy again – here is the ABC Factcheck on that $550 figure Correction: An earlier post (11.08am) made mention of Senator Louise Pratt’s former partner. Apologies for the mistake. Before we get to the next government dixer, Speaker Smith announces a special guest is in the public gallery, to the applause of the House: Just before I call the member for Bonner, I’d like to advise the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon very prominent Australian Olivia Newton-John, accompanied by her husband, John. And her team from the Olivia Newton-John Institute. A warm welcome. She is a prominent Carlton supporter! Shorten tries again, this time without the preamble: My question is to the prime minister. I just ask again: prime minister, how much of power bills for Australia has gone up since the Liberals formed government in 2013? Turnbull tells us the bills have gone down. And up. But that’s Labor’s fault. They came down significantly when the Coalition came into government and the carbon tax was abolished. They came down significantly. We have seen them going up again recently. The reason they’ve been going up is because of the impact of decisions taken by the Labor party ... They can wave their arms around and shout as much as they like but it was the Labor party, it was the Labor party that allowed gas to be exported without any protection for the domestic market. None. They did not give any thought to the protection of the Australian market. Speaker Tony Smith disagrees with the prime minister on a small matter: The one thing I will disagree with the prime minister on. They can’t shout as much as they want and anyone that continues to do so will be leaving under 94(a). The first government Dixer gives the PM a chance to repeat himself, with the member for Chisholm, Julia Banks, asking what steps the government has taken to lower power prices. Turnbull gives another version of the answer he just gave Shorten. Which is just a variation of the answers he gave yesterday and the day before and, we can assume, a preview of the answers he’ll give tomorrow. Question time has started with a question from Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull. It is, you will not be surprised to learn, on energy: My question is to the prime minister. On Monday, the prime minister was asked if power prices were higher or lower since this government came to office and he refused to answer. On Tuesday, the prime minister was asked about the average Sydney household paying $1,000 more since this government came to power and refused to answer. So, prime minister, just answer: how much have power bills increased since the Liberals came to office? Turnbull seizes it as an opportunity to describe the steps he says the government has taken to lower power prices: We’re bringing down gas prices already. In terms of dispatchable energy, we’re taking practical steps with AGL on Liddell, the obvious one option to avoid it creating a big gap is to keep that power station running for longer so we are exploring that with the company. In the longer term, we are building the biggest renewable power system in the country’s history since Snowy 1, Snowy Hydro 2, which will make renewables reliable, [and which] is derided by the Labor party as a stunt. They have no policies and no plan. The only thing we know Australians will have to pay for is the blackout bill. As we get ready for question time, let’s review the day so far: Energy has again kickstarted the day, with Josh Frydenberg and Barnaby Joyce out making the hard sell on behalf of the government. But nothing has shifted since earlier this week, The clean energy target has raised its head again, with the government still working out what it is going to do moving forward – and if it has one. Labor is looking to wedge the government on the issue. The government is looking to wedge Labor on its plan for reliable energy supply. In other words, we’ve moved nowhere. The safeguard legislation for the marriage equality campaign has been passed during an emotional debate in the Senate. Labor, the Coalition, the Greens, Derryn Hinch and the Nick Xenophon Team stood in support of the legislation, while Cory Bernardi and One Nation voted against it, citing concerns over ‘freedoms’. Hanson believes that under marriage equality, people will be stopped from saying ‘mum and dad’. ACL head Lyle Shelton and Liberal party vice-president Karina Okotel gave the ‘no’ case for marriage equality at the National Press Club. The head of the ABCC, Nigel Hadgkiss, has resigned after admitting he breached the Fair Work Act. The chief of the Australian Building and Construction Commission has resigned the day after he admitted to breaching the Fair Work Act in 2013. The Australian Financial Review reported yesterday Nigel Hadgkiss had admitted “to recklessly misrepresenting union rights to employers for more than two years”: From January 2014 to July 2016, the ABCC published downloadable posters and fact sheets on its website that advised employers that union officials “must comply with your reasonable requests” over which areas they could use to hold discussions with workers. However, the CFMEU pointed out new Labor right of entry laws, which came into effect on January 1, 2014, carried no such requirements and in fact gave unions a default right to use the lunchroom to meet workers if they could not reach agreement on a location with the employer. Internal emails uncovered in discovery revealed that ABCC staff knew the correct position internally but continued to maintain the information on the site. Emails showed Mr Hadgkiss insisted that planned corrections be “canned” because the incoming Coalition government had indicated it would seek to reverse Labor’s new laws by February that year. The repeal never happened and in an agreed statement of facts Mr Hadgkiss admitted he “did not turn his mind to the possibility that the legislation repealing the right of entry amendments might not be passed”. Michaelia Cash has thanked Hadgkiss for his service We have an update on Paul Karp’s story from this morning on the robo-call which has been doing the rounds- here is a quick refresher on that A robocall asking Australians their opinion about the same-sex marriage postal survey has suggested that marriage equality may lead to “radical gay sex education” and threats to freedom of speech and religion. The poll, which was first reported by social media users on Tuesday night, stated that it was conducted by the Republican-linked American pollster WPA Intelligence. Marriage equality advocates fear the call, which contains no authorisation disclosing who commissioned it, may be push-polling designed to boost the no campaign.” The Australian Market and Social Research Society have put out a statement saying the WPA Intelligence are breaching its code of practice. AMSRS have received a number of calls in regards to a survey being conducted by WPA Intelligence. We wish to advise that WPA Intelligence has no members of AMSRS; they are a company operating out of America. The survey WPA Intelligence are conducting in regards to the same-sex marriage postal survey appears to be “push-polling” – an activity that attempts to impart information to individuals rather than collect information from individuals. This practice is not genuine social research and runs contrary to the AMSRS Code of Professional Behaviour and may contravene aspects of the Privacy Act (Australian Privacy Principles). Lyle Shelton may have apologised for comments made during the 1980s but no apology has been forthcoming for his ‘stolen generation’ comments. Instead, he has framed his case around concerns for freedoms and children. I just want to say if you are concerned about freedom, if you’re concerned about what your children are taught at school, you’re not a bigot. You’re not homophobic, you don’t have irrational fear. These are valid and reasonable concerns which you should be allowed to express, even express them on social media with your friends. If you’re concerned about these things, I would encourage you to vote no. If you don’t know where the final frontier in the LGBTQI sex agenda is, same-sex marriage agenda is, if you don’t know where that is, vote no. Bill Shorten has formally written to Malcolm Turnbull requesting more funding for LGBTIQ counselling and trauma services “to assist them with the increase in demand for services that is occurring as a result of your postal survey on marriage equality”. Shorten writes that Beyond Blue has reported a 40% increase in call services since August, while QLife, a LGBTIQ phone counselling service, has reported a 20% increase in demand. Given your determination to proceed with this survey despite the harm it will cause, you have a responsibility to ensure that services around the country are able to cope with the consequences. We cannot leave LGBTIQ Australians and their families on their own through this process” Lyle Shelton has taken his place at the National Press Club’s podium and he starts his speech with an apology. I want to start my address today by offering an apology. This is a very emotion-charged debate for many people in Australia and Karina has talked about some of the vitriol we have experienced that at ACL and, yes, it does exist on both sides of the debate. But going back to the early 1980s at the height of the Aids crisis in San Francisco, when gay men were dying like flies, people who represented Christian organisations said some very hateful and hurtful things. And I just want to say here today that for those who might think that people like myself and Karina represent that viewpoint, I want to say – we’re sorry for what happened back in those days. It was a generation ago, it was before my time, but nonetheless wounds were there and I think still exist to this day and probably with some justification by our friends in the LGBTQI community. So I just want to start by offering that as an apology from myself. I’m not here representing the church or anyone else, but I just think that needs to be said.” Stepping outside parliament to the National Press Club now. Vice-president of the Liberal party, Karina Okotel, and managing director of the Australian Christian Lobby, Lyle Shelton, are making the arguments for the ‘no’ case in the marriage equality debate. Paul Karp is there and will report on all the proceedings a little later, but here is a taste from Okotel: A culture has developed whereby it’s acceptable to vilify, mock, abuse and shame anyone who stands in the way or even raises questions about whether we should legalise same-sex marriage. I have been called a homophobe, a bigot, and been told my views are disgusting. … Why is this? The yes campaign have framed their debate about being one for equality and for justice. And who could stand against this? When I first considered the legalisation of same-sex marriage several years ago, I was all for it. I thought if two consenting adults want to get married what would it hurt anyone else. At that point in time I would have voted yes, but the more I looked into the issue, and the more I observed the experience of other countries that have legalised same-sex marriage, my concerns grew. You cannot, after all, fundamentally shift an institution we have always had, that is practised the world over, without there being consequences.” The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has met with Olivia Newton-John as she promotes the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute. I’ll leave the captions to you. The Senate moves on to media reforms. This is the legislation that will scrap the two-out-of-three media ownership rules, which stop a company from owning a newspaper, TV station and radio station in the same market, as well as scrapping the 75% reach rule. These reforms have been on the Coalition’s agenda since Tony Abbott was elected in 2014. Outside in the courtyard, Barnaby Joyce has been continuing the power attack, complete with his giant hat. He’s repeating his lines from yesterday, questioning why AGL won’t just sell Liddell, if it “such a dog of an asset”. If it is something that, just, horrible, if it is something that just warrants being pulled down, if you want to take on the costs of pulling it down, then surely that would pose the question, ‘Why would you take to it the market and see if someone wants to buy it?’ If it is such a terrible asset, surely if someone wants to buy it that would be a much better outcome. But it doesn’t seem at this point in time that AGL have any contemplation about anybody wanting to buy Liddell. They seem very focused on wanting to pull it down. Then they say, ‘We will put up other renewables in that space.’ I have no problems with renewables, Australia is a big place. There are a lot of renewables in New England. If you want to put them up, sure, knock yourself out. The idea of pulling down one of the major supplies toNSW for no apparent – I haven’t had a cogent reason as to why they want to pull down a power station, just doesn’t stack up. We have to make sure that we keep the lights on in Sydney. We have to make sure that the Coalition policy of keeping power affordable and reliable is a predominant policy, not the Labor policy, which you can see in live form in South Australia. You can see it. Highest power prices in Australia and driving Australia to have the highest power prices in the OECD. For a refresher on what happened yesterday, here is Katharine Murphy’s report. In between having their say on what they believe vilification to be, or if it even exists, One Nation has been hearing from the communications minister, Mitch Fifield. Mr Bowers spotted a quick chat between Fifield and Pauline Hanson as the anti-vilification debate carried on around them. Once this debate is finished and it’s almost done, with a Greens amendment to extend the survey to 16 and 17 year olds about to be defeated and Mathias Cormann just dealing with some lingering questions from Cory Bernardi – the Senate will move on to Fifield’s media bill. Take from the body language what you will. Pauline Hanson has had a lot to say about this legislation, which One Nation will not be supporting, as it believes it will shut down debate. Hanson uses the case of Dads4Kids, which she says was stopped from being able to run a Father’s Day commercial because of political correctness but was actually just asked by Free TV to add an identification tag, in line with the Broadcasting Services Act, which requires ads with political matter to say who is responsible for the ad. But let’s not let pesky facts get in the way of this debate. Hanson is also very concerned over whether calling people “mum” and “dad” will be seen as a form of vilification. Once you have marriage equality, you have the right of any couple that is married in Australia. What about the rights of the child? Have we considered the children, what may come of this, is we go to school now, or kids go to school, and they say, ‘I want you to draw a picture of mum and dad’, or ‘What’s mum and dad done?’, or ‘Have you had time with grandma and granddad?’ So then is [someone] going to come in and say, ‘Sorry, you can no longer call that parent mum and dad, because it is going to offend the children who don’t mum and dad. So it is going to be, ‘You must call that person by Peter or Anne or John?’ So there is no longer mums and dads, grandma and granddad. This is the impact that it is having in other places, so I have been told. Malcolm Roberts has also had a bit to say. We need to stop weakening people and instead we need to strengthen people. Instead of singling out people as the term LGBTIQ does and becomes divisive and hurts people, that is the same as singling out people because they are Aboriginals or females or aged or teens. Instead we need to include all people and that is real equality of opportunity. We need to stop the division, we need instead to unify. Now hate speech to confess, really, is not on people’s minds. Because the incidence is low. And most people can understand the point that I am going to make in a few minutes. We can deal with hate speech by showing that we don’t accept it. That is the key, that we don’t accept it. So while I empathise with Senator Wong’s pain, I do not sympathise with it. I can empathise with any hurt she feels, yet I am not going to reinforce her pain. Because all pain in my experience comes from within. Wearing your heart on your scarf, as you do Labor senator Louise Pratt delivered an emotional speech, where she talked about an anti-marriage equality pamphlet that was handed to her three-year-old son. I want to talk to you about what is most important. And that is, to the LGBTI community – to stay strong, as strong as you can. To acknowledge your feelings. To look out for each other. To take care of yourself and each other. But most of all, we are going to be dealing with this by getting busy winning their debate. We will be getting to work. We will be going door-to-door, making hundreds of thousands of phone calls, we will be knocking on doors all around the country. So it is my plea to all Australians who support equality, please keep an eye out for your ballot paper, which is being sent out this week. Fill it out, post it back, stand up for equality and make your vote count. *Correction: this post previously made mention of Senator Pratt’s previous partner. Apologies for the mistake. Cory Bernardi is against the legislation – he says there is a principle at stake. “If we are trying to protect everyone in this country from having their feelings hurt, we are on a path to I don’t know where.” Bernardi says it is “essentially 18c on steroids, to protect their feelings from being hurt”. The spurious claim is going to be my feelings were hurt, I feel vilified, I feel alienated, I feel upset and alarmingly, alarmingly, the person who will sit, from my understanding, sit in initial judgment on the merits or worthiness of that case will be the attorney general. They will be the person who can interfere and direct things to the federal court or appeal against them to the federal court. Now do we want really a cheerleader, and I don’t mean this disrespectfully to the attorney, but anyone who is a partisan cheerleader for a side in a campaign to be sitting or rendering any form of judgment about a complaint about the conduct of one side or the other. These concerns, Bernardi said, could lead to the worst of the Harry Potter sequels. The court of public opinion will render its verdict. It doesn’t need Judge George and the chamber of outrage to determine whether things are offensive or not. Janet Rice said “given the circumstances that we are in” the Greens will support the safeguard legislation. We are on a long, winding, damaging path to marriage equality but I know we are going to get there in the end. So we are taking stock of where we are at, we are moving forward and we accept that this bill is going to make some improvements on what would be an even more damaging process. The issue of marriage equality is a personal issue for me as, well as a political one. My relationship with my wife, Penny, is one shared by not very many couples in Australia and it is an interesting, if not unique, perspective. When my wife, Penny, and I were married 31 years ago, she was a bloke. So we fitted the stereotype of being the perfect couple. We married in a church, bought a house, we had two kids and fitted, hand in the glove, to being mainstream Australia. Then, of course, some 17 years later, she transitioned. And became the woman she truly was. And we went from being the perfect couple, the ordinary couple, the mainstream Australian couple, to being weird. To being discriminated against. Because suddenly we were weird. We were not normal. And suddenly, if Penny wanted to complete her affirmation as a woman by changing her gender on her birth certificate, we would have to divorce. Of course we didn’t want to get divorced. We were still a happily married couple. We had two wonderful children. But that is what our law said we had to do. So, of course, Penny’s birth certificate has sat in her drawer since then. Mathias Cormann has introduced the bill to the Senate, with the Greens, Labor and the Nick Xenophon Team announcing their support – not surprising, given the parties worked with Cormann in developing the bill. The speeches are quite personal. Penny Wong said that among all the hateful things that have been said “politely and abusefully” she takes comfort from the simple acts of acceptance in every day life. I take comfort, I take faith from, the sort of open heartedness and acceptance that I have experienced in my life. On the birth of our children, the generosity of so many strangers, sending gifts, sending cards, sending messages, sending flowers, lots of clothes, people stopping me and congratulating us. When I drop my daughter off at school, the way in which parents of other kids talk to us, ask us about the latest happenings. Parents dropping their kids off for play dates, sitting down and having a cup of tea and just talking about what the class is doing. In these simple acts there is an acceptance and respect that I hope will win in a debate that thus far as been too much characterised by a lack of acceptance and a lack of respect and I encourage those on the other side to stand with us in providing that leadership about the nature of the debate to come. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has been speaking on North Korea, following her joint statement with the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, yesterday, which welcomed the new UN sanctions on the rogue state but called on China to do more. This morning, the message is being handled delicately. Australia still believes China can wield its influence to convince North Korea into backing off from its nuclear mission but Bishop was not singling its ally out: China has demonstrated its willingness to support the toughest and most comprehensive set of sanctions on North Korea to date. There is room for more sanctions. China has said it will fully implement all sanctions to which it has agreed and I take them at their word. China and Russia, in fact, all members of the permanent five of the UN Security Council, have a unique responsibility to uphold the authority of the UN Security Council and that is a message that I have been sending to China, Russia and other members of the P5 for some time – that they have a responsibility to ensure that the authority of the UN Security Council is respected and upheld. North Korea is in direct violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions. Its sixth illegal nuclear test was the most powerful and it is in direct defiance of the UN Security Council. So, the permanent five have a unique responsibility to ensure that North Korea respect and abides by UN Security Council resolutions. The Greens are also on board with the anti-vilification legislation, with Senator Janet Rice saying the government included what the party had requested in terms of protections in the bill. The key concerns that we raised publicly and in consultations with the government have largely been incorporated into the legislation being put forward today, which is why the Greens will be voting in favour of these emergency protections.” It is absolutely critical that the LGBTIQ community feels supported throughout this process, which, as we’ve already seen, has the potential to cause great emotional harm, especially to young people. The energy war is ongoing, despite a brief ceasefire between Josh Frydenberg and Ed Husic this morning. Just a couple of hours after playing up for the cameras, both Frydenberg and Husic had their game faces on for Sky News. Frydenberg said the government was doing the only responsible thing, in talking to AGL about keeping its Liddell coal-fired power station open beyond 2022, given what he said were the energy market operator’s warnings about supply reliability. Bill Shorten, or Blackout Bill, says this is an issue for down the track. We take AEMO’s words at face value and are working urgently to ensure there is no supply shortfall. We have already seen a press release from Delta Electricity, which owns Vales Point, which has said it is prepared to do due diligence on the asset. AGL have certainly not been public in saying the asset is for sale. When that, if that was to occur, then no doubt you would see parties announce that they were interested. Husic appeared in the studio just after to set out Labor’s attack lines for the day. I think it is important to note that Malcolm Turnbull has overtaken Tony Abbott for the amount of time spent in the top job and he has ended up looking more like the bloke he replaced, every day. Malcolm Turnbull was the bloke who crossed the floor of parliament to support an energy approach he is fighting right now. So instead of actually thinking how to generate more energy and cleaner, he’s continually doing a throwback to the past, committing huge amount of government funds to generate energy in a way that is not as efficient as we could be. For those keeping count, Tony Abbott famously resigned by fax on 15 September 2015, the day after the leadership spill, an anniversary we are rapidly approaching. Overnight, the Victorian senator Derryn Hinch used parliamentary privilege to name another convicted paedophile, while some of the man’s now adult victims watched on from the public gallery. A court order means we can’t name him publicly but here is Hinch telling Patricia Karvelas why he did it. This police officer for 12 years raped a five-year-old stepdaughter at gun point. He took her out of school almost every day … He took a young boy, he said ‘Do you want to see a police station?’, took him in there in his uniform and raped him in a room in the police station. One of the victims came to me. She’s now 45. She was the five-year-old step-daughter. She came to me, she tried everything. When she was 15 her grandfather took her to the police station and was told ‘don’t worry about it’. When she was nine she started to bleed and her grandmother took her to the doctor and she was having a miscarriage. Now that woman approached me and said, ‘Will you name him? He’s still there’, so I named him. We talked to every victim, of the nine [victims]. We approached them all and got their permission so they wouldn’t be blindsided and two of his victims came to Canberra, drove to Canberra from Victoria, and sat in the gallery last night and they felt like a weight had been lifted off them. It’s one of the proudest things I’ve ever done since I’ve got elected. It’s not the first time he has done it and he told ABC radio that it won’t be the last. If it’s necessary. I think I’ve done it twice in a year, that’s all. I’m not running out there naming everybody. But this case, the victims came to me and they said, ‘We’ve been trying for years to get this done.’ She said ‘I’m a victim. I want him named.’ So how is [the suppression order] protecting the victims? If they want me to, and it makes them feel better and [allows] them to get on with their adult lives, yes I’ll do it. And I’m sure it will come up again. The anti-vilification legislation, which has been designed to place safeguards around the marriage equality campaign – at least as much as is possible – has been confirmed as the Senate’s first order of business. But even though Labor has worked with the Coalition in creating the legislation, it doesn’t mean the party is happy about it. Speaking earlier, Tanya Plibersek said it would not stop hate speech but was better than nothing. The debate is already ugly. I have already had the homes of my constituents graffitied. I’ve seen all sorts of appalling stuff distributed, unauthorised and completely inaccurate, all sorts of foul stuff. The very fact that we are having this debate is bringing out some of the worse commentary and, personally, I hold the prime minister responsible for that. However, some protections are better than none, so we have worked with the government to offer some protections, because it is better than leaving people on their own. Will this stop the hate speech? No. Because I have seen too much of it already. It was a long night for the crossbench as the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, pinned them down on media reform. It’s not done and dusted as yet, but it’s almost there, as Nick Xenophon told ABC radio this morning: It is fair to say that we are on the verge of reaching an agreement. I think the best thing to do is give details of that once it has been finalised. It will be a significant package for smaller and regional publishers. Media in this country faces a crisis for a range of reasons, particularly the impact of Google and Facebook and advertising revenue. It is going to be another loooong day for the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, but he’s starting the day a little better than he did yesterday. Around this time yesterday he was facing off with Joel Fitzgibbon in the parliament hallways in full view of the cameras. This morning, he’s still in front of the cameras and interacting with Labor opponents but he looks like he’s having a better time with Ed Husic. Last night Olivia Newton-John was a guest at Parliament House, talking about the work of the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute and her own experiences with breast cancer. All sides of politics proved they were totally devoted to the power of ONJ, turning out in spades to hear Newton-John speak. Malcolm Turnbull said the debate is not coal vs renewables but how reliable power can be assured. What we are focused on is not a debate between coal on the one hand or renewables on the other, our focus is on affordable, reliable energy and meeting our emissions-reduction obligations we have entered into. We are working hard to secure Australia’s energy future which means ensuring Australians have access to reliable, base load or dispatchable power. But Labor’s Tanya Plibersek was having none of that: Here you have got a government that is so at war with itself that it can’t do anything on energy policy. The prime minister once said that he didn’t want to lead a party that was not as committed to real action on climate change as he was. Well he has dumped that, as he has dumped every other single thing that he used to stand for. He is now on a short leash, jerked by the coal enthusiasts in the party room who say if it is not coal, it’s nothing. We say there should more gas, more renewables, more storage and more certainty. A couple of quick points on the clean energy target: It has been clear from the moment Alan Finkel produced his report that the government would not implement his recommendation as modelled in his report – it would produce a mechanism which allowed incentives for coal. There has been positioning inside the government on this point since Finkel produced his report in June. The Nationals have made it clear coal being in the mix is the price of their support. Work inside the government continues on the clean energy target model, and the government now has a new report from the Australian Energy Market Operator which quantifies the shortfall once the Liddell power station exits the system. The government is now speaking about an investment framework rather than a clean energy target as a means of pivoting away from the specific Finkel recommendation (which was a CET, minus coal) to something more fossil fuel-friendly which has some prospect of clearing the Coalition party room. But even if the government can get an energy investment framework through the party room, it’s not clear whether Labor will support it. If it feels like we have been here before, it is because we have. Energy is once again the buzzword of the day, with government leaks hinting at what we already knew – that it looks like it is walking away from Finkel’s clean energy target in favour of an investor framework. We’ll hear plenty more on that today. Media reforms have also been shifted to the top of the Senate agenda, which, at this stage at least, means the government is feeling confident it’s close to a deal. Both Labor and the Coalition appear to have agreed on the anti-vilification legislation for the marriage equality postal survey campaign, which should be dealt with quickly, given both major parties are in support. And Simon Birmingham is gearing up for another fight over education, with his higher education funding reforms also due in the Senate. But that could change, depending on how much debate we see over media reforms. As always, I’ll have updates from the Guardian Australia political team, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens across the day and the comments thread is open for your business.

Now she wants to be the first undocumented immigrant in the state to be allowed to register as a lawyer. The 23-year-old had tended bar to make enough money to help support her family and attend law school at Rutgers University, in Newark. She took the bar exam this summer and is waiting for the results. She was smuggled across the border from Mexico at just 18 months old, in a vehicle, with fake papers. Her parents crossed through the treacherous desert and the family has lived in the US ever since. “I’m considered to be one of the leaders of undocumented youth in New Jersey because I was the first to be public about it,” Conde-Hernandez said. She remembers first talking loudly about “being illegal” to her kindergarten teacher, before her mother quickly hushed her. She now rejects the term illegal as inhumane. Conde-Hernandez is the subject of a film and photography project, called Newest Americans, which will be featured in a photography festival that started on Wednesday in Dumbo in Brooklyn, New York, called Photoville. She is currently protected from deportation back to a country she has never consciously known, because she is a Dreamer – part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, allowing eligible young people to study or work legally, which was started by Barack Obama and was earmarked for cancelation by Donald Trump earlier this month. “I find myself needing to talk about it. What if I cannot practice as an attorney?” she said. If she gets a high enough score on the bar exam, it’s her mission to fight for legal and professional status in New Jersey. She also said, choking up, that she might need her skills in the future to prevent undocumented relatives from being sent back to Mexico, including her father. Newest Americans is an arts project focusing on personal stories coming out of the incredibly varied student and faculty population of Rutgers. It has repeatedly been called America’s most diverse college campus by the magazine, US News &amp; World Report, which surveys and ranks US universities annually. “It’s majority minorities. It’s a microcosm of the way the rest of the country’s demographics are going,” said Julie Winokur, executive director of Talking Eyes Media, a New Jersey-based documentary production and storytelling non-profit, who led the creative team on the project. People involved in Newest Americans, including Conde-Hernandez and Winokur, will be part of the opening night event at Photoville on Wednesday. “Rutgers is a place of opportunity and part of an incredibly dynamic, multi-cultural community that’s thriving. It’s basically every white supremacist’s worst nightmare,” Winokur said. In statistics supplied by the college about its intake this fall, the Rutgers University student body at its Newark campus is 27% Latino, 23.5% white, 20% Asian, 19% black and 11% Native American and other smaller ethnic groups. Newest Americans will be featured in video and photography exhibitions at Photoville, centered around evening events at the beer garden and a “village” of shipping containers dotted around Brooklyn Bridge Park, by the river. Each one will house photography exhibitions examining different themes, and running from 13 to 17 and 21 to 24 September. Now an annual event in its sixth year, Photoville has taken on many themes at the forefront of current affairs around the world, but particularly concerning the socio-political upheaval roiling American life since the rise and electoral victory of Trump. Newest Americans features images of young American Muslim women wearing and discussing the hijab. A shipping container exhibition called Body Talk by online lifestyle magazine Refinery29 shows striking images of women in water at the beach in different countries, highlighting transgender rights and sexuality, and how beaches can be a source of both “empowerment and anxiety” for people, especially women. Laura Roumanos, one of the three co-creators of Photoville, said the team decided at the last minute to feature images from the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month, which quickly broke down into violence when white nationalists carrying weapons, shouting racist slogans and performing Hitler salutes were confronted by counter-demonstrators. “It’s an example of images and issues arising from an event that many people, including me, as the mother of a two-year-old, were scared to attend. I took my daughter to the Womens’ March on Washington, but not Charlottesville. We wanted to create a space where people can have constructive conversations about such difficult issues as hate. It’s about how to rise above,” Roumanos said. Other exhibitions look at the role climate change plays in terrorism recruiting and security problems in Somalia, images from war-torn Syria and young African American men’s sense of identity. Photographer Endia Beal’s powerful project about black women entering the workforce: Am I what you’re looking for? is also part of Photoville, as are pictures documenting inner-city life among low-income, immigrant communities of post-industrial Ironbound, New Jersey. This article was amended on 14 September 2017 to clarify that Newark is not the location of Rutgers’ main campus, and Endia Beal’s project is part of Photoville, not Newest Americans. This article was amended on 19 September 2017, to correct diversity statistics for the Rutgers-Newark campus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/12/the-disaster-artist-review-james-franco-toronto-film-festival-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T22:21:23Z","webTitle":"The Disaster Artist review – James Franco's ode to bad film-making is a riot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/12/the-disaster-artist-review-james-franco-toronto-film-festival-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/12/the-disaster-artist-review-james-franco-toronto-film-festival-tiff","fields":{"headline":"The Disaster Artist review – James Franco's ode to bad film-making is a riot","bodyText":"One of the overriding questions one has while enduring a particularly awful film is, with all of the talented out-of-work film-makers in Hollywood, just how on earth did this get made? Did no one take the time to really read the script? Couldn’t someone spot the signs during production? Didn’t anyone try to burn all available copies of the film before it limped onto the screen? There’s a certain sadistic pleasure in not only watching a “so bad it’s good” movie (a hobby that’s grown in popularity in recent years) but also to explore the tortured story behind the scenes. It’s especially fascinating when the finished product emerges in total earnest, seemingly produced by a team of people blissfully unaware of the horrors they have inflicted on an audience. Not many films conjure up this playful curiosity quite as much as 2003 oddity The Room. It’s a small-budget drama that developed a cult status for its stilted acting, nonsensical plotting and indefinable central figure Tommy Wiseau. It was released in just one theater in LA, with a two week extension paid for by Wiseau himself to ensure that it qualified for Oscar consideration. The compellingly strange details of its production were turned into a book, The Disaster Artist, which has now made its way to its inevitable resting place: the big screen. Greg (Dave Franco) is a 19-year-old struggling actor living in San Francisco. He struggles not just because of the impossibly competitive nature of the industry, but also because, well, he’s not that good. In acting class, he’s finding it hard to lose himself in a scene, a problem that is quite notably not shared by boisterous classmate Tommy (James Franco). The pair begin to bond, Greg envious of Tommy’s apparent confidence and Tommy jealous of Greg’s “baby face” looks. Tommy is a frustrating enigma: his age, place of birth and source of income remain a mystery, but his enthusiasm compels Greg to stick with him. After the pair move to Los Angeles, they both try plotting their individual routes into the industry, but Tommy’s eccentricities and Greg’s stiffness mean that their careers fail to take off. After yet another rejection, they hatch a plan: why not make their own movie? Tommy heads to his typewriter and before long, The Room is ready for production, with Tommy playing the lead and Greg nabbing a major part. But as the cameras start to roll, Greg discovers that he’s underestimated Tommy’s quirks and overestimated his talents. While it’s not entirely essential to have seen The Room before The Disaster Artist, it does elevate the experience, the script answering longstanding questions hardcore fans have had for years. Franco, who, like Wiseau, also acts as director here, has crafted a loving tribute to the film, its fans and also film-making in general. There’s a tendency to cast aside unfathomably bad movies, the belief that their lack of quality then dictates a lack of respect, but Franco has assembled a painstaking recreation and a detailed exploration into a story that might never have been told. In the past few years, Franco’s career has turned into something of a joke: his tiresome need to provoke and his unfounded belief that he is a master of all trades means it’s all too easy to forget his talent as an actor. But he is staggeringly good here, almost unrecognizable as Wiseau, nailing his strange mannerisms, unusual voice and awkward laugh while also delving deeper to inhabit a man whose deep-rooted insecurities are messily papered over with bravado. It’s easy to laugh at Wiseau, and the film unavoidably does, but it’s harder to make us actually care about him. It’s an affectionately handled portrait of a difficult man, and we share the frustration and sympathy of other characters. As director, he does solid work, but peppers his film with some bizarrely picked pop culture references. Despite the film being set in the late 90s/early 00s, the music is all from the early 90s and, clumsily, a number of posters in the background of scenes are of films released years after. As the film starts to cover the meat of the story, the production of The Room itself, it becomes giddy, often hysterically funny entertainment. We follow Greg’s increasing horror as he realizes just what he’s got himself into and there’s a sustained series of ludicrous, crowd-pleasing set-pieces in rapid succession. Franco has also recruited a strong cast of actors for the many small roles in the film, including Seth Rogen, Alison Brie, Jacki Weaver, Sharon Stone, Melanie Griffith, Megan Mullally, Hannibal Buress, Judd Apatow, Bryan Cranston, Zac Efron and Ari Graynor. But the dazzle of the cast and the targeted in-jokes never take away from the film’s core messaging about the importance of believing in one’s own ability as an artist. Rather like last year’s Florence Foster Jenkins, the finale shows that even a really, unarguably bad performance can bring unabashed joy to a crowd, and with awards buzz already circulating around The Disaster Artist, Wiseau might be heading to the Oscars after all. The Disaster Artist is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in US cinemas on 1 December with a UK date yet to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/12/hammond-tries-to-keep-eu-friction-at-acceptable-levels-in-his-lords-outing","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T21:13:06Z","webTitle":"Hammond tries to keep EU friction at acceptable levels in Lords outing | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/12/hammond-tries-to-keep-eu-friction-at-acceptable-levels-in-his-lords-outing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/12/hammond-tries-to-keep-eu-friction-at-acceptable-levels-in-his-lords-outing","fields":{"headline":"Hammond tries to keep EU friction at acceptable levels in Lords outing","bodyText":"Midway through his appearance before the House of Lords select committee on economic affairs, Philip “Lurch” Hammond dodged a question on how the economy was coping with artificial intelligence – “Not very well, since you mention it, now we have a Maybot in charge of the country” – to insist that his main focus was on Brexit. “The quicker we can provide clarity the better,” he said. Labour peer Alistair Darling gave a sigh of relief. Clarity on Brexit has been in short supply. Unfortunately it was to remain so. Just because it would be better to give the clarity of which he spoke, it didn’t follow that Lurch was in any mood to oblige, though he could confirm that last week’s leaked report on being beastly to foreigners was not the government’s preferred position, unless the need should arise when it might become so. What the government was basically after was for everything to remain pretty much the same as it was now for as long as it took for someone – not him, that kind of stuff was well above his pay grade – to see if they could come up with anything better. “Business can’t cope with two sets of changes in any transitional arrangements,” Lurch announced confidently. “So we would be remaining in the single market and the customs union during the transitional period,” said a relieved Darling. Lurch looked puzzled. What part of the status quo didn’t the former chancellor understand? Of course we wouldn’t be staying in the single market and the customs union, because we would be automatically leaving both in March 2019 when we left the EU. Now it was Darling’s turn to look confused. How could everything be the same when everything was fundamentally different? And why did the government imagine that the EU would be willing to let the UK carry on doing exactly as we liked, negotiating new third-party trade deals with whoever – on the hoof – when we weren’t prepared to accept freedom of movement? How could we have left the EU yet still be in a state of leaving? Lurch shrugged. Just because. Negotiating with the EU was a bit like sending a letter to Santa. You wrote what you wanted on a piece of paper, shoved it up the chimney and come Christmas Day Michel Barnier would deliver. The EU was bound to give us everything we wanted because we were nice. And British. Why would they care if we were to offer India a more favourable deal than we were them? Darling began to quietly sob, unable to work out if Lurch was having a nervous breakdown or was just catatonically dim. “If we already have frictionless trade,” he asked, “how can we possibly get a better deal than the one we have?” “It may not be quite as frictionless as all that,” Lurch reluctantly conceded. “But we will try to keep the friction at acceptable levels.” Fingers crossed and all that. Sensing the chancellor was now in danger of going seriously off-message, Norman Lamont, another former chancellor and an enthusiastic Brexiter, tried to get him back on track. “This is very persuasive,” he said, summoning all of his legendary smarm. But just say that the EU didn’t choose to play ball. How well did he think Britain was prepared for a no-deal scenario? Now Lurch could barely contain his laughter. Prepared? Who did he think he was kidding? If no customs deal could be reached, then the lorries would be backed up miles along the M20 outside Dover. Britain would be in a state of gridlock within days. Any BMW stuck on transporters would be second-hand by the time anyone got their hands on it. Lamont kept silent before Lurch could do any more damage. But it was far too late. Lurch had inadvertently given away the government’s position on Brexit. It was almost the same as Labour’s. Only even more confused."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/12/hurricane-irma-florida-tourism-industry-suffering","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T18:54:36Z","webTitle":"Florida tourist industry counts the cost of Irma's devastation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/12/hurricane-irma-florida-tourism-industry-suffering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/12/hurricane-irma-florida-tourism-industry-suffering","fields":{"headline":"Florida tourist industry counts the cost of Irma's devastation","bodyText":"Barely a month ago, Florida proudly announced a record-setting number of visitors to the Sunshine State – more than 60 million tourists coming to enjoy its theme parks, beaches and other attractions since January. Now, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma, tourism is facing a major challenge. The devastation caused by one of history’s largest storms, especially in the popular Florida Keys, is a direct strike at the $90bn industry that fuels the state’s economic engine, with the harm caused incalculable, experts say, at least in the short term. “Anything that happens to our tourism industry impacts the state of Florida in a huge way,” said Kevin Murphy, chair of the Rosen college of hospitality management at the University of Central Florida, speaking before the White House announced that President Trump will visit the state on Thursday. Murphy said: “It’s like a ripple effect. It’s like dropping not a pebble but a large rock in a pond with the ripples going out. That’s what it does to our economy. “Disney, Universal, all the big parks, they’ll survive just fine. It’s all of the smaller tour operators, the people that make their living on taxi rides, gator boat rides, they’re really going to be hurt. Since our economy is built on small businesses, there’ll be a huge impact, the housekeepers, all those people living paycheck to paycheck. For them this is devastating.” Rebuilding the tourist industry in the hardest-hit areas is just one of the massive challenges facing Florida as it plots its recovery from the largest storm ever to hit the state. After the immediate priorities of restoring power, water and sewers, affected cities on both coasts and along the Keys must repair washed-away beaches and damaged infrastructure, and ensure it is safe for visitors to return. In the longer term there will be questions over strengthening construction codes for buildings to better withstand severe storms, how much insurance premiums will rise for property owners, and how property values will be affected. But for now the 1.4 million people employed in Florida’s hospitality and tourism industries have only one priority, getting back to work and getting their businesses open again. On Tuesday in Treasure Island, a barrier island off of St Petersburg, the buzz of chainsaws echoed across an empty road. Homes are boarded up, but the hospitality industry is getting back to work. Businesses here operate on notoriously slim margins. Even closing for a few days can be a huge financial burden, not only to owners but to staff. “It’s brutal,” said Brad Piche, owner of Ricky T’s, an outdoor beach bar across from some of the largest Gulf fronted hotels. “We’re still paying payroll, but we got no money coming in. It’s expensive, you’re not only closed, but you have younger kids working here,” he said. “People who had “never been through something like this.” One member of his staff fled to Chicago, Illinois to avoid the storm. “We got people all over the country,” Piche said, meaning Irma was still causing problems as it harassed states people evacuated to, such as Alabama and Georgia. “Even though I’ll be all cleaned up and ready to open, I might not have a staff,” said Piche, who estimates he would have lost $15,000 in food if the power had stayed off longer. In one dark bar, R Bar and Grille, all the seats are taken. Nancy Patterson, the bartender, sprays soda into icy plastic cups as she hops between customers. Has Irma affected business? “Absolutely,” she said. “It was closed for a couple days, business is business. “I don’t have power in my house and I came to work,” she said. “I think a lot of people don’t have power.” It could have been worse. Along with homes, businesses in the Florida Keys have been ravaged. And in Key West, which suffered some flooding but avoided the worst of the damage, tourism businesses might be ready to open, but no visitors can get there. “We’re just cleaning up as best we can and waiting. There’s nobody here,” an employee in the bookshop of the Hemingway House, the island’s leading tourist attraction, told the Guardian. Key West is a popular cruise destination from passengers from Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa and other ports around the US, but will continue to lose out if restoration takes a long time, as is feared. “What’ll happen is they’ll shift the ships from the east to the west Caribbean itinerary, and maybe Jamaica or the Yucatan pick up some of the calls that Key West would normally get,” said Andrew Coggins, a cruise industry analyst at Pace University’s Lubin school of business in New York. “The question is how badly damaged the shops and restaurants are that generate revenue from the cruise passengers.” The support of Visit Florida, the state’s official tourism body, and trade organisations are available to business owners. The Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association for example has a comprehensive list of resources available to its more than 10,000 members on its website. But only time will tell how quickly Florida’s tourism industry bounces back. “Those tourism dollars are absolutely huge, particularly from American visitors,” said Alan Fyall, professor of tourism and marketing at UCF. “The scale of the industry you can’t grasp until you get here. One thing people fail to realise is that Florida’s a playground for domestic tourism. Sure there are all these international visitors, from Europe and the UK, but essentially Florida is for Americans.” The sentiment was acknowledged by Florida governor Rick Scott even as he focused on the recovery efforts in the Florida Keys on Monday. “This state has a strong, resilient people,” he said at a briefing. “We’re going to get our jobs back, we’re going to help build our companies again.

Taylor is alleged to have discouraged Tony Brien, one of Ted Langford’s victims, from reporting what had happened and told him, according to evidence presented to the inquiry, that he should “move on” after the teenager informed Villa in the 1987-88 season that he knew from personal experience, aged 12 to 14, that boys were at risk, having been abused at a feeder club for Leicester City. Taylor died in January this year, a hugely popular figure after his long managerial career, but the inquiry is also looking at a separate allegation relating to his first spell at Villa, from 1987 to 1990, that another of Langford’s victims came forward with information that could have saved other boys from similar ordeals. As well as evidence from Brien, the barrister in charge of the inquiry, Clive Sheldon QC has heard a claim that one boy told Villa what had happened and Taylor subsequently visited him at home with another member of staff. The allegation, again, is that Taylor discouraged the boy from taking it further. In Brien’s case, he alleges that Taylor spoke to him on the telephone and told him that if the story reached the newspapers it would make the player, then at the start of his professional career, a target for terrace taunts. Taylor, Brien says, asked him to imagine what it would be like hearing the crowd’s obscenities every week. Brien, who was 18 and had just broken into Leicester’s first team, claims the message was, “Can you really be doing with the abuse from the terraces?” The police were never informed and new evidence shows Langford, previously a scout for Leicester, continued working for Villa until the summer of 1989, raising questions for one of England’s biggest clubs about what they knew, what they did about it and how many boys potentially suffered as a result. The Guardian has seen a letter on Villa-headed notepaper that has Dave Richardson, then the club’s assistant manager, inviting one boy to a four-day training course in March 1989 and explaining that “exact arrangements will be given by our representative Mr T Langford”. The boy in question has reported he was abused by Langford from 1987 to 1989, including at Villa’s training ground. Richardson, who went on to have key roles in youth development for the Football Association and the Premier League, has chosen not to comment while the inquiry is ongoing but has clearly stated on previous occasions, including a statement issued by his lawyers, that the club were first warned in 1987, leading to an internal investigation and Langford’s sacking. Yet other official papers, also seen by this newspaper, show that Langford continued to be paid for up to two years after that point. Langford, a part-time scout in the club’s youth set-up, was paid throughout the entire 1987-88 and 1988-89 seasons. His final payment came in June 1989 when he was sacked in the wake of other allegations that Villa did not report to the police or the FA. Langford, a binman in his ordinary job, continued to work in youth football in the Birmingham area and when he was finally convicted in 2007 the offences related to four boys from 1976 to 1989. Langford admitted three charges of indecent assault and four of gross indecency and was sentenced to three years in prison. A decade later, his involvement at Villa is one of the cases being investigated under point five in the inquiry’s terms of reference, namely to examine “what that club did or did not know and/or did or did not do in relation to child sexual abuse”. Sheldon intends to interview Richardson and the findings are expected next year. Brien, now 48, played for Leicester, Chesterfield, Rotherham United, West Bromwich Albion and Hull City in an 11-year professional career and waived his anonymity after the Guardian’s interview with the former Crewe Alexandra footballer Andy Woodward last November started what the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as a “tidal wave”. The last police figures, from 30 June, showed 741 alleged victims had come forward and 276 suspects had been identified. Operation Hydrant, the specialist police unit in charge of the operation, had received 1,886 referrals and a number of court cases involving professional clubs are under way. Langford was 66 when he appeared at Birmingham crown court in December 2007 and was described by the judge as someone who “held the keys” to boys’ dreams, molesting youngsters who “would have been in awe of you, unable to quarrel with you or reject your advances”. The team were Dunlop Terriers, who acted as a feeder club for Villa and, previously, Leicester. All the victims suffered psychological damage, the court was told, including one who had taken an overdose which left him in hospital. Langford’s lawyer said his client regarded the boys as “easy victims” because of their dream to become professional footballers. Brien, who was not involved in the criminal case, went to the police last December only to discover that Langford had died in 2012. His police statement was passed to the FA and, in an interview with the organisation’s senior case officer, David Gregson, in March, he also recalled Dunlop Terriers going on exchange trips to Sweden and Denmark – playing in Leicester kit – when Langford would share a bunk bed with different boys on the ferry. A lot of boys, Brien said, would play those games with love bites on their necks. In his later evidence to the inquiry, he was asked to describe Langford and talked of him being “always in tracksuit bottoms, little goatee beard, yellow fingers from smoking his Park Drive and small hands”. Langford was the manager of Dunlop Terriers, who were based in Birmingham, and Brien was there when they had links with Leicester, where Richardson was youth-team manager from 1980 to 1987. Brien was eventually taken on by Leicester but at the age of 12, Langford told him that if he wanted to make it as a footballer he needed to show the club’s doctors he had a special gene that could be found only in sperm. Langford would then drive him to the Hilltop golf course in Birmingham, close to Brien’s school, and abuse him in his red Ford Granada. Giving evidence to the inquiry on 10 August, Brien said he eventually became strong enough, at 14, to warn Langford off and, desperate to cleanse himself from “a dirty feeling I couldn’t get rid of”, summoned up the courage to report him when Richardson left Leicester to join Villa four years later. Langford moved with Richardson at the same time, with Dunlop Terriers also switching allegiances, and Brien said he knew other boys would be at risk. “Dave Richardson brought me to Leicester City. I felt as though he was the only one I could really tell because he had that man working for him as well. I wanted to do something to stop it happening again.” According to Brien, there were a number of telephone conversations in the following weeks and then Richardson allegedly rang him to say the club had decided what to do, telling him: “You’re a good player – sweep it under the carpet, son, move on.” Taylor was then said to have taken the phone and repeat the message. “They discouraged me from going forward and never offered me a chance to go to the police or anything like that,” Brien said, answering questions from Sheldon and a second barrister, David Bedenham. “We used to look up to Dave Richardson as though he was a father figure. I’ve still got a lot of admiration for Dave Richardson, [for] what he did for me when I was a young man being coached. I thought he was a brilliant coach. But when I thought I was doing the right thing by reporting it to somebody who I trusted I felt let down and I didn’t know what to do. “I was an 18-year-old child – well, child, man, whatever you want to call it – and you just don’t know what to do next. You’ve actually gone forward and told somebody, but they’ve just said: ‘Well, yeah ...’ They’re like: ‘Whatever …’ and you’re in shock.” When Richardson was interviewed on two separate occasions by the BBC in January he appeared to remember Brien telling him about Langford and said he had already received other warnings, prompting him to start an investigation that was “dealt with fairly rapidly ... as soon as we got more information, as soon as I knew, we brought him [Langford] in and we got him out of the way.” Richardson added that he did everything possible to help his players and it was “totally wrong” to say he had tried to smooth it over. “The bottom line is once he’d rung me [I would have said]: ‘We’re dealing with it, it will be dealt with in such a way whereby you don’t have to worry.’ I would have told him: ‘Leave it with me and we’ll deal with it.’ I wouldn’t brush it under the carpet, otherwise I wouldn’t have sacked him [Langford].” In a statement issued by his lawyers, Richardson then said he could not recall any conversation with Brien and that he had launched the internal investigation, resulting in Langford’s sacking, after “alarming allegations” from another member of staff in the pre-season of 1987. “I took these extremely seriously and began making inquiries. These led me to speak to the parents of two young footballers at Aston Villa who each told me their sons had been abused by Ted Langford. I asked them if they were going to report the allegations to the police or if they wanted me to. After consulting with each other, both sets of parents told me that they did not want the matter reported to the police. “I respected that request and, therefore, instead I reported the allegations to Graham Taylor, Doug Ellis and Steve Stride [respectively the manager, chairman and secretary of Aston Villa] with my recommendation that Ted Langford be dismissed. This was accepted and Mr Langford was duly sacked by the club. “In the late 1980s regrettably there were not the safeguarding procedures and protections which exist today. Since the parents of the two young footballers at Aston Villa had not wanted the allegations reported to the police, I did nothing further once Mr Langford had been dismissed and indeed heard nothing more about him until I was told in November 2016 that he had been imprisoned for abuse offences and subsequently had died.” Dino Nocivelli, a lawyer who specialises in abuse cases, from solicitors Bolt Burdon Kemp, said of Villa: “They should have done more to protect children in their care. My clients have been let down and other children have been abused due to the lack of action from Villa staff.” Taylor was appointed as England manager in 1990 and though his time in charge of the national team was not a success, he had become something of a national treasure by the time he died, aged 72. He was awarded an OBE in 2001 and his managerial career also included two periods in charge at Watford, where one of the stands is named after him, plus spells at Lincoln City and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Taylor’s family and former representatives have been made aware about what the inquiry has heard. Richardson, a former teacher and non-league player, began his long coaching career with Middlesbrough’s schoolboys in 1966. After his spells at Leicester and Villa, he became director of youth at the Premier League and was later appointed chairman of the Professional Football Coaches Association, whose website credits him for having “worked closely with the then FA technical director, Howard Wilkinson, to establish the current academy system in professional football”. Ellis, who was also once prominent within the FA as well as being on various committees for Fifa and the Premier League, stepped down at Villa in 2006 after a £62.6m takeover. Now 93, he is currently abroad and unavailable for comment but has said in the past that he remembered allegations of a child abuser but could not recall any discussion about whether the police should be informed. Then, as now, there was no legal requirement to report Langford to the authorities. Villa say they cannot comment on specific allegations involving Langford because of “ongoing legal proceedings”. A statement said: “The club has co-operated fully with the ongoing FA investigation and takes the safeguarding and welfare of all players and staff very seriously and considers it to be of paramount importance. The club now has robust safeguarding polices and procedures in place to deal with any new and historic complaints raised.” Leicester have also released a statement saying the club had “no indication of any current or historic allegations made against or in relation to [its] employees. We would, of course, investigate fully in the event any further information comes to light.” Brien, whose career also included loan spells at Mansfield Town and Chester City, gave a full account of his story to the police in December but told the inquiry he opted against naming Taylor during an appearance on the Victoria Derbyshire Show on 30 January because the funeral was two days later. “No matter how much has happened to me, he’s still got a family and whatever you call it – respect, dignity, I don’t know – I just said: ‘This is not the right time to be [mentioning him].’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/12/bell-pottinger-goes-into-administration","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T17:41:31Z","webTitle":"Bell Pottinger goes into administration amid South Africa scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/12/bell-pottinger-goes-into-administration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/12/bell-pottinger-goes-into-administration","fields":{"headline":"Bell Pottinger goes into administration amid South Africa scandal","bodyText":"Bell Pottinger has been put into administration after the PR firm suffered an exodus of clients and increasing losses in the wake of the scandal over its campaign to stir up racial tensions in South Africa. The administrators BDO, who had unsuccessfully sought a buyer in a fire sale of the embattled company, said it had made a number of the 250 staff redundant as it sought to recoup losses to pay off bank debt. “The administrators are now working with the remaining partners and employees to seek an orderly transfer of Bell Pottinger’s clients to other firms in order to protect and realise value for creditors,” a BDO spokesman said. “Following an immediate assessment of the financial position, the administrators have made a number of redundancies.” The move to put Bell Pottinger into administration does not affect its subsidiaries in Asia and the Middle East. The management of those units, which are legally separate from the scandal-ridden parent company, are in negotiations to be spun off and rebranded. The London-based parent firm is thought to have accumulated losses of about £5m – in part related to payouts to former management, including its co-founder Tim Bell who left last summer – which it has no prospect of recouping. “The level of those losses, compounded by the inability of the business to win new clients, was such that remaining management were left with no option but to commence the process to place all UK Bell Pottinger entities into administration,” BDO said. BDO said the business had been “heavily financially impacted” by the loss of clients, partners and staff as the scandal spiralled in recent weeks. The chief executive, James Henderson, resigned last Sunday, the day before the UK’s PR trade body expelled Bell Pottinger from its ranks. Administrators from BDO informed staff of the adminstration, and layoffs, at an emotionally charged meeting at Bell Pottinger’s Holborn offices in central London. One witness said: “There was a lot of anger and upset. A lot of talented and innocent people have had their lives and careers shattered, people who had nothing to do with a piece of morally indefensible work carried out by a small group of former colleagues.” The Public Relations and Communications Association said it had never before “passed down such a damning indictment of an agency’s behaviour”, with the five-year minimum ban being unprecedented for a City PR firm of Bell Pottinger’s size. The firm was being paid £100,000 a month by its client Oakbay Capital, the holding company of the wealthy, powerful and controversial Gupta family, to run a social media and PR campaign in South Africa focused on “economic apartheid”. The Guptas have been accused of benefiting financially from their close links to the South African president, Jacob Zuma, whose son Duduzane has been a director at several Gupta-owned companies and worked for Oakbay. Both have previously denied such a relationship. More than a dozen clients, including Waitrose, Richemont, Investec, HSBC, TalkTalk and the Clydesdale banking group, have cut ties with the agency. Even the tobacco giant Imperial Brands, owner of Gauloises, John Player and Winston – the kind of client on which Bell Pottinger built its business – is reviewing its account after using the agency for more than two decades. Last week, the Guardian revealed that the agency’s second-biggest shareholder, Chime, which is owned by the US firm Providence and Sir Martin Sorrell’s WPP, had handed back its 27% stake for free to escape the scandal. The collapse of Bell Pottinger marks an ignominious end for one of the most high-profile and controversial UK PR firms of the last 30 years. Co-founded in 1987 by Lord Bell, Margaret Thatcher’s favourite ad man, the agency built its reputation on a mix of high-profile City companies and taking on sensitive geo-political clients that others may have balked at. Bell handled a string of controversial clients, including the Pinochet Foundation; Syria’s first lady, Asma al-Assad; the governments of Bahrain and Egypt; Oscar Pistorius, after he was charged with murder; FW de Klerk, when he ran against Nelson Mandela for president; and Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian dictator. It also emerged last year that Bell Pottinger had been paid £500m to make propaganda videos in Iraq on behalf of the US government. They included short news segments made to look like Arabic news networks, and fake insurgent videos. “As long as there is controversy about things there will be controversial characters,” an unrepentant Bell said last week. “You can’t spend your life regretting what you do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/13/brexit-rights-theresa-may-eu-uk-brexit-identity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Brexit rots our rights.

How can Theresa May ignore the stench?","bodyText":"Prime ministers are rarely judged on the power of their noses. The way they speak and listen attracts comment. They are praised if they have a common touch or strong vision. Smell is routinely underrated among the political senses, and yet I am increasingly convinced that deficiency in this department is Theresa May’s greatest weakness. Not literally. I’m sure she can tell when the milk in a No 10 fridge is off. But she struggles with tests of political pungency. She did not catch vote-repellent whiffs emanating from her doomed election manifesto – the stale tang of foxhunting, for example. She has sidled close to Donald Trump, disregarding his offences against decency and democracy, without so much as a nostril twitch towards the American president. I raised this weakness once with a Downing Street aide in the context of EU nationals resident in the UK. It was this time last year, in the run-up to Conservative party conference. In the months since the referendum, pretty much everyone I knew of non-British background had received some stranger’s jibe to the effect that they had overstayed their welcome in this country. Data showing a surge in reported hate crime supported my anecdotal evidence, stuff we had seen: abuse hurled from passing cars; a child in tears because schoolmates asked when she was “going back” to a country she hardly knew. There was something rancid in the air, and I wondered if the prime minister could smell it. This was not, I insisted, an invitation to change course on Brexit, nor a criticism of those who voted to leave the EU. Full-bore racists were a tiny minority. But it may, I said, be in the prime minister’s interests to show sensitivity. Somewhere on their liberation march, leavers trod in something nasty, and the new government should check its shoes. I was told that May was known as an ex-remainer and needed to consolidate her new credentials as a Brexiter. She dare not show sympathy for a cause she had abandoned. A year later, no one thinks May has a soft spot for the 2.9 million EU citizens in the UK. The cloud of casual xenophobia has become a light rain of institutional prejudice: landlords refusing to let properties, employers demanding proofs of residency that are not required by law. Not yet. A government position paper, published over the summer, makes it clear that non-British EU citizens will have to apply to the Home Office for new legal status. Their subsequent entitlements, the ease with which they may reassemble a facsimile of what they have now, will depend on the date when they arrived in the country. For most Brexiters, this is uncontroversial. EU membership made Britain open its borders to continental settlers. That arrangement will end, so it stands to reason that non-Britons must embark on the route to citizenship (which the government says will be easy) or accept their foreignness. To the leaver-believer, this is a generous offer. Move along, nothing to smell here. It is hard to convey odours with words, but let me try to explain what it is that makes this remainer recoil. Brexiters see the issue in bureaucratic terms – moving people between legal rubrics. Most will not see it in terms of identity because they don’t see an EU passport as a credible vehicle for any emotional sense of belonging. If they did, they would have voted remain. Through the leaver lens, French passport-holders in Britain were simply French. They had the option of taking British citizenship before Brexit, and will still have it. Legal uncertainty in the interim is regrettable, but that is a problem of timing, not ethics. Anyone from a migrant background will appreciate that there is no easy separation of official status and belonging. Even those who, like me, were born in the UK to immigrant parents, and have had British passports from birth, carry a sense of the permission that was once granted. We recognise that times change, and societies may become more or less permissive. Generosity waxes and wanes. But in the mainstream, those shifts have always been expressed in rules for future migration. Retrospective changes – rescinding licences already granted – belonged on the send-’em-home fringe. EU free movement conferred a right to relocate. And, whether Brexiters like it or not, that implied a right to belong in perpetuity. So it is not a technical adjustment, this decision to downgrade the status of people who took jobs, married, had children, all on the basis of their old status. It calls out their failure to be more indigenous and confiscates a little something from them. In so doing it hints at the conditionality of the deal other British people with roots abroad thought was sealed. Many British citizens with immigrant backgrounds voted leave and are happy with that choice. I can speak only for any who share my anxiety when I warn that the treatment of EU citizens probes a delicate place in our migrant psyches. It slides a government nail under the seam where multiple identities overlap, picking away at the place where we had woven together the idea of being British and something else – Indian, African, Muslim, Jewish, European – without being forced to rank or discard. Brexit forces choices. It tells French citizens in Britain (and British citizens in France) that they must reapply to be something they thought they were already: at home. A kind interpretation of Theresa May’s record as home secretary is that she never tried to understand immigration beyond the pressure from those people who want less of it. That is a sensitivity worth heeding too, and one to which liberal pro-Europeans often blocked their eyes, ears and noses. But Brexit is being enacted to satisfy that demand. Leaving the European Union will negate a right that millions of people exercised as the foundation for their lives in this country. Any claim that they cannot be wounded by it is absurd. It cuts deeper than many leavers realise. It is a big deal to revoke permission to belong in a country. I don’t expect the prime minister to know how it feels, how it smells, to those of us who owe everything to such permissions, but I can tell her. It hurts and it stinks. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/12/british-navy-warships-to-use-voice-controlled-system-like-siri","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T17:18:46Z","webTitle":"British navy warships 'to use Siri' as technology transforms warfare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/british-navy-warships-to-use-voice-controlled-system-like-siri","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/british-navy-warships-to-use-voice-controlled-system-like-siri","fields":{"headline":"British navy warships 'to use Siri' as technology transforms warfare","bodyText":"British warships are to employ a voice-controlled system along the lines of Apple’s Siri assistant, the first sea lord, Adm Sir Philip Jones, has said at the opening of one of the biggest arms fairs in the world. Jones said the Royal Navy was witnessing the rapid speed at which warfare is being transformed by IT and had to move to embrace it. He cited the new Type-31 frigates, scheduled for deployment in 2023, as an example, with IT being integrated into their weapons systems as well as the running of the ship and offshore logistics. “What this means in practice is that the Type 31e will feature different app-based tools which can access the ship’s data. These will be operated from a series of touchscreen displays, Siri-style voice-controlled assistants and perhaps even augmented reality technology,” Jones said on Tuesday. “This is not a gimmick or a fad. As modern warfare becomes ever faster, and ever more data driven, our greatest asset will be the ability to cut through the deluge of information to think and act decisively.” While most people tend to ask voice assistant Siri questions such as “What’s the weather going to be like today?”, the navy may have more ambitious questions such as “Who fired that missile?” – but Jones did not elaborate. The first sea lord said the changes to IT in the armed forces glimpsed in the last two years have potential knock-on effects on the traditional make-up of the navy. “This requires big decisions, with far reaching consequences. Are we, for instance, prepared to remove existing platforms from service in order to create the financial and manpower headroom to introduce new systems which, in time, could deliver truly transformative advances in capability?” Jones said. The impact of IT on warfare was one of the dominant themes at the Defence and Security Equipment International exhibition. The exhibition at the ExCel centre in Docklands, held every two years, has attracted 1,600 exhibitors. Forty-two countries have pavilions showcasing equipment including weapons and security devices, ships docked outside and planes, armoured cars, drones and motorbike-mounted rifles. About 100 anti-arms trade campaigners were arrested outside on Monday. International trade secretary Liam Fox mounted an unashamed defence of Britain’s arms exports industry on the opening day of DSEI. Ignoring the protests, Fox hailed the British arms export sector for its contribution to the country’s economy. The UK is a global leader in defence and that should be celebrated, he said. Justifying the arms trade in moral terms as well as economic, Fox said: “If nations and peoples have an inalienable right to look after their own defence, those of who trade from advanced economies must remember that if we did not provide countries with the means of defending themselves then we would see a proliferation of uncontrolled and unregulated arms sales free from oversight or inhibition. To allow such a situation to develop would be vastly irresponsible. “The UK hosts one of the most highly sophisticated, structured and multi-faceted export licensing regimes in the world. At the same time they are not designed to hinder trade or prohibit exports. “Rather they are robust safety measures to allow ethical defences exports to flourish, protected by a licensing system to ensure exports are rational and lawful and which guarantees that we do not in the process violate international law, create tensions, promote terrorism or endanger global security.” The UK is the sixth biggest arms exporter in the world. Fox cited exports to the United Arab Emirates, Eastern Europe and India but made no mention of the UK’s huge sales to countries such as Saudi Arabia, which has been conducting a sustained bombing campaign of Yemen. According to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, the UK has sold £3.8bn in defence equipment to Saudi Arabia since 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/12/sky-takeover-bradley-letters-reveal-concerns-over-fox-standards","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T20:18:50Z","webTitle":"Sky takeover: Bradley letters reveal concerns over Fox standards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/12/sky-takeover-bradley-letters-reveal-concerns-over-fox-standards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/12/sky-takeover-bradley-letters-reveal-concerns-over-fox-standards","fields":{"headline":"Sky takeover: Bradley letters reveal concerns over Fox standards","bodyText":"The publication of letters between Karen Bradley and the media regulator show the culture secretary was determined to ask their competition counterpart to look into the Murdochs’ commitment to broadcasting standards as part of its investigation into 21st Century Fox’s £11.7bn bid to take over Sky. Bradley wrote to the Ofcom chief executive, Sharon White, on 7 August (pdf) asking her to respond to “potentially new evidence” that raised questions about its finding that Fox should not be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority on the grounds of broadcasting standards. Bradley asked Ofcom to provide further comment on Fox’s broadcasting record, the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News US, alleged lax corporate governance at 21st Century Fox, and claims by critics of the Sky takeover bid that Ofcom had not taken into account all relevant evidence relating to phone hacking. Scandal at Fox in the US Ofcom’s response on 25 August said there were “alleged behaviours [at Fox US] amounting to significant corporate failures that were very concerning”. However, Ofcom said, the issues – including Fox News publishing a discredited story that the murdered Democrat aide Seth Rich was the source of hacked party emails – “did not occur in a broadcasting standards context”. “The evidence before us of senior management efforts to rectify the situation, which included dismissal of those directly responsible, our judgment was that ... there were not concerns which may justify a reference on grounds of the broadcast standards,” Ofcom said. Corporate governance failings and the phone-hacking scandal Ofcom had said it dealt with the issue of phone hacking when it conducted a “fit and proper” test in 2012, after Murdoch’s previous attempt to take over Sky, and another one earlier this year. Bradley wrote on 7 August: “A number of representations contend that Ofcom has not considered all the evidence. Representations contend that relevant evidence emerged after [2012] including the various trials into News International staff [now News UK], the continuing civil action on claims related to phone hacking and the findings of the House of Commons committee of privileges report on the conduct of News International employees.” White responded on 25 August: “We were aware of this evidence but we did not consider it to be both new and material so as to affect our view on the broadcast standards public interest consideration.” Bradley also asked Ofcom to respond to representations that argued that Fox’s supposedly tougher new corporate governance measures had failed. Ofcom said: “We placed weight in our fit and proper decision on the revised corporate governance arrangements, which are designed to secure that allegations of misconduct come to senior management’s attention, and on the fact that James Murdoch has taken personal responsibility for their effectiveness. We [also] have evidence, which we did not have in 2012, of action being taken to investigate and address alleged wrongdoing.” Fox’s broadcasting compliance record Fox News has fallen foul of the UK code seven times in recent years, including four times last year, one of which was for a programme that featured a guest who said Birmingham was a city “where non-Muslims just simply don’t go”. Bradley’s letter asked Ofcom to respond to representations that it did not give “sufficient weight” to the failure of Fox to “have in place adequate procedures to ensure compliance with the broadcasting code”. She said some representations contended that Ofcom did not adequately take into account Fox’s approach to broadcasting in international jurisdictions – for example, the US and Australia – citing examples of “alleged biased, divisive and grossly inaccurate reporting”. Ofcom said Fox’s record of compliance with the UK broadcasting code had been “good” and that overseas broadcasts were not relevant. “Whilst we were concerned by Fox News’ lack of adequate procedures for broadcast compliance, we consider we did afford it sufficient weight in considering the question of whether there is a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards by Fox in this country,” Ofcom said. Conclusion Ofcom admitted that while it had found “non-fanciful concerns”, it stood by its original finding that none of them “justify a reference in relation to the broadcast standards public interest consideration”. A second letter from Bradley on 31 August firmly set down the idea of a lower threshold for referral than Ofcom had used in its assessment of the broadcasting standards issue. The media regulator gave Bradley the window she was looking for, saying that it “recognises that the legal threshold for referral is low [and] you may refer as secretary of state if there are any non-fanciful concerns”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14787","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T23:00:22Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,787","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14787","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14787","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,787","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/13/betting-firms-ads-asa-ladbrokes-888-skybet-casumo","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T08:32:46Z","webTitle":"Betting firms could be fined over ads 'targeting vulnerable people'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/13/betting-firms-ads-asa-ladbrokes-888-skybet-casumo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/13/betting-firms-ads-asa-ladbrokes-888-skybet-casumo","fields":{"headline":"Betting firms could be fined over ads 'targeting vulnerable people'","bodyText":"Four betting firms could face fines over adverts disguised as news articles that “targeted vulnerable people” with claims about a gambler who cleared his debts and paid for his wife’s medical treatment by playing online casino games. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints against Ladbrokes, 888, SkyBet and Casumo over adverts placed by “affiliates”, which are agencies paid to directi gamblers to online casinos and bookmakers. While the companies said they did not approve or condone the adverts, the ASA held them responsible because they stood to benefit from them. The Labour party called for “strong action” from industry regulator the Gambling Commission, which can impose financial penalties, to prevent more of the “disgusting” adverts. Details of the ads also provoked criticism of the affiliate model, revealed in the Guardian earlier this month, under which anonymous tipsters get paid a commission for sending new customers to betting firms. One of the ads, which appeared on three websites, referred to “William” who was “£130,000 in debt after having to sell the house and continue to pay out of pocket for his wife’s cancer-related medical bills their insurance wouldn’t cover”. “William took to Facebook one night in the hospital lobby to update his friends and family on his wife’s health,” it continued. “A little tired and admittedly a bit repressed, William stumbled upon an ad for Sky Vegas. “With little to no money to spend he admits he laughed and almost scrolled past it until he saw they were offering a promotion that would reward him with £10 free at the Jackpot 7 game, which at over £700,000 was too hard to pass up.” The ad, which the ASA said “targeted vulnerable people” stated that “William” had won “over 30 times his annual salary in a single spin,” adding that “his debt and financial worries came to an abrupt end”. The ASA upheld complaints against the “socially irresponsible” advert and three almost identical adverts that used the same narrative but named 888, Ladbrokes and Casumo instead. The watchdog said the adverts breached the UK non-broadcast advertising code because they suggested gambling “could provide an escape from personal problems such as depression and that it could be a solution to financial concerns”. It also ruled that the adverts gave the incorrect impression that they were genuine news articles. Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson MP, who recently called for a ban on gambling adverts on football shirts, said:“The disgraceful cynicism of these ads is breathtaking. “While these ads were produced by an affiliate, they are ultimately the responsibility of the betting companies whose products they were selling. “The Gambling Commission needs to take strong action against the beneficiaries of these disgusting ads, to make clear that nothing like this can be allowed to happen again.” The Commission has fined betting firms BGO and Lottoland over misleading adverts, including those placed by affiliates, but declined to say whether it was considering penalties for Ladbrokes, SkyBet, 888 and Casumo. The Gambling Commission said: “We expect operators to take action to ensure that they have a clear view of what their affiliates are doing on their behalf. “Where operators fail to do this, we will not hesitate to use our powers to hold them to account.” Ladbrokes said: “We take this very seriously and have been working to improve the types of advertising and marketing used by affiliates. “Nobody in Ladbrokes Coral believes that this sort of ‘fake news’ marketing has a place in the sector. “We have been reducing the number of affiliates we work with as well as clamping down hard on anyone using our name without our knowledge in a bid to curtail this sort of activity going forward.” A spokesperson for 888 said: “The company removed the advertorial as soon as it was made aware of it and has since terminated its business relationship with the affiliate marketing agency.” The spokesperson added that the company has “taken further steps to ensure this type of incident does not occur again”. Sky Vegas said it had not been aware of the advert, and had since terminated its agreement with the affiliate and ended its affiliate programme altogether. Casumo blamed an external “media buyer”. Clive Hawkswood, chief executive of online gambling trade body the Remote Gambling Association, said: “It would be wrong to tar all affiliates with the same brush but there are now too many examples of them acting in a way that is unacceptable. “Hopefully lessons will be learned, but, if not, affiliates can expect to see operators reconsidering their relationships and the real prospect of direct regulatory action.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/13/newcastles-dave-walder-embraces-philadelphia-challenge-with-spirits-high","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T13:15:39Z","webTitle":"Newcastle's Dave Walder embraces Philadelphia challenge with spirits high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/13/newcastles-dave-walder-embraces-philadelphia-challenge-with-spirits-high","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/13/newcastles-dave-walder-embraces-philadelphia-challenge-with-spirits-high","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle's Dave Walder embraces Philadelphia challenge with spirits high","bodyText":"Newcastle and Saracens are in Philadelphia, preparing to play at the Talen Energy Stadium on Saturday. The game may be more of a must-win for the Aviva Premiership than for either team, but whatever the crowd size or the American TV audience, early-season points are at stake. “We had a day to rest and recover but some of the boys were off recreating Rocky, running up the steps,” said Dave Walder, the Falcons’ new head coach. Some Saracens also ran to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, up the stone slope made famous by Sylvester Stallone. As they did, Walder was plotting to bring them down. “We’ve hit the ground running and that gives everyone a bit of confidence,” Walder, 39, said of wins over Worcester and Sale. Sarries are double European champions but in US sports speak they are one and one for the year. “I say we stand a chance to win. They’ve probably had a disrupted pre-season, with so many of their players involved with the Lions and other internationals. You know it will be be very tough against Saracens every time, but we really look forward to this.” Not so long ago, no Newcastle coach could have said that with confidence. There have been a few of them since Walder, who won four England caps, wore the Falcons fly-half shirt. While he was playing for Wasps and in Japan, then learning to coach with RGS Newcastle, Percy Park and more, the Falcons changed ownership, were relegated, appointed Dean Richards director of rugby and began at last to rebuild. Walder came in to look after the kicking, then took over the backs. The team finished eighth last season and the back rower Mark Wilson went to tour Argentina. That was a plus for the region after a spell in which, another paper pointed out, more England players came from Germany than the north-east of England. Walder says one key to such improvement is “consistency in the coaches. John Wells has been a constant” – the ex-England forwards coach switched from head coach to defence on Walder’s promotion last month – “and we’ve got Micky Ward who I played with, as forwards coach. He’s a local legend and a good friend.” In the age of globalism, everything is local. That may be just as well. Newcastle are playing a home game in Philly and chances to see Independence Hall and sample a famous cheese steak aside, the switch has not been popular with all their fans. This summer, a remark by the Saracens chief executive, Heath Harvey, gave flesh to suggestions that clubs with more political and financial muscle are more able to resist such a move. Sarries were the away team against London Irish in New Jersey in 2016. Should Premier Rugby ever make his club the home team, Harvey said, they would “take it on the chin”. Newcastle’s balance sheet is not Walder’s chief concern. In the city of Rocky, he’s working out how to land blows on Saracens’ jaw. His squad have local heroes in every sense of the word. In the second row there is Nick Civetta from New York state, not far from Philly and thus of interest to NBC. In the back row there is Wilson – actually from Cumbria but in Walder’s joking words, “my fourth-favourite Geordie after Gazza, Peter Beardsley and Will Welch”. Welch, a flanker born in Newcastle, has been club captain since he was 22. “Both of them have been absolutely outstanding,” Walder said. “If Will had got the nod too for Argentina, anyone who was surprised wouldn’t have been to Newcastle in my three years here. He’s been a brilliant leader. I think it’s great that we’re finally going to get better recognition.” As, it seems, will Walder. Newcastle-born, educated at Durham University, he has wandered the rugby world. Now he’s home. “There were deep-rooted issues at the club when I left,” he said, “financially and in terms of whether the players were happy. It took Dean maybe two or three years to turn things round and last year for the first time we were able to recruit well, from being in mid-table at Christmas. “Players want to go to a club either to win or to earn money. I think the game’s gone a bit mad with the money, to be honest. Some of the figures out there are amazing. We’re more after the right type of player to fit in.” They think they have found them. A standout in the backs is the full-back Simon Hammersley, who also went to Durham. On Saturday afternoons in the late 1990s Walder learned his game there. The hard way. “I remember the first time I played Horden away,” Walder says, of a proud club from a pit village long minus its pit. “My opposite number had a fend but it was just a left hook. I was stunned. And then afterwards, he bought me a beer in the bar.” In a region with a healthy club rugby scene, Newcastle are forging strong links. There are community coaching programmes and the hooker Scott Lawson and the flanker Ally Hogg are in charge at Tynedale and Blaydon. Such commitment pays: Falcons’ crowds are up. It’s a long way from pitched battles at Horden, Westoe and Billingham to the pitch at St James’ Park, home to Walder’s beloved Newcastle United and, tantalisingly, the final of next season’s European Rugby Champions Cup. It’s a longer way still to Philadelphia, where the European champions await. “I want to be successful for Newcastle,” Walder says. “There’s a real bond to the place if you’re from there. I’m proud to represent it in America.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/13/los-angeles-olympics-2028-policing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"LA is about to discover that democracy and the Olympics don’t mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/13/los-angeles-olympics-2028-policing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/13/los-angeles-olympics-2028-policing","fields":{"headline":"LA is about to discover that democracy and the Olympics don’t mix","bodyText":"On Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee will rubberstamp the plan to hand Paris the 2024 Summer Games while Los Angeles will host in 2028. Given the lack of bids from democratic countries and the increasingly frequent torpedoing of bids by activists and referenda, Olympic boosters are surely thrilled to lock down Paris and LA, two cities in democracies with storied Olympic histories. After all, the IOC has received negative attention – and rightfully so – for bestowing the Games on authoritarian regimes. Olympic honchos even handed Beijing its second Games – it will host the Winter Olympics in 2022 after staging the Summer Games in 2008 – despite the fact that China is a serial human-rights abuser. As Sophie Richardson, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said: “The reality is that the Chinese government’s hosting of the Games has been a catalyst for abuses.” No matter to the IOC, despite its own charter’s celebration of human dignity and non-discrimination – apparently, the Games must go on. But a key point often lost in the criticism of the IOC’s tolerance of tyranny is that by hosting the Olympics, democracies become more authoritarian. Staging the Olympics in places like Beijing and Sochi clearly does not help the cause of democracy and human rights, but neither does hosting the Games in Los Angeles, Vancouver or London. We are already seeing this democracy deficit in Los Angeles where the city council rammed its Olympic endorsement through a process that largely boxed out public participation. During the city council meeting that approved the 2028 Games, anti-Olympics activists were not allowed to make public statements. City council president Herb Wesson contended that “public comment on this item has been satisfied” as boos from activists rung through the room. Yet a cavalcade of Olympic athletes, including swimmer Janet Evans and track star Carl Lewis, were trotted out and allowed to speak at length. At one point Lewis said “this isn’t just about the Olympics Games. This isn’t about sports.” He alluded to social problems in LA and added, “Why can’t we use the 2028 Olympics to solve it all?” Unfortunately, such exaggeration only amplifies already unrealistic expectations. Like a greyhound fixated on a rabbit, city council officials pressed their case, becoming openly irritated when concerned citizens packing the chamber guffawed or hissed. At one point city councilman Joe Buscaino lost his cool: “I’m tired of these people coming to us and questioning our decision making.” An anti-Olympics activist shouted in response, “It’s called democracy.” Buscaino then sputtered out a mash-up of Olympic pabulum: “What these games will do is create jobs and weed out poverty and put Los Angeles on the map.” Hold on. Is “weed out poverty” some sort of sloppy code for ramping up gentrification? And the Games will “put Los Angeles on the map”? LA is already a city known around the world. The Olympics can also make host cities more authoritarian by affording an excuse to militarize and bolster their police forces. Angelenos should be familiar with the process. In 1978, the IOC handed the city the 1984 Summer Olympics. Earlier that same year Daryl Gates was named police chief. He not only helped author epic-fail acronymic humdingers like CRASH (Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums) and DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), but also pioneered “Olympic Gang Sweeps” ahead of the Games. Gates deployed Special Weapons and Tactics units trained in paramilitary methods as a one-size-fits-all force to carry out drug busts, crack down on gangs, and intimidate dissent before and during the 1984 Olympics The result was bracing. Days ahead of the Games’ opening ceremony the New York Times reported “if there is a distinctive sound so far to the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, it is the chop-chop noise of helicopter rotor blades whirling in the warm southern California air.” One Japanese journalist said of LA under Gates: “It’s almost like a military base.” If 1984 was successful, for many Los Angeles residents it was a terrifying brush with success. Gates’s theory of militarized policing is a legacy of the 1984 Games, a prominent element of all subsequent five-ring festivals. Just ask residents of Vancouver, host of the 2010 Winter Games. Authorities formed the Vancouver Integrated Security Unit – made up of more than 20 policing agencies – to patrol the Olympic zone. Military helicopters and CF-18 Hornet fighter jets monitored from above. London 2012 security officials riffed from the same script, even purchasing a Long Range Acoustic Device, a military-grade weapon used in Afghanistan and Iraq. Surface-to-air missiles were ratcheted to the roofs of apartment complexes. Aerial drones and elite police units buzzed about. Thousands of military personnel flooded the streets of London, giving the event an overtly camouflage sheen. Let’s be clear: much of the equipment purchased for Vancouver and London was not boxed up and returned to sender. For example, the security cameras installed for the Vancouver Games stayed up afterwards, blending into the already existing architecture of surveillance and policing. For Los Angeles, the bottom line is that the Olympics promise to intensify the militarization of policing in the city and that communities of color and marginalized groups will bear the ferocity of this uptick. The Los Angeles 1984 Games, with its $225m surplus, have bottle-fed the legend that the Games can be a fiscal success. Today, even some Olympics critics are saying that the LA 2028 bid carries little financial risk for the city. But focusing on finances deflects attention from the authoritarian tendencies the Games help install. Behind the shimmering scrim of podium platitudes lurks a harrowing history. The authoritarian downsides have become an ingrained feature of the Games, not merely a bug. Forget the five-ring hype: the truth is that democracy and the Olympics really don’t mix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/12/murdochs-21st-century-fox-sky-competition-markets-authority-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T20:00:31Z","webTitle":"Murdochs' Sky bid isn't the slam dunk it looked a month ago | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/12/murdochs-21st-century-fox-sky-competition-markets-authority-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/12/murdochs-21st-century-fox-sky-competition-markets-authority-investigation","fields":{"headline":"Murdochs' Sky bid isn't the slam dunk it looked a month ago","bodyText":"The Murdochs, as the Labour MP Tom Watson gleefully noted, will be furious. In a one-dimensional fight at the Competition and Markets Authority over media plurality, the Murdoch clan would start as heavy favourites to get 21st Century Fox’s bid for full control of Sky over the line. That is because the BBC and ITN, on most measures of audience reach, would still be bigger. An additional referral on grounds of broadcasting standards – which is what the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, now proposes – is a very different matter. The CMA wonks will be wading into unfamiliar waters. They will have to pull apart boardroom culture at Fox and consider the scope for the “Foxification” of Sky News – meaning the danger that the channel is turned into one that pumps out partisan drivel. It’s hard to know which way the technocrats will jump when their usual spreadsheets offer no help. The plot has taken an unexpected turn. The stock market, making instant odds on the chances of the takeover ultimately happening, marked Sky’s shares down, but by only 1.6% at the close of trading. How to read a share price of 937p? Well, it’s 13% below Fox’s proposed takeover price of £10.75, which is a significant gap. But one doesn’t know at what price a standalone Sky’s shares would trade – they were 760p before the Murdochs made their move but revenue and profits have barely missed a beat since then. At a rough guess, the market is saying there is a 70% chance of the deal completing, not quite the slam dunk it looked a month ago. For Sky – and for the Murdochs – there are complications beyond the mere fact of a wider CMA inquiry. The time the process is taking will also infuriate them. Full CMA probes usually take six months minimum, and a study of corporate governance standards at Fox doesn’t sound like a quick job. In the new year, Sky’s board must decide how aggressive it wants to be in the next round of bidding for Premier League rights. That commercial puzzle may be trickier now. One popular theory in TV land holds that the Murdochs want the football at almost any price but Sky executives, mindful of other shareholders’ worries, are less gung-ho. If that’s true, who do the executives think they’re working for? There’s also the small matter of the £200m that Fox must pay Sky if the takeover doesn’t happen by 15 August 2018. That date seemed an age away when the takeover proposal was made in December 2016 – less so now. Ed Miliband, chief lobbyist in getting Bradley to rethink the terms of her referral and reject Ofcom’s advice, has played a blinder. He still may not succeed in getting the deal blocked, but there is now genuine uncertainty in the air. City behind the game on rate rise? Inflation has forced the government to lift the 1% annual cap on public sector pay from next year. That is a significant political event which makes one wonder if the City, which has breezily ignored warnings from various Bank of England policymakers about the need to raise interest rates soonish, is behind the game. Certainly there was a moment of self-doubt in the currency market as the consumer price index recorded 2.9% for August. The figure was only a tick or two above expectations but sterling hit a 12-month high against the dollar. It is, obviously, silly to read much into a single month’s data. Even a few months’ readings don’t offer easy lessons. The CPI was 2.9% in May, 2.6% in June, 2.6% again in July and has now returned to 2.9%. Is that evidence of the stickiness of inflation? Or does it merely suggest that the effects of the post-referendum fall in sterling are taking time to wash through the system, especially in areas like clothing and footwear? Hard to say. For the time being, only votes at the Bank’s monetary policy committee matter. Andy Haldane, its chief economist, is the main floating voter, given his recent remarks. If he switches sides and votes for an increase on Thursday, and if everyone else follows form, the majority for doing nothing would fall from 7-2 to 6-3. In itself, that wouldn’t alarm investors. But a 3%-plus CPI figure next month – not impossible – would shake things up. The comforting idea that inflation will slowly fall as autumn arrives, and that a rate rise is a year away, is not nailed down yet. SuperGroup’s new bonus scheme At last, some original thinking on bonuses. Julian Dunkerton and James Holder, co-founders of SuperGroup, the Superdry folk, are launching a share-based scheme that applies to all staff. It won’t win any awards for closing the pay gap, it should be said. On the illustrative example, store staff would collect up to £2,000 after three years, store managers £28,000 and senior executives £300,000. Still, Dunkerton and Holder are funding the scheme out of their own projected gains if SuperGroup’s share price improves and it won’t cost other shareholders a penny. That is to their credit. One of these day, let’s hope, a company will copy John Lewis’s practice of awarding annual bonuses to all staff as a percentage of salary. That approach seems simple, fair, and seems to work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/14/tamal-ray-saffron-recipe-chicken-kebab-stuffed-baby-aubergines","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T05:00:33Z","webTitle":"Tamal Ray’s saffron recipes: chicken kebabs and stuffed baby aubergines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/14/tamal-ray-saffron-recipe-chicken-kebab-stuffed-baby-aubergines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/14/tamal-ray-saffron-recipe-chicken-kebab-stuffed-baby-aubergines","fields":{"headline":"Tamal Ray’s saffron recipes: chicken kebabs and stuffed baby aubergines","bodyText":"Browsing the spice section of your local supermarket, with its row upon row of pristine glass jars, it can be hard to imagine a time when spices were so precious that wars were fought for them. In this age of maximised yields and corporate super-farms, there is perhaps one spice, above all others, that retains some of its ancient mystique: saffron. Today, saffron remains by far the most expensive spice in the world, trading at thousands of dollars a kilo. The high price is a reflection of the painstaking and labour-intensive process of cultivation, which has changed little in centuries. The fragile thread-like stigmas emerging from the flowers of the saffron crocus are carefully plucked by hand and then dried to produce the familiar reddish strands. The flavour is hard to describe. Beneath the sweet hints that belie its floral origin is a richness and depth that endows saffron with endless versatility in the kitchen. Though many associate it with sugary foods such as cakes and traditional Indian sweets, it’s also ubiquitous in Persian cuisine, providing the base flavour for many stews. It is from the Middle East that I have taken inspiration for this month’s recipes, each showcasing saffron’s versatility in a different way. It’s the dominant flavour of a quick and simple chicken kebab, but also merges well as one of the many flavours in my stuffed baby aubergines. Saffron chicken kebabs with brown onions (Makes four skewers) This Persian-inspired recipe is quick and easy and would go well as part of a mixed-meze meal. Wrapped up in a tortilla, however, it makes one of my favourite lunchtime sandwiches. For the marinade 2 pinches saffron strands 2 tbsp milk 1 tsp ground cinnamon 3 green cardamom pods, finely ground ¼ - ½ tsp cayenne pepper 6 heaped tablespoons Greek yoghurt 2 cloves crushed garlic ½ teaspoon salt 8 boned chicken thighs 1 large Spanish white onion vegetable oil 4 tortilla wraps – optional Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Prepare the marinade by grinding the saffron to a fine powder and adding to the milk in a small bowl. Allow to sit for a couple of minutes then mix in with the other spices, yoghurt, crushed garlic and salt. Chop up the thighs into large chunks of about 4cm x 4cm. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring the chicken is well coated. Then place the chicken in a covered bowl in the fridge to marinade for 2 to 4 hours. Meanwhile, finely slice the onion and add to a roasting tray. Drizzle with enough oil to coat the onions and roast in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the onions are softened and have started to brown and caramelise at the edges. Thread the meat on to skewers and cook under a hot grill, turning the chicken to ensure it cooks evenly all the way through. Rewarm the onions and serve with the chicken and a bread of your choice. Stuffed baby aubergines (Makes four baby stuffed aubergines, enough for dinner for two) This has that strange property of improving with a day’s ageing. Baby aubergines can be found in Asian food shops, while intensely tangy barberries are readily available in Middle Eastern stores. You can substitute with regular aubergines by halving them lengthways and removing some of the inner flesh for the stuffing. You can substitute dried cranberries or currants for the barberries, but halve the quantity of sugar when cooking. 100g walnuts 6 baby aubergines (apple-sized) 1 pinch saffron strands 60g bulgar wheat 2 tangerines 4tsp sugar 20g dried barberries or dried cranberries 1 medium handful flat-leaf parsley (about 15g) 1 medium handful flat-leaf mint (15g) 2 tbsp tomato puree 80g feta cheese A few tablespoons of olive oil Salt Place the walnuts on a roasting tray and toast in the oven for 7 minutes at 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, finely dice 2 of the baby aubergines and add them to a frying pan with a little oil. Fry on a medium heat for about 10 minutes until softened. Grind the saffron to a powder with a pestle and mortar. Then add to a bowl with the bulgar wheat, ¼ teaspoon salt and 75ml boiling water. Cover and set aside for 10 minutes until all the water has been absorbed. Add the zest and juice of the tangerines together with the sugar in a small pan and reduce down until the liquid has halved. Stir in the dried berries and cook until the liquid has further reduced to become thick and syrupy. Prepare the remaining aubergines by slicing through from the base, stopping just short of the stem. Turn the aubergine and make a second cut, again from the base to just short of the stem. This will give a quartered aubergine, held together at the stem. Rub over the outer and inner surfaces with a little olive oil and salt. Mix together the stuffing by stirring together the bulgar wheat, tomato puree, berry-syrup mix, finely chopped herbs and chopped walnuts with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add further salt to taste if needed. Finally, crumble in the Feta. Divide the stuffing between each of the 4 aubergines, then bake uncovered for 15 minutes at 180C. Cover with foil and bake for a further 20 minutes until the aubergines are softened."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/14/john-mclaughlin-and-the-4th-dimension-live-ronnies-review-heavy-hitting-and-formidable","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T18:00:11Z","webTitle":"John McLaughlin and the 4th Dimension: Live @ Ronnie's review – heavy-hitting and formidable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/14/john-mclaughlin-and-the-4th-dimension-live-ronnies-review-heavy-hitting-and-formidable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/14/john-mclaughlin-and-the-4th-dimension-live-ronnies-review-heavy-hitting-and-formidable","fields":{"headline":"John McLaughlin and the 4th Dimension: Live @ Ronnie's review – heavy-hitting and formidable","bodyText":"Earlier this year, on a two-night stand at Ronnie Scott’s, the 75-year-old guitar giant John McLaughlin (Jeff Beck, Pat Metheny and Chick Corea are among his famous fans, but he has also been a key pioneer of Asian-western fusions) spliced new material from his 4th Dimension quartet’s 2015 Black Light album with reworkings of his classic 70s jazz-fusion themes .

Hawa Diabaté’s emotional, soulful voice provides a reminder of her legendary father Kassé Mady Diabaté. She is backed on those ancient instruments, the xylophone-like balafon and bass n’goni lute, by Fodé Lassana Diabaté and Mamadou Kouyaté. Then the Quartet join in, at first with respectful playing and then with exuberant, thrilling flourishes that transform the ancient griot song Lila Bambo.

The flower arrangement, decorating a well in Chesterfield’s market place to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Diana’s death, was mocked online after the Derbyshire town’s council published pictures on Facebook. Gayla Tuckley said: “I saw it and thought what an insult to Dianna [sic] ... luckily she had a sense of humour and would probably be laughing.” Stephen Jones posted: “Seriously!! ... I hope this was done by a local primary school?” Roger Fearn wrote: “Our shops our closing, our Market stalls are empty, we have homeless people in our bus station, our football team is crap and now this.” Other comments were less kind. But Chesterfield council hit back, with a spokesperson telling the Derbyshire Times: “All art is meant to be a talking point and that certainly seems to be the case with this year’s design. “The well dressing is designed to attract visitors to the area and if the publicity encourages more people to come and visit the market and local shops then that can only be good for Chesterfield. “The well dressing is produced by 14 volunteers using the ancient Derbyshire art of well dressing, which involves creating designs from flower petals and other natural materials.” Despite the overwhelmingly negative reaction to the arrangement, it did find some fans on social media."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/17/yellow-nail-varnish-for-the-brightest-hands","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"Yellow nail varnish for the brightest hands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/17/yellow-nail-varnish-for-the-brightest-hands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/17/yellow-nail-varnish-for-the-brightest-hands","fields":{"headline":"Yellow nail varnish for the brightest hands","bodyText":"This is not a yolk.

Slit trenches are being dug in Green Park and at home children are fitted with gas masks. Hitler is determined to invade Czechoslovakia in his scheme to reclaim lost German territory. Chamberlain is equally determined to prevent another war. Europe holds its breath as a last chance for peace goes up for grabs at a conference in Munich. As history this feels so well known as to defy a further rehearsal. Chamberlain’s piece of paper has become as pathetic in its way as Desdemona’s handkerchief: a white flag in the face of oncoming tragedy. As fiction, though, we’re just getting started. Amid this febrile atmosphere Robert Harris has parachuted one of his trusty old-school protagonists through the interstices of historical events, sticking tight to the record but suggesting how things might have turned out differently. Hugh Legat, late of the Foreign Office, now a private secretary to the PM, is privy to the “real truth” about Britain’s home air defence. The RAF has only 20 fighter planes “with working guns” to defend the entire country, so a war would be not only morally repugnant but strategically disastrous. Legat, a brilliant Balliol scholar, is also an upright, downright, forthright stiff, perhaps deliberately: Harris doesn’t want a “colourful” lead stealing any of the narrative’s thunder. Meanwhile, in Berlin, a high-born diplomat named Paul Hartmann has joined a group of conspirators plotting against Hitler. Hartmann has got hold of a document outlining Germany’s expansionist ambitions, including their intention to launch a surprise attack and “smash” the Czechs. If the plotters can somehow convey this dynamite to a sympathetic ear in Whitehall it might provoke the British government to take action, and stop “the madman” in his tracks. The first hundred or so pages of Munich are full of tight little huddles, grave-faced men darting in and out of offices. At times the documentarist in Harris seems to be rather crowding out the novelist, hugging the shore of verifiable fact instead of boldly striking out on the choppier waters of fiction. I’m not sure, for instance, of our need to know that the Führer’s train south to Munich went “at an average speed of 55 kilometres per hour”. But then a couple of pages later Hartmann, aboard the train as an assistant translator, visits the toilet and notes the tiny steel swastikas adorning the taps – the vigilant novelist has reasserted himself. “No escaping the Führer’s aesthetic, thought Hartmann, even when one took a shit.” After the pianissimo first section the book turns up the volume as the dual plotlines converge: Hartmann, who was a friend of Legat’s at Balliol, is relieved to discover that the Englishman is also on his way to Munich, aboard the PM’s plane. Both men must operate under a lowering cloud of suspicion as they inch closer to the respective centres of power, revealed to us in telling pen portraits. Chamberlain, nearing 70, a Victorian throw-back in stiff wing-collars, constantly surprises his staff with his energy and his “ostentatiously modest” way with the spotlight. Hitler, impatient and dour, presents a more enigmatic figure: how did this unexceptional man (“it was almost compelling how nondescript he was”, thinks Legat) bewitch a mighty nation into surrender? And just for good measure Harris throws in this sulphurous firecracker: he has the body odour of “a workman who had not bathed or changed his shirt in a week”. On top of everything else, Hitler stank. As the negotiations grind on the scene is enlivened with touching squiggles of detail, such as the crowd outside the British delegation’s hotel striking up with “The Lambeth Walk” to make the visitors feel at home. Munich itself comes to life in the poignant contrast between the gracious city of botanical gardens Hartmann once loved and the new brutalist parade-ground spiked with gigantic flagpoles and swastika banners. During a midnight flit outside Munich he gives Legat a terrible glimpse of where Nazi Germany is heading, and both men come to a private reckoning of their failure to make a mark. A tense encounter in Hitler’s apartment is the book’s thwarted climax. A tantalising addition to the inexhaustible game of “what if?”, Munich is one of Robert Harris’s more contained performances, less daring than Fatherland, not as compulsive as Pompeii, his best novel. The story of a crisis averted is, perforce, something of a pulled punch. But it makes for an ominous foreshadowing of the main event. “Our enemies are small worms,” the Fuhrer would tell his generals in August 1939. “I saw them in Munich.” • Anthony Quinn’s latest novel is Eureka (Cape).

Salvatore Caputa, a self-proclaimed sayer and former policeman from Sicily, drew pilgrims from Germany, Austria and Italy, some on crutches and in wheelchairs. Observers reported that at 4.30pm on the dot, he fell to his knees as a strong smell of rose scent wafted through the air. He then entered the chapel. While the Catholic church does not recognise Caputa, who has been claiming to have seen visitations by Mary since 1986 and to have had conversations with her, the archdiocese of Munich took the events seriously enough to send an observer to report back to church leaders. Manyin attendance copied Caputa as he held a rosary in an outstretched hand, while others held up mobile phones and filmed the spectacle.Pilgrims said they had “felt a presence”. Anna Maria Schwarz, 75, who prayed at the chapel, told German media: “Salvatore has the grace of God, he has been chosen by the Mother of God.” She described smelling the perfume, saying the smell was only reserved for those “in a state of grace”. She added: “You feel a vibration and you know the mother of God is there.” Returning from the chapel about half an hour later with a page full of writing, Caputa said: “Mary wants you to pray to her. She is greatly troubled.” He urged those present to “bring peace into your hearts” and added that she had pronounced her love for Austria and Germany, and would return on 19 March at 4.30pm. Otto Masszi, the owner of the private chapel and an environmentalist in Munich’s administrative district office, said it was a “fantastic message” to hear that the Virgin Mary was to return. “That tells me that (until then) nothing will happen to our beautiful world. No asteroid will destroy the earth, there’ll be no world war three, no epidemic,” he said. The mayor, Lorenz Kronberger, was focused more on practical than pastoral details, saying he had struggled to deal with issues such as parking and road safety amid the influx of so many visitors. “My main concern is the traffic management rather than that the Mother of God will appear in the flesh,” he said. Some pilgrims gathered water from the village well, which Caputa said had been blessed by Mary, filling up bottles and jerry cans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/13/borussia-dortmund-young-talents-ousmane-dembele-tottenham-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"Borussia Dortmund: a club whose plan is working almost too well","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/13/borussia-dortmund-young-talents-ousmane-dembele-tottenham-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/13/borussia-dortmund-young-talents-ousmane-dembele-tottenham-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Borussia Dortmund: a club whose plan is working almost too well","bodyText":"The news was good yet the atmosphere seemed somewhat subdued. The Borussia Dortmund CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke, was delivering an update on the club’s financial situation – record turnover of €400m (£364m) for 2016-17 and an astonishing profit of €134m since 2011 – but no one appeared to be that interested. There was only one story in town and that whether Ousmane Dembélé was going to join Barcelona. In the end the 20-year-old Frenchman joined the Catalan club for £96.7m and while that will make Dortmund’s figures even prettier next year it has severely diminished the club’s chances of challenging at home and in Europe, where they kick off their Champions League campaign against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley on Wednesday. In fact, the whole saga has completely overshadowed an already turbulent summer and it is only now that the new manager, Peter Bosz, knows what kind of a squad he has at his disposal. That is not unusual in itself, with clubs all over Europe recalibrating after the last days of the transfer window, but few clubs will have lost a bigger talent than Dortmund. Add to that the tension that surrounded Thomas Tuchel’s last few months at the club and the terrible attack on the team bus in April that shocked the whole club and left the defender Marc Bartra out injured for a month and it is clear that it has been a hugely testing year for everyone. The main problem with the Dembélé move was not that he joined Barcelona – it was anticipated he would leave at some point – but that he had been at the club for only a year. Apart from that, he had been the perfect Dortmund signing: a young, talented player who had been given a chance in the first team, excelled and seen his value increase beyond all dreams. It is what Dortmund do best and to give them their credit, they had worked incredibly hard to sign Dembélé. They had been in contact with him for a long period, telling him how much they rated him and that he would get his chance in the starting XI immediately. “Dortmund showed their interest in me from a very early stage,” he said when he joined, “and were in close contact with me throughout – and that behaviour really impressed me. I knew that they would look after me.” The Dembélé signing in May 2016 was only one of several triumphs for the club in the transfer market. Over the past few years they have established themselves as the No1 club for young players to be nurtured. This season Bosz has no fewer than 10 players aged 23 or younger in his first-team squad. When the Swedish wonderkid Alexander Isak was leaving AIK in January 2017 he chose Dortmund ahead of Real Madrid. The 17-year-old Jadon Sancho left Manchester City for the Bundesliga club during the summer while Dan-Axel Zagadou, an 18-year-old French defender, felt similarly out of the first-team picture at Paris St-Germain and he too opted for Dortmund. All three must have been encouraged by the chances given to Dembélé and Christian Pulisic, the young American forward who has played 41 times in the league for Dortmund despite being only 18. Zagadou has already played three times for the first team. Dig further and there is an array of talent at the club’s youth teams as well, with Janni Serra, Dzenis Burnic, Jan-Niklas Beste and Manuel Pherai, whose adviser is none other than Mino Raiola, among the players the club have high hopes for. As for the here and now, Dortmund have started their league season with two wins and a draw. They travel to London in good spirits but with a mounting injury crisis. The club captain, Marcel Schmelzer, has been ruled out for several weeks with an ankle problem and Bartra is a doubt with a thigh injury, also suffered in the 0-0 draw against Freiburg on Saturday. Add to that the long-term absentees Marco Reus, Raphaël Guerreiro and André Schürrle and the fact that the club’s best midfielder, Julian Weigl, is just returning from a lengthy time on the sidelines and the challenge facing Bosz is pretty clear. So far the former Ajax manager has given Pulisic the chance to replace Dembélé to the right in a front three and he has responded superbly. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang still leads the line despite interest from Milan this summer with Maximilian Philipp, a £17.5m signing from Freiburg, on the left, although another summer arrival, the Ukrainian Andriy Yarmolenko, could start at Wembley. Either way, this season should really be one of transition considering the loss of Dembélé and the fact that a new manager is in place. Dortmund, however, have surprised before and try telling the ultra-competitive Bosz that they will not challenge this season. But no matter how they end up doing, the future is bright for Dortmund and they are an example to many a club. They have a long history of giving young players a chance and they will continue to do that. As Lars Ricken, the 1997 Champions League winner who is the head of youth development at the club, recently said: “Promoting players from our own youth teams, such as Pulisic, Felix Passlack, Schmelzer, Götze, Reus or Nuri Sahin, who have now reached almost legend status, is for Borussia Dortmund’s identity extremely important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/bike-blog/2017/sep/16/nine-of-the-best-bikes-for-all-budgets","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"Nine of the best bikes for all budgets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/sep/16/nine-of-the-best-bikes-for-all-budgets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/sep/16/nine-of-the-best-bikes-for-all-budgets","fields":{"headline":"Nine of the best bikes for all budgets","bodyText":"Commuter 6KU Detroit, £325 If your commute is relatively flat, a single speed bike has lots of advantages: less weight, simpler to maintain and cheaper.

The United Democrats movement took 11 out of 12 council seats in the Tverskaya district, a wealthy neighbourhood adjacent to the Kremlin. It also secured all 12 seats in the Gagarinsky district, where Putin cast his vote on Sunday. The opposition likewise upset the odds to triumph in a dozen other districts, the vast majority of them in the heart of the Russian capital. “We took the centre!” Maxim Katz, the opposition’s campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. The opposition coalition’s breakthrough campaign was masterminded by the former MP Dmitry Gudkov and the Yabloko and Parnas opposition parties. Among the coalition’s advisers was Vitali Shkliarov, a 41-year-old Soviet-born political consultant who worked on Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign last year. Shkliarov, who headed the US senator’s mobilisation efforts in Nevada, helped the opposition coalition register almost 1,000 candidates for Sunday’s district council elections. “This is a new era for Russian politics,” said Shkliarov on Monday. “Everyone is so shocked. It’s so symbolic that the opposition now controls the district where Putin is registered to vote.” The vote represents a rare electoral success for Russia’s liberal opposition, whose candidates are often barred from standing for public office. This time round, however, the Kremlin decided to relax its grip on election registration procedures, in an attempt to hold what Moscow city officials hailed as “the most honest elections ever”. Yekaterina Schulmann, a prominent political analyst, said the liberal opposition had achieved a symbolic and political victory by infiltrating the Kremlin’s electoral machine. Among the victorious candidates was Ilya Yashin, a former ally of Boris Nemtsov, the opposition leader who was gunned down in Moscow in 2015. “There is a new sheriff in town,” Yashin said after taking first place in the vote in central Moscow’s Krasnoselsky district. Although local councillors have little political power, their support is vital for anyone who wants to stand in mayoral elections in Moscow. The election of almost 200 United Democrats councillors will make it much easier for the opposition to challenge Sergei Sobyanin, the Kremlin-backed mayor of Moscow, at next year’s elections. Sobyanin has angered many Muscovites by ordering seemingly endless roadworks and renovations across the city, which critics say are aimed purely at enriching government officials and Kremlin-linked property developers. Although the electoral victories in central Moscow were greeted with euphoria by opposition supporters, United Russia still managed to secure about 75% of district council seats across the city. Allegations of vote fraud in favour of Putin’s party were widespread, however. Golos, an independent election monitoring group, registered about 600 complaints. Video footage was also posted online of a district official in western Moscow apparently instructing polling station staff on how to falsify the vote count. Turnout at Sunday’s elections was low, at about 15% – half the turnout at last year’s parliamentary polls. In other votes across Russia on Sunday, United Russia won every seat in 16 polls for regional governors. Opposition-friendly candidates, including Yevgeny Roizman, the popular mayor of Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-biggest city, were kept off the ballot in most regions by election officials loyal to the Kremlin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/11/escape-hurricane-irma-not-option-caribbean-islands-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T13:18:54Z","webTitle":"Escape from hurricane Irma was not an option for most of us in the Caribbean | Gabrielle Thongs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/escape-hurricane-irma-not-option-caribbean-islands-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/escape-hurricane-irma-not-option-caribbean-islands-poverty","fields":{"headline":"Escape from Hurricane Irma was not an option for most of us in the Caribbean","bodyText":"The winds and rain came first, usual for this time of year. Crops drown in the sodden earth, the price of vegetables and fruits in the market rises and, as the rain and wind beat down on the tin roofs and wooden frames of many of our homes, communities bear down for more. Torrential storms, gushing flood waters and devastated infrastructure come next, and lives are lost in their wake. Evacuation is not an option for most citizens of the Caribbean. Instead of escape, survival is a matter of endurance. What were predictable changes to the wet or dry months in the Caribbean are now increasingly irregular weather patterns, bringing serious weather events that demand more resources and attention to mitigate escalating damage, including loss of life. There is widespread agreement in the region, based on meteorological data as well as lived experience, that Caribbean seasons, noteworthy for shifts in temperature and precipitation, are changing. As residents in the region, sometimes we wonder if “change” is a powerful enough word to represent the realities of rising seas and battering rains, coastal erosion and habitat loss, new agricultural stresses and higher food import bills, as well as the loss of human life. Despite broad consensus, we must be clear that climate change is not the only villain. Regional underdevelopment and global economic polarisation exacerbate the effects of disasters. The colossal convergence of clouds formed by the churning of warm waters in the Atlantic basin has generated three fully formed hurricanes since tropical storm Harvey passed through the eastern Caribbean in mid-August: hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia. The Atlantic basin has not seen activity of this nature since 2010 when category three hurricanes Igor and Karl joined category four Julia to bring disastrous impacts to Caribbean islands. None of these previous hurricanes, however, were nearly as devastating as Irma’s category five assault, which has resulted in 28 confirmed deaths across the Caribbean so far – and thousands will be displaced. Those whose lives have been washed away, leaving them without shelter, include street dwellers, homeless people, squatters and others living precariously in rural, hillside, and coastal areas, which are prone to landslides, collapse and flooding. Also vulnerable are elderly people, children and people who are mobility-impaired or sick and may more quickly succumb to the health effects of mould, poor nutrition and lack of clean drinking water, exacerbated by constraints in accessing medical help. In addition to flood losses in residential, agricultural, and commercial areas, winds destabilise transport and communication infrastructure, while storm surges dismantle much needed economic, social, and environmental assets on coastlines. Disasters, as we know them, are a function of magnitude, exposure, and vulnerability. On its own, Irma has characteristics that could make it one of the Caribbean’s most damaging hurricanes on record, due in part to the low levels of economic development that hamper the region’s ability to cope with natural hazards. Irma’s path of destruction has affected more than 10 Caribbean countries, a significantly higher number of islands than those affected by hurricanes Igor, Julia, and Karl combined. While Igor, Julia, and Karl directly affected islands including Bermuda and Cape Verde, Irma made landfall on Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the US Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, St Kitts, Nevis, and Guadeloupe among others. Bermuda and Cape Verde have substantially higher GDPs and GDP per capita than Barbuda and Anguilla, which strongly correlate to higher resilience and much better coping mechanisms. For example, in Barbuda Irma destroyed more than 90% of the housing stock and telecommunications infrastructure; large and extended families, including one group of seven, were reliant on rooftop rescues by emergency responders. Similar incidents have been reported from Anguilla and other islands. By comparison, although serious damage was reported in Bermuda and Cape Verde, nothing nearly as devastating as this occurred. These two islands can expect to return to normal life much more quickly than the islands with fewer economic resources. Clearly, the impacts of such storms and the course of the subsequent recovery are determined by a country’s preparedness and capacity to respond. At both the national and community levels, development provides protective armour. As we look to the future, we must heed the lessons taught by these hurricanes. While it is not possible to modify the hazard of a hurricane such as Irma in itself, there are ways to reduce the disastrous effects, and increase coping capacities and resilience of those affected. With dwindling funding for disaster risk reduction in the Caribbean, there is a growing need to encourage self-protective resilience. Education and communication are crucial tools, and we must develop new techniques to identify the most vulnerable communities, groups and households. The climate chaos represented by the increased magnitude and heightened form of storm activity in the Atlantic basin is becoming the norm for the Caribbean. The regional realities of this chaos have been masked by the discourse of “climate change”, which suggests a more manageable and gradual process. In June and July tropical storms Bret and Don also passed through the Caribbean as far south as Trinidad, an island that had previously seen a total of only four tropical storms since records began in 1851. The mismanagement of natural resources and failure to protect the environment pose a grave threat to many of us living in small-island developing states and less economically developed countries. Ultimately, just as the health of the oceans and atmosphere are related to one another, so the current plight of countries on the periphery is the best indicator of the future of the core. • Dr Gabrielle Thongs specialises in disaster planning and spatial modelling at the University of the West Indies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2017/sep/14/scaling-up-our-response-to-super-hurricanes","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T20:30:14Z","webTitle":"Scaling up our response to super-hurricanes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/14/scaling-up-our-response-to-super-hurricanes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/sep/14/scaling-up-our-response-to-super-hurricanes","fields":{"headline":"Scaling up our response to super-hurricanes","bodyText":"Hurricane Irma has unleashed her fury across the Caribbean and the south-eastern US. She’s been the second major hurricane to barrel into the US mainland in recent weeks, and with Hurricane Jose following hot on her heels, 2017 is shaping up to be one of the busiest hurricane seasons for at least a decade. The strength and intensity of Irma – she sustained wind speeds of 185mph for a record breaking 35 hours – has taken everyone by surprise, and some have raised the question of whether a new category is needed, to describe “super-hurricanes” like Irma. The Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale is based on hurricane wind-speed, with anything over 157mph being given a category 5 – the highest rank on the scale. When it was developed, more than four decades ago, super-hurricanes like Irma were exceedingly rare. But since then oceans have warmed, and models suggest that the probability of more intense hurricanes is likely to rise (for every degree of warming in tropical seas hurricane wind-speeds increase by an average of 10mph), though the overall number of tropical storms is expected to fall. So from a measurements perspective adding a category 6 (winds over 175mph) seems reasonable, though this extra category tells us little about the risk associated with these winds; any hurricane of category 5 and over is going to flatten most things. Instead, a revamp of the hurricane rating system might make more sense. The National Center for Atmospheric Research’s hurricane severity scale includes such risk factors as whether the hurricane is likely to stall in one place (as Harvey did to devastating effect).

They celebrate 30 years since its release – three decades that have been filled with groundbreaking remixes, productions, DJ sets, club nights and occasional forays into the charts – with a new and doubtless thrilling audiovisual show. 21 September, Village Underground, London. Loyle Carner Of all the current crop of British MCs, Loyle Carner feels the most idiosyncratic. His debut album, Yesterday’s Gone, was restrained, lyrically downbeat, big on mournful piano and jazz guitar, suffused with a very British kind of melancholy, and came furnished with a spoken-word endorsement from his mum (“He was and is a complete joy,” she proudly offered). He’s a genuinely unique talent, and this tour contains his biggest show to date, at London’s Brixton Academy. 28 September, ABC Glasgow; then touring until 12 October. The Grime and the Glamour The Barbican’s season of New York movies has a distinctly musical slant. It opens with a triple bill of rarely seen films about the 70s punk scene, including Amos Poe’s legendary 1976 document Blank Generation, and takes in everything from 80s hip-hop drama Wild Style (30 Sept) to Smithereens, Susan Seidelman’s feature film set in and around the downtown music scene and starring Richard Hell (30 Sept), and Seidelman’s later Desperately Seeking Susan (1 Oct), one of the few films starring Madonna that can be safely viewed without losing the will to live. 29 September-5 October, Barbican, London. David Bowie: A New Career in a New Town The exemplary series of box sets charting the course of Bowie’s career reaches its third volume and the Berlin and Brian Eno years, The 11 CDs or 13 albums include Low, “Heroes”, the double live set Stage, Scary Monsters and a compilation of non-album tracks including Bowie singing Brecht from the Baal EP. The real gem is a new and noticeable improved version of the hugely underrated Lodger, remixed by Tony Visconti. Next, presumably, Bowie’s 80s: gulp! 29 September (Parlophone). Miley Cyrus: Younger Now Another intriguing career turn from mainstream pop’s most off-message figure, after 2015’s psychedelic Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz. That featured the Flaming Lips, a song called Milky Milky Milk and a cover photo of an impossibly stoned-looking Cyrus smearing her face with glitter: this, however is heralded as a return not to the electropop of Bangerz but to her country roots and a more conservative image, apparently inspired by the election of Donald Trump. 29 September (RCA) Spacebomb Revue Richmond, Virginia’s Spacebomb has succeeded in carving out its own musical niche. A recording studio powered by a house band in the manner of Motown or Stax, it’s made a succession of albums that manage to be both individual while boasting a signature style: warm, luscious, soul-influenced Americana. This show features both the label’s mainstays – singer-songwriters Matthew E White, Natalie Prass – and other artists who’ve received the studio’s magic touch, including Foxygen and Mike Scott of the Waterboys. 6 October, Barbican, London. Liam Gallagher: As You Were Admirably blunt, Liam Gallagher has admitted that his first solo album represents “the last roll of the dice” for a post-Oasis career that’s thus far never threatened to repeat the kind of success he found with his brother. Beady Eye have been replaced by a team of blue-chip co-writers for hire, including Greg Kurstin, co-author of Adele’s Hello, and regular Mark Ronson collaborator Andrew Wyatt. It’s a strategy that’s produced only minor hits thus far, but you never know. 6 October (Warner Bros). St Vincent: Masseduction Since her last, eponymous album in 2014, Annie Clark has become infinitely more famous, a state of affairs that has less to do with her music than her private life: you can’t date one of the world’s most famous supermodels without the tabloids taking a prurient interest. Her fifth album should redress the balance: she is, after all, one of the most consistently fascinating singer-songwriters around, and the tracks released thus far from Masseduction – electro-fuelled and “all about sex and drugs and sadness” according to its author – suggest no slip in quality. 13 October (Loma Vista). The Jam: 1977 Attempting to singlehandedly start a mod revival at the height of punk should have been a foolhardy and doomed undertaking: incredibly, Paul Weller pulled it off, as documented by this lavish five-disc box set, clearly aimed at the middle-aged feather-cut Christmas market. It explores The Jam’s oft-overlooked early years in depth, collecting their debut In the City and its wobbly, undercooked follow-up This Is the Modern World alongside umpteen demos, live performances and TV appearances. 20 October (Universal). J Hus Rapper Stormzy recently caused baffled consternation by referring to Theresa May as a “paigon”. Had people been paying attention to the oeuvre of his sometime collaborator J Hus, they would have been familiar with the term thanks to his 2015 track Dem Boy Paigon. Since then, his star has risen considerably. This year, his intriguing blend of hard-hitting grime MCing and music influenced by Afrobeat and bashment has resulted in a top ten album and single: a brief tour rounds the year off. 22 October, Tramshed, Cardiff. Then touring. Avicii: True Stories On paper, a feature-length documentary about an EDM DJ and producer doesn’t sound like the most fascinating cinematic experience imaginable. But Avicii is clearly a more complex and troubled character than his DayGlo music suggests. Film-maker Levan Tsikurishvili spent four years in his company, capturing both his success and a subsequent physical and mental decline that led him to unexpectedly retire from performing live last year. True Stories promises to be “a cautionary tale that explores the taxing nature and intensity of fame.” 26 October in selected cinemas Godspeed You! Black Emperor The announcement of the Canadian post-rock collective’s seventh album, Luciferian Towers, came complete with a list of demands, among them “the total dismantling of the prison-industrial complex” and “the expert fuckers who broke this world never get to speak again”. Certainly, their brand of apocalyptic instrumental music has seldom felt more appropriate: their live shows, meanwhile, are invariably overwhelming experiences, the intensity of the music ratcheted up by the films that accompany it. 23 October, Brighton Dome. Then touring. Liverpool Music Week The line-up for the 15th annual Liverpool Music Week is impressively eclectic – ranging from an opening night performance at the Echo Arena by Nile Rodgers and Chic to experimental electronics from Mount Kimbie and Blanck Mass to an appearance by reggae legend Dawn Penn. Everything Everything, meanwhile, headline a closing show that also features Zola Jesus and the Orielles, the latter responsible for two of 2017’s most captivating singles, Sugar Tastes Like Salt and I Only Bought It for the Bottle. 26 October-4 November. Father John Misty Josh Tillman continues to cut a divisive figure in rock music: for everyone who thinks this year’s Pure Comedy and its equally acclaimed predecessor I Love You Honeybear are the dernier cri in latterday singer-songwriter sophistication, there’s someone else loudly informing the world that they find his shtick arch and irritating: “the most self-important asshole on earth”, as Ryan Adams recently complained. Live, however, he’s a potent presence: funny and compelling in equal measure. 1 November, Usher Hall, Edinburgh. Then touring. Goldie: All Things Remembered You would have a hard time arguing that drum’n’bass pioneer Goldie has led an insufficiently incident-packed life to warrant an autobiography: from a childhood spent in care homes to international celebrity, All Things Remembered promises “an explosive story of abuse, revenge, graffiti, gold teeth, sawn-off shotguns, car crashes, hot yoga and redemption through reality TV”. 2 November (Faber &amp; Faber) Perfume Genius Mike Hadreas’s journey from something approaching an outsider artist turning his turbulent life story into shaky, harrowing, lo-fi music to something approaching mainstream success – his music now turns up in adverts, he models for fashion magazines – is a fascinating one. This year’s album No Shape proved a career highlight and one of 2017’s best: a less straightforward pop album than it first appears, where lyrical strangeness exists alongside melodic richness and sonic ugliness disrupts the spectral beauty. 2 November, Glasgow School of Art. Then touring. Princess Nokia Destiny Frasqueri currently finds herself in a unique position. There aren’t many uncompromising, comics-obsessed intersectional feminist female rappers apparently poised for commercial success, but the music on her mixtape 1992 – recently reissued by Rough Trade with a plethora of new tracks attached – is good enough to snare a wider audience and her rhymes are smart and sharp and funny. These shows may well represent the last chance audiences get to see her in smaller venues. 3 November, Invisible Wind Factory, Liverpool. Then touring. Shabazz Palaces It says something about how challenging Seattle rap duo Shabazz Palaces’ earlier oeuvre was that a pair of interlinked concept albums about an alien called Quaraz very much represented their most approachable work to date. But amid the sonic experiments and incomprehensible storyline, the Quaraz albums offered moments of unexpected directness – gorgeous melodies, snappy, relatable lyrics – without ever surrendering the duo’s uniqueness: they remain like nothing else in hip-hop. 6 November, Oval Space, London. Then touring. Run the Jewels Run the Jewels’ Pyramid stage performance was one of the highlights of this year’s Glastonbury. The duo came on stage immediately after Jeremy Corbyn’s rapturously received speech and were scarcely less triumphant, the potency of their music and their ability to switch their set’s mood from rage to humour to poignancy and back again fully in evidence: proof, should it be needed, of what a great live act Killer Mike and El-P have become. 9 November, Victoria Warehouse, Manchester. Then touring. Hüsker Dü: Savage Young Dü Hüsker Dü are one of 80s alt-rock’s great lost, pioneering bands: others, including Pixies and Nirvana, made far greater commercial capital from harnessing hardcore’s rage and noise to pop melodies, but Hüsker Dü did it first. Their back catalogue has long been in a state of disarray, never treated with the care and attention it deserves, until now: this exhaustive box set from Numero Group, chronicling their raw, warp-speed early years, is a treat and revelation. 10 November (Numero Group). Taylor Swift: Reputation Taylor Swift’s sixth studio album is by some considerable distance the biggest pop release of the autumn, guaranteed to provoke an infinite number of think pieces. If the two singles that have preceded it are anything to go by, Reputation sees a shift away from 1989’s Springsteen-ish AOR towards a more electronic sound and lyrically continues her habit of opaquely referencing her umpteen feuds and gossip surrounding her private life: it remains to be seen if every song is a kind of millennial You’re So Vain. 10 November (Big Machine) Thundercat Multi-instrumentalist Stephen Bruner has played with everyone from Suicidal Tendencies to Erykah Badu, but it was his work on Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly that really catapulted him into the spotlight, winning him a Grammy. He responded with to the increase in profile with Drunk, a fabulously eclectic album that took in smooth soul, jazz fusion, electronic funk and yacht rock – Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald joining Pharrell and Kendrick among the guest stars. Live, he’s as off-kilter as you might expect. 14 November, O2 ABC, Glasgow. Then touring. Morrissey: Low In High School The announcement of Morrissey’s first new album since 2014’s World Peace Is None of Your Business brings with it the usual mix of excitement and apprehension. A return to peak form or more fair-to-middling? Will the lyrics reflect his passion for Brexit, love of Nigel Farage and belief that Sadiq Khan “talks so quickly that people can’t understand him”? How long until his much-trumpeted new record deal collapses amid blood-curdling acrimony? We shall see. 17 November (Etienne). U2: Songs Of Experience Riding high again after the critical and commercial success of their summer tour revisiting 1987’s The Joshua Tree, U2 finally unveil the much-delayed companion piece to 2014’s much-derided Songs of Innocence, its original incarnation scrapped following the election of Donald Trump, and new songs recorded live in the studio with producer Steve Lillywhite. Whether it’s enough to quell the band’s evident fear that they’re seen as a heritage act in the wake of the Joshua Tree tour is an intriguing question. 1 December (Island). CLASSICAL K-Music Held at seven venues across London, this festival provides an intriguing reminder that Korea’s music scene stretches far beyond K-pop and Gangnam Style. Many of the artists use traditional instruments in new ways, from the gentle, exquisite compositions of Jiha Park to the psychedelic pansori-rock of Aux. The opening concert, at the Union Chapel, is a collaboration between Northumbrian piper Kathryn Tickell and Black String, who rework ancient Korean styles using bamboo flute, zither and electric guitar. 15 September-25 October, various venues, London. R17 Cardiff’s centenary commemoration of the Russian revolution embraces all the arts, but opera features prominently. Welsh National Opera revives its fine productions of Mussorgsky’s Khovanshchina, Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin, and Janáček’s From the House of the Dead, while Mid Wales Opera mounts a new touring production of Walton’s The Bear, which is based on a Chekhov short story. 23 September-7 November, various venues, Cardiff. The Bear tours Wales 2 November-3 December. The Judas Passion Sally Beamish’s new choral work promises a fresh look at one of the most familiar biblical stories. David Harsent’s libretto retells the events of Christ’s crucifixion from the perspective of Judas Iscariot, posing questions of whether his betrayal can ever be forgiven. Nicholas McGegan conducts the OAE and its chorus for the performances, with Mary Bevan as Mary, Roderick Williams as Christ and Brendan Gunnell as Judas. • 24 September, Saffron Hall, Saffron Walden; 25 September, St John’s Smith Square, London. Voices Hard to believe, but the London Sinfonietta is 50 years old this year. It is celebrating its half century with a series of concerts, and though sadly there is no revival of the work with which it made its debut, John Tavener’s exuberant fantasy The Whale, it is revisiting some of its great successes, including Voices, Hans Werner Henze’s evening-long, multilingual song cycle, conducted by David Atherton, one of the Sinfonietta founders. • 11 October, St John’s Smith Square, London. Marnie English National Opera gave the world premiere of Nico Muhly’s first opera, Two Boys, in 2011. It’s got the first bite at Muhly’s follow-up too, which is based on Winston Graham’s 1961 novel, which also led to Alfred Hitchcock’s psychological thriller. Martyn Brabbins conducts his first new production as ENO’s music director; Sasha Cooke takes the title role and Michael Meyer directs. • Coliseum, London, 18 November-3 December. Les Troyens Complete recordings of The Trojans, Berlioz’s operatic epic, can still be counted on the fingers of one hand. The new one, conducted by John Nelson, is derived from a pair of concerts in Strasbourg last April. Reports on that live performance were hugely enthusiastic, and with Marie-Nicole Lemieux as Cassandra, Joyce DiDonato as Dido and Michael Spyres as Aeneas, the cast is about as good as anyone could hope to hear today. 24 November (Erato). JAZZ Mike Gibbs’ 80th Birthday Tour The glowing ensemble sound and raucous harmonies of jazz composer Mike Gibbs mark him out as one of the most creative inheritors of the painterly methods of Duke Ellington and Gil Evans – a tradition into which he has woven elements from Charles Ives and Olivier Messiaen to Thelonious Monk and country rock. Pianist Hans Koller has assembled a superb Gibbs-directed UK orchestra including saxophonist Jason Yarde and guitarist Mike Walker for this 80th birthday tour. 24 September, Scarborough jazz festival. Then touring until 29 September. 25th London jazz festival The EFG London jazz festival returns with its signature mix of stars and intriguing newcomers, marking its 25th anniversary year with the 25 for 25 showcase of specially commissioned work, including American trumpeter Terence Blanchard’s Herbie Hancock-inspired piece for full orchestra. South Africans Abdullah Ibrahim and Hugh Masekela, mandolinist Chris Thile, and piano giants Brad Mehldau and Chucho Valdes are among many glitzy guests on this unique citywide 10-day jazz party. 10-19 November, various venues, London. WORLD/FOLK First Time Ever by Peggy Seeger A memoir of an eventful life from a hugely influential figure in the folk revival, now 82. Seeger is an ardent feminist and left-wing activist, a singer-songwriter blacklisted under McCarthyism, the half-sister of legendary folk singer Pete and partner of controversial folk purist Ewan McColl, whose most famous song, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, is about her. The blurb promises “a story of birth and abortion, sex and infidelity, devotion and betrayal”. 5 October (Faber &amp; Faber). Jon Boden The singer-songwriter and fiddler who shook up the folk scene as the frontman of Bellowhead returns with a new solo album, Afterglow, the second part of his post-apocalyptic trilogy, which began with Songs from the Floodplain in 2009. He says that the new songs deal with a world transformed by climate change, in which “the luxuries and comfort of 21st-century life have become scarce, and a harder, simpler existence now prevails”. 6 October (Hudson records). On tour 6-26 November. Saz’iso Albanian saze is a haunting, often melancholy style that features clarinet, violin and complex iso-polyphonic singing that combines at least two melody lines. This powerful music is little known outside southern Albania, but that could change thanks to Saz’iso, a group of virtuoso musicians who came together with help from Joe Boyd, a producer who has worked with everyone from Nick Drake and Fairport Convention to Cubanismo and Songhai. He co-produced their debut album, At Least Wave Your Handkerchief at Me: The Joys and Sorrows of Southern Albanian Song, 13 October (Glitterbeat). On tour 1-11 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/11/pewdiepie-racism-youtube-games-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T15:07:53Z","webTitle":"PewDiePie must not be excused.

Using the N-word is never OK","bodyText":"Using the N-word is never okay. It’s a fairly easy rule to live by, but one that needs repeating in the wake of YouTube megastar Felix Kjellberg’s latest controversy. Commonly known as PewDiePie, the vlogger called another player “a fucking nigger” during a live video stream. Taking too long to realise his mistake, he qualified the racist slur with “I don’t mean in a bad way” and laughed it off. Social media kicked into gear after the video came to light and condemned the YouTuber. In addition, games developers have publicly criticised Kjellberg. Most notably Sean Vanaman from Campo Santo responded by filing a copyright claim to order YouTube to remove Kjellberg’s Firewatch videos. He also urged other developers to do the same. Despite the public outcry, many people are coming to Kjellberg’s defence (some using the hastag #PewDiePieDidNothingWrong), dismissing the event as a crime of gaming passion. This ignores his influence and sends a clear message that it’s okay to be racist in the gaming community. Casual use of racial slurs needs to be condemned wholeheartedly, every single time. There is never a good reason to use the language displayed in this video. Playing a video game is not an excuse, just as being drunk or angry does not give anyone free reign to use racist insults. Watching the video is shocking because Kjellberg drops the word so casually. In fact, he doesn’t even seem to recognise what he’s just done, until you hear some nervous laughter from someone off-camera prompting Kjellberg to attempt an apology. It’s all framed as something said in the heat of the moment. It doesn’t represent who he is or what he thinks, his social media supporters claim. His fans tell us that he’s clearly not racist, but all we have to go on is the fact that he repeatedly uses racist language as a source of what he calls satire and entertainment. It’s not the first time racist language has been used in jest by Kjellberg: he lost lucrative contracts with Disney and YouTube in 2016 after repeated instances of antisemitism in his videos. It’s easy to be sucked in by the affable, good looking YouTuber. Kjellberg’s PewDiePie persona is the funny, care-free friend you want to hang out with. He doesn’t take anything too seriously. He’s fun to have around. Let’s not forget that Kjellberg was the highest paid YouTuber of 2016, earning £11.8m last year with nearly 60 million subscribers. For this seemingly harmless, popular figure with no agenda to use offensive, racist language as if it’s nothing only normalises it. Laughing it off like Kjellberg does is even worse. The trouble with the “he’s not racist” argument is that it ignores everything that comes with any racial slur. It ignores the pain and the history and the times people have had to shrug off those insults. Using the N-word is a choice, not an accident. And we need to stop framing the perpetrators as the victims because they seem like nice people or because they have black friends and an appreciation of rap music. Racism isn’t funny. It’s as simple as that. In the current political climate, the far right has managed to rebrand itself as the so called ‘alt-right’, reframing its politics as the acceptable face of racism and homophobia. Only a few weeks ago, a Nazi rally took place in America and dominated news headlines for days. The word Kjellberg used is not just a word. It’s a word that is heavy with history and suffering, but just because it’s used in rap music or films people feel they are entitled to use it. They are not. And they are not entitled to tell black people not to be offended when someone like Kjellberg uses it. How many times is the games industry going to be shocked and appalled by Kjellberg’s racist language and stunts? How many apologies does he have to record before we admit that the industry needs to stop supporting him? Silence is complicity. The video game industry has a diversity problem – but it can be fixed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/12/aa-milne-memoir-shows-winnie-the-pooh-author-longing-to-escape-his-bear","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T10:03:39Z","webTitle":"AA Milne memoir shows Winnie-the-Pooh author longing to 'escape' his bear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/12/aa-milne-memoir-shows-winnie-the-pooh-author-longing-to-escape-his-bear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/12/aa-milne-memoir-shows-winnie-the-pooh-author-longing-to-escape-his-bear","fields":{"headline":"AA Milne memoir shows Winnie-the-Pooh author longing to 'escape' his bear","bodyText":"Winnie-the-Pooh may have secured a place in the hearts of children worldwide and made his creator a millionaire, but author AA Milne resented the way the bear of little brain undermined his reputation as a serious writer. The revelation appears in his 1939 memoir It’s Too Late Now, which is to be republished on 21 September, 70 years after it went out of print and ahead of the release of a biopic about his son, Goodbye Christopher Robin. Despite the success of Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and friends, Milne was frustrated that his reputation as a writer for adults had been irrevocably damaged. Prior to his children’s books, Milne had written a string of hit plays, novels and short stories for adults, as well as editing the satirical magazine Punch. But his first book of children’s verse, When We Were Very Young, sold 50,000 copies within two months of publication in 1924 and his Winnie-the-Pooh books became immediate bestsellers around the world. When the first volume Winnie-the-Pooh was published in 1926, it sold 150,000 copies by the end of the year in the US alone. It has never been out of print since. In It’s Too Late Now, Milne claims that he had tired of children’s writing after 70,000 words (“the number of words in the average-length novel”), but was trapped. “I wanted to escape from [children’s books] as I had once wanted to escape from Punch; as I have always wanted to escape,” he writes. “In vain. England expects the writer, like the cobbler, to stick to his last.” In one waspish passage, to which today’s bestselling authors would no doubt relate, Milne adds: “It is inevitable that a book that has had very large sales should become an object of derision to critics and columnists.” In a swipe at literary snobs, he adds: “We all write books, we all want money: we who write want money from our books. If we fail to get money, we are not so humble, nor so foolish, as to admit that we have failed in our object. Our object, we maintain, was artistic success.” The book also reveals a fraught relationship with literary critics. In his sights was the famously acid critic Dorothy Parker, writing as the Constant Reader for the New Yorker. The House at Pooh Corner resulted in one of Parker’s most famous putdowns: “Tonstant Weader Fwowed up”. Milne was stung and traded back: “However greatly indebted to Mrs Parker, no Alderney, at the approach of the milkmaid, thinks ‘I hope this lot will turn out to be gin’, no writer of children’s books says gaily to his publisher, ‘Don’t bother about the children, Mrs Parker will love it’.” The memoir also shows that Milne appeared blithely unaware of the negative impact the Pooh books had on his son, Christopher Robin, who became estranged from his father later in life. Recalling that his son referred to himself as “Billy Moon”, Milne writes: “I mention this because it explains why the publicity that came to be attached to ‘Christopher Robin’ never seemed to affect us personally, but to concern either a character in a book or a horse that we hoped at one time would win the Derby.” However, Christopher Robin was mercilessly bullied at school because of Winnie-the-Pooh, later claiming to Giles Brandreth that Milne “had got where he was by climbing on my infant shoulders, that he had filched from me my good name and had left me with nothing but the empty fame of being his son.” Harriet Sanders, who is republishing the memoir for Macmillan’s imprint Bello, said it revealed Milne to be more complex than many assume. “People think they know him, but the memoir reveals that though he is very famous, we hardly know anything about him,” she said. Bello, which revives out-of-print titles, is publishing the memoir alongside seven of Milne’s other lesser known works, including a 1921 novel based on his 1919 play Mr Pim Passes By, a comedy of errors set in a grand home in Buckinghamshire; a 1933 murder mystery called Four Days of Wonder, which follows an enthusiastic teenage girl detective; and Birthday Party &amp; Other Stories, a collection of 15 short stories that was first published in 1948."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/11/autistic-boy-turned-away-from-norwich-college-days-after-starting-course","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T19:29:53Z","webTitle":"Autistic boy turned away from Norwich college days after starting course","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/11/autistic-boy-turned-away-from-norwich-college-days-after-starting-course","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/11/autistic-boy-turned-away-from-norwich-college-days-after-starting-course","fields":{"headline":"Autistic boy turned away from Norwich college days after starting course","bodyText":"A teenager with autism was left in tears after he began a course at a further education college only to be told days later that he was not allowed back. James Parker, 16, who is described as having high support needs, enrolled at City College Norwich (CCN) on Monday last week for a one-year pathways course and enjoyed “the best week of his life”, his mother said. Then on Friday his mother, Emma, received a letter from the college telling her he had been enrolled in error and asking her not to send him back to college. Emma Parker posted the letter on Facebook on Friday saying she was heartbroken. “This has been the story through all his educational years. I’m taking this further. How dare they do this.” Her post has been shared more than 14,500 times. It reads: “My son is autistic and was told [at the] beginning of [the] year he had to find a college for September as he couldn’t stay on at his autistic school. So we applied and went for [an] interview at the city college. He was over the moon to hear the lady say: ‘Yes, 100% James is on the course.’ So he started and enrolled Monday – had the best week of his life. He even said: ‘Mum, I could cry happy tears.’ “To then get this letter today, as you can imagine he is absolutely devastated. I’m heartbroken.” A tearful James, interviewed on BBC Look East on Monday, said: “I just wanted to stay there. It’s like they’ve just chucked me away in a bin.” The college said it would review its application processes but said James’s needs had been assessed earlier in the year as part of his education, health and care plan (EHCP) and it was decided he needed a higher level of support and a different learning environment from that which it could provide. That decision, which James’s family had a right to appeal against, was conveyed to Norfolk county council in March so that a place could be found for him elsewhere. The council said it had made repeated attempts over several months to contact the family,. Emma Parker told the Eastern Daily Press she had not heard from them. In July she made a direct application to the college. A CCN spokesman said: “On the basis of the information that was available to our staff at the time, this led to a place being offered to James which was conditional on the right support and funding being available. “As had been determined in March, the college had already assessed that we were unable to provide the level of right support and environment needed, but this only came to light when we cross-referenced enrolment and additional needs funding records.” The college apologised, adding: “We are clear that this very unfortunate and isolated incident should not have happened. We are now reviewing our application processes to make sure that something like this cannot happen again. We are also working with Norfolk county council to help find the right provision for James.” The council said: “We remain very keen to work with James and his family to secure the best possible outcome for his education and urge them to respond to our offers of a meeting as soon as possible to talk through the options.” Sarah Lambert, head of policy at the National Autistic Society, said young people with autism often faced difficulty trying to find appropriate places to study once they left school. “We know from talking to autistic young people and their parents that finding appropriate post-16 provision is really important but can be a huge challenge. Research indicates that fewer than one in four young people on the autism spectrum continue their education beyond school,” she said. “It’s clear that the system to ensure James got on to a course that meets his needs has broken down in this instance and it’s vital that the local authority works with him and his family now to find the right provision.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2017/sep/17/battlefield-bounty-hunters-in-polish-ww2-battlefields","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T07:30:35Z","webTitle":"Battlefield bounty hunters: the detectorists of eastern Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/17/battlefield-bounty-hunters-in-polish-ww2-battlefields","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/sep/17/battlefield-bounty-hunters-in-polish-ww2-battlefields","fields":{"headline":"Battlefield bounty hunters: the detectorists of eastern Europe","bodyText":"In the quiet of the forest, Aleksander holds a rusted pistol and turns it over. Others gather round to admire the handgun, each feeling its weight before shooting an imaginary bullet into the trees. More detritus of war is placed on a picnic table – a swastika-adorned badge, shards of shrapnel, a Soviet medal inscribed “Proletarians of all countries, unite!” The remnants of fallen regimes. The men are among the thousands of detectorists across eastern Europe hunting for relics of the Red Army, the Third Reich and Imperial Russia. Beneath ploughed field and remote woodland is buried treasure from a turbulent, vanishing past. Even today, the war dead lie in these lands. Sometimes bodies are found. Each weekend this group, calling themselves the Masovian Guardians of History, heads to the Polish backwoods to escape the city. There is a builder, barman, factory worker, office clerk, postman and sushi chef, among others. Fuelled by vodka and a passion for history, they strip old battlefields of artefacts while trying to dodge the police. On a drizzly summer afternoon 24 hours earlier, I meet Aleksander in a station outside Warsaw. The 30-year-old, with cropped hair and an athletic frame, has just finished his shift at a railway parts factory. He gives a polite yet calibrated smile and leads me to his car. As we drive across flat, open country, I try to imagine the bloodletting that passed on this, the former Eastern Front – the armoured clashes, the scorched-earth policies, the millions dead. But it is impossible. It’s not long until conversation turns to politics. “Immigration is not good,” says Aleksander, unprompted. “We should stop the mix of people and cultures.” What about his compatriots who face similar hostility in the UK? “They should not be in Britain in the first place,” replies the amateur kickboxer-turned-triathlete. “These Poles are exploited and should stay here to make our country great.” The countryside grows emptier and, beyond the nondescript town of Międzyrzec Podlaski, we reach a small dwelling with rundown outhouses, guarded by a yapping mongrel. A middle-aged man dressed in camouflage trousers and black T-shirt opens the gate. A few detectorists stand around, drinking beer. Several more soon pitch up, dressed in the outfit of choice – khaki fatigues. Suddenly, someone lets out a cheer. Dariusz has arrived. In sweat-stained army surplus, he swaggers over – metal detector slung over his shoulder, paunch protruding from his vest. A silver cross hangs on a heavy chain around his neck. His right arm is tattooed with a Winged Hussar of the old Polish cavalry. After greeting his friends, he challenges me to a fight but gets distracted by our photographer – a Mexican. “Ah, you’re from the Zetas cartel! You are my boss!” As a joke, he holds two knives to the throat of our translator then heads off for another beer, tripping down the steps to the house. “Ha!” he guffaws. “Instant karma!” The dig will start in the morning. The plan now is to get plastered. Lager flows among innumerable shots of vodka flavoured with cherry, plum, quince or walnut. Dariusz prepares a campfire for a pot that bubbles with potatoes, onions and chunks of pork. This hearty dinner fails to soak up all the booze and, by the early hours, the detectorists pass out. Three collapse fully clothed on to a single bed. Two hundred miles away lies Kraków, the base of DCI Bartłomiej Morek. This policeman runs the Vinci unit, targeting unaccredited detectorists, art thieves, forgers and relic smugglers. “We don’t want to fight hobbyists, but my job is to protect archaeological sites,” he says. “We must stop detectorists destroying them.” Finds are often flogged on the black market, with online bazaars distributing artefacts to countries around the world, including the UK. “We have tools to locate people on the other side of the internet,” says Morek. “Once we know an item is illegal and inside Poland, there’s no problem securing a search warrant.” Landing a prosecution is harder. “Detectorists know how to escape a conviction and share their knowledge about how to stay free.” Metal detecting without the right permit can incur a £1,000 fine or a month in prison. Those guilty of possessing salvaged weapons and explosives – even if rusted or deactivated – may be jailed for several years, though sentences are often suspended. Critics say Polish law on historical objects is ambiguous, leading to arbitrary punishment and offering no financial incentive to hand in artefacts. Back near the Poland-Belarus border, as the Masovian Guardians of History gather on Saturday morning, Dariusz is jovial despite last night’s heavy session. His fascination with the past was kindled by his grandfather, a Second World War veteran captured by the Nazis and used for slave labour. “I am surrounded by history,” says Dariusz, 35, in broken English. He graduated with a history degree and now, after a turbulent 20s, works as an itinerant farmhand, picking fruit in southwest Germany. “My mother was a civil servant, my father committed suicide when I was 19. After his death, I drank hard for three years. One litre of vodka per day sometimes. I was very aggressive and fighting in the streets, so my girlfriend said: ‘You have a problem, go see psychologist.’ One day, I just wake up and decide to stop. Now I’m better. Sometimes I see my father in me, but I make a choice and fix it.” As with most here, Dariusz is a nationalist. His right-wing views extend to Islam (“I get my machete for all the Muslims”), gay rights (“This is a Catholic country – I think most people don’t like the gays”) and recent demonstrations against the government’s controversial plan to take control of the Supreme Court (“This protest is sponsored by Soros and run by old communists”). On American politics, he is nonplussed (“Obama or Trump – same shit”). Despite his views, Dariusz is affable, all bluster. As a fellow detectorist explains: “He’s the most popular guy here. He has a big heart. If he saw a Muslim woman in trouble, he’d be the first to help.” He’s still single. “Girls don’t like it when I’m away digging,” he says. “Maybe I have wife one day, but now digging is winning.” Over breakfast, the group knocks back coffees and beers and then, dressed in combat gear, piles into a van for the bumpy ride into the mosquito-infested woods. This area was once scarred by a series of clashes – between the Wehrmacht and the Red Army in 1944, between the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires during the First World War, between Polish rebels and the tsar in 1831 – along with assaults during the 17th-century from Russia, Sweden and Zaporozhian Cossacks. No one here bothers with the bureaucratic rigmarole of obtaining accreditation to dig. One of the regulars, a policeman, is usually on hand to help them evade the law. “Once we got stopped by two cops,” says one detectorist. “But he was more senior so they let us go.” Before the dig, the group gathers round a recently salvaged collection of weapons from the battlefield – rifles of Imperial Russia, semi-automatic Mausers, a pair of Ruby and Tokarev pistols – along with rare medals, coins and military insignia. Then they fan out into the green glow of the forest. Their instruments buzz, bleep and hum as they head through stands of birch and maple, oak, pine and spruce. One of them stumbles across a wartime trench, already ransacked. I spot Aleksander, his sensor flicking from side to side. He and his grandfather – a survivor of massacres carried out by Ukrainian nationalists in 1943 – enjoyed long conversations about history, which nurtured his passion for the past. There is another reason for his love of metal detecting. “My factory is stressful and dirty, but the forest is clean,” says Aleksander. “I rest my brain and escape from reality.” But his pursuits have created a family rift. His sister, an archaeologist, does not approve: “We don’t talk much any more.” Their relationship is symptomatic of the tensions between detectorists and archaeologists, about whom Aleksander is scathing: “They just attend conferences and spend money. They’re the real thieves.” The feeling is mutual. Dr Tomasz Nowakiewicz, from the University of Warsaw’s Institute of Archaeology, says: “We’re no longer in the 19th century. Calling yourself a collector is no excuse.” Institute director Dr Krzysztof Jakubiak tells me the detectorists’ slapdash methods destroy an object’s context – critical for interpreting past human activity. “We know how to do proper excavation and extraction. We don’t just tear objects out from the soil. Within 10 years, we risk losing all these objects.” The detectorists scour the forest and find medals, coins and shrapnel, but not much more. Sweaty, bug-bitten and ready to refuel, they stop at a pizza parlour. Artur, a factory worker, orders a carafe of vodka and passes out before we arrive back at the rented house. They consider themselves custodians of history. “For me, these objects are priceless,” says one. “They connect me to the past. I don’t want to leave them to rust. This is our national history, but they’re my artefacts.” That night there is axe-throwing and vodka shots while Marek, a sushi chef, plays the same patriotic military tune on repeat. After too much boozing, he is carried to bed, but by breakfast the next morning he has already necked three beers. The group walk through an orchard and cross a marsh amid birdsong and the buzz of insects. It is bucolic, another world from the one that Jan Demczuk remembers from his childhood. We meet the 90-year-old, retired farmer chopping firewood outside his barn. He doesn’t seem bothered by the khaki-clad strangers probing his land for trinkets and trophies. “There was fighting around here in September 1939 between Germans and Poles,” recalls the old man. The frontline returned in summer 1944 as the Soviets pushed back against the Wehrmacht. “I remember soldiers running past. There were many explosions.” As battle raged, Demczuk describes his mother taking him with their piglets to hide in a field. The sow, missing her litter, escaped from her pen and joined them, as the terrified young boy cradled the tiny animals. Asked about life under occupation, he answers: “As hosts, the Nazis were perfect. There was order. Sure, they killed innocent people, but it was war.” His recollections do not capture the horror that unfolded in this area, home to a large, centuries-old Jewish community. A ghetto was established, then came the mass deportations by cattle wagon to extermination camps. Less than 1% of the local Jewish population is believed to have survived. The detectorists survey a meadow then move to a raspberry plantation, occasionally crouching down to dig up the goods. Dariusz is unconcerned about unexploded ordnance. “No problem. It’s not dangerous. If it blows up, my brain is dust and I don’t even know.” Like Aleksander, an obsession with past heroics is not his only motivation for rummaging in the dirt. “When I am digging, I am escaping,” he explains. “I just forget.” There is a beep and Marek and Piotr begin excavating with great purpose. They hollow out a few inches then test the soil with a detector. Another beep. Piotr grabs his spade and digs out clumps of earth. He reaches in, clasps his fingers around the object and lifts it out. A helmet, perhaps? An SS officer’s Luger? It’s a rusted horseshoe. He tosses it away. Bottle tops and farm junk may account for most finds but, very occasionally, something extraordinary is unearthed. Back at the house, a builder called Sebastian is knocking back a late-morning beer. This father-of-two in his late 30s is going through a divorce and has come to the countryside to clear his head. He describes how, several years ago, he went looking for militaria near Bohukały, a village by the Belarus border. German Panzer divisions had rumbled through here on their lightning advance eastwards in 1941. Three years later, this tiny village was again at the centre of fierce fighting during the Soviets’ counter-offensive. Sebastian heard that following the battle locals had buried the dead in bomb craters. He set out across this necropolis and his detector soon started beeping. He dug up a flask then burrowed further and found a dog tag, and then a skull. The more he dug, the more bones he found, finally exhuming 26 skeletons. “I was excited and emotional,” says Sebastian. “It was intense.” He took the dog tags, covered the bones and informed a German organisation that repatriates the remains of missing soldiers. “It doesn’t matter if they’re Polish, Russian or German. They’re soldiers with loved ones who don’t know what happened.” He also pocketed spent ammunition, shell fragments and a medal awarded to those wounded in action. Is this grave robbing? “I never take jewellery or gold teeth from the dead,” he replies. “But medals – that’s OK.” The group gathers for one last beer, inspecting the weekend’s haul. Besides shrapnel and cartridge cases, there are coins and military buttons from the 19th century, a 1660s shilling, a bronze medallion from the Russian-Turkish war (1877-78), a Nazi map-reading instrument, and a handsome piece of silver. But they’ve not made that dynamite discovery that could earn a fortune and generate a legend. “No problem,” smiles Dariusz, shrugging his shoulders. “We try again next weekend.” Some names have been changed"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/11/natural-selection-review-birds-andy-holden-peter-former-newington-library","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T15:59:50Z","webTitle":"Natural Selection review – a risky celebration of the dastardly life of birds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/11/natural-selection-review-birds-andy-holden-peter-former-newington-library","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/11/natural-selection-review-birds-andy-holden-peter-former-newington-library","fields":{"headline":"Natural Selection review – a risky celebration of the dastardly life of birds","bodyText":"It sounds just charming: a long look at all the feathered friends flitting around our back gardens. Yet the cosy material in Natural Selection, an exhibition by father and son duo Andy and Peter Holden, turns out to have more drama than Hitchcock’s The Birds, rife with dastardly tales of a criminal underworld, obsession and class conflict. The project, commissioned by public art powerhouse Artangel and sited within London’s former Newington Library, takes as its jumping-off point A Natural History of Nest Building, a three-screen film essay presented by artist Andy and his ornithologist father Peter. Sporting a cravat, Peter has the measured tones of a man comfortable on camera: as “the bird man” on Blue Peter and co-presenter with Bill Oddie on Bird in the Nest, he introduced generations of children, including his son, to the wonders of birds. In a faded brown tie and jacket and nerd glasses that look back to his dad’s heyday, Andy on the other hand is nervy, his delivery fast-paced and unpolished. What of the birds? The pair relate fascinating stories, from the cuckoo’s parasitic tactics to birds that lay eggs straight on to cliff edges. Holden junior is particularly interested in how nest-building relates to art-making. Do birds create their intricate constructions because instinct tells them to drop moss on twigs, or do they have a vision of their home in mind, suggesting a higher consciousness? Consider the Australian bowerbird, unique in fashioning an inverted arch of sticks purely for displaying the objects it collects, like “a set for a performance”. Andy has constructed a massive version of one in the gallery. Meanwhile, bird behaviours become pronounced metaphors for the creative process, like the osprey, whose nests resemble vast balls of tangled wool, sites they return to again and again and build up over the years. Andy’s breakout 2010 work comes to mind, a knitted boulder that upscaled a chip of a pyramid he had “stolen” as a child, into an ingenious analogy for the comic distortions of memory and guilt. This is Andy’s typical modus operandi: starting small with something from his own life, then exploding it outward into a twisty nest of ideas. Sophistication is balanced by self-exposure, embarrassment even. Natural Selection’s inspiration he tells us, was a blackbird nest discovered when he moved back to live with his parents. The artist first started collaborating with his dad on bird-themed art performances in 2011. But, as diverting as these nest-building accounts are, it’s in the library’s low-lit basement – where another father and son, Richard and Henry Cuming, once stored their natural history collection – that the plot thickens. Here an eerie CGI-animated blackbird with Andy’s voice relates the history of egg-collecting. Beginning with Victorian aristocrats hell-bent on cataloguing nature, through to the 21st century’s outlaw nest robbers, it’s a narrative peppered with police chases, undercover detectives and secret societies. Egg collectors aren’t presented as monsters immune to the threat of avian extinction though. Rather they are self-styled experts, often clinging to the values of a past era. A backdrop of paintings romanticising the English landscape, from Eric Ravilious’ chalk horse on a West Country hill to David Hockney’s Technicolor take on Yorkshire, underlines how artists also impose their very human vision on to the natural world. Where things get really interesting – and risky – is in Andy’s focus on a particularly thorny subject right now: class, specifically the white working class, apparently left behind by the globalised world and demonised as stuck on a vision of a Britain that never was. Today’s criminal egg collectors are welders and decorators, living isolated existences with pictures of those original “gentlemen scientists pinned to their walls”. Victorian hero Lord Rothschild – who founded the Natural History Museum, gifting it his egg collection – is represented in the two-screen video by a photo of his zebras pulling a carriage. On the other hand, the East Ender Matthew Gonshaw, whose collection landed him in prison in 2011, comes across as a tragic, sympathetic figure. “I’d like to find a female,” he says, baring his lonely heart to a gang of news reporters. In an adjoining room, Andy has recreated a 2006 hoard of 7,130 eggs, found in Cleethorpes. The tiny speckled treasures are housed as they were discovered, not in display cases but old margarine tubs and chocolate boxes. The subject matter is quaint, but Andy uses rough edges – his awkward delivery, the iffy animation – to avoid what might be a rose-tinted Wes Anderson-ish dive into yesteryear’s pursuits. What emerges, finally, is a reflection on the dangerous allure of nostalgia itself. There are a lot of layers to unpick. But, like the osprey’s nest, it is a project that deserves repeat visits. • Andy Holden and Peter Holden: Natural Selection is at the former Newington Library, London, until 5 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/11/cares-paul-hollywood-bake-off-dress-nazi-when-nigel-farage-eu-flags-proms","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T14:20:46Z","webTitle":"Who cares about Paul Hollywood dressing as a Nazi when we have Nigel Farage? | Suzanne Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/cares-paul-hollywood-bake-off-dress-nazi-when-nigel-farage-eu-flags-proms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/cares-paul-hollywood-bake-off-dress-nazi-when-nigel-farage-eu-flags-proms","fields":{"headline":"Who cares about Paul Hollywood dressing as a Nazi when we have Nigel Farage?","bodyText":"We really have got our bunting in a twist. This is hardly surprising in the age of Brexit when questions of identity are fought over on a symbolic level. Why else does it matter if a local radio presenter and MEP (Nigel Farage) complains about the waving of EU flags at the Last Night of the Proms? Suddenly flags seem to matter. There was a time without bunting and suddenly it was everywhere, nostalgia-invoking with its nod to the village fete, the homemade, a vision of Englishness, a reminder of the postwar celebrations. I blame Cath Kidston. But then I blame her for most everyday horror. And the retro nature of the bunting seen these days tells us a lot about where we are going. Sure there is ironic bunting and there is art bunting but bunt-central remains the Bake Off tent, the dreamspace of unperturbed Englishness. Inclusive and yet reassuring. Everything is lovely in the tent. No one pisses outside it or would even want to surely? This is why when one of its stars, the grizzled biscuit pastry judge Paul Hollywood, does something as symbolically wrong as to be pictured wearing a Nazi uniform, the reaction is general hilarity. The photograph of Hollywood dressed as an SS officer wearing a swastika armband has only just surfaced but was taken 14 years ago when he went to a fancy dress party as a character based on the TV series ‘Allo ‘Allo!. He has now said that he is “absolutely devastated if this caused offence to anyone”. Here’s a tip: if you are not sure, best not dress as a Nazi. Prince Harry made the same mistake at 20 when he attended a “colonials and natives” party. As you do. I have only ever seen actual Nazi uniforms when I was in Chile in the early 80s. This was during Pinochet’s time and the fact that people proudly kept them at home chilled me to the bone. Most people forgave Harry and they will forgive Hollywood for just being stupid. But something else is going on at the moment, isn’t it? There is this desperate performance of an uncertain British identity: cakes, bunting, second world war larks. We are uncertain whether it is OK to make jokes about Nazi symbols, yet we are also being told that not to wave a union jack is unpatriotic. To wave an EU flag at the Proms is to be in denial about how people voted in the referendum. So says Farage, who understands symbols very well. He is very concerned about flags. He does not wear a Nazi uniform. Oh no. Instead he attends and speaks at rallies of the far-right AfD party in Berlin as the guest of the granddaughter of Hitler’s finance minister. When he was at school (Dulwich College) one of his teachers wrote to his head as she was so concerned with reports of his “publicly professed racist and fascist views”. Farage’s Breaking Point poster showing a long queue of migrants and refugees trying to get into the EU which appeared during the Brexit campaign was denounced by the former Belgian prime minister as “Nazi propaganda”. Yet Farage professed surprise when he saw white supremacists marching in Charlottesville last month: “Cannot believe we’re seeing Nazi salutes in 21st century America” he tweeted. Really? Here we come to the link between symbols and action. The domestication of far-right politics and its embrace by a Tory party with no discernible moral compass means that a battle about identity is being carried out via symbols. The right needs to recast the war as isolated-but-clever-little Britain against the rest of the world. History is rewritten as Farage poses gormlessly by a poster for Dunkirk. Paul Hollywood may have thought it was ‘Allo ‘Allo! funny when he donned his smart casual SS officer look, but the image does not sit well with the deliberately constructed Britishness of the Bake Off tent, even if shrugged off as a mistake. The German politician Beatrix von Storch who invited Farage to come and speak in Berlin has asked for border guards to use firearms on illegal immigrants “if necessary”. But she later claimed this was “a mistake” but a senior member of her party has described Berlin’s holocaust memorial as a “monument of shame”. So the issue is not one of who waves a flag and who doesn’t. It is not one even of people who dress up as Nazis for fun, or accidentally. It is one of giving a platform to those who cavort with the offspring of Nazis while claiming to be patriots. No amount of flag-waving can conceal this rot. • Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/shortcuts/2017/sep/11/mark-hamill-luke-skywalker-wolves-fan","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T13:00:06Z","webTitle":"Star Wars' Mark Hamill – not the Wolves fan you were looking for","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2017/sep/11/mark-hamill-luke-skywalker-wolves-fan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/shortcuts/2017/sep/11/mark-hamill-luke-skywalker-wolves-fan","fields":{"headline":"Star Wars' Mark Hamill – not the Wolves fan you were looking for","bodyText":"Name: Mark Hamill. Age: 65. Appearance: A little short for a stormtrooper. Mark Hamill? Now that’s a name I’ve not heard in a long time … a long time. What do you mean? He’s the actor who played Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars movies. He returned for The Force Awakens two years ago, and will star in The Last Jedi in December. He’s had lots of attention. It was a Star Wars quote, dummy. Sorry. It’s hard to keep up with pop culture references sometimes. Indeed, Hamill himself has had that trouble. Now he’s been forced to become a fan of Wolverhampton Wanderers. No! That’s not true! That’s impossible! It’s perfectly true. Hamill is an enthusiastic user of Twitter, where he has nearly 2m followers, and spends his days “liking” their various Star Wars quips and messages of support. So far he has pressed “like” approximately 136,000 times. Cripes. He must work quickly. Yes. He just seems like a friendly guy, happy to share the love. Anyway, during one Twitter binge last week, he was asked whether he was a Wolves fan and liked the tweet. Where did it go? Bring it back. Play back the entire message. I can’t, I’m afraid. The original seems lost among thousands of others. But other Wolves fans noticed and sent him supportive comments, eager to check if he was a secret fan. And is he? “I am now,” Hamill replied. “Never heard of them until 2 days ago. All because I ‘liked’ a tweet from a #Wolves fan &amp; they made me feel like family. Very nice!” The next day he admitted that he thought he’d been asked if he was a fan of wolves, the animals. Oh dear. Still, it looks like he made a good choice. Wolves beat Milwall 1-0 at the weekend, and have made a fine start to this season in the Championship, where they are currently third. Promotion to the Premier League could be just months away!

It became a guessing game. Surely Rick Astley wasn’t billed on merit, alongside local heroes Noel Gallagher, Blossoms and the Courteeners? Kay must be planning to duet with him, we decided, perhaps as Geraldine from Britain’s Got the Pop Factor. And yet Never Gonna Give You Up came and went, and there was still no sign of the Bolton comedian. It wasn’t until just before Gallagher’s closing set that Kay finally came on stage, wearing the yellow fleece of an Arena worker. I assumed he was in character. He wasn’t. He told the 14,000-strong crowd he had worked there for four years from its opening day, on 15 July 1995. He’d seen a lot of happiness in this hall, he said, both as a worker and a comic: “We can’t let terrorists win.” He went on: “We’ve got to remember the good times and let them outweigh the bad. The victims will never, ever been forgotten. But we have got to move forward with love, not hate, and that’s how we win.” Comedians getting all serious can sometimes grate. I want to see Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge, not agitating for the Labour party. But there was something rather lovely about Kay getting up on stage with no script and no jokes, talking from the heart and telling the terrorists to “do one”, as we say in Manchester. The only uncomfortable bit of the night was its title: We Are Manchester. I looked around the Arena and saw almost exclusively white faces. You could blame it on the guitar bands, to whose charms the BAME community has largely remained immune. But high up on the bill was Bugzy Malone, a young black grime artist who raps about Manchester’s 0161 dial code, despite almost certainly never using a landline. Thirty-three per cent of the local population is not white. Where were they? The Brexit club Also in Manchester this weekend, 51 strangers gathered to talk about what they wanted from Brexit. Dubbed the Citizens Assembly, the participants had been chosen to accurately reflect the UK population and how the nation voted in the EU referendum. The group comprised three non-voters, 25 leavers and 23 remainers. None had applied to be there: the organisers needed to weed out people with a special interest in politics. The most interesting speaker was David Coleman, emeritus professor of demography at Oxford University. Migration alone cannot realistically keep us with the level of public services and pensions to which we are accustomed, he argued. His most compelling statistic was that to keep the balance between the people of nominal working age (16-64) and those aged 65+, the population would have to rise to 300 million by 2100. There is technically space in the UK for an extra 135 million people, he said, claiming you could actually fit the population of the Earth on the Isle of Wight, if no one wanted to sit or lie down. But the focus should instead be on improving productivity to increase wages, he said. The assembly gathers again in three weeks, when it will vote for the sort of Brexit it wants. I hope the politicians listen. Pride of the Peaks Driving through the Peak District on Saturday morning, in horrendous weather, I passed a surprising number of cyclists tackling the Brickworks, a famous local climb from the village of Pott Shrigley, near Macclesfield. At the bottom, I discovered why: the Manchester Wheelers were holding their annual hill climb. Never mind that half the road had turned into a waterfall. Their determination was outdone only by a father and son who had decided to “everest” the hill: going up and down it 60 times until they had ascended all 8,848 metres of Mount Everest’s height. They raised nearly £4,000 for 42nd Street, a young people’s mental health charity. A soggy chapeau to them both. • Helen Pidd is the Guardian’s north of England editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/17/yusuf-cat-stevens-the-laughing-apple-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T07:00:34Z","webTitle":"Yusuf/Cat Stevens: The Laughing Apple review – a late-career highlight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/17/yusuf-cat-stevens-the-laughing-apple-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/17/yusuf-cat-stevens-the-laughing-apple-review","fields":{"headline":"Yusuf/Cat Stevens: The Laughing Apple review – a late-career highlight","bodyText":"Yusuf marks the 50th anniversary of his first two albums, both released in 1967, by reinterpreting some of his songs from the era, including four from New Masters and others never released at the time.

Here’s how not to feel like an impostor at uni\r\n","bodyText":"With freshers’ season fast approaching, if you’re from a minority background, you can expect some of the following delights in your first term: “You’re like black and gay? No wonder they let you in – couldn’t let that box-ticking opportunity go to waste”; “I’m not racist, I just don’t like brown girls – it’s the same as having a preference for blondes”; “you get a full bursary/maintenance loan? That is SO unfair. My parents don’t get help with anything and we’re really poor … Yes, we do have a house in France but all our cash is tied up in assets.” Being at university can be isolating if you’re from a minority background. While middle-class peers don beanie hats and coopt mockney accents, your real working-class mannerisms will likely just single you out for abuse. During my own freshers’ week, people assumed that I must have got in with concessions because I spoke using slang – as if I was writing “bruv” in my essays about Kant – while brushing it all off as “banter” – that ceaselessly posh word that is somehow considered not to be slang. This downplaying of privilege for social kudos can feel particularly horrible when the perpetrator denies having gained any benefit from their own background, while mocking you for yours. In Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Americanah, she references the experience of not knowing that you’re black until you go to a white country. University represents the equivalent for working-class students, who likely enjoyed the real social mix of studying at a state comp, only to find themselves in a place where – despite only 7% of the country attending private school – they’re suddenly alongside a disproportionately privately educated class. Here are a few tips to get through those difficult early days and weeks. First, know your own worth. In a world where everyone else seems so much more “articulate” (read, posh), confident and at ease, it’s normal to feel inferior. Perhaps your peers have read more, debated publicly and have learned the gift of the gab (in other words, haven’t done the work but know how to conceal it). It’s easy to feel like you are, indeed, the diversity hire. Poring over books in the library you’ll sit in fear waiting for someone to come in and tell you the game is up and it’s time to go home. The sooner you shake off this so-called impostor syndrome, the better. If universities were so keen on accepting people from “diverse” backgrounds at the expense of their white counterparts, then universities wouldn’t be so overwhelmingly white and middle class. The number of those from free-school-meal backgrounds at university is even lower, with people from working-class backgrounds dropping out at an alarming rate. Chances are, you got there despite your background, not because of it. Second, don’t feel you have to be Unelected Minority Representative for the whole time you’re at university. Allow yourself personal preservation if you need it, if not for your own sanity then – and I know this is controversial – to satisfy your peers; don’t feel you have to pick them up on every tiny thing. It is not fair that some students have to placate ignorant or offensive views at university and it can be a real chore; it is unfair to hold a victim to account for not standing up to every instance of racial, class or other form of abuse when the same isn’t required of others. This is something that is simply not asked of middle-class, white peers who make up the majority, and therefore have the added benefit of hiding in plain sight. Afford yourself that refuge, too, if you need to. Third, don’t feel guilty about whatever leg-ups peers might suggest your background has given you. The chances are, they aren’t wondering whether their costly private education and array of expensive extracurricular activities are really the reason they got in, because in deeply unequal societies people tend to justify their privilege with the belief that those who are less well-off made worse choices, rather than consider that they have unfairly benefited from privilege. My final piece of advice to those approaching freshers’ from a minority background is to get used to it: it will prepare you for the outside world. Life in the UK is still, sadly, a place where those from our backgrounds are too often asked to conceal or downplay our roots to get ahead. Signifiers of class are commonly used to lock working-class people out of job opportunities, and being from a black or minority ethnic group as well is a double disadvantage. Whatever field you go into, the experience of learning how to gracefully ignore unfair treatment will be beneficial, I promise. The truth is, university is just the beginning – start learning now. • Poppy Noor is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2017/sep/11/child-soldier-recruits-double-in-one-year-in-middle-east-and-north-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T17:11:09Z","webTitle":"Child soldier recruits double in one year in Middle East and North Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/11/child-soldier-recruits-double-in-one-year-in-middle-east-and-north-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/sep/11/child-soldier-recruits-double-in-one-year-in-middle-east-and-north-africa","fields":{"headline":"Child soldier recruits double in one year in Middle East and North Africa","bodyText":"The number of children recruited to fight in conflicts across the Middle East and North Africa has more than doubled in a year, UN analysis has found. The huge increase in child soldiers in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and other countries follows years of ongoing violence, displacement and a lack of basic services, which has reduced the coping mechanisms of families, according to Unicef. Almost one in five children across the region – 28 million in all – now need immediate humanitarian assistance. More than 90% of these children live in countries affected by conflict, and in some cases families are sending their children to fight. “With no end in sight to these conflicts and with families’ dwindling financial resources, many have no choice but to send their children to work or marry their daughters early,” said Geert Cappelaere, Unicef’s regional director. “The number of children affiliated with the fighting has more than doubled.” The agency said in the past it had witnessed children working as porters, guards or paramedics, but it was now seeing them take on more active roles, carrying guns, manning checkpoints and being trained as paid soldiers. The number of children actively recruited into fighting rose from 576 in 2014 to 1,168 in 2015, according to verified UN figures. The situation in Yemen was particularly grave, with a fivefold increase in children recruited into armed conflict in 2015 compared with the previous year. Such numbers were likely to be an underestimate, Unicef said. Children were also being recruited as soldiers in Sudan and Libya. Years of ongoing violence, displacement and a lack of basic services have hit children hardest and threaten to reverse child development gains, said Unicef. “Conflict continues to rob millions of girls and boys of their childhood,” Cappelaere said. “Decades of progress are at a risk of being reversed across the Middle East and North Africa.” Civilian infrastructure – including hospitals and energy, water and sanitation facilities – has come under attack in countries including Yemen, Syria and Iraq. Millions of families have been forced to flee their homes, some of them repeatedly, and under fire, the agency said. Last week, the UN reported that 1,700 children, some as young as 10, had been recruited to fight in the three-year conflict in Yemen. The deteriorating situation in the country is now the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, with almost 18.8 million people in need of aid and 7 million on the brink of famine. More than half of the country’s health facilities are out of service, water facilities have been destroyed and more than 15 million children are in need of water and sanitation facilities. The country is in the grip of the world’s worst cholera outbreak, with more than 610,000 suspected cases to date. More than 2,000 people have died from the highly contagious but curable bacterial infection since April this year, with thousands of new cases every day. Inside Syria and in countries hosting refugees, such as Lebanon and Jordan, about 12 million Syrian children require humanitarian assistance, Unicef found. An estimated two million children live in hard to reach or besieged areas in Syria, which have received limited humanitarian assistance over the years. In Iraq, more than 5 million children are in need of assistance as heavy fighting intensified, recently in Tel Afar and in Mosul. They need food, shelter and education. In the Gaza strip, an ongoing electricity crisis has reduced access to water by 30%. Cases of diarrhoea in children have doubled in three months, the UN agency said. “Children in the Middle East and North Africa region have undergone unprecedented levels of violence and witnessed horrors that no one should witness. If violence and wars continue, the consequences – not only for the region but for the world as a whole – will be dire. World leaders must do much more to put an end to violence for the sake of boys and girls and their future,” said Cappelaere. Last week, Unicef figures showed how war was affecting children’s chances in education. Conflicts in Iraq and Syria had resulted in an additional 3.4 million missing out on their schooling, bringing the number of out-of-school children across the Middle East and North Africa back to 2007’s level of about 16 million."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/sep/13/life-in-the-old-bird-yet-study-of-dodo-bones-yields-new-biological-insights","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"Life in the old bird yet: study of dodo bones yields new biological insights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/13/life-in-the-old-bird-yet-study-of-dodo-bones-yields-new-biological-insights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/sep/13/life-in-the-old-bird-yet-study-of-dodo-bones-yields-new-biological-insights","fields":{"headline":"Life in the old bird yet: study of dodo bones yields new biological insights","bodyText":"“So rapid and complete was their extinction, that the vague descriptions given of them by early travelers were long regarded as fabulous or exaggerated, and these birds, almost contemporaries of our great-grandfathers, became associated in the minds of many persons with the Griffin and the Phoenix of mythological antiquity.” Hugh Strickland, 1848, in Strickland &amp; Melville’s The dodo and its kindred. Despite being one of the most iconic animals in the world, we know very little about the dodo. A quick count on my bookshelf comes up with over 1400 pages of published works on the dodo (and these are only the main scientific works*), yet many aspects of the bird’s basic biology remain unknown. We have a general idea where it came from and how it is related to other pigeons (Shapiro et al., 2002), some notion about what it looked like, and a few observations about its behaviour and feeding habits. Most of this information, however, comes from early traveller accounts and drawings, and they are often contradictory and clouded by inconsistencies. And unless we can go back in time and do a full dodo assessment, many aspects of the dodo’s life history will forever remain unknown. Some will argue that the break-neck speed at which ancient DNA techniques are developing would enable us to bring the dodo back from extinction. Although I’m the first to admit that to look a living, breathing dodo in the eye would be immensely thrilling, a resurrected dodo would be, at best, a dodo-pigeon hybrid which would spend its days far removed from its natural habitat, as the original ecosystem on Mauritius is gone. Anyway, in the absence of time travel and de-extinctioned dodos, all that we are left with are bones (and some pieces of dried skin). Glorious bones! In the age of increasing molecularisation of palaeontology (and archaeology), it is easy to think that those dry, dusty bones have nothing left to offer. But for those who know how and where to look, bones continue to reveal glimpses into worlds far, far away. A team of scientists led by Delphine Angst at the University of Cape Town in South Africa took a sample of bones from the Mare aux Songes dodo mass grave and cut them up into very thin slices. When viewed under a microscope, these thin slices show the basic structure of the bone in great detail and give clues regarding the processes and life events that shaped dodo bones. Similar to modern birds, the walls of dodo limb bones are made up of three layers of bone. The central scaffolding layer (fibrolamellar bone) is formed relatively quickly during growth, whereas the outer and inner layers (the outer and inner circumferential layers) are formed more slowly. These layers vary in thickness and structure depending on the age of the animal, and allowed the researchers to distinguish between juvenile, young adults and more mature dodos. Two specimens show a distinctive bone tissue that extends into the central cavity of the bone. This bone tissue likely represents medullary bone, a special bone tissue that forms in egg-laying species and serves as a calcium reservoir for building the hard eggshell. These two specimens thus represent female dodos that died during the breeding period. A number of the adult dodo bones showed significant cavities in the bone wall. Such cavities occur when bone tissue is being broken down and its elements reabsorbed into the bloodstream to be used in other purposes. Such reabsorption of bone tissue occurs during moulting when the replacement of feathers increases the demand for calcium. During moulting, birds can look distinctly different from their normal appearance, and this may account for the variation of dodo plumage recorded in historical accounts. The wing feathers have been variously described as black, yellow to whitish yellow, and pale grey to pale brown, whereas the tail feathers may have been greyish, yellowish or yellowish brown plumes. In some sketches, the dodo lacks any tail feathers all together. In some of the young adult and adult specimens, distinct thin lines are visible in the fibrolamellar and outer circumferential layers. These lines are referred to as Lines of Arrested Growth (LAGs) and indicate points in time when bone growth stopped temporarily, and resumed again after some point, and are thought to be caused by severe environmental stress, such as lack of food. The Mascarene Islands are prone to cyclone activity during the austral summer (November-March). The native forest has a canopy of interlaced branches and buttressed stems to support trees. For animals, cyclone season would have resulted in marked shortages of food. Angst and colleagues thus argue that the LAGs visible in the dodo bones formed as a result of food shortages during the cyclone season between November and March. Given that LAGs would have formed annually, the bone formed between two LAGs reflects a year. In the two female dodo bones with medullary bone, a significant layer of bone, almost 50% of that between previous LAGs, had formed after the last LAG. This suggests that the breeding period occurred approximately six months after the cyclone season, around August. Dodo chicks then grew rapidly to reach a large enough size to withstand the next cyclone season. When Angst and colleagues looked at the bones showing evidence of bone reabsorption (evidence of moulting), the amount of new bone deposited after the last LAG was relatively thin, indicating that moulting took place not too long after the austral summer and before the next breeding season. This fits with historical observations of dodo’s with downy feathers and some feathers in the wings that were done in June and July. More importantly, a moulting period after the cyclone season and before the breeding period is in line with breeding and molting periods for all modern native birds on Mauritius. This new research continues to show our shifting perception of the dodo from an unfortunate bird destined for extinction, to a resilient bird adapted to its less-than-idyllic island life.

In a previously unreported deposition from 17 August, Mugabe countered the version of the incident given by Gabriella Engels to police and media. According to Mugabe, she was protecting herself after intervening on behalf of her adult sons, Chatunga and Robert Jr, who were “in trouble with a drunken young woman”. The statement said Mugabe, 52, was considering seeking attempted murder charges. Engels alleges an irate Mugabe burst into the room in a luxury hotel where she was waiting with two friends to meet Chatunga Mugabe on 13 August and started beating her with an electric cable. Photographs taken soon after the incident showed a gash to Engels’ forehead and head. The incident reinforced Mugabe’s reputation for angry outbursts and focused attention on the lifestyle of Mugabe’s two sons, who live in the upscale Sandton area of the South African commercial capital. South African media alleged this week that the two students had been handed a $60,000 bill for damages following their eviction from a penthouse apartment in Sandton after a brawl in July. Mugabe is a contender to replace her ailing 93-year-old husband, in power for 37 years, as Zimbabwe’s president. The alleged assault played badly at home in Zimbabwe, where it was picked up in detail by the media, which also reported on the first lady’s multimillion-dollar property portfolio in Johannesburg and the alleged extravagance of her two sons. In her deposition, Mugabe dismissed Engels’ version as “malicious allegations” and said she had been attacked after going to help her sons. “She was worried about them and went to see them at their hotel suite,” the statement said. “Upon her arrival, Ms Engels, who was intoxicated and unhinged, attacked Dr Grace Mugabe with a knife after she was asked to leave the hotel …Security was left with no other option but to remove Ms Engels from the hotel suite.” The statement also alleged that Engels had been in a fight with other women at Johannesburg’s Taboo nightclub the previous evening and suggested that may have been the cause of her injuries. Afriforum, a civil society group acting on behalf of Engels, denied both accusations, and accused Mugabe of “desperately trying to escape responsibility for her own violent behaviour by using lies to falsely portray the victim in this case as the perpetrator”. “Gabriella never attacked Grace Mugabe in any way and she did not participate in the fight at Taboo,” Afriforum told Reuters news agency. South Africa controversially granted Mugabe diplomatic immunity, allowing her to evade immediate prosecution for assault. Engels and Afriforum have challenged the legal basis of that decision, saying Mugabe was in South Africa not on official business but to seek medical treatment. The decision to let Mugabe return home caused a row in South Africa, with the opposition Democratic Alliance also going to court to try to overturn the immunity. Mugabe’s main rival in the race to succeed her ailing husband is the vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, a veteran party official. Mnangagwa, 74, is the preferred choice of most western diplomats, has some public support and is thought to have the backing of the military. Mugabe is a more flamboyant figure, once known for her lavish shopping trips, which angered many in the impoverished country. Recently she has become more involved in politics as the head of the Zanu-PF women’s wing, and has publicly called on her husband to name a successor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/11/amsterdam-to-increase-tourist-tax-to-reclaim-city-for-residents","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T13:29:28Z","webTitle":"Amsterdam to increase tourist tax to reclaim city for residents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/amsterdam-to-increase-tourist-tax-to-reclaim-city-for-residents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/11/amsterdam-to-increase-tourist-tax-to-reclaim-city-for-residents","fields":{"headline":"Amsterdam to increase tourist tax to reclaim city for residents","bodyText":"Amsterdam is planning to increase taxes on tourists by as much as €10 a night, as the authorities attempt to limit stag weekends and visitors to the red-light district and reclaim the city for residents. About 17 million people visited the city of 850,000 residents in 2016, up from 12 million five years earlier, and the trend is expected to accelerate. More than a quarter of visitors stayed in budget hotels, the local council says, bringing limited cash into the municipal coffers but helping to encourage a trend towards the city centre being dominated by tourist accommodation. Last week, protesters carrying banners and megaphones took to the city’s streets chanting, “Amsterdam, not for sale!” and “Whose city? Our city!”, in the latest show of frustration among residents at the changing face of their town. Following a number of measures in recent years to respond to residents’ concerns, including a moratorium on hotel developments and a campaign to encourage tourists to go beyond the city centre, a radical tax plan is now in the making. Tourists pay 5% of the cost of their room in the city centre, with that rate due to increase to 6% in 2018. The city councillor responsible for finance, Udo Kock, has said he is looking at a new formula to squeeze out low-spending tourists and in favour of the heavier spenders. “We need more people who actually spend money in the city,” Kock told the Dutch newspaper Het Parool. “We would prefer people who stay a couple of nights, visit museums, have lavish meals at restaurants, to people who pop over for a weekend eating falafel while sauntering around the red-light district.” The council is considering introducing a split-fee system – with visitors paying a fixed amount per night of as much as €10 plus a percentage of the hotel bill. Such a tax would add significantly to the costof a budget trip to the city. Kock said: “The number of visitors will grow from 17 million to 23 million in the coming years and that means more cleaning and a greater police presence in the streets. And I want Amsterdammers to profit from the success of the city.” Residents have become increasingly vociferous in recent years, complaining they are being forced out by spiralling house prices and an influx of tourists. Local politicians have claimed the city is at risk of becoming “the Venice of the north”. This year, the chief executive of Amsterdam Marketing, Frans Van der Avert, claimed European “cities are dying from tourism” and that people would no longer live in the historic centres. The mayor of Amsterdam, Eberhard van der Laan, received a letter from local companies and residents urging him to stop the city’s “Disneyfication”. Rick Aalders, 28, the manager at Hotel Aalders on the edge of the city centre, said he did not believe the tax plan would change the city for the better. “The taxes are already high for tourists”, he said. “Are people really going to stop coming because of a rise in taxes? I don’t think so. We have growth in numbers of 7% to 8% every month. I think the tax rise is about making money... But it is true that everyone is moving out. On our street, a house will cost €700,000 and most people can’t get a mortgage for that, so everyone is moving to other cities.” Last year, the city of Amsterdam attempted to reassure its critics that it was sensitive to the changing face of the city by striking a deal with the property-sharing website Airbnb. The company agreed that apartments rented out for 60 days would be removed from the site for the rest of the year. The website also agreed to install a “neighbour tool” through which other residents can complain about noisy or aggressive tenants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/08/sports-direct-pays-out-43m-bonus-among-2000-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T18:21:35Z","webTitle":"Sports Direct pays out £43m bonus among 2,000 staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/08/sports-direct-pays-out-43m-bonus-among-2000-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/08/sports-direct-pays-out-43m-bonus-among-2000-staff","fields":{"headline":"Sports Direct pays out £43m bonus among 2,000 staff","bodyText":"Sports Direct has handed £43m in share bonuses to a group of nearly 2,000 permanent staff who took part in an incentive scheme launched in 2011. Mike Ashley, the majority shareholder and chief executive of the retail group, praised the “magnificent achievements and fantastic loyalty” of workers who were helping the company move towards becoming the “Selfridges of sport”. Ashley said: “The people at Sports Direct deserve every penny of these bonuses.” The company revealed the payout in a stock exchange announcement, which came days after chairman Keith Hellawell narrowly escaped being voted out by independent shareholders partly in response to poor treatment of workers under his stewardship. Only just over 53% of independent investors backed his re-election on Wednesday as Hellawell defended Sports Direct’s use of zero-hours contracts and said there was no need for an independent review of its working practices. The retailer’s board pledged to tackle both issues a year ago. A spokesman for Sports Direct said: “It our policy to treat all people at Sports Direct with dignity and respect and we will continue to make a positive difference.” However, the generous share bonus scheme, which paid out this week, has also proved controversial as only a tiny proportion of the 29,000 people who work for Sports Direct are able to participate. Applications for the scheme are limited to those directly employed on full contracts. Those on zero-hours contracts, including the vast majority of store staff, and those employed via agencies, as are most of those who work in Sports Direct’s Derbyshire warehouse at Shirebrook, cannot take part in the scheme. Sports Direct does not have a current share bonus plan for staff after a planned scheme missed its targets. The retailer said last year it would not be paying a bonus under a scheme set to mature in 2019 after underlying profits missed the company’s target of £420m. The bonus plan would have paid out £200m in shares to 3,000 permanent staff if earnings doubled by 2019. The company said it is developing a replacement scheme. Sports Direct said it expects to pay other awards and incentives this year of about £19m, from which both permanent and casual staff can benefit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/sep/13/daca-dramas-immigration-tv-us","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T13:57:51Z","webTitle":"'Daca dramas': how immigration became US TV's new obsession","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/sep/13/daca-dramas-immigration-tv-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/sep/13/daca-dramas-immigration-tv-us","fields":{"headline":"'Daca dramas': how immigration became US TV's new obsession","bodyText":"Television ripped from the headlines doesn’t usually fare too well. When Homeland delved in, there was an embarrassing moment involving Arabic graffiti, while Scandal’s treatment of real-life events was so ham-fisted that other show’s parodies made it look tame. The latest TV trend involves the idea of real life directly informing TV, but takes things up a notch by centering it around one of the most divisive subjects in US politics: immigration. In the past two weeks, three new projects have found homes at major US channels, and they follow half a dozen more which were given the green light in the past 12 months. Last October, it was confirmed that the memoir of the Orange is the New Black actor Diane Guerrero would be made into a series. The show Casa, meanwhile, will focus on a group of siblings whose parents are deported – a situation that Guerrero really experienced when her parents were sent to Colombia. The network leading the way is the CW, best known for Gossip Girl and Gilmore Girls. More recently, though, the channel’s crown jewel has become Jane the Virgin, the telenovela remake starring Gina Rodriguez. And it’s Rodriguez who is executive-producing the Daca drama Illegal, which follows a student who finds out he is undocumented, for the channel. (Casa will also be on the CW, while Rodriguez is bringing Have Mercy – a remake of the German immigration drama Dr Illegal – to CBS.) For Rodriguez, this is a chance for more stories involving Latinos to be seen and heard. “When we talk about inclusivity, there are a lot of communities that aren’t being discussed,” she recently told the Los Angeles Times. “And the Latino community, we have waves of Latinos doing projects – but do they get exposure?” Immigration dramas have proved to be a good way for under-represented communities in the US to have their stories on the small screen. Fresh Off the Boat was adapted from the memoir of the “food personality” Eddie Huang, who detailed his life growing up in America after moving from Taiwan. That show has balanced ideas of assimilation with the pressure of new and old cultural norms colliding (Huang’s love of hip-hop perplexes his parents) and pulled off something enlightening, but above all funny. Most of these new shows have a comedic element: Illegal is described as “an edgy Latino version of The Wonder Years”, while another new show, Welcome to Maine, is set to find the funny as a Syrian refugee enters a rural community. But such sensitive subject matter can easily leave networks in trouble. A comedy called Mail Order Family, which focused on the travails of a young woman from the Philippines, was recently cancelled after an outcry. Dissecting rather than reinforcing stereotypes seems to be a prerequisite to making these shows a success. Rafael Agustin, who is working with Rodriguez on Illegal and was undocumented himself, also spoke with the LA Times about why these shows need to be made. “It’s important to understand the complexities of immigration. When people see a face to these issues, it’s different. It doesn’t become villainizing. We’re not fake, shadow people taking jobs.” With creators who are immigrants themselves telling real stories, the next wave of immigration could be coming from the TV."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/10/sam-vesty-england-argentina-tour-focus-on-worcester","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Sam Vesty happy to focus on Worcester despite summer success with England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/10/sam-vesty-england-argentina-tour-focus-on-worcester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/10/sam-vesty-england-argentina-tour-focus-on-worcester","fields":{"headline":"Sam Vesty happy to focus on Worcester despite summer success with England","bodyText":"Sam Vesty would be forgiven for counting down the days to England’s next tour of Argentina. As a player he won his only two caps there in 2009 and over the summer he was seconded as England’s skills coach for the two-Test tour against the Pumas. Considering the impact he had on England’s attack, however, he may not have to wait another eight years to sample the international arena again. At first Vesty’s temporary summer role came as a surprise, though having been a wicketkeeper-batsman for Leicestershire’s second XI before his rugby career took off with the Tigers, and considering Eddie Jones’s passion for cricket, there was obvious common ground. “It was out of the blue,” says Vesty. “Eddie had an opening, the opportunity arose, I discussed it and it was a great opportunity for me to learn in a different environment. We did talk about cricket quite a bit. Glen Ella was out there as well [as attack coach], Glen loves his cricket, too. Eddie is of the opinion that Australia are a bit better than things would suggest.” But to suggest Vesty was chosen to replace Rory Teague at short notice purely because of his ability to debate the winter Ashes series does him a disservice. For the 35-year-old possesses one of the keenest young coaching minds in the country. A former Leicester and Bath utility back, Vesty has been cutting his coaching teeth at Worcester since 2013 and has graduated to backs coach. And after impressing Jones in an interview Vesty was packing his bags for South America. “Having Eddie and Glen to bounce ideas off and come up with ways of doing things was excellent. It was a world-class environment and an opportunity to take as much as I possibly could and hopefully add a little bit as well.” Evidence that Vesty did indeed “add a little bit” is in rich supply. The first Test was a helter-skelter 38-34 victory, the second an only slightly less madcap 35-25 triumph. The most memorable moment was perhaps Denny Solomona’s last-gasp try in the first Test but Henry Slade’s show and go and then inch-perfect grubber for Jonny May was not far behind and, truth be told, England played with verve and swagger all tour. The key, according to Vesty, was to encourage England’s youngsters to express themselves. “The young lads go out there and play rugby. They’re not hampered by past issues of playing too much,” says Vesty. “They don’t overthink it, they go out there and back themselves. With that comes people playing really positive rugby and, if we can keep that in our rugby players, all the better. “I was wrapped up in it. Really all-consumed by it. It’s a part of coaching that I absolutely love. Watching young guys who are just hungry for anything they can get. They leave everything out there for every single training session. And on the pitch as well. It’s just really rewarding for those guys. They were a really great bunch.” On announcing the addition of Vesty to his staff, less than two weeks before the first Argentina Test, Jones said: “He interviewed very well. He is a Leicester boy, played a lot of club rugby, played for England. They usually make good coaches.” It should not come as a surprise that Vesty impressed in the interview. Coaching has long since been at the forefront of his mind. He contributes to a coaching website and has written books on the subject. He still considers himself in the early stages of his development, however, and for now Worcester is his main focus. “I’d love to get an opportunity to do some more [internationally],” he adds. “I’m committed to Worcester [but] I’d love to give it a crack sometime in the future. I’m a young coach and I need to learn my trade.” On Sunday Vesty pits his wits against the Premiership’s sharpest attack in Wasps. Worcester were resoundingly beaten at Newcastle on the opening weekend and have a tough run of fixtures ahead. Should they suffer defeat on Sunday then a relegation fight will loom. “We were poor last week but we know we’re much better than that,” says Vesty. “There wasn’t a lack of effort, we just need to play better but we know we’ve got it in ourselves. We’ve got a good group and we’re confident with the players we’re taking to the field with.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/08/arsenal-bournemouth-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T16:47:21Z","webTitle":"Arsenal v Bournemouth: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/08/arsenal-bournemouth-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/08/arsenal-bournemouth-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal v Bournemouth: match preview","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger says “every defeat is a crisis” and it certainly feels that way for him, as he chugs his way towards a 21st anniversary at Arsenal.

Lord’s, the scene of his first victim back in 2003 against Zimbabwe, rose to a standing ovation for Anderson as he celebrated crashing the middle stump of West Indies’ opener Kraigg Brathwaite with a beauty that nipped down the slope. With his family among them its significance hit home. Speaking after stumps on the second day, which the tourists closed on 93 for three in their second innings with a lead of 22, the 35-year-old said: “I felt a bit emotional because my family were in the crowd, my kids, my mum and dad and my missus. Knowing they were there made it special and sharing with guys I have played 100 Tests with was an amazing feeling.” Asked if this was more than he had ever felt on the field before, Anderson replied: “Probably, yeah. Normally it’s anger but today it was a bit more, not quite teary but emotional in that way. I don’t get like that when trying to focus on my job and it took me a bit by surprise.” Anderson, who had earlier put on 31 with Stuart Broad for the last wicket as England were bowled out for 194 in this low-scoring series decider, ended the day with 501 wickets thanks to a beautiful outswinger from around the wicket that trimmed the off bail of Kieron Powell. He said: “I think ideally I’d have got to the milestone on the first day (when he moved to 499) but Ben Stokes (six for 22) didn’t want me to. To get it out the way now, with a tight game to focus on, is a big help. We didn’t bowl as well as the first innings but we’re still in a good position.” Anderson experienced his more regular feeling on the cricket field when issued with two warnings by umpire Marais Erasmus for running on the pitch – one more and he will be withdrawn from the attack for the remainder of the innings – and expressed this verbally to the official before eventually switching to his less preferred Nursery End. He said: “I was talking him through my 500! But yes, I was getting frustrated. He mentioned it a couple of times early on and then warned me straight away in my second spell. I tried to chat it through. I’ll be doing everything I can to not run on the wicket now. I have laws to abide by but, with us batting last, it doesn’t make sense to do it deliberately.” This issue could not detract from Anderson’s earlier feat, however, and already the ball with which he became only the third seamer after Glenn McGrath (563) and Courtney Walsh (519) to reach the landmark has been stashed away after it was damaged on striking Brathwaite’s stumps. The Lancastrian referenced the hard times from 2005 to 2007 when injury and form made it a stop-start period early in his career as making him the player and person he is today while adding that his passion and love for the game is what has driven him to join the elite. Asked about now looking to pass McGrath to become the all-time leading wicket-taker among seam bowlers – the spinners Muttiah Muralitharan (800), Shane Warne (708) and Anil Kumble (619) sit above the great Australian – Anderson replied: “Milestones are nice but not what drive me to be as good as I can. “I want to help England win games of cricket. That’s my motivation and why I turn up every day and try to improve myself. I am loving playing cricket at the minute I am bowling well. I feel fit and strong and hopefully that can continue for a while yet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2017/sep/08/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T20:00:48Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/08/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/sep/08/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• In an article reporting from east of the Elbe river about the forthcoming German elections, an acknowledgement to the James Hawes book The Shortest History of Germany was lost in the editing process (Long after wall’s fall, elections highlight country’s deep divide, 2 September, page 22). • We said that the Forestry Commission looked after the Hafod estate in Wales (British boltholes, 2 September, page 14, Travel).

I’m Danish – and Brexit Britain wants me out","bodyText":"News of a leaked Home Office document on Britain’s EU immigration policy after Brexit caught me by surprise early on Tuesday morning. Before rushing off to work, I experienced the now all-too-familiar feeling of futile frustration and increasing disillusionment with a country that, while I was growing up in Denmark, I always admired and dreamed of living in. It is true. I am an EU migrant. It took me 25 years before I identified as one: my white, northern European appearance, easily pronounceable first name and generic English accent mean that for the most part I can move quietly through London unnoticed. I arrived in the UK in 2009 to study for an MA in literature, planning to settle in the country afterwards. I came with good intentions. However, I decided to launch my bid at a new life at the height of the recession, and subsequently struggled (as so many of my British fellow postgraduates did) to find a footing in the job market. I floated between low-paying jobs and little-to-no-paying positions in start-up companies, while telling myself that I wanted to stay and make it work. Eventually I gravitated towards another MA. This time I chose to study British history – partly for better job opportunities and partly to indulge my interest in the politics and culture of the place that I had now lived in for four years. After 2013, the recession finally seemed to be easing and I found work first as a researcher and subsequently as a copywriter. Then, in late June 2016, Brexit suddenly became a reality. As the shocking result morphed into “Brexit means Brexit” and “No deal is better than a bad deal”, the reality started to dawn on those of us helplessly caught in the crossfire. We were no longer welcome. Fellow migrants around me began to look for ways to become more British on paper, while others remained in a state of desperation, hoping that somehow a lasting future would still be possible in the country. What the leaked paper appears to suggest is that Brexit will see EU migrants treated as unwelcome, temporary visitors, hired to do a job for a set time before being asked to leave again. As a copywriter, I am not sure where this places me. I neither save jobs nor build bridges in my daily life, and I am fairly confident that despite paying in more in taxes than I take out, I will still be considered an undesirable immigrant. My passion for PG Wodehouse quips, Goon Show jokes and Britpop songs won’t be considered of any value. Nor will my knowledge about British history and politics be deemed relevant to the Home Office; they might send me a polite, passive-aggressive letter one fine post-Brexit day asking me to quietly leave the country. My girlfriend, a fellow EU migrant – who, as a senior medical student, must face the further injustice of relentless NHS cuts – might be judged to be a more valuable asset to benefit “existing residents”. However, she too could ultimately be denied a future in this country – forcing her out after five years would mean the loss of her skillset, too. It is the most vulnerable who will pay the price once the drawbridge to Europe is pulled up and the “keep calm and keep out” sign is put up. At a time when politicians can go from talking about the burden of a growing elderly population to decrying young and skilled immigrants for trying to settle in the country, with no understanding that the latter group could aid the former, it seems like us “outsiders” are simply used as a convenient scapegoat. We can only guess which of us will be the next to blame once the current government runs out of more socially acceptable targets. • Martin Andersen is from Denmark and has spent the last eight years living, studying and working in London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/08/building-work-delays-london-opening-of-us-smash-musical-hamilton","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T16:50:24Z","webTitle":"Hamilton's London premiere delayed – leaving ticket holders in limbo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/08/building-work-delays-london-opening-of-us-smash-musical-hamilton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/08/building-work-delays-london-opening-of-us-smash-musical-hamilton","fields":{"headline":"Hamilton's London premiere delayed – leaving ticket holders in limbo","bodyText":"The London opening of smash US stage musical Hamilton has been delayed by a fortnight, leaving thousands of ticket holders unsure when they will see the record-breaking show. Impresario Cameron Mackintosh blamed the delay on problems with building works at the Victoria Palace theatre as he announced that previews will begin on 6 December rather than 21 November. Some 16,000 ticket holders who had bought seats for the first two weeks of previews face a wait to discover when their tickets will be rescheduled. The show is in such demand that some tickets for the cancelled nights were on sale on the secondary market for more than £2,800 each before the announcement on Friday. The show was written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and uses hip-hop to tackle the unlikely subject of the life and times of the United States’ first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton. It won 11 Tony awards, including for best musical, the 2016 Pulitzer prize for drama and the 2016 Grammy award for best musical theatre album. Michelle Obama proclaimed it “the best art I have ever seen in my life”. Fans took to social media to voice frustration at the delay. Michelle, from Germany, said on Twitter: “It’s not like people booked flights and hotels.” Rachael said: “Not cool that my Hamilton tickets have been postponed until further notice cause the theatre isn’t ready.” The producers said: “A large number of seats were held in reserve to be released at the time the building was nearing completion which will allow affected patrons to be reseated early in the run with a minimum of inconvenience.” Asked if compensation would be paid for travel and hotel costs, a spokeswoman for Mackintosh told the Guardian: “Patrons will be contacted direct by Ticketmaster to discuss their own specific circumstances.” “We are extremely sorry to disappoint patrons who we know expended time, effort and valuable resources to purchase tickets for our first performances,” said producer Jeffrey Seller. “But they will be given immediate priority so that they can be reseated as early as possible.” Mackintosh described the refurbishment of the theatre as “thrilling and fraught”. “The time constraints to access the land around the theatre to enable the rebuild and getting the show open to the public by the end of this year have been equally tight, not helped by the theatre being built over the huge King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer, an active 200-year-old brick tunnel,” he said. “Added to the usual unhelpful problems that always happen when doing up old buildings, this has put pressure on the time needed to commission the entirely new services that have been installed at the theatre and obtain the necessary licences to reopen to the public. I am, of course, sorry to amend the performance schedule but undertaking a private rebuilding project on this scale in central London has no precedent.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/11/recruitment-agency-cordant-morphs-into-social-enterprise","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Recruitment agency Cordant morphs into social enterprise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/11/recruitment-agency-cordant-morphs-into-social-enterprise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/11/recruitment-agency-cordant-morphs-into-social-enterprise","fields":{"headline":"Recruitment agency Cordant morphs into social enterprise","bodyText":"One of the UK’s largest recruitment firms is to tear up its 60-year-old structure and become a “social enterprise” with a pay cap and profit-sharing plan, in a move the family who own the company hope will inspire others businesses to follow suit. Cordant, which sends 125,000 temporary staff every year to work for 5,000 clients such as Amazon and Tesco, will announce the radical overhaul this week. Its largest shareholder, Phillip Ullmann, whose father founded the Cordant Group in 1957, said he hoped to convince clients to follow suit by improving workers’ conditions, predicting a Brexit-related shortage of workers that would give low-paid staff more bargaining power. The new ethos, cemented by a change to the company’s articles of association, will include a fixed limit on its pay ratio, the gap between its highest- and lowest-paid employees. Top earners will not be able to take home more than 20 times the salary of its lowest-paid staff, some of whom earn the minimum wage, effectively meaning a salary cap of £400,000. There will also be a ceiling on dividends paid to its owners, several branches of the Ullmann family, who will not be able take more than £3m out of the business between them in any single year. Profit, above what is paid to shareholders, will be shared with the company’s 1,500 permanent staff, while company money will be channelled into projects that “address the needs of society”, Cordant said. It has yet to finalise its plans but this will include offering staff and IT systems to the NHS at cost rather than for profit, which it says will save the health service “millions of pounds”. Cordant also plans to plough cash into education initiatives to help teachers and improve workplace skills. As well as overhauling its own model, the company hopes in time to convince some of its clients to adopt similar measures, such as profit shares for the low-paid temporary staff they employ via Cordant. Ullmann, who lists his favourite film as Mission Impossible, said: “With Brexit there will be a shortage of minimum wage workers so there should be more power to the workers.” “Brexit will focus the mind,” he added. He came up with the plan after a discussion with the accountancy firm Deloitte and sought approval from fellow family members, who between them control the company. Ullmann, whose profile on the Cordant website describes him as “chief energiser”, said: “I was a traditional capitalist. I wanted to make more money and increase the size of the wealth. “Now I’ve found gold dust, that’s how it feels to me. It will give more satisfaction than just doing more of the same.” Ullmann said the company would share some its profits with its 1,500 permanent staff, a scheme reminiscent of John Lewis’s annual staff bonus scheme, and would encourage businesses that use its temporary staff to do the same. But he admitted he could not force clients such as Tesco and Amazon, which use Cordant workers in their warehouses, to come up with similar plans. “We’re not going to tell clients to put up wages or we won’t work for them,” he said. “If I decided what they pay, wages would be high. It’s a more subtle journey than that.” He said workers would also benefit from plans to give them more choice in where they work, rate temporary employers and sign up for extra shifts when they want them. But Cordant’s ambitions to cap its dividend and profits could be limited by its ability to produce them, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The Uxbridge-based company made a pre-tax loss of £9m last year, although it posted a profit of £3.9m in 2015, and it has not paid a dividend in either of the past two years. “I recognise the ladder we’re trying to climb but I’m not daunted by the challenges in the way,” said Ullmann. “We are all in. We’re not going to reverse.” Cordant also has some way to go to win the hearts and minds of its workers, according to posts on the jobs website Glassdoor, which carries reviews of hundreds of employers. Some 55 reviewers gave it an average of 2.4 out of 5, a relatively low score compared to other companies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/13/talent-show-london-fashion-week-designers-know-aw17-season-lfw","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T15:00:14Z","webTitle":"Talent show: the London fashion week designers to know this season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/13/talent-show-london-fashion-week-designers-know-aw17-season-lfw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/13/talent-show-london-fashion-week-designers-know-aw17-season-lfw","fields":{"headline":"Talent show: the London fashion week designers to know this season","bodyText":"It’s become increasingly hard for independent designers to succeed in the fashion business today, but the key is having a unique point of view – and endless grit and determination. Whether it’s textile maverick Matty Bovan’s magpie mixes of colour and pattern, Steven Tai’s offbeat sense of humour, or Supriya Lele’s fusion of British and Asian cultures, these are the next generation of designers shaping the way we are dressing The eclectic: Matty Bovan In many ways, Matty Bovan is your archetypal young designer. Wild prints? Tick. Shocking colour clashes? Tick. More makeup than an eighties New Romantic on a big night out? Tick, tick, tick. To pigeon-hole him as just another wacky fashion upstart, however, is to underestimate his enormous potential. Bovan, 27, is a rare thing – a designer who sees textiles with the finely honed eye of an abstract expressionist, from the great tradition of wonderfully original English eccentrics that includes Zandra Rhodes, Vivienne Westwood and Bodymap. His collection for AW17 includes a whole raft of techniques including crochet, machine knitting, screen printing, digital printing and felting. It’s the textile equivalent of sensory overload, but he does know when to stop. “I sometimes see it like I’m making an album and each track has its own personality so you have to approach them differently,” he says. Bovan’s career trajectory has been as wiggly as one of his knits. After completing his degree at Central Saint Martins – something he was only able to do with the help of various scholarships – he decided to move back home to his mum’s house in York where he set up a studio in the garage. It made economic sense and gave him the headspace to focus on a variety of projects including his ongoing work as a contributing fashion editor for Love magazine; a print collaboration for Marc Jacobs; and Girlness – a film for Barbie’s birthday on what it means to be a girl in 2017. Sketches and colour references at Matty Bovan’s York studio As a child, Bovan was encouraged in his creative vision by both his mother, Plum, and his grandmother who taught him to knit. He also took inspiration from the inventive way his mother decorated the house. “My favourite bedroom as a child was lilac with red net curtains and those wiggly mirrors, as well as disco ball-esque cushions – it was a very intense combination!” For the past two seasons mother and son have collaborated on the accessories – the earrings, charms and necklaces that finish off each look so perfectly. Matty Bovan’s autumn/winter 2017 collection Bovan’s multi-disciplinary approach and his flexibility make him a real talent to watch. While he’s already collaborated with his childhood partner in crime, Barbie, he says he would love to dress Bjork and Róisín Murphy. “Anyone who has a strength of character and knows their own style,” he says. Just like him. TB The geek: Steven Tai Steven Tai has a quirky sense of humour. He likes playing games like Resident Evil 7 and his favourite Netflix show is the off-the-wall comic strip Rick and Morty. For AW17, his collection was based around sleep, with great cocoon coats so you can wrap up in a duvet even when you are not in bed. It was called Sleep Now, Work Later because, he says, we never get as much sleep as we’d like to. The day we spoke, the 33-year-old was mainlining coffee having arrived in London at 5.30am on a flight from Macau, heading straight to a 10am seminar and then a briefing with his team at his Hackney Downs studio. The former Portuguese colony is where Tai was born. His mother still lives there and runs a factory where Tai produces his collections. His grandparents were also in the manufacturing business. “I wouldn’t have started my own label if it wasn’t for that,” he says. Details at Steven Tai’s Hackney studio Tai’s family moved to Macau from Shanghai but emigrated to Vancouver when he was nine. He went to business school in Vancouver but changed course when he enrolled for a fashion degree at Central Saint Martins in London. He graduated in 2011, and won the prestigious Chloe Prize at the Hyéres Fashion Festival the following year. Yohji Yamamoto was the judge. “I was petrified,” Tai says. “I got so anxious. I just didn’t know what to say to him! I could tell he has a really funny sense of humour. He makes jokes but people around him are too nervous to laugh. I was laughing on the inside.” Tai set up his own label in 2012 and now shows his collections in London and, for the past two seasons, in Shanghai. Although he says China is a difficult market to break into, it now accounts for half of his sales. For spring/summer the collection is expanding to include more types of the Steven Tai girl in different stages of her life. His girl, he says, dances to her own rhythm. “We have a strong sense of humour and irony. I was an outsider a lot of the time and always a bit of a geek so I had to embrace that about myself.” All he needs now is a good night’s sleep. TB The crafters: Malone Souliers With no plans for a glitzy flagship, and absolutely no intention of spending thousands on a glossy ad campaign, Malone Souliers is a luxury shoe brand that means business. But they are determined to do it in their own way. Launched in 2014 by creative director Mary Alice Malone and business brains Roy Luwolt, the duo are already competing with established names, boasting 250 outlets across five continents. Jessica Chastain, Oprah Winfrey and Amal Clooney are all loyal fans. The secret is the complementary talents of the two founders, who met at a dinner party. MA, as Luwolt calls her, is obsessed with the craft of shoemaking – and has a sharp eye when it comes to a cool pair of kitten heels – while Luwolt has 18 years of experience developing strategies for luxury brands. The son of a diplomat, Luwolt grew up moving between 45 countries. Malone spent her childhood in the Pennsylvania countryside and was selected for the Olympic equestrian junior team. She dreamed of becoming a painter but transferred a talent for making things to a degree in shoemaking at Cordwainers at London College of Fashion. “I love the very human interaction that making shoes has,” says Malone. “You are making this object that someone will put on, that could change their self confidence, their outlook, their day and even possibly their life. Maybe they just got a new job wearing your shoes.” For London fashion week in February, Malone Souliers put the designer centre stage, making a pair of shoes live to showcase the craftsmanship to press and buyers. “You can be really hard on yourself,” she says of the process. “You put one nail out of place and your ruin the whole shoe and have to start again. On the day, I was able to be in my element so it was a rather enjoyable experience. I was just happily making shoes.” TB The thrifter: Asai A Sai Ta’s mother gave birth to his older brother on a boat between Vietnam and Hong Kong. His parents were refugees from the Vietnam war and ended up in the UK in the late seventies. A Sai, 29, the second youngest of seven children, grew up in south-east London. His father, a carpenter, left when he was six, leaving his mother to bring up the family. She earned money as a seamstress, sewing clothes at home. When he speaks to his mother now, they do so in a hybrid language that only they understand, a mix of Vietnamese, Cantonese and English. A turtle pin and avocados at Steven Tai’s studio As a child, he changed school often, so never had all of the right uniform on the first day of class. “I remember wearing these green tartan trousers and everyone else was wearing grey trousers,” he says. “I felt so silly and then the coolest kid at school said ‘where did you get those trousers? I want my mum to get me a pair,’ and I realised how clothing can form an identity and how much you can tell about someone.” The Ta household was a noisy, hectic place filled with his older siblings and their Portishead and Massive Attack posters. A Sai – who was called Andrew as a child but reclaimed his Asian name after a trip to Hong Kong when he was 18 – would go to charity shops with his older sister and liked to customise hand-me-down clothes. He got his first weekend job at H&amp;M at the age of 16, and worked in retail during his BA and MA in fashion at Central Saint Martins. He quit his last shop job at Selfridges only last year, where his designs were being sold on the floor above as part of the Fashion East pop-up. They sold out in a week. At the end of his BA, Ta was awarded the L’Oréal creative prize. When Kanye West was at the college to interview prospective designers to work on his Yeezy brand, he was intrigued by Ta’s unique textile experiments and invited him to spend three months in LA. “I learnt a lot just seeing how much passion he had,” says Ta, “and how open he was to learn made me realise you have to keep pushing your vision out there, it gave me the confidence to believe in myself to do it.” Ta’s first collection, part of the Fashion East show last season, was a colourful exploration of textiles and texture – the frayed, distressed fabric has become his signature. “I stumbled on this overlocking technique just by accident,” he says. “I didn’t have much money so I collected all the thread from school to create my own fabric – and it came out in these really interesting shapes.” TB The frill seeker: Molly Goddard Molly Goddard gets excited by the idea of embroidered doilies and Victorian nightdresses, is a “bit obsessed with fabric manipulation techniques” and loves visiting craft fairs. She thinks it’s a shame that craft has such a “dodgy Pinterest persona”. If anyone can restore craft’s bad rep, this 28-year-old designer, smock-lover and Rihanna favourite can. She set up her label in 2014 and her brightly coloured, voluminous taffeta and tulle dresses have been earning her accolades ever since – from being snapped up by Dover Street Market after her first show, to being a finalist in this year’s LVMH’s young fashion designer prize. Goddard has made a name for herself for shows big on concept: for AW15, models took part in a life drawing class, SS16 saw them layer-up cheese and lettuce sandwiches on a production line and for AW16 the Tate Modern catwalk took on the form of a just-finished dinner party. Goddard’s work has been described as “dishevelled bohemian crossed with punk princess”. But Goddard herself is wary of summarising: “trying to describe it always makes it sound a bit rubbish, doesn’t it?” But try she does: “There’s a clumsiness … a slight awkwardness to [my designs] in that they’re a bit wonky and imperfect.” Molly Goddard’s signature tulle and smocking “Childlike” is a word that often crops up – “growing up always interests me,” she says, “I love seeing what little kids wear.” Another is “girly” – she’s been asked how she feels about that one before. “I sometimes wonder if I should sit down and actually think about these things, actually what do I think?” A moment later: “I think there’s nothing wrong with the word ‘girly’ … it has negative connotations but it doesn’t have to be negative.” At a time when fashion seems fixed on feminism, her often-oversized designs have been celebrated for speaking to the kind of dressing that’s done to please no one but yourself. While sure of her own feminist beliefs, she’s less sure of how her work connects to them: “The shows for me are about bringing people together and encouraging people to wear what they want – and, I guess, not dress for men. I don’t know.” Goddard’s mind, understandably, is perhaps busy elsewhere – she has London fashion week to prepare for. She describes the collection as “a little more grown up maybe … maybe a bit less colour – it’s more controlled in that sense, but not in a boring way”. Molly Goddard’s autumn/winter 2017 show at London fashion week With fans like Rihanna and dresses that make grown women swoon like seven-year-olds, perhaps it doesn’t matter that she hasn’t thought it all through; her clothes speak volumes for themselves. EVB The contrarian: Dora Teymur Dora Teymur is sure of something: that he doesn’t want to be pigeon-holed. It makes speaking to him about his work – beautifully ugly handcrafted shoes beloved of street style stars and Solange Knowles – an interesting exercise. Of certain things we can be sure: he is 25 years old. He’s originally from south-east Turkey. And he’s largely to thank for the mule being the It shoe of the year. Even though mules, Teymur concedes, are “tricky” – “it’s like leopard print: either you’re super chic, or you’re Erin Brockovich”. Studded shoes by Dorateymur On other topics he is less definitive. Ask him to put his design aesthetic into his own words – “I’m looking at lifestyle and character and music … nostalgia is part of my work”. What era is he nostalgic for? “I can’t be specific about my work, it always depends on my mood. I’m inspired by the classic, although I can’t describe my work as classic, but I am very much inspired by what is classic.” Teymur is not trying to be difficult or evasive – he is just terrified of being “stuck in one certain place”, pinned down. His work is always evolving, he says: “What scares me the most is saying ‘this is my work’ and then your mind changes, you evolve, you like making different things.” He started his Hampstead-based brand, Dorateymur, in 2012, during his second year at London College of Fashion’s Cordwainers. The brand is now stocked at Browns, Net-a-Porter and Opening Ceremony. His signature styles include the Nizip, a mod-ish ankle boot that wouldn’t look out of place on Twiggy or Felicity Shagwell; and the elegant Harput loafer, with its square toe and extravagant metal logo ring. For his AW17 collection, Suburban Melancholia, he crafted heels in the shape of miniature elephants – inspired by ornaments he has seen in people’s homes. The concept behind his upcoming London fashion week collection, he says, is “the new aesthetic” of the near future, informed by the development of new technology and AI. Given his a fear of being pigeon-holed, it would be remiss to try and predict even the near future for Teymur. One thing we can say: let’s not rule anything out. EVB The embroiderer: Alice Archer While chatting with Alice Archer a broad variety of names pop-up in conversation. The designer, 32, is an expert in embroidery and worked for Tracey Emin on her embroidered artworks before launching her own brand in 2013. Mary Queen of Scots is another inspiration – the ill-fated queen embroidered while incarcerated. Meanwhile, John Singer Sargent – in an unlikely partnership with fashion photographer David LaChapelle – provides the mood-board material for her upcoming spring/summer 2018 presentation. Training in fine art at Goldsmiths and textile design at the RCA, Surrey-born Archer describes her time with Emin as formative. “I learnt loads of techniques of hand embroidery,” she says. “I try to bring that to my work – the feeling of spontaneity.” Emin herself was a blast: “She is fantastic, extremely fun and generous – a strong woman. She made me feel ambitious.” Embroidered dress and kimono jacket for autumn/winter 2017 by Alice Archer Archer’s aesthetic is luxurious, grown-up, louche, glamorous – with robes as something of a signature. The clothes are expensive – up to £2000 for a dress – but they are already on the radar of those with bottomless budgets including Pippa Middleton and even P Diddy. The rap mogul wore one of her robes. “His girlfriend bought something at Barneys,” says Archer. “It was just by chance that I saw it on Instagram.” Archer’s dedication to the glamour that appeals to the superrich remains undimmed even if it impacts on her day-to-day. “I love designing occasion wear,” she says. “I have nothing to wear in the day but a great collection of amazing dresses. I had a million weddings this summer - I think 10 - and wore a different dress to each one.” LC The skater: Blondey McCoy Anyone with half an eye on Palace, the favoured brand of hypebeasts everywhere, might recognise Blondey McCoy – the skater has been their face for five years. But that’s just the entry level intel on this rising star. McCoy is an artist and designer as well, with his own label Thames London, which he founded in 2015. Following a collaboration with Fred Perry, this London fashion week the brand is launching a collection with jewellery designer Stephen Webster. Did we mention that McCoy has just turned 20? While most people his age are still learning how to use the washing machine, McCoy speaks as someone with world-weary experience. “I have been in London and skateboarding since as long as I care to remember,” he says. The collaboration with Webster came out a chance encounter. “I vaguely remember bumping into Stephen on a night out,” says McCoy. “He told me that he’d mentioned Thames to his daughters and that they were aware of the label and had insisted on the collaboration.” The collection interprets the theme of London with an eye on the landmarks. It features Eros – the angel of Piccadilly Circus – on sovereign rings and pendants, and the razor blades associated with punk reworked in gold. Sovereign necklace and knuckle duster ring by Thames London and Stephen Webster McCoy grew up in London with a British mother and Lebanese father. He says his designs come down to his attitude to his hometown. “I’m a real tourist,” he says. “I feel lucky everyday to walk the same streets as my current and past heroes, I love Soho and all of its heritage from [Francis] Bacon and [Sigmund] Freud to [Paul] Raymond and [Quentin] Crisp … I think it will always be a creative melting pot as long as there is room for people to inspire each other to be individuals.” McCoy might be young, but joining those London heroes already looks likely. LC The culture clasher: Supriya Lele When you come from a family of doctors, choosing a career as a fashion designer might understandably raise some questions from your parents. “There was a point when I was younger when they suggested me being a lawyer,” says Supriya Lele. “But I was always stronger in the arts at school.” Lele is, in fact, proving herself to be something of a fashion talent. Graduating from the RCA last year, the 30-year-old had a presentation at Fashion East, the well-respected new designer showcase. It prompted i-D magazine to call her “the British-Asian designer everybody’s talking about.” Lele’s debut was a collection inspired by her background, as someone with Indian parents who grew up in the UK in the nineties, and had a moment as a goth. It featured a diverse casting, with models wearing Indian jewellery as well as draped clothes recalling Indian dress, mixed with satin blazers, leather trousers and 10 denier tights. “I am British and Asian and there is a dialogue between the two,” explains Lele. “Growing up I never wore Indian clothes but family members, like my aunties in India, would wear saris every day. It’s about being from one place but also another.” Belt detail by Supriya Lele Her show at Fashion East this season will continue on this theme but the designer remains in the minority on the London fashion week schedule. There are still relatively few non-white faces coming out onto the catwalk for the customary post-show bow. While her identity is a rich vein of inspiration, the wider politics of race in fashion is less analysed. “I don’t feel like an anomaly but you don’t see that many British Asian designers,” she says. “I don’t know why that is. Perhaps there is more [that the fashion industry] to engage with that community.” Lele’s presence – and the hype around her collection – can only be a step in the right direction. LC The modernist: Rejina Pyo Rejina Pyo describes her clothes as “effortlessly elegant with a playful modern twist”. If that sounds straight out of the fashion book of hot air, she follows this up with something a little more thoughtful. “I think that’s my natural aesthetic and my personal taste. It’s easier when you’re being honest to yourself,” she says. “I wear my clothes and feel privileged to test them out. I might wear something and go ‘oh yeah, but I feel restricted’ and then lose the waistline.” It’s this kind of real-life-friendly thinking that has arguably put Pyo, 34, on the radar of editors and stylists since launching in 2014. Working with Roksanda Ilincic before starting her own label, Pyo’s clothes have a similar modernist simplicity. Her Greta dress, a puffed sleeve midi design with bodice detailing around the waist, has been worn by fashion director Caroline Issa and stylist Kate Foley – women who are endlessly photographed outside fashion shows. That profile is likely to reach a new tipping point this season as Pyo is moves from presentation to have her first catwalk show at London fashion week. From moodboard to look book, designs by Rejina Pyo for autumn/winter 2017 Pyo was born and raised in Seoul and moved to London to study at Central Saint Martins when she was 25. It was her first trip out of South Korea. How did she acclimatise? “I think it’s easier for us coming to the west because we see a lot of films, know what its like,” she says. Nine years on, she feels London is home. “The more you live here, the more you get the underlying text,” she says. “Now I feel I belong here more [than South Korea] because I am very supported. London is very open.” LC"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
