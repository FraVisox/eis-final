Urgent British-led efforts at the UN were under way to dissuade the United Arab Emirates and the Saudis from pressing ahead with the attack – or at least to give undertakings that it will not seek to starve Hodeidah into submission. Aid agencies have warned that an attack would have catastrophic consequences. The UN security council met behind closed doors on Monday at the request of Britain to be briefed on the situation after heavy fighting erupted near the city on Friday and Saturday. The UAE has vowed it will take the port saying it is being used by Houthi rebels to smuggle in arms including missiles used to attack Saudi Arabia itself. “We are, at the present moment, in intense consultation,” the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, told reporters. “I hope that it will be possible to avoid a battle for Hodeidah.” He said the UN’s Yemen envoy, Martin Griffiths, was shuttling between the capital of Yemen Sanaa and also the UAE and Saudi Arabia. One proposal is for the UN to take control of the port or the city. After briefing the security council on Monday, UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told reporters that “if for any period Hodeidah were not to operate effectively the consequences in humanitarian terms would be catastrophic”. “While the UN and other humanitarian agencies are reconfiguring their presence it’s also our planned intention though to stay and deliver. We have dozens of UN staff still in Hodeidah,” Lowcock added. The UK’s Middle East minister, Alistair Burt, repeatedly urged the UAE not to mount an attack, but he told MPs in the Commons that it would only be a breach of international law if the attack was used as a matter of policy to attempt to starve the population. Burt said: “The UN special envoy has previously expressed concern that conflicts in Hodeidah could take peace off the table ‘in a single stroke’. It is essential for him to be given the time that he needs to facilitate a negotiated solution that avoids conflict in the city and we support his efforts to do so.” He urged the Houthis to respond to the entreaties in the next 48 hours saying “this will make a significant difference”. But there was little sign that either the British or the Americans were willing to announce a halt to arms sales to Saudi or any other similar mark of disapproval of the Saudi assault. Burt argued that the Saudis saw the threat of an assault as a way of pressuring the Houthis to negotiate a peace deal. The UN has warned the Saudi-led coalition that a military attack or siege on the city, long a target in the war, could lead to the displacement of 250,000 people. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, at the weekend spoke to the Saudi foreign minister, al-Jubeir, the UAE foreign minister, Abdullah bin Zayed, as well as to Griffiths. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, made a similar round of calls, but Pompeo did not call for the attack not to go ahead. He simply said all sides should honour their commitments to the UN adding he had “made clear our desire to address their security concerns while preserving the free flow of humanitarian aid and life-saving commercial imports.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/15013","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T23:00:24Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 15,013","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/15013","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/15013","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 15,013","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/13/planned-parenthood-union-workers-rocky-mountains","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T13:20:54Z","webTitle":"Planned Parenthood chapter should back its workers, not side with Trump | Liza Featherstone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/13/planned-parenthood-union-workers-rocky-mountains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/13/planned-parenthood-union-workers-rocky-mountains","fields":{"headline":"Planned Parenthood chapter should back its workers, not side with Trump","bodyText":"Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is asking Donald Trump’s National Labor Relations Board for help in busting its staff union. Last December staff at the clinic voted to join the Service Employees International Union (SEIU); management is challenging that decision. By using the rightwing Trump administration against its own workers, a Planned Parenthood chapter is effectively pitting two powerful beacons of progressive politics against one another, at a time when we all need them to be working together. That’s bad enough. But it’s especially troubling for a reproductive rights organization to take an anti-union stance, given that unions are central to feminist progress. Unionized workers suffer less sex discrimination and sexual harassment than other workers, and when they do experience these things, unions offer grievance procedures to address them, as well as solidarity and guidance. By contrast, the neoliberal workplace – and the gig economy – offer women the opportunity to lean in and suck it up. According to the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC), union membership is crucial if women want equal pay: among unionized men and women, the pay gap is half that of non-union workers. Indeed, women gain even more from joining unions than men do ($224 per week, on average, according to the NWLC). Their greater income and job security gives unionized women more sexual freedom; when women don’t have to depend on men, they can choose their partners, leave bad relationships, or even, to the distress of the incel movement, choose not to marry or date at all. Given this critical link between unions and women’s economic power, the Colorado Planned Parenthood chapter’s move is particularly short-sighted. After all, women’s material conditions determine reproductive freedom itself. Today, in the United States, “choice” is not equally distributed among women. Since the Hyde amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions, women depending on Medicaid can’t easily get them. “Choice”, according to much of the Democratic establishment, means “have an abortion if you can pay for it”. Even before abortion was legalized in this country, well-off women could leave the country and get it done (as was the case in Ireland before the country’s recent referendum to legalize abortion). But the relationship between reproductive freedom and class is bigger than that. “Choice” isn’t only about deciding not to have babies. When we are enslaved by poverty and bad working conditions, we are often forced to remain childless against our will, as left-feminist writers Jenny Brown and Moe Tkacik have noted. Many young women in the US who would like to have children – or larger families – simply can’t afford to right now. With the decline in private-sector union membership, many women lack the family wage that makes motherhood a “choice” at all. All this partly explains why nurses and teachers – most of whom are women – are organizing more visibly and successfully than any other workers right now: women need the labor movement. (The staff of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains face issues similar to those faced by nurses and teachers: low pay for work that is skilled, professional and, like a lot of work done by women, emotionally demanding.) It’s also why the work that nurses and teachers are doing is so much more sustained, widespread and contagious than any other feminist organizing of the Trump era, despite the scale, passion and vivid pink on display during the inauguration weekend Women’s Marches in 2017. Women in the US also need Planned Parenthood. The organization not only fights for abortion rights in an environment of constant, knuckle-dragging conservative backlash, it provides sex education to kids and life-saving healthcare to women, all over the country. But the organization must not ignore the inextricable ties between economic and gender justice. Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains should rethink its disastrous alliance with the Pussy Grabber-in-Chief and join the nationwide feminist labor movement. The first step is bargaining with its staff in good faith."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/13/fury-affordable-homes-redeveloped-sold-housing-associations","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T06:30:11Z","webTitle":"Fury as housing associations redevelop and sell affordable homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/13/fury-affordable-homes-redeveloped-sold-housing-associations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/13/fury-affordable-homes-redeveloped-sold-housing-associations","fields":{"headline":"Fury as housing associations redevelop and sell affordable homes","bodyText":"Housing associations have made at least £82.3m from auctioning homes in five London boroughs since 2013, according to figures seen by the Guardian. Analysis by the Labour MP for Westminster North, Karen Buck, shows that Westminster, Brent, Camden, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Kensington and Chelsea sold 153 properties at auction through Savills estate agents – with more than half in Westminster where sales totalled £36.4m. The true figures are likely to be much higher as the data only covers sales made by one agency. The auctions are part of a wider trend of some housing associations selling off social housing in expensive central London to fund new developments, which tenants say are unaffordable or far removed from their families, schools and work. Buck says: “I’m dealing with a family who are statutorily overcrowded and in the highest medical priority and I haven’t been able to get them moved in over eight years. That’s because housing associations [in general] say they don’t have the stock in the area and yet they’re still selling off homes.” Nationally, sales of housing association social homes to the private sector have more than tripled since 2001, with 3,891 social homes sold in 2016. Overall, more than 150,000 homes for social rent have been lost since 2012. Bucks’ analysis shows that in Kensington and Chelsea housing associations made £5.3m from auctions in 2013 alone. Between 2013 and 2018, Brent sold £20.9m, and Hammersmith and Fulham £13.7m. Although most auction lots do not state the housing association selling the property, Buck has identified many homes as stock of Genesis and Notting Hill Housing, which merged in April . Notting Hill Genesis manages 65,000 homes. A spokesman says before the merger, the two associations sold 497 homes between them in the past five years, using the proceeds to build more homes in less expensive areas in and outside London. Of these, 49 were auctioned last year, raising £19.7m, but the merged housing association “will limit sales to no more than 20 per year”. The selloffs are fuelling overcrowding and homelessness, and undermining efforts to tackle the housing crisis, experts say. “They’re buying and leasing homes all over London as temporary accommodation yet housing association homes within these boroughs are being sold off,” says Steve Hilditch, former head of policy for Shelter and a housing adviser to the last Labour government. Meanwhile, other housing associations are redeveloping their stock. In Kensington and Chelsea, local residents and the council have warned a public inquiry that backing plans to redevelop the Sutton estate, near the King’s Road, would give housing associations across the country carte blanche to not update social housing and replace it with private homes, which risks pushing thousands of tenants into temporary accommodation or homelessness. England’s largest housing association, Clarion Group, wants to demolish the red-brick Edwardian mansion block estate. The plans have fomented debate over the provision of social housing in Kensington and Chelsea, a year after the Grenfell fire in the north of the borough. Although there are around 200 vacant flats on the Sutton estate, many survivors are still living in temporary accommodation. Clarion has said the empty homes were not fit to be let. Campaigners argue that if Clarion had better maintained the estate they could have provided more suitable permanent accommodation for Grenfell survivors. But Kensington and Chelsea council has also come under fire for failing to house enough people made homeless after the fire. A spokesman for the council says it has spent £235m on securing 307 properties to help rehouse people affected by the fire. Of the 203 households requiring rehousing, 134 have a new permanent home, while 52 are in temporary and 15 in emergency accommodation. But a report published this week by the North Kensington law centre, says many homes lay unoccupied for months due to damp, disrepair and access issues. Labour MP for Kensington and Chelsea, Emma Dent Coad, says: “We have heard they [the council] are reselling some of the properties bought in haste last summer,” she adds. “We have 30 [Grenfell] households including at least one person with disabilities, and only three homes with disabled access – and it seems these may not be of the right size.” The planning inspectorate is due to submit a report on the Sutton estate inquiry to James Brokenshire, secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, in late August. The minister is expected to make a decision on Clarion’s appeal by the end of the year. says if the appeal is successful “it opens the floodgates to privatise social housing”. “This is a test case for social housing across the UK because if Clarion are allowed to do this, every other housing association will do the same. They’re a housing charity fighting to privatise charitable housing.” Kim Taylor-Smith, deputy council leader and lead member for Grenfell and housing, agrees. “It’s my view that Clarion’s intent from day one was to make money from the Sutton estate,” he says. “But William Sutton’s motivation was to provide homes for the poor. I would hope that they remember that.” Clarion has also last month submitted a revised regeneration scheme for the Sutton estate to the public inquiry, which the council accepts would not lead to a loss in social housing. But it has not withdrawn the original scheme and both will be assessed by the planning inspectorate. “We remain committed to the regeneration of the Sutton estate and to providing our current and future residents there with good quality homes,” says a spokeswoman. “No further decisions will be made until the outcome of the appeal is known.” But Clarion told the public inquiry that if its appeal against the planning decision is rejected, it would rent out the empty flats privately, noting that it had already rented out three of them, or would sell off the whole estate. The housing association adds that the empty flats cannot feasibly be renovated and re-let as social housing because they do not meet the government’s minimum standards for public housing. “They’re claiming they can’t refurbish them as social homes but they have refurbished and let three properties out privately for £1,800 [each] a month,” Henderson says. “Grenfell survivors have told us they would like to live here because they don’t want to live near the tower again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/11/fernando-alonso-f1-future-mclaren-canada","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T19:31:10Z","webTitle":"Fernando Alonso might consider F1 future after McLaren’s Canada failure | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/11/fernando-alonso-f1-future-mclaren-canada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/11/fernando-alonso-f1-future-mclaren-canada","fields":{"headline":"Fernando Alonso might consider F1 future after McLaren’s Canada failure","bodyText":"Alonso considers the future Fernando Alonso’s 300th grand prix was far from a celebratory affair: he started 14th on the grid, his lowest position this season, and retired from the race with an exhaust failure. The McLaren racing director, Éric Boullier, had been clear about their car’s problems in lacking grip in low-speed corners that was making them struggle in Canada and afterwards Alonso could not wait to walk away from it. He wanted to talk about Le Mans, where he will race next weekend. He will be in the class of the field Toyota at La Sarthe, a world away from the recalcitrant McLaren. The Spaniard is now in talks with McLaren about his future and CEO, Zak Brown, has already hinted that a McLaren Indycar project might be where he goes next. If Alonso wins at Le Mans, the triple crown he has targeted would be one victory away at the Indy 500 and with his team not providing the performance he so desperately desired this season, he might just call time on F1. Leclerc impresses again The 20-year-old Charles Leclerc is going from strength to strength in what, thus far, must be considered a hugely impressive rookie year. Tenth in Montreal, he has now scored points in three races. More pertinently, he has put his more experienced team-mate Marcus Ericsson in the shade. The Monégasque driver has made it to Q2 in the last four races. Ericsson has yet to do so once. The Sauber is an improved car and with this year’s Ferrari engine (badged as an Alfa Romeo) the car has the horses it lacked in the past but it is also a handful to drive. Yet Leclerc has proved able to master it. In Canada he once again held his nerve and control to ensure he secured a point. Doing so amid the highly competitive midfield pack is even more impressive. He is 15th in the world championship, in front of Stoffel Vandoorne in the McLaren. Ferrari may want him to drive for another season with a junior team but on this form he is making a strong case to replace Kimi Räikkönen in 2019. Max does it clean Max Verstappen is nothing if not an entertaining personality. His refusal to back down and sheer self belief presents a more fascinating, wilful character than many in the paddock. On Thursday before the race he was offering to headbutt anyone who continued to ask questions about the incidents that have plagued his season. They were valid enquiries but the Dutchman simply wanted to do his talking on track. At the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve he finally did so. Fastest in all three practice sessions and with an excellent third in qualifying, he just needed to execute on Sunday. In doing so it seems that some of the admonishments Red Bull have administered have sunk in. With another good start he beat Valtteri Bottas off the line and was alongside the Finn in turn two. He could have refused to cede the place and contact would have ben inevitable. He chose to back off, stayed in the game and took third, temperament finally in tune with his talent. Ferrari step up Mercedes have been open about their shortcomings in Canada. The lack of hypersoft tyres for practice, not bringing a new engine and the cooling issue that cost Hamilton among them but on the form Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari displayed, they would have had a huge challenge regardless. The Scuderia did have a new engine but what was most impressive was how they reacted and worked on the ground in Montreal. On Friday Vettel described practice as a “disaster”. The team addressed it, not least with reserve driver Antonio Giovinazzi putting the hours in overnight on the simulator at Maranello and by Saturday they had the car where they needed it. Pole followed as did an almost flawless run to the flag, with Vettel dominant. Ferrari have proved they are developing strongly and that the team is functioning efficiently and cohesively at the sharp end. These are the hallmarks of a championship-winning unit – attributes Mercedes have demonstrated repeatedly in the past four years. Problems make for a procession The season has provided some great racing but has now suffered the blow of two successive processional races, after Monaco also failed to ignite. Canada is often a thrilling race and the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve offers overtaking opportunities but, this year, the way the cars were forced into a train so early on again highlighted the task facing F1 in forming new regulations for 2021. Once again the race was single-stopper which meant drivers were concerned with managing their tyres and reluctant to attack as they degrade quicker in the dirty air. The cars are wider now, of course, and teams were managing fuel as well. All of which was exacerbated by the perennial issue of being unable to close to below a second without losing grip due to the wake from the car in front. It is hoped the latter, addressed in the form of slimmer front wings, will make a difference next year but the importance of dealing with them all cohesively could not be clearer than when Canada turns into a damp squib."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/25/spain-morocco-world-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T19:59:27Z","webTitle":"Spain held by Morocco but last-gasp Iago Aspas goal ensures they face Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/25/spain-morocco-world-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/25/spain-morocco-world-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Spain held by Morocco but last-gasp Iago Aspas goal ensures they face Russia","bodyText":"In the last minute of Spain’s final group game Fernando Hierro and all of Spain’s subs were suddenly off the bench, frantically signalling to their players, a finger raised on each hand, barely able to believe what had just happened and desperately trying to convey the news. Somehow, they did not yet know how, they had done it – or it had been done for them. Not only had they avoided defeat with a late goal, eventually granted by VAR after an agonising wait, but another late goal 1,593km away meant they claimed first place in Group B, technology telling them their destiny, events elsewhere deciding it. Although Spain were never really in danger of being knocked out, first place mattered: they now travel to Moscow to face Russia rather than Sochi to play Uruguay and avoid the half of the draw likely to include Brazil, Germany, France and Argentina. “Moscow will be lovely,” Hierro said; whatever it is, it could have been worse. On moments like these fate turns and futures are built. Spain, certainly, may feel like something shifted here tonight. Sergio Ramos called it a “turning point”. At 2-1 down to Morocco substitute Iago Aspas scored a 92nd-minute equaliser that was ruled out for offside and then the referee, Ravshan Irmatov, consulted the video. All at once Spain’s celebration was cut short and everything on pause, an entire stadium in suspended animation. Minutes passed, silence falling until Irmatov pointed to the centre circle, the goal given. At the same time, everything changed a long way away, beyond their control. Another 92nd-minute goal, this time a controversial penalty for Iran, took Spain from second place to first – and a very different path to the final. It had seemed so implausible a moment before and for most of the night. For Portugal it was painful and for Morocco cruel again: the portrait of a World Cup at which they deserved so much more. They could barely believe it. Nordin Amrabat spat: “VAR is bullshit” as he departed. Aziz Bouhaddouz said: “We’ve had no luck. We’ve played amazingly. Last week Ronaldo had one chance and scored: that’s why we lost and the refereeing was shit – sorry about my English.” If they could not believe it nor could Spain, as delighted as they were relieved. And if a Cristiano Ronaldo goal had sunk Morocco, a Ronaldo missed penalty rescued Spain. So did Aspas. Hervé Renard’s players honoured his promise that they would “roar like lions for the pride of Morocco” coming within seconds of defeating Spain, whose tournament this may be after all. Down after quarter of an hour and again with moments to go, they had their late equaliser but even that was not enough until Karim Ansarifard’s penalty in Saransk. It had been a long, emotional night that began with Sergio Ramos’s error allowing Khalid Boutaïb to race away and score, slipping the ball between David de Gea’s legs and offering competing visions of Spain: deeply impressive at times, deeply vulnerable at others. “We have to be self critical,” Hierro said. “Five goals conceded in three games is not the path. If we let goals in so easily, it will be hard to achieve the objective.” After falling behind, Spain got a grip, inclined to the left where Andrés Iniesta and Isco combined and accelerated. Isco rolled the ball under his studs, offering it, hiding it, turning away from challenges. Iniesta speeded up but never sprinted; instead, he skated. Outside them, Alba whizzed, legs whirring. Every pass had purpose and Spain soon had the equaliser, the ball moved swiftly through many stations: Iniesta, Isco, Diego Costa, Iniesta, Isco and into the net. But while Spain controlled they remained at risk, a throw-in sending Boutaib away again only for David De Gea to make his first save of the tournament. At 1-1 at half-time Spain were through but Portugal’s lead meant they trailed their Iberian neighbours and the second half began badly. Gerard Piqué was fortunate not to be penalised for a handball; De Gea punched unconvincingly as M’barek Boussoufa dashed in; and Amrabat crashed an astonishing shot off the bar. All within 10 minutes during which Nabil Dirar’s speed opened Spain up. Meanwhile, in Saransk Ronaldo missed a penalty that would decided this. Spain responded and became urgent now. Even the subs were quick, leaping off the bench to return the ball. Possession was theirs, the pass count climbing beyond 500 within the hour, but opportunities were few. Isco had a header cleared off the line by Romain Saïss, Piqué nodded wide. Hierro intervened, Marco Asensio and Aspas were introduced. Spain had 15 minutes but needed two goals to win the group. As it turned out, they did not have to get both themselves – and even conceding one did not ultimately cost them, after Fayçal Fajr’s late corner was met with a towering header from Youssef En-Nesyri. Spain were on course for defeat until Aspas flicked in the equaliser. At first it was disallowed but VAR was called. The wait felt eternal and by the time the goal was given, tension rising, confrontations on the touchline, far away Iran had scored. Fingers were raised, alerting incredulous footballers. Morocco had roared and had frightened them but they had not stopped them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jul/02/country-diary-swans-river-bank-otley-wharfedale","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-02T04:30:02Z","webTitle":"Country diary: swanning around the river bank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/02/country-diary-swans-river-bank-otley-wharfedale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jul/02/country-diary-swans-river-bank-otley-wharfedale","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: swanning around the river bank","bodyText":"The distance to the end of my garden from the back of my “new” house (I moved in eight months ago) is about the length of a cricket pitch. Beyond it there is a lush line of trees and an intractable tangle of bramble, bindweed and balsam, which drops steeply down to the banks of the River Wharfe. Along this stretch of the Wharfe there is a corridor in which trees, weeds and animals have free rein, a sort of riparian republic buffered from the human world. Living within the breathing space of the river is fantastically noisy and eventful, like being in a Yorkshire jungle. Swifts scream above the trees, scything through clouds of midges and mosquitoes; kingfishers and grey wagtails flash their colours in the green; beetles clatter against the bright windows at night; the screeches of little owls often pierce my dreams. Even so, it was a surprise when, in early May, a pair of mute swans commenced nest-building on a patch of willow-shadowed riverside grass next to a nearby office complex, once a worsted mill. It seemed such a brazen, exposed spot, so vulnerable to malice or stupidity. But the local response was fascination and concern; on my visits I overlapped with half a dozen different individuals watching them or “keeping guard”. Over the course of six weeks I visited the swans whenever I could, absorbed by their labours: the male’s methodical foraging for the nest; the female’s careful arrangement of it all; the frequent swapping of incubation duties. Mute swans typically pair for life and learn with each brood, successful or otherwise, and there was a practised, purposeful air to them that might have been earned by experience. That rearing-up display whenever I outstayed my welcome was also a reminder of their readiness for self-defence. My heart skipped a beat when I finally arrived to see the nest empty except for shell fragments. I found the pair a little further up the river. For a few anxious moments, there was no sign of young. But then four cygnets came into view, days old, scuttling around their parents in the water – tiny, urgent and utterly miraculous."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/26/james-harden-nba-mvp-houston-rockets","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T14:31:28Z","webTitle":"James Harden is a deserving NBA MVP even if fans find him hard to love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/26/james-harden-nba-mvp-houston-rockets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/26/james-harden-nba-mvp-houston-rockets","fields":{"headline":"James Harden is a deserving NBA MVP even if fans find him hard to love","bodyText":"James Harden was literally speechless when he was named the NBA’s most valuable player on Monday night: he did not have a script on hand. After thanking his mother, who was standing next to him on stage, an uncharacteristically emotional Harden exclaimed: “Sixth Man of the Year to MVP,” referencing the last major individual award he won, before exhorting kids to chase their dreams. The NBA Awards are a strange event. Although they aired well after the NBA finals this year – blame the Golden State Warriors for beating the Cleveland Cavaliers so swiftly – the actual voting takes place before the postseason even begins. This can lead to potential awkwardness. For instance, on Monday, current Detroit Pistons coach Dwane Casey won Coach of the Year for the job he did with the Toronto Raptors, the team that fired him immediately after the Cavaliers swept them out of the playoffs. Beyond anything else, the weirdness comes from the interminable wait between the awards and the end of the NBA regular season, which was way back on 11 April. At least this time it’s somewhat fitting, because Harden knows a thing or two about waiting. “The last four years have been like knocking on the door,” he said after his speech, adding: “I felt like last year I should have won as well, so I didn’t see a difference between last year and this year.” He’s not wrong. In different circumstances, Harden probably would have won the 2016-17 NBA MVP, but his former teammate Russell Westbrook wowed the world by averaging a triple-double and beating Oscar Robertson’s then-record regular season total in that category. Back in 2015, Harden came in second to Stephen Curry during a year in which the Warriors guard broke his own record for three-pointers and led his team to 67 regular season wins. This time around there was very little suspense. Harden received 86 first-place votes. In comparison, the second place finisher, little-known Cavaliers player LeBron James, garnered just 15 first-place votes. No surprises there. Harden averaged 30.4 points, 8.8. assists and 5.4 rebounds per game during the regular season all while leading the Rockets team to 65 wins, the best total in the league and in franchise history. If Harden felt a certain amount of vindication after finally winning MVP, one could hardly blame him. For much of his time in Houston, Harden put up the statistics of a star player while gathering regular criticism for his unconventional play. Most infamously, there were the lapses in defense where it often looked like he had stopped trying. Then there was his borderline miraculous ability to draw fouls to get to the free-throw line, which opposing fans took to call “flopping.” You could even take issue with the mechanical, assembly-line nature of Harden’s three-point shooting. Comments about his defense aside (and he has made a noticeable improvement in that aspect of his game), you’ll notice that these are mostly aesthetic complaints rather than serious attacks on Harden’s ability to play. No one likes to watch basketball games continually halted by referees’ whistles – after all, free throws are the tasteless iceberg lettuce of basketball. If Harden played with the joyful enthusiasm of a Curry rather than with his trademark vacant Michael Myers stare, it would be easier to love his prolific three-point shooting. However, if there was one criticism that stuck more than any other it was this: Harden’s teams couldn’t win during the playoffs. It’s possible that the “choking” narrative started in 2012, the year he won the Sixth Man of the Year Award he mentioned on Monday. His inexplicable disappearance in the NBA finals – he managed only 12.4 points per game despite being the team’s third best player – was cited as a reason that the Thunder fell to the Miami Heat in just five games. Oklahoma City then traded him to the Rockets in what was then a controversial move. This writer’s reaction was “Harden is a great player, a perennial All-Star, but he’s not the No 1 option on a true contender.” Yeah, about that. After Houston handed him a starting role, the magnificently bearded Harden almost immediately became the face, and facial hair, of the franchise. More than any other move, the Rockets’ trade for Harden established them as perennial contenders. Meanwhile, the Thunder never fully recovered. Still, Harden’s Houston teams have struggled with a reputation of faltering in the playoffs. That reputation probably wasn’t completely rehabilitated this year, not when the last image we have of the 2017-18 Rockets is them going 0-for-27 beyond the three-point line in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals, but maybe it should. Bucking the odds, the Rockets managed to take the mighty Warriors to seven games and, had point guard Chris Paul not gotten hurt in Game 5, there’s a very good chance they could have advanced to the NBA finals to face a vulnerable Cleveland Cavaliers team. Of course, we can’t know if that’s what would have happened, which is why the league collects MVP votes before the playoffs begin. In the postseason, all it takes is one game, one injury or some other reversal of fortune to alter the entire a player’s year and erase an entire season’s worth of success. Regardless of how it ended, Harden deserved the MVP this year and he has earned the respect that goes with it, even if he may never win the love of every NBA fan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/25/academy-oscars-daniel-kaluuya-tiffany-hadish","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T18:49:35Z","webTitle":"Daniel Kaluuya and Tiffany Haddish join film Academy in fresh diversity push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/25/academy-oscars-daniel-kaluuya-tiffany-hadish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/25/academy-oscars-daniel-kaluuya-tiffany-hadish","fields":{"headline":"Daniel Kaluuya and Tiffany Haddish join film Academy in fresh diversity push","bodyText":"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced a record-breaking 928 new members in an increased push for diversity.

The new names include Daniel Kaluuya, who received an Oscar nomination for his role in Get Out, Girls Trip breakout Tiffany Haddish, I Feel Pretty’s Amy Schumer, Solo: A Star Wars Story’s Emilia Clarke and Moonlight’s Andre Holland and Trevante Rhodes. Star Wars breakout Daisy Ridley, Call Me by Your Name director Luca Guadagnino and Beasts of the Southern Wild nominee Quvenzhané Wallis are also included. In 2014, the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started to trend when the acting and directing nominees included no one of color, a situation that repeated itself in 2015. In 2016, the Academy president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, announced a diversity initiative to produce a more representative membership, doubling both women and people of color by 2020. Last year saw 774 members invited, a record at the time, with this year’s new batch breaking that by almost 20%. This year’s 928 invitees are also from 59 countries, including France’s Blue is the Warmest Color star Léa Seydoux, Chilean A Fantastic Woman star Daniella Vega and Swedish The Square director Ruben Östlund. Overall, membership is improving but there is still work to be done to reach the 2010 goal. Women now account for 31% of the Academy and people of color make up 13%. The basic requirement for members is that they must have “demonstrated exceptional achievement in the field of theatrical motion pictures”.

Four months later he was dead, murdered, says his father, by sindicatos – the violent gangs that now rule Venezuela’s eastern border. “They shot him 200 times and threw him in a shallow grave,” said Patrick Saywack. “They took my boy, then took over the mine.” As the crisis in Venezuela intensifies, the breakdown of law and order has been particularly acute in its remote eastern regions. And for border communities in neighbouring Guyana, a country of just 770,000 people on the northern shoulder of South America, the growing threat of cross-border criminal activity has exacerbated a century-old territorial dispute. Whitewater, a settlement of fewer than 2,000 inhabitants, lies in the Essequibo region, a vast carpet of thick forest and meandering rivers that makes up two-thirds of the country’s territory. Venezuela has claimed ownership of the region since the mid-19th century and has repeatedly warned off potential foreign investors in the region, costing Guyana billions of dollars in potential oil, mining and hydroelectric projects since its independence in 1966. In March, Guyana filed a claim with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that it hopes will enshrine the country’s current borders. “We have tried to use conciliation and other peaceful mechanisms but those options have been exhausted, our only resort is the ICJ,” said Carl Greenidge, the minister of foreign affairs. To raise awareness of the ICJ case, the ministry even commissioned a soca song brimming with references to obscure border treaties and defiant lyrics such as: “Love our neighbours, let the good vibes flow / So why would they wanna take Essequibo?” But in Whitewater the atmosphere is more anxious than defiant. A new patrol base for the Guyana Defence Force (GDF) was set up in February and on a recent afternoon, a handful of young recruits cleaned their weapons in the shade of the small wooden building. For years, both governments have turned a blind eye to the unreported comings and goings in the border town. The village’s main dirt track peters out at a riverside landing bay where bare-chested men lug barrels of contraband Venezuelan gasoline from motorized canoes. Entrepreneurial or desperate Guyanese have also trodden the path in the other direction, entering Venezuela to mine for gold. Miners say that until mid-2017 they paid members of Venezuela’s Guardia Civil 3oz of gold per month for the right to work. Then, without warning, it was the sindicatos demanding the fee – and eliminating anyone who stood in the way of their business operations. Late last year, Guyanese social media buzzed with a series of videos supposedly depicting the beheadings of Brazilian and Guyanese miners. “This is the worst brutality I have seen in my life – it’s worse than Isis,” said Gerry Gouveia, a former Guyana Defence Force soldier and pilot who runs a flight service to the region. “This criminality is spreading a huge sense of fear to businesses along the border.” And the Venezuelan gangs are already making their influence felt in Guayanese territory. In April, miners in the town of Eterinbang, south of Whitewater, reported that heavily armed sindicatos had set up a base on the Cuyuni river and were attacking boats that refused to give in to their extortion attempts. Many Guyanaese suspect that the sindicato gangs operate in collusion with the Venezuelan government but Greenidge insisted that there is no evidence for the claims. Instead, he said, the gangs “recognize there is a dispute and a lack of cooperation between the countries. This creates a vacuum in the border region and it makes them bolder.” Some international analysts are not so sure. “As the Venezuelan social and economic crisis intensifies, we have seen violence and crime in border regions increase significantly – and we expect it to continue to do so in the coming two years, unless we see an unlikely regime change” said Raúl Gallegos, the associate director of Control Risks, a political consultancy. “The Venezuelan government has become essentially a joint venture between extreme leftists and very corrupt bureaucrats. And some of these groups, especially inside the military and the investigative police, have links with criminal organizations working in kidnapping, extortion and gold mining.” President Nicolás Maduro has form in stoking nationalist fervour over Essequibo. In July 2015 – two months after ExxonMobil discovered huge oil deposits off the coast of Guyana – he issued a decree claiming ownership of vast parts of Guyanese waters and established the Essequibo Rescue Office telling countrymen “we are going to take back what our country left for us.” So far, however, the new government agency has remained inactive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/30/watch-the-world-cup-last-10-minutes-christian-sinibaldi","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-30T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"'I didn't breathe for the last 10 minutes': how we watch the World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/30/watch-the-world-cup-last-10-minutes-christian-sinibaldi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/30/watch-the-world-cup-last-10-minutes-christian-sinibaldi","fields":{"headline":"'I didn't breathe for the last 10 minutes': how we watch the World Cup","bodyText":"When Christian Sinibaldi turned up at homes across England to photograph fans watching the World Cup, he was overwhelmed by every nationality’s hospitality. “And their food,” he says. “I’ve eaten a lot of crisps and beer, but also the traditional Brazilian dish of feijoada in north London, Mexican quesadillas and guacamole in Putney, and a lovely Moroccan tagine cooked on the barbecue in Letchworth.” Sinibaldi sat with a fixed camera near the television screen and never asked anyone to pose: he didn’t need to. “Pretty much as soon as the match got under way, they forgot I was there.” He enjoyed watching the tension build. “Very few people left the room or changed positions throughout the game. They were glued to their chairs.” It does mean that Sinibaldi has not watched any matches himself, because he has been looking the wrong way. “But I could nearly always tell when a goal was coming – I could see it in their faces.” There’s a reason he made time for the project this year: as an Italian, it’s one way of dealing with the fact his home side didn’t make the cut. England 6 Panama 1 Cooper family, Milnrow, Rochdale, 24 June Timing is everything at Rick and Jo Cooper’s house, where the family are on countdown for England’s second match of the tournament, against Panama. With excited shouts of “Half an hour to kick-off” drifting in from the garden, the smell of burgers on the barbecue waft into the front room where the floor is strewn with balloons, inflatable clappers and St George’s flags. The country is in the early grips of a heatwave and little do the Coopers – grandmother Alison, 72, uncle Malc, 44, Rick and wife Jo, both 41, and their sons, Leo, eight, and Aaron, five – know that the sunshine will not be the only turn-up for England. Stones’ header puts England 1-0 up eight minutes in. “I missed it!” says Rick, distracted by Aaron walking in with lunch. But no one misses goals two, three, four or five – including two Harry Kane penalties – all before half-time. “This is unbelievable!” Rick shouts. “Football’s coming home.” The noise from the boys’ vuvuzelas is deafening. “The boys were too little for Brazil 2014,” says Rick, a Manchester United season ticket holder, “so I’m enjoying watching this one with them. I was obsessed with skiing as a kid. But France 98, where Beckham got sent off, that really got me into football and I’m mad for it now.” His brother Malc says, “You always have that hope with England, and it’s always been dashed. I remember Gazza with the tears at Italia 90, watching that with my late dad. And Maradona’s hand of God in 86, watching that on holiday in Torquay, around a tiny black-and-white TV. The injustice of it. But we’re perennial optimists, and with this young team, there’s a different mentality.” Their mother, Alison, is the only one who saw England triumph in 66. She says, “The country couldn’t believe it. My late husband, Henry, he loved the game. He always said: ‘If they play football, they’ll murder ’em.’ He’d have been thrilled with this one.” Brazil 1 Switzerland 1 Kiki Machado and friends, Crouch End, London, 17 June Cristina “Kiki” Machado’s house is a sight, and sound, to behold during the Brazil v Switzerland game, what with the yells of the 30 people squeezed into the living room, the guitar music from Kiki’s tenant Caco Barros (at front, glass in hand) and the green-and-yellow stars chalked on the pavement outside. “We drew six,” says Kiki (in hat), “because Brazil has won five times – we drew one more for luck.” Kiki’s living room is packed out with her “north London family”, friends collected over 20 years in this country, from Brazil, England, Lithuania, Serbia and Italy. When she arrived, her godmother gave her the number of her best friend’s daughter, Luciana, who was living in London. She never called, but seven years later they met by chance in the local library at a singalong for their children. “My family in Brazil said people aren’t celebrating there the way we are,” Kiki says. “It’s natural when you’re away from your country to find your people and cheer together.” She remembers as a child how everything stopped during a World Cup game, so when Martha asked if she could come home from school early for the match, she said, “Of course. Your teacher will understand.” After their 7-1 defeat by Germany in 2014, Brazilians are approaching this World Cup with trepidation. “I’m in defence mode,” says Janaína Campoy, 44 (on right, wearing glasses). “That game was a tragedy. It came just as things were going badly for us politically and economically. We lost confidence as a nation.” The self-esteem of an entire country seems a lot to put on 11 men, but they don’t let them down. After the match, they party until midnight, because that’s the Brazilian way to celebrate a draw. “When we won in 2002, that party lasted 24 hours,” Kiki says. “The hangover lasted a week.” Senegal 2 Japan 2 Adama Kande and friends, Ancoats, Manchester, 24 June The music and the chat don’t stop at Adama Kande’s city centre flat. Adama, 44 (in front of picture), a musician, came to the UK from south Senegal in 2008 and the green, red and yellow of his home country is all around his living room: on flags, posters and djembe drums. Watching with his partner Neilum Singh, 43 (second from right), and friends Iain Dixon (far right), 40, and Lamin Conteh, 42 (far left), Adama cannot hide his excitement. “Senegal is like Brazil,” he says. “Everyone plays football. When I was a boy, my neighbour was manager of the local team. He taught me, too – I’m a good player.” An early goal from Senegal superstar Sadio Mané sends them wild: the music and chants get louder, and the energy soars. When Japan equalise, Lamin booms: “It’s game on. Game on.” But when Japan equalise a second time, the mood deflates. “I wanted more,” Adama admits at full time. “They got the opportunity to win, but there were a few mistakes. They need to change tactics now.” For him, the World Cup couldn’t get much sweeter than 2002, when Senegal beat title holders France in the first game and reached the quarter-finals. He watched back home, crowded around a neighbour’s TV. “When Papa (Bouba Diop) pushed that ball inside, it felt as if we could beat anybody.” Neilum agrees: “They love their sport in Senegal. Because people have limited access to technology, they’re forced to share a TV, sometimes outside, sometimes in a cinema. Watching football with West Africans is electric – it’s just fire.” Morocco 0 Iran 1 Essakhi family, Letchworth, 15 June Before most Morocco matches, Mohammed Essakhi, 54 (in cap), finds himself in the kitchen cooking nibbles for friends coming over. He’s a school head chef and caterer, focusing on Moroccan and Spanish food. For this game, his starters include hummus, tzatziki and stuffed peppers. The barbecue comes after, “because when there’s a football match on, we want to watch it”. Balbair Chahal, 42 (pictured front left), works with Mohammed at the school; Phil Moore, 56, and Amanda Brosnan, 50 (centre), are friends and fellow Leicester City supporters. They watch the game with Mohammed’s wife, Rosalind, 56, his nephew, Kaeran Duff, 30, his son, Nizar, 16, who is training with Watford and hopes to go pro, and his daughter, Azza, 22 (far right). The 1-0 loss to Iran is “a bit of a let-down”, because the team played well, says Mohammed. Azza points to an important difference: “Footballers in England are so famous – it’s good to see people from your own background compete on the same platform.” “I would love Morocco to win,” Mohammed says, “but realistically, it’s not going to happen. What would really make me proud is seeing Morocco host the World Cup. We’ve been asking for about 20 years.” His best football memory is the 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986: “I was still living in Casablanca, and I remember youngsters celebrating in the street. Nobody thought it would be possible. At that time, Africa had only two teams that had qualified.” Azza, who recently graduated, is working in Morrisons, and is delighted to wear her Morocco shirt to work when the team play Portugal a few days later. “It was to raise money for Clic Sargent [a cancer charity for young people]; we pay a pound to wear the team shirt. It was a real conversation starter. That’s what I love about the World Cup: the unity. No matter what happens or what team you support, there’s a conversation you can have with anybody.” Japan 2 Colombia 1 Nishi family, Acton, London, 19 June Naohiko Nishi (on right) and his eight-year-old son Atsuhiko (next to him) have no special food or drink, hang no flags, have no good-luck rituals. What they do have is a Japanese guidebook to the World Cup, with detailed information about every player: how old they are, what kind of a player. This is consulted very regularly. Today the Nishis – Naohiko and his wife Akiko (far right), their sons Atsuhiko, eight, and Takahiko, six (front right) – are watching the game with their friends Hiro and Shiho (on left), and their children Masa, 12 (on floor), and Iroha, nine (with giraffe). The children are keen footballers: Masa, Atsuhiko and Takahiko all play at the nearby Football Samurai Academy. Atsuhiko plays football three days a week, and says he hopes to play for Japan when he’s older. For him, the best moment of this game is Shinji Kagawa’s penalty, secured in the game’s sixth minute after a handball from Carlos Sánchez: “It was kind of scary before he took it – we were very surprised that we won.” His father agrees: manager Akira Nishino was appointed just two months before the World Cup began. “To be honest, Colombia is much better than Japan. They got a red card, which was so lucky for us. Winning this match was a great moment - because in the 2014 World Cup, Japan didn’t get a good result.” Though they were the first team to qualify, Japan failed to make it out of the group stages. For Naohiko, the joy of this competition has been watching Japan improve their standing on the world stage. “Japan didn’t join the World Cup until 1998. Only some of them played in Europe at the time - whereas now almost all the Japanese players play for Europe. The quality has got much better and their confidence has increased.” The win against Colombia, and a subsequent draw against Senegal, will be hard to beat, though Naohiko still holds dear his memories of the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan: he was able to attend the opening game - where he watched Japan draw against a “very strong” Belgium. Iran 0 Spain 1 Shirin Azari and friends, Bromley, 20 June If only Vahid Amiri, the Iranian striker, could hear the chant from the mothers, teachers and former students of Iyda, or the Intercultural Youth Development Association, a Farsi-speaking community in south London: “Vahid pa Talayii omide team e mayii (Goldenfoot Vahid, you are our team’s hope).” Sadly, his golden foot doesn’t save the day: Iran’s only goal in the game against Spain is offside and they lose 1-0. It is a women-only party, organised by Shirin Azari (behind sofa, in white Iran T-shirt) with friends in Bromley. “We often get together for food and gossip and chat,” says her friend Pupak Navabpour, whose children learn Farsi at Iyda. Food is the focus at these events, and it is all set up before people arrived, “so you can eat with your eyes first”. Shirin has made dolmas and Turkish burek, and serves them with rosebud and cardamom black tea brewed in a samovar, followed by gaz (almond nougat) and nabat (crystal sugar) on sticks. “That is what we do when ladies get together,” she says. “The group was singing Iran Iran by Arash, dancing and chanting in Farsi.” “I think Iran are really good at defence, one of the best,” says Shirin, “but not attack. Even if they try to score, there’s nobody there; they keep themselves to their own goal.” Despite her criticisms, she is proud of her team, “because they don’t have the facilities or coaches that western countries have.” Pupak agrees: “It was gutting that the goal was disallowed. They defended well and almost scored a few times – even though they lost, I think they did quite well.” Pupak started taking Farsi classes as an adult when she realised she was beginning to struggle with her mother tongue. Now her children go every Saturday. “My youngest said, ‘But Mummy, I’m English.’ Even though I’ve spent most of my life here, I don’t feel that kind of belonging. When I watch Iran play in the World Cup, I suddenly feel that connection to home.” Serbia 1 Costa Rica 0 Bogdanovic family, London, 17 June On 17 June, Serbia won their first World Cup game in eight years. The more superstitious might have the Bogdanovics to thank for it: “We sit in the order we were sitting in 2010, when Serbia won against Germany,” says Deanna, 47 (on left). “We try to recreate exactly what happened that day, so we can win in the future.” Serbian snacks must be on the table and everyone must dress for the occasion. Deanna and Brian, 47, moved to London 20 years ago; soon they will have spent more of their lives here than in Serbia. “Often you question where home really is,” Deanna says, “but the World Cup erases that feeling. I’m not usually into football, but the World Cup turns me into a completely different person. When we scored,” she says of the winning goal, “it was such an amazing feeling. I don’t think we breathed for the last 10 minutes.” The only year-round football fan in the family is 15-year-old Vuk. Serbia haven’t qualified for the World Cup for more than half his lifetime, and he remembers being a small boy watching Serbia beat Germany. “Back then, Stojkovic was my favourite goalkeeper, and he saved a penalty. That was a proud moment.” His ritual during the game is never to jinx it by being overconfident: “Even if we were 3-0 up, I’d still keep my mouth shut until the final whistle.” Iceland 0 Nigeria 2 Silla Johannesdottir and friends, London, 22 June Iceland’s mere presence here is historic. The smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup, its population is the same as Sunderland’s. Silla Johannesdottir (on far right), who watches the game with her family and Icelandic friends, bearing flags and face paint, says, “It’s like a fairytale – we’re a tiny, tiny country. No matter how it goes, we’re so super proud of them.” But the game is disappointing, ending in a 2-0 loss to Nigeria. “When we got the penalty, there was a tiny bit of hope,” Silla says, “but Gylfi Sigurdsson didn’t score. That was a real low point, a kick in the gut. Everyone just left, there was no celebration. It was a bit sad.” What went wrong? “They were just better than us. They can run, those boys, and the Icelandic team just couldn’t keep up with that pace.” Her husband, Dadi Sveinbjarnarson (back right), agrees that speed was the Nigerian team’s strength. “The Icelandic team played pretty well, they had two or three tries on goal, and that was more than Nigeria, as far as I could see. Iceland just got outrun.” Dadi feels particularly connected to the team because he used to work with Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Thór Halldórsson, whom he describes as “a Viking shield wall”. “I was a commercial producer and he was one of our film directors. He is a very talented commercials maker who had a side life as an athlete – then that became the more important part of his career.” Halldorsson even directed a Coca-Cola commercial for the World Cup, using the famous supporters’ “Viking clap” as a lead-in. But Silla thinks everyone in Iceland feels connected to the team, and that even other nations have been rooting for them. “People approach us and say, ‘Well done.’ Everyone is happy for us. The World Cup really brings people together.” Colombia 3 Poland 0 Erik Sarmiento and friends, Manchester, 24 June In Colombia, football isn’t watched with strangers in a bar – it is a party to be shared with those closest to you, in your home. So Erik Sarmiento, 27 (sitting on the floor), is bringing South American carnival to inner-city Manchester by cramming 10 friends and family into his small flat to watch Colombia play Poland. The beers are flowing and a Colombian barbecue is on the go, with sides of guacamole, black beans, chimichurri and patacones (fried plantain) served with hogao (tomato salsa). The Spanish TV commentary is streamed at high volume and everyone’s focus on the match is unwavering, despite the noise of friends talking. An expensive bottle of Amarone wine sits by the television for final whistle celebrations. Erik, a business manager who lives with his wife Laura Van Hoof, 28, a Spanish teacher, came to the UK as a university student on a scholarship to learn English in 2009. “Growing up in Colombia,” he says, “sport isn’t associated with status or money because you can play in the streets. Colombia turns into a carnival when the national team plays. When I watch here, with Colombian food, music, friends, it’s a little bit of home in the UK.” The group play on bongo drums and improvise beats with a cheese grater, metal jug and spoons throughout the game. For 90 minutes, it feels as if the room is poised to explode – and it does, when Mina scores 40minutes in. “Goooooooooooal-azo,” they scream. By the third goal, they hug and sing: “Championes, championes, olé, olé, olé!” Erik says, “Football is an international language. I play four or five times a week – it’s how I met these friends. I saw someone wearing a Colombian club’s kit and now we are all watching together.” Sebastian Cano, 29, who moved to the UK in 2013, agrees: “It’s a sense of community. This is how it would be back home. I grew up with Carlos Valderrama [known to non-football fans for his big, blond perm] as a national legend, but in my opinion that generation was overrated. This squad is better. “The last World Cup was the first time in our history that we made it to the quarter-finals; James Rodríguez was top goalscorer and won the golden boot which was a big thing for us. Now our expectations are high.” France 1 Peru 0 Yves Ogrodzki and friends, Cheltenham, 21 June Studies over the years have reported that the French aren’t the easiest folks to please. Chef Yves Ogrodzki, 53 (with glass in hand), and his sous chef Jeremy Denni, 21, aren’t doing much to subvert those findings with their assessment of France’s victory over Peru. “It was a bit weak,” Yves says, “they could have done a lot better than that. I didn’t find it very exciting really.” Jeremy agrees, pointing out, “We have some of the best players in the world, so 1-0 is falling short. There were moments I was scared we wouldn’t win.” Yves and his wife Elisabeth, 53 (on right), run a French restaurant in Cheltenham, and they have invited the staff to their home to watch the game. “We want to bring to our customers a proper French atmosphere, so all our staff come from France. They are all in their 20s, it’s their first time working abroad, so we very often organise little parties like this at home.” Yves prefers rugby to football, but finds the World Cup gives foreigners an opportunity to talk about their national identity. “I remember when France won in 1998, people felt very patriotic. But living abroad, there’s a new dimension to our identity. The World Cup brings everybody together while still having that thing that says, ‘I belong to that country.’ Even someone like me who is more interested in other sports, we still get to go back to our roots. And I like the jokes. I’ve seen people joking on social media that now Italy haven’t qualified, they can look after everyone else by delivering pizzas.” There’s no special World Cup dish, just your basic French delights: a glass of pastis, sausages with mustard from Dijon, some traditional Parisian baguettes with ham and cornichons. “To bring luck,” Jeremy says, “we all sing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, before the game starts.” Mexico 1 Germany 0 Hayaux-du-Tilly family, Putney, London, 17 June At the apex of a divisive Mexican general election, nothing brings the country together like beating Germany. Yves Hayaux-du-Tilly (back right) watched the game with his sister and her Irish husband, his daughters, the nanny Maggie who has lived with them for 16 years, his sons and their friends. His wife, who was working, was sad not to see their win. “It was a brilliant game,” Yves says. “Mexico generally make it to the finals, but they normally underperform. This time they played brilliantly; it wasn’t a consequence of a mistake from the German defence. We could have scored one or two goals in the second half; unfortunately we didn’t, but we won. We defeated the world champions.” The family members have varying levels of superstition when it comes to the World Cup. José Pablo, 19, “will probably wear the same underpants and shirt without cleaning it every game the Mexican team plays”. They have to hang the Mexican flag and the beer has to be Mexican: “And of course we have guacamole, nachos, quesadillas – as an expat, it’s a way to connect with your country.” After the victory, Yves was in Mexico and found the mood of the entire nation lifted. “I was there three weeks before the game and everybody was angry and trying to convince other people to vote for their candidate. Now, nobody really cares about the election. We feel nothing can be that wrong if we can beat Germany. It changes the mood of the entire country. It’s very, very powerful.” Yves, whose best football memory is watching Mexico play at the Azteca stadium during the 1986 World Cup, thinks people will be talking about this victory for decades to come. “I love that the World Cup gives us this opportunity every four years to try again. That’s what life is about: you always have the opportunity to prove yourself one more time.” Ten days later, Mexico got through to the final 16, despite losing 3-0 to Sweden in their final group match. “It was a bittersweet feeling,” Yves says. “I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of character, focus, concentration and discipline in the players. But the main objective is to get through to what we call in Mexico ‘the fifth game’,” ie the quarter-finals. “That has only happened twice, only at the World Cups in Mexico,” he says. Yves did ultimately enjoy watching the Sweden match in a pub, largely because of the simultaneous Germany v South Korea game, which saw reigning champions Germany crash out of the tournament. “We didn’t care about our score,” he says. “We were all watching South Korea and when they scored we all cheered and hugged the South Korean fans.” South Korea 1 Mexico 2 Lee Jaeyoung and friends, Bradford, 23 June No one gathered in front of Lee Jaeyoung’s TV thinks South Korea have a chance against Mexico. The group of international students are on a study abroad programme at Bradford University. “I asked my friends how they thought we would do,” says Jaeyoung, 27 (back left), who studies psychology, “and they predicted a 2-0 loss, or maybe 2-1 if we were lucky.” He is more optimistic, hoping for a draw, but in the end the 2-1 defeat comes as no surprise. “I saw Mexico play Germany, and the Mexican team is really good.” Before his friends arrived, Jaeyoung bought some beer and fried a load of chicken drumsticks – an extremely popular combination the Koreans call “chi-maek”, from “chi” for chicken and “maekju”, the Korean word for beer. “Unfortunately we couldn’t find Korean beer,” Jaeyoung says, “so we had Stella and someone brought Carlsberg. It was a really good time.” They hung up the Korean flag for luck. “I don’t watch football usually, just the World Cup,” says Kim Seungyeon, 21 (back right), who studies psychology and counselling. “It’s a lot like the Olympics in that if our team wins, I feel I’ve won, too. I know they work hard, so I’m really happy to support them.” For her, the moment to beat in World Cup history came in 2002, when hosts South Korea reached the semi-finals. “It was the best moment – a miracle.” Despite today’s loss, they are extremely proud of the team’s forward, Son Heung-min. “He got a really incredible goal during extra time,” says Jaeyoung, who is a huge fan of the Tottenham player. “After the match finished, I saw on the Korean news that he was crying in the locker room. I felt like shouting, ‘Don’t cry, Son! We lost but you were the best!’” He was similarly impressed with his team four days later, when they achieved the unexpected and won 2-0 against Germany, marking the end of the latter team’s World Cup. “I didn’t expect that kind of score,” he says. “It was really impressive.” The match was a 0-0 draw until the 92nd minute, which would have still resulted in Germany being knocked out, but then South Korea’s Kim Young-gwon scored: “And I was like, ‘What the hell? This is awesome,’” Jaeyoung says. The goal was ruled offside, then reviewed on VAR, allowed, and was swiftly followed by a second goal from South Korea. Even though the win didn’t change their knockout from the World Cup, the celebrations were exuberant. “We were screaming and dancing,” Jaeyoung says . “I just wish I had put a bet on.” Russia 3 Egypt 1 Anastasiia Fedorova and friends, Catford, London, 19 June The balloon is for Anastasiia Fedorova’s husband, whose birthday was a few weeks before the match. He chose to work an extra hour in order to miss the game. “He was absent on principle,” she explains. “He’s British but was born in Ukraine, so he doesn’t support the Russian team. Sometimes we have small political battles. If there was a game between Russia and Ukraine, it would be a nightmare.” Anastasiia, 31 (on right), and Polina Kaplitskaia, 29, studied at the same university, St Petersburg State in Russia, and four years later bumped into each other on a plane from London to Moscow and rekindled their friendship. They both came to the UK for love; Anastasiia’s husband is British, and Polina’s husband Andrey had been living in the UK for 10 years when he met Polina through a mutual friend on a trip to Saint Petersburg. Polina has brought along red, white and blue paints to decorate their faces with the Russian flag. She thinks Egypt’s own goal, clumsily scored by Ahmed Fathi in the 47th minute, prompted a surge of energy on the Russian side: “I don’t think our team was concentrating very hard - but then Egypt scored an own goal and after that Russia started playing better. They became more active and confident.” “Our first goal was the best moment for me,” Anastasiia says. “I remember thinking, we’re so close to winning the game, and if we win we’ll go through to the next stage and it will be the first time in Russian history.” She hopes the World Cup will be good for the Russian people: “I hope everyone sees the real Russia, how the people are nice and welcoming. Sometimes our government does things that aren’t nice, but the people are not the same as the government. My parents in Russia say the atmosphere is so warm.” Living abroad when your country is hosting sometimes means missing out on the party, and Anastasiia felt sad when she saw Instagram stories showing people celebrating in the streets of St Petersburg. “We won and that was a surprise for everyone,” she says. “We’ve only won two games so far – but for us it’s like we’ve won the whole thing.” • This article was amended on 2 July 2018 to correct the spelling of Adama Kande’s surname. • Commenting on this piece?

But we will keep hoping","bodyText":"“It feels like I’ve been dumped by text message,” wrote one of my friends. She sounded like a heartbroken lover but in fact she was talking about the Turkish opposition’s presidential candidate, Muharrem İnce. It was around 11 o’clock on election night and İnce’s whereabouts were unknown, while people were risking their lives trying to monitor the vote count. Half of the nation – responding to İnce’s call to fight until the end – had been trying to protect their votes from the government’s theft of the election. It was like something from a Hollywood romance. The woman, having been disappointed so many times before that she fears opening up to another man, finally lets down her guard to love again – only to be disappointed once more. We, the heartbroken woman, learned that İnce had acknowledged the victory of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan through an off-the-record text message he sent to a TV presenter, not thinking that it would be revealed live on air. The fireworks from the governing party buildings and the celebratory gunshots from the Erdoğan supporters seemed to mock the defeat of democrats: how stupid we had been to believe in a leader again after so many previous let-downs. At the end of our film, President Erdoğan, confirmed again as the sole leader of the country, gave one of his classic victory speeches, in which he said: “One nation, one flag, one state.” We, the opposition, as has been very clear for a while, are not included in his understanding of this nation. For those who do not know much about Turkey – except for its representation in the global media as the crazy country where anything can happen – we have been living under a series of maddening political absurdities that have become easier to relate to since Donald Trump came to power in the United States and western countries started to face their own share of rightwing populism. However, prior to these elections – the first since the Gezi Park protests of 2013 – there had been real hope for those who opposed the hostile polarisation imposed on the country by Erdoğan. It wasn’t only the rallies of the social democrat candidate İnce that brought millions together. It was also felt by ultra-nationalists and Islamic conservatives, including the mainly Kurdish HDP party. There was a de facto alliance of democracy against this one-man regime. For the first time in years, the choking sense of “Erdoğan the impregnable” was shattered. The man himself was stammering during his rallies, forgetting his words during speeches that the audience had been paid to attend; and his election promises – such as free cake in coffee houses – were widely ridiculed. Yet despite the fact that we all knew it wouldn’t be a fair election, the spirit of “Yes we can” was in the air. Even the hardcore cynics were having second thoughts. Younger voters were expected to play an important role in the outcome, and they were out campaigning for İnce. After years of division, that much-missed feeling of brotherhood among the different factions of our political spectrum was an inspiration. So much so that I wrote: “This is the liberation war of democracy. The western countries should follow the Turkish elections to see how democracy can be saved from rightwing populism even when all the state powers are seized by a ruthless leader.” I wasn’t alone in this enthusiasm: the international media, for the first time in years, were talking about a Turkish politician who was not Erdoğan. “I am sorry,” said İnce, in his long-awaited speech, the day after the election. He was genuine and open as he apologised for not appearing in public to make a statement the previous night. “If you still want me to lead you through this walk, I am ready.” Since neither his party nor his intensely emotional supporters gave him any credit, he was embarrassed to do it himself: “In an election campaign of just 50 days, the votes of my party increased for the first time since 1977. Imagine what we can do in 500 days.” It was met with mixed feelings. Some wanted to get back to their comfort-zone cynicism; others wanted to try again. In the coming days we will see whether or not İnce will be able to convince the exhausted opposition of Turkey. Whatever the result may be, it is thanks to İnce and the other opposition candidates that Turkey showed the entire world how half of our country is ready to join the struggle for democracy, at a time when the concept itself seems in global decline. In countries such as mine, politics is highly emotional, and leaders are either loved or hated. Supporters carry their leader’s photo in their wallet like a secret lover’s. This might have seemed an odd phenomenon to western societies. But now there is the “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” chant and “I love you, Bernie” screams. This happens when people are faced with the fear of rightwing populism. Just like the Turkish people, Britons and Americans have started looking for a saviour, a valiant prince who won’t let them down. As I was reprimanded after the election by my self-loathing friends for my childish enthusiasm and passionate behaviour on social media during the night, I thought of the line from the Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer romance Frankie and Johnny: “Maybe I am crazy, but I’d still like to believe in love.” In our case, in Turkey, determined as we are to stand together and continue to hope, that rings true. No matter what. • Ece Temelkuran is a Turkish political commentator and the author of Turkey: The Insane and the Melancholy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/25/marcelo-bielsa-modest-target-first-season-leeds-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T16:44:04Z","webTitle":"Marcelo Bielsa sets modest target for first season as Leeds manager","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/25/marcelo-bielsa-modest-target-first-season-leeds-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/25/marcelo-bielsa-modest-target-first-season-leeds-manager","fields":{"headline":"Marcelo Bielsa sets modest target for first season as Leeds manager","bodyText":"Marcelo Bielsa did not make any rash promises on being installed as Leeds United’s 21st managerial rethink since dropping out of the Premier League 14 years ago, though he did come up with a vote of confidence for his native Argentina at the World Cup. “I think we’ll see the best of Argentina from the next game onwards,” the former manager of Athletic Bilbao and Marseille said. Bielsa confessed he might not be the best person to judge, given that when he was in charge of Argentina in 2002 when the side did not make it out of the group stage, but he sent his best wishes to the squad currently struggling in Russia. “I firmly believe in the quality of the players and in Lionel Messi’s leadership,” he said. “I believe they will learn from their first two games and take positives from them. I rate the backroom staff and leadership team highly and I am sure the players will find a way out of this difficult situation.” Bielsa has worked with some of the world’s best players, though for his first job in England he has agreed a two-year contract at a somewhat lesser level. The 62-year-old is hardly the most garlanded of managers and, though his reputation for ideas and innovation is immense, he does not have a track record of winning prizes. The Olympic gold medal he helped Argentina win in 2004 still stands as his most solid achievement, and though he took Athletic Bilbao to two cup finals he lost them both. In his last job at Lille he was relieved of his duties after just 13 games in charge, something he described as the lowest point of his managerial career. “My self-esteem really suffered,” he explained. “I was removed from my position with the team in 19th place, though we had only played 20% of the matches for which I was contracted.” Perhaps understandably, given that he only lasted just over a year in his previous job at Marseille and the rate at which his new club have been going through managers, Bielsa was reluctant to set promotion as a first-season target. “I don’t want to predict the future, I don’t think it is a good idea to be making great statements of intent when I have only just met the players,” he said.The new Leeds manager has been hailed as a coaching genius by Pep Guardiola, among others, and Mauricio Pochettino regularly cites him as a formative influence, though he modestly disputes the amount of influence he has had on either. “I don’t want to be accused of false modesty,” he said. “But I have studied both their styles quite a lot. Guardiola is the best manager in the world and his ideas are his own. Pochettino too has built his own career and developed a unique style. I don’t see too many of my own ideas there.” One handicap Bielsa will have to overcome is the language barrier. His introductory press conference at Elland Road was conducted through an interpreter and lasted well over an hour. “If you struggle with a particular language you are bound to find it more difficulty to get your ideas across to the players,” he admitted. “Words are so important. I actually spent 15 years trying to learn English as a kid, because my mother thought it was important. She might have been right, but now I will have to start again.” The inevitable question of a manager with an enormous reputation turning up at Elland Road was actually asked by a Spanish journalist. “Revie or Clough?” The man known as El Loco, not entirely to his liking, broke out in a broad smile. “I would prefer to lose rather than cheat, if that is what you are asking,” he said. “I like beautiful football better than pragmatic football, and if you can play well you have more chance of winning things.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/soggy-chips-six-more-lessons-my-baby-daughter-taught-me","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Soggy chips: six more lessons my baby daughter taught me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/soggy-chips-six-more-lessons-my-baby-daughter-taught-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/soggy-chips-six-more-lessons-my-baby-daughter-taught-me","fields":{"headline":"Soggy chips: six more lessons my baby daughter taught me","bodyText":"With a shift in my body clock I’ve been waking up at 4.30am, waiting for one of my kids to stir. I keep thinking I should do something with all the extra time. Learn a language or take a thorough stab at finishing Infinite Jest. Either way, last week I reflected on six of the 12 things I’ve learned since my youngest daughter turned one. Here are the rest: 7. First words can tell you a lot: our eldest daughter’s first words were “banana” and “maple”. Maple is the name of her favourite teddy. Our youngest daughter’s first words were “dirty” and “get down”. And this feels entirely symptomatic of being the second child. She is left to fend for herself while we prepare food, read books to our eldest, tidy, do jobs, prep things. And the first time she is noticed is when we are saying, “Bleugh, no, dirty. No, get down from there. Get down please.” She shakes her head a lot to indicate no. We never know when she is agreeing to things. And if you say no to her, she cries. Even if it’s in passing or casually. “No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, there’s no limit” would make her bawl with sadness as if we were telling her the world was ending. 8. What worked first time does not work second time. With our first kid, we sorted the sleep first and we used a dummy. The dummy was fine. The dummy was our friend. With our second, she wouldn’t take the dummy and sleep was a big issue. I was tearing my hair out trying to figure out how we could find a way of getting our second to go to sleep that was just as effective as the dummy. And then, our eldest decided she was too old for the dummy and needed to give it up. Suddenly, the both of them were in cahoots, trying to turn the night a shade of insomnia called sleepless purple. 9. A year is a strange vortex of time. When our youngest was born, I couldn’t for the life of me fathom how long this was all going to last. It felt endless. I joked that, for the next 14 years, I would be struggling to get them to bed and then I would struggle to get them out of bed. Now, I cannot remember that desperation I felt. It was irrational. To the point where I would write in a notebook how many hours of sleep I would get when I went to bed. And what knock-on effect interrupted sleep felt like. But the thing was, as soon as I felt like that was the rest of my life, done, everything changed. Now, I look back at that time and it’s a blank. 10. Chips do not travel well. In the second year since our kid was born, the Friday-night takeaway has become a staple. However, if there is one thing I have worked out, it’s that if you get one of those apps to send you food, chips do not travel well. They go soggy very fast. And cold and soggy chips do not make Friday night feel like you made it out and you’re living your best life. Eating your soggy cold chips in front of an episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine can sometimes feel like you are not living your best life. No matter what the apps say. 11. They are always watching. Always. With our eldest, we have this routine. Forty-five minutes before bath and bedtime, we have tidy-up time followed by telly time. Every night. And the routine has worked perfectly for her. She will help to put away her toys, watch 30 minutes of television and then head up for a bath, almost on autopilot. Our youngest is always watching. I realised this last week when I sang the tidy-up time song. And our youngest, who is not expected to be part of the tidy-up time routine, picked up a rattle and a doll and walked over to the box they both belonged in, before throwing them down. She is now part of the routine. Tidy-up time is hers, too. 12. I know nothing. This point bears repeating. Every time I think I have it all figured out, something happens to show me that I do not have a clue about what’s happening and anything I think is a given is a one-off. It keeps me on my toes. And boy, I would not have it any different."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/26/job-restructure-how-look-busy-motivated","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T14:30:12Z","webTitle":"I don’t have enough to do at work.

England arrived at the World Cup having failed to register from a corner at a major finals since 2010, encompassing 72 attempts stretching back to Matthew Upson scoring from Steven Gerrard’s delivery to give England hope in the 4-1 defeat by Germany in Bloemfontein. Yet Southgate’s team have scored from three in their first two Group G games, as well as winning a penalty, with seven of their 10 corners having resulted in an effort on goal, whether directly or via a flick on, or a spot-kick. Their fourth goal in the 6-1 rout of Panama was also cleverly constructed from a free-kick routine involving Kieran Trippier, Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling, leading to John Stones scoring his second goal of the game. The assistant manager, Steve Holland, worked within a Chelsea coaching setup that consistently ranked in the top five teams for set-piece goals in the Premier League. “But, if anything, Allan is spending more time on the set pieces,” said Southgate. “We’d identified them as key in tournaments, and an element we felt we could improve upon. “It helps if you have outstanding delivery and people who want to go and head the thing, of course, and we’ve got that. We’re giving it the right attention in training, and it was clear Panama were wary of it from the start. No matter how much you control the play at both ends, set plays are really important.” Russell, a 37-year-old former journeyman striker at lower-league clubs in Scotland and England, is a Uefa A licence coach, and has been on Southgate’s staff for around a year. During spells at US clubs such as Carolina RailHawks and Orange County Blues, the Scot has witnessed at first-hand the positional specialist coaching afforded to players in that country. “We’d been spending a lot of time on set pieces,” said Ruben Loftus-Cheek. “Right down to the details, all the runs and the blocks. To see it coming out on the pitch is great.” “Allan does finishing sessions with us, tells us about opposition defenders, goalkeepers, and tells us maybe where we can exploit a weakness,” said Kane, who might have earned two further penalties after being impeded at corners either side of half-time against Tunisia. “We are all top players, so he is not running through technique or telling us how to strike a ball. It’s just little stuff to maybe give us an edge. He does our attacking set plays, which are going pretty well so far, and we do a lot of work on it in training. Every little helps – particularly the little details at this level in a World Cup.” Southgate had identified that 11% of goals at the 2014 finals stemmed from corners, a slightly higher proportion than normal, but has also studied American sports to assess whether techniques used in NFL and NBA could be adapted for football. He has visited the Seattle Seahawks, attended the past two Super Bowls and spoken to set-play NFL analysts and NBA coaches to ascertain how players create space in tight areas, whether through the timing of their runs or by subtle and legal screening of opponents. Ashley Young’s block of Michael Murillo, who had been assigned to mark Stones, at England’s eighth-minute corner in Nizhny Novgorod arguably illustrated the technique. As a result, with Russell drilling the routines from St George’s Park to Zelenogorsk, England look thoroughly well prepared, with their first two opponents in Russia rendered vulnerable. It helps to have delivery of the calibre offered by Young and, in particular, Trippier, with the latter having learned from his club-mate at Spurs, Christian Eriksen. “It’s a crucial part of the game, and one we’ve targeted,” said the right wing-back. “We work on them, defensively and offensively, and we’re being rewarded.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jun/25/delay-on-third-runway-served-heathrow-owners-well","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T18:38:05Z","webTitle":"Delay on third runway served Heathrow's owners well | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jun/25/delay-on-third-runway-served-heathrow-owners-well","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jun/25/delay-on-third-runway-served-heathrow-owners-well","fields":{"headline":"Delay on third runway served Heathrow's owners well","bodyText":"The true scandal in Monday’s Commons vote on expansion at Heathrow wasn’t Boris Johnson’s absence but the fact that the government presented a plan that looks suspiciously like a charter for the airport’s private-sector owners to milk passengers and get other people to pay for their cost overruns. Whatever your view on the expansion of Heathrow, it ought to be easy to agree that if a third runway is going to happen at a (current) official estimate of £14.3bn, it should be 100% clear who is on the hook if costs explode. The government has danced around the question, with transport secretary Chris Grayling offering vague lines about how a third runway must be “affordable” and be built “at a sensible cost” without defining what he means in figures. The airports national policy statement – the key document in the process – was 91 pages of flimflam. It simply stated that the final proposal should be “cost-efficient and sustainable” and seek “to minimise costs to airlines, passengers and freight owners”, with the Civil Aviation Authority left to sort out the details. Good luck to the CAA but one suspects it will be no match for Heathrow’s battalion of lobbyists. At a minimum, the government should oblige Heathrow’s owners – led by the Spanish firm Ferrovial, with a 25% stake, and the Qatar Investment Authority, with 20% – to inject many billions of pounds in upfront equity capital into their company to ensure the scheme can withstand the inevitable delays and surprises. As things stand today, Heathrow’s use of debt – £13.5bn at the last count – is so extreme that even Carillion’s bosses would have blushed at the leverage ratios. Unlike at Carillion, however, if a financial emergency were to materialise with the third runway, there isn’t a credible option of letting the company fail. The airport is too important to the UK – and the owners know it. So, if costs explode and risk equity remains minimal, the CAA would be drawn into a negotiation. The owner would want higher landing charges from airlines to service its debts and the regulator would come under huge pressure not to thwart a project carrying so much political prestige. That negotiation, one can guess, would be one-sided. Therein lies the scepticism from the airlines. Craig Kreeger, the chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, called in February for Heathrow to be forced to give a “passenger cost guarantee”, adding: “They have the most information on how likely the costs are to be deliverable – and they should bear the risks of their estimate being grossly, grossly off-target.” The airlines are not disinterested players, of course, since a third runway would bring more competition for them – but it is surely reasonable to expect Heathrow’s owners to prove, upfront and transparently, that they will have a big cushion of risk capital in place. Simply pleading, as Heathrow does, that its owners are wealthy international investors with reputations to protect is not the same thing. It is hard to escape the conclusion that delay, confusion and political in-fighting has served Heathrow’s owners well. Parliament has been asked for approval even before the airport has decided whether part of the M25 should be sunk into a tunnel to make room for the new runway or whether the runway should be built on stilts. That little detail may turn out to be important. Politicians seem so exhausted by the effort of getting the project across the line that detailed risk allocation has been left for later. One day, one suspects, the report from the National Audit Office will be a riveting read. Where is the Brexit voice from UK employers? First it was Airbus, then Siemens, now BMW. It would be useful if some large British-owned employers, if they feel similarly, spoke up about the potential damage to their supply chains from Brexit.

No doubt his strong support for the EU has something to do with it, but perhaps his sudden rise to wealth through a single, well-timed bet is also part of the fascination. In 1992 Soros was a relatively unknown hedge fund trader. Then he decided to place a bet that would make him legendary. An outrageously risky bet with potentially momentous consequences: he bet against the British economy. This was in the run-up to the infamous Black Wednesday, when the Bank of England was aggressively buying the pound on foreign exchange markets to defend its overvalued position in the exchange rate mechanism, the system that attempted to fix the rates of European currencies against each other in preparation for the single currency. By August 1992, Soros had bet at least $1.5bn on the pound. He began short-selling – a technique used to profit from the falling price of a stock. In this case, Soros bet that the Bank of England would not be able to defend the value of the pound and that, when it fell dramatically, he would make massive gains. His bet paid off, making him a profit of about £1bn. So, what if the Brexiteer’s obsession with Soros stems from similarities between his good fortune and the bounty claimed by hedge funds betting against the pound on the night of the referendum? There has long been speculation surrounding Farage’s interview with Sky News on the evening of the EU referendum, when he appeared to concede defeat. On Monday detailed analysis by Bloomberg noted that his “concessions” that night could have helped hedge funds make millions off the back of the pound’s collapse following the true Brexit result. With early suggestions that remain had won the day, the pound leapt to its highest mark against the dollar in six months. But hedge funds had hired the services of an array of pollsters in the days leading up to the referendum, selling them advance information – including data that would have been illegal for them to give the public. Buoyed up by private exit polls, which showed victory for the leave campaign, hedge funds were perfectly placed to earn fortunes by short-selling the British pound. Bloomberg raises important questions about whether Farage, a former commodities broker with many friends and backers in the financial sector, said remain had won with the intention of benefiting hedge funds who stood to gain from a sudden drop in the pound. Farage told Bloomberg his concessions were not aimed at moving the markets for anyone, and told MailOnline that he did not try to mislead people by conceding defeat. But speculating on Brexit has made at least one very rich Brexiteer that bit richer. Crispin Odey was one of the largest donors to leave, handing over just shy of £900,000 to the campaign. On hearing the referendum result, Odey said: “I feel fantastic. It’s a fantastic decision by the electorate.” Odey had a special reason to feel “fantastic”. He’d bet on Brexit hitting the pound by “shorting” sterling and moving 65% of his fund into gold in anticipation. Odey’s fund made £220m in the space of just a few hours. As he said at the time: “I think I may be the winner.” Hedge funds make money by betting on economic events, and hit the big time during the turbulence caused by the 2008 financial crisis. EU policies designed to restore stability to financial markets, such as the 2012 short selling regulation , are anathema to this sort of investor. Odey has voiced his objection to tighter EU regulation of hedge funds and has claimed that new EU banking rules will contribute to a “terrifying” environment for “investors”, although a distinction between investors and gamblers might be helpful here. Hedge funds, including the one run by Odey, made some big wins by betting on the damage Brexit would do to the pound and UK stock markets. Some of his hedge funds have since lost significant value, but if the UK actually leaves the EU, the ensuing volatility will create excellent conditions for them to roll their dice again. He’s already banking on Britain’s largest firms performing badly in the wake of Brexit. But such is financial engineering that you don’t even need to bet on something going in a particular direction – you can also bet that uncertainty itself will go up or down. The threats posed by leaving the EU to the many – our jobs, rights and protections – seem to be benefiting an elite few. These City wide boys – the real “bad boys” of Brexit – have used and continue to use Brexit as a way to swell their own wealth and power. This could be the ultimate big short, and a victory for disaster capitalism. It seems that Soros was right in his prediction: “A vote for Brexit would make some people very rich – but most voters considerably poorer.” • Molly Scott Cato is the Green party speaker on economy and finance and spokeswoman for EU relations"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/25/luis-suarez-uruguay-russia-world-cup-2018-group-a-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T15:53:19Z","webTitle":"Luis Suárez leads way for Uruguay to spoil 10-man Russia’s party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/25/luis-suarez-uruguay-russia-world-cup-2018-group-a-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/25/luis-suarez-uruguay-russia-world-cup-2018-group-a-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Luis Suárez leads way for Uruguay to spoil 10-man Russia’s party","bodyText":"The more phlegmatic among Russian observers tend towards the view that, vibrant and positive as the early stages of this World Cup have been, it would be wise to extract every last ounce of fun from the party because reality will soon bite back. At some stage life will return to normal and the euphoria around the national team’s performance is one uplifting aspect that, on this evidence, may not last a great deal longer. This defeat had no impact on their progression from Group A but it was a reminder that, faced with practised opponents and a dash of quality, they will hit a ceiling on any normal day. Uruguay sailed past them with an efficient, unfussy display, aided by an early Luis Suárez free-kick and an own goal from Denis Cheryshev. By the time Edinson Cavani had sealed things the game had long since fizzled out and Russia, who lost Igor Smolnikov to a first-half red card, must now seek to make this a bump in the road rather than a juddering halt. “Luzhniki is my stadium. I love it,” said Stanislav Cherchesov, finding a positive in the fact that his side will now play their round of 16 tie at Russia’s flagship venue on Sunday. They rose to the occasion in demolishing Saudi Arabia there on the opening day; expectations had been damningly low before that game and perhaps the scaling down of projections that will follow this comprehensive defeat may work in their favour. But in practical terms they could not cope with Uruguay, who have played within themselves throughout the group stage but finished top with no real alarms. Russia will need more than their manager’s happy sense of place if they are to eke any more from a slung-together group who are already unlikely heroes. Cherchesov might feel, in any case, that Russia should have made more of the 42,000-capacity Samara Arena, which was witness to a more raucous, partisan atmosphere than local fans had produced in Moscow or St Petersburg. It was a slight surprise to hear jeers at the end although, in fairness, that seemed little other than a routine reaction to losing. Russia had never played here before and, even when the game had drifted away, nobody seemed minded to let the occasion slide by. The entire buildup had felt fresh: the boisterousness of a provincial city equipped, given the positive swing in sentiment, to love its team. Suárez’s goal was nonetheless a buzzkill at the time and, in creation and execution, was the perfect example of what happens when errors creep in against quality adversaries. Saudi Arabia or Egypt would probably have let Yuri Gazinskiy off the hook when he played a stray pass into his own half, but a prowling Suárez tends not to forgive, and set in train a move that ended with Gazinskiy fouling Rodrigo Bentancur. The position of the free-kick, 18 yards out and central, already looked a gift for Suárez and the defensive wall’s preference for wrestling over structural integrity opened up the perfect angle. He swept low inside Igor Akinfeev’s left post and Russia’s momentum had floundered. “When you see such errors I believe you give your opponent the opportunity to do whatever they want,” Cherchesov said, before pointing out that his players had spent Sunday defending set pieces in training only to be undone, in one way or another, by three of them. Uruguay’s second goal came from a half-cleared corner but was lucky, Cheryshev unable to avoid being struck by Diego Laxalt’s wayward shot and seeing the ball fly past a scrambling Akinfeev. The sequence, though, was a handy encapsulation of Russia’s day: Cheryshev, who had come in from the cold to score three times earlier in the tournament, was now the unwitting victim of an unhappy but costly accident. He had, in fact, started the game brightly but did not last the duration of the first half. Again it was not his fault: when Smolnikov, already booked, hacked down Laxalt a red card was the only plausible outcome and Cherchesov needed to shore things up. On came Mário Fernandes, the right-back who had been one of three players rested after two energy-sapping displays. If things had clicked into place in the previous fortnight, now everything was that little bit awry. They were more stable in the second half, although Uruguay should have scored more. Eventually Cavani buried a rebound after Akinfeev had saved Diego Godín’s header from a corner, and a strike of no singular merit may prove more significant than it looked. Cavani had looked like a man who needed a goal in each of Uruguay’s group games; now he has one and, like his team, appears to be going through the gears at the right time. “Let me put the brakes on,” was Óscar Tabárez’s response when asked excitably whether his side could go on to be champions. It seems like a stretch; they need to play a genuine contender before anyone can judge, but looked more balanced here and Bentancur, in particular, showed some expressive touches. “Russia did not put us in a corner; we did that to them, at least in the first half,” Tabárez continued. They tend to save their more pugnacious fare for the big guns so this may have been a valuable sparring exercise. The question is whether Russia have any more fight. Cherchesov feigned surprise that nobody applauded him at the end of his press conference, as has become the custom after Russia’s World Cup games. “We’ll do it on the 1st,” a voice responded, but it will take some showing for the volume to reach fever pitch again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jul/01/beauty-tips-hot-showers-and-singalonga-moisturiser","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Hot showers and singalonga moisturiser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jul/01/beauty-tips-hot-showers-and-singalonga-moisturiser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jul/01/beauty-tips-hot-showers-and-singalonga-moisturiser","fields":{"headline":"Hot showers and singalonga moisturiser","bodyText":"Sometimes I feel like there are mini-fireworks inside me, sparks rushing through my veins.

Five thousand miles separate the Texas-Mexico border from Folkestone in Kent, where Bashir Khan Ahmadzai sleeps in a child-sized bed underneath a calendar that is two years out of date. However dire, his situation will not draw the TV anchors or be commemorated by a Getty photographer. Yet the more I turn over his story, the more troubled I am not just for him, but for what it says about our politics and our media. To scream at the barbarian in the White House, to denounce Italy’s thuggish deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, to shudder at Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán: such acts come easily to decent politicians and pundits. And so they should, because each of these men normalises a racist brutalism. Yet to stop there is merely to play liberal pantomime. The harder, but just as essential, task is to look away from the TV screens and headlines and spot signs of the same casual racist brutalism at home, in our political system, in a case such as that of Ahmadzai. The term everyone uses for Ahmadzai is “vulnerable”. His friends say it. People who work with him say it. Even tough-minded judges use it, again and again. And when you meet him, as I did last week, you see why. He is skin and bones and wide brown eyes, and he wears on each ear a hearing aid that fizzes static. The authorities have him down as 21 years old, but that seems a stretch. His housemate Khalil Niazi says: “He is like a child. I make sure he’s OK.” Ahmadzai certainly came to Britain as a child, nearly six years ago, from provincial Afghanistan. His father, a policeman, had just been murdered by the Taliban. Then they came looking for him, he recalls, and his mother sent him away. On arrival in Britain, the boy applied for asylum but somehow it was recorded that he had grandparents in Kabul who could look after him. Ahmadzai denies ever saying such a thing, while Niazi reckons the interpreter just didn’t understand him: “My other Afghan friends – even they can’t catch what he’s saying.” Court documents I have seen agree he has “complex speech, language and communication difficulties”. Still, that point about having relatives in Kabul followed him through the system and helped to ensure he was given not asylum but temporary leave to remain here while a minor. Now he’s apparently an adult, and has to report regularly at Lunar House immigration centre in Croydon, on the outskirts of London. Last month, Ahmadzai went in to sign on as normal. It should have taken moments, but the official asked him to stay behind for a while, which turned into hours, which turned into him being transported to Brook House – the low-rise block near Gatwick airport where the government often warehouses Afghans and others before forcing them on to planes out of the country. He was locked in a small cell: a toilet, a bed, a small window he couldn’t see out of, and a spyhole to allow officials to look in. There was shouting and planes roaring overhead and he had no idea what was going on. But when he told the officers that he wasn’t well, that he had health problems, that he felt weak from fasting for Ramadan, they kept silent. Instead, they told him, rudely, brusquely: “We’re going to deport you.” They said it so often it became almost a chant: “We’re going to deport you, we’re going to deport you, we’re going to deport you.” Afghanistan, according to the Home Office’s own guidance, is “the second-least peaceful country in the world after Syria”. In each of the past five years well over 10,000 civilians have died or been injured by roadside bombs, in suicide attacks, or from other forms of armed violence. The British government warns us against travelling there, yet it was happy to dump there a youth described by the courts as “dependent on others for his wellbeing and general welfare”. I ask what Ahmadzai would have done in Kabul. Even in Folkestone, he says, he can’t leave the house at night because gangs of boys beat him up. Then he imagines life in a country as broken as Afghanistan 17 years after a war begun by Britain and America and their other allies. His family is in the north-eastern province of Baghlan, where the Taliban is constantly taking towns – and he doesn’t even have their address. His friend Niazi translates this, then tells me in low, even English that he knows Ahmadzai can’t follow: “I think in Kabul he would die.” Knowing what we do about Afghanistan, this doesn’t sound hyperbolic. Yet our government was willing to take that risk with a highly vulnerable young man. The Home Office didn’t respond to my questions on his case but said: “We take responsibilities of health and welfare very seriously and we are working closely with partners to ensure Mr Ahmadzai is receiving the support he needs.” Yet of those “partners”, I understand that Kent county council did not know he was going to be detained, and his social worker wrote to plead for his safety. (The council did not issue an official response.) Ahmadzai did not sleep at Brook House. He would ring his friend and carer Niazi again and again: what was going to happen, what was he going to do? “He kept saying to me, ‘I’m scared, I’m scared.’” Then after four days, as suddenly as he’d been taken, he was released. However dramatic his story, it is worryingly common for Afghans. The immigration barrister Colin Yeo points out that the Home Office habitually detains hundreds of Afghans a year then releases three-quarters of them. It is a form of opportunistic gambling with people’s lives – bring them in, bang them up, then see if you can drag them into a seat on a plane where they will no longer be your problem. And if that doesn’t work, well, you’ve given them one hell of a scare. Just like those border guards do in El Paso. The British state helped to cause the mess in Afghanistan that forced Ahmadzai to flee – now it is punishing him for escaping it. At Goldsmiths, University of London, Prof Sue Clayton points out that from the early 2000s onwards, the Home Office regularly rounded up Afghans and dragooned them on to “ghost flights” from airport cargo terminals in the middle of the night. The practice only stopped in 2015, thanks to overwhelming protest. This happened under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron. Theresa May was the home secretary who petitioned for the likes of Ahmadzai to be forced out of Britain. These are not callous extremists but they had no shame about using some of the same tactics and going after some of the same targets, and they did so against a similar media backdrop. When the rightwing US commentator Ann Coulter describes crying infants at the Texas border as “child actors”, she is only doing bigger and bolder what our press and Tory MPs did when they described the child refugees fleeing the Calais migrant camp as being adults in disguise. An easy comfort resides in shaking your fist at the foreign monster on your plasma screen while ignoring the monstrousness done right here. There is a thin line between justified outrage and hypocrisy – and you cross it when you don’t examine the outrages perpetrated in your name. To believe this era of demeaning and dehumanising others simply because of their country of birth only began with the Brexit vote – that we lurched from 2016 straight into the 1930s – is to commit to flawed history and failed politics. To march against Trump while doing nothing when the far right turns out in their tens of thousands for Tommy Robinson is the kind of self-satisfied blindness that sees threats on distant shores but misses those right under its nose. Niazi knows about Trump’s new immigration policy. “What’s happening there is horrible; it makes me angry,” he says. “But look at the way the government treats Bashir [Ahmadzai] – they’re not showing him any compassion.” Ahmadzai has been asked to sign in again at Lunar House on Wednesday. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/24/gavin-williamson-allies-reject-reports-of-threat-to-topple-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T14:04:12Z","webTitle":"Gavin Williamson allies reject reports of threat to topple Theresa May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/24/gavin-williamson-allies-reject-reports-of-threat-to-topple-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/24/gavin-williamson-allies-reject-reports-of-threat-to-topple-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Gavin Williamson allies reject reports of threat to topple Theresa May","bodyText":"Allies of Gavin Williamson, the UK defence secretary, have moved to quash reports that he had threatened to topple the prime minister unless defence spending was increased, but warned there was significant backbench anger over Theresa May’s refusal to confirm the UK would remain a “tier one” military nation. Williamson is scheduled to meet Philip Hammond in the next fortnight in a attempt to secure concessions ahead of a Nato summit in Brussels in July, following a tense meeting with May and the chancellor last Tuesday, which ended without any promise of further funding. After the meeting, May declined to confirm the UK should remain a “tier one” military power, a defence term referring to the full spectrum of military capabilities, including nuclear weapons. May said only that the UK was “a leading defence nation”, despite being asked to use the specific phrase “tier one”.Conservative MPs have expressed concern both privately and publicly about the comments. “There is certainly a large cohort of backbench Tory MPs who were deeply concerned at the lack of backing for the UK remaining a ‘tier one’ nation,” one defence source said. “It would be massively reassuring for the party and the military if she was to confirm it and use those terms.” Williamson’s lobbying for more funding was backed by Julian Lewis, the chair of the defence select committee, who said the MoD needed similar sums like the £20bn extra given to the NHS “just to stand still”. He added: “There needs to be no political risk to the PM if she does the right thing. I’ve been in parliament 20 years and have never known such unanimity.” However, some Tory MPs have voiced frustration at the tactics of some cabinet ministers. The former minister Nick Boles hit out at Williamson on Twitter, but also voiced frustration at the conduct of other cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson, who after being asked at a reception about bosses’ concerns over Brexit, reportedly replied: “Fuck business”. He tweeted: In a coded warning to her cabinet colleagues, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, is set to warn in a speech that it is “not macho” to demand more money for their departments and they should concentrate on fiscal discipline. “It is a tougher skill to demand better value for money and challenge the blob in your department,” she will tell the LSE on Tuesday, and add that the NHS funding boost was “exceptional”. Truss met Williamson this week to discuss defence spending, along with May and Hammond. A source close to the row said Williamson was “genuinely passionate about the military getting the right resources” but said it was far-fetched to suggest he was threatening May. “To suggest that the defence secretary is behind a plan to bring down the prime minister is absurd,” the source said. “He has been one of the most loyal people since she became prime minister, he never lost a vote as chief whip, he helped her broker the deal with the DUP to stay in power so she could keep her job and he continues to be her rock in cabinet. “Any other suggestion is completely unfounded. But as a former chief whip, he’s only too aware of the strength of feeling on the backbenches and people have been very vocal in their warnings.” The shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show Williamson was having “tantrums”, adding: “We don’t know for one minute whether he’s actually going to get that money.” On Sunday, defence minister Guto Bebb defended the government’s strategy, saying it was “meeting the Nato target and increasing the defence budget in real terms ever year”, but added it was “laughable” that Labour would spend more on defence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/24/zimbabwe-opposition-fears-crackdown-election-rally-bombing-emmerson-mnangagwa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T08:29:09Z","webTitle":"Zimbabwe opposition fears crackdown after election rally bombing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/zimbabwe-opposition-fears-crackdown-election-rally-bombing-emmerson-mnangagwa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/zimbabwe-opposition-fears-crackdown-election-rally-bombing-emmerson-mnangagwa","fields":{"headline":"Zimbabwe opposition fears crackdown after election rally bombing","bodyText":"Opposition leaders in Zimbabwe fear the bombing of a ruling party election rally on Saturday will serve as a pretext for a wide-ranging crackdown by the government or the military in the southern African state. The attack at the White City stadium in Bulawayo apparently targeted the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. At least 49 people, including both of Zimbabwe’s vice presidents, were injured by the explosion that occurred close to the VIP podium immediately after Mnangagwa finished his speech. Mnangagwa later called for peace, love and unity in Zimbabwe and pledged that the attack would not derail what has been a largely peaceful election campaign so far. The upcoming election is the latest turning point in the most tumultuous few months in almost four decades of Zimbabwe’s political history. In November, Robert Mugabe was forced out of power after 37 years, following a peaceful military takeover supported by the vast majority of the 17 million population. The poll on 30 July pits Zanu-PF, the ruling party, against the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the longstanding opposition. MDC officials called for an independent investigation of the attack. “This needs an urgent and independent investigation so the culprits can be brought to book. Every reasonable Zimbabwean condemns this. We have to end this cycle of violence,” said David Coltart, a senior opposition leader. Tendai Biti, another senior MDC leader, said it was important to “find out what has happened because the fingerprints are so obvious”. Many opposition activists voiced concerns that the attack would be used as a pretext to crack down on their campaigning. “We’re going to have to see who they start picking up in the next few days. There is a huge worry. Are they going to use this to justify a clampdown on opposition people,” said one official in Harare, the capital. Zanu-PF is led by Mnangagwa, a former vice-president known as “the Crocodile” who took power when Mugabe was ousted. Polls indicate a potentially close race, but one that Zanu-PF should win. Past votes have been marked by systematic intimidation of the opposition and fraud, and the US and others have said a credible vote is key to lifting international sanctions. “The campaign has so far been conducted in a free and peaceful environment, and we will not allow this cowardly act to get in our way as we move towards elections ... Let us continue to be united and address our differences peacefully. The strongest response to violence is peace. The strongest response to hate is love,” Mnangagwa said in a statement on Saturday night. Derek Matyszak, an expert in Zimbabwean politics at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa, said the opposition’s concerns might be misplaced. “I don’t think [the authorities] will start closing down the democratic space for the MDC but we could well see a more extensive military deployment around the country,” he said. The MDC have long complained that voters, especially those in rural areas, are intimidated by the presence of soldiers and thus more likely to support the government. There is no indication of who might be responsible for Saturday’s attack. There have been frequent allegations of assassination attempts directed at Mnangagwa and other senior politicians, these have not involved bombings or firearms. Mnangagwa said on Twitter that he was awaiting further information about the blast but added, without elaborating, that those responsible must have come from “outside Bulawayo”. He added: “I can assure you these are my normal enemies.” The November crisis was the culmination of a lengthy power struggle between a faction of young politicians led by Mugabe’s wife Grace and supporters of Mnangagwa. Opinion of Mnangagwa is divided among western diplomats and analysts in Harare. Some are convinced the president wants to be seen as the statesman who has restored democracy in Zimbabwe and who would step down if defeated. Others say he “does not have a democratic bone in his body”, but has pragmatically recognised the need to win international legitimacy if his country is to access the financial assistance it so desperately needs. Zimbabwe last experienced explosions at rallies in the 1980s, when Mugabe was targeted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/24/shorten-plays-down-talk-of-rift-with-albanese-after-labor-manifesto-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T05:15:55Z","webTitle":"Shorten says he's not offended by Albanese's Labor manifesto speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/24/shorten-plays-down-talk-of-rift-with-albanese-after-labor-manifesto-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/24/shorten-plays-down-talk-of-rift-with-albanese-after-labor-manifesto-speech","fields":{"headline":"Shorten says he's not offended by Albanese's Labor manifesto speech","bodyText":"Bill Shorten has played down suggestions of tension with Anthony Albanese over a speech in which Albanese laid out his Labor manifesto with a greater emphasis on aspiration, growth and cooperation with business. On Sunday Shorten said there was “nothing in that speech which caused me any offence at all” when asked about Albanese’s Gough Whitlam address delivered on Friday. The speech from Shorten’s rival in the 2013 leadership ballot has been widely interpreted as a sign Albanese will put pressure on Shorten in the event that Labor stumbles in five byelections to be held on 28 July – and the Coalition has been eager to play up suggestions of division in the opposition. Despite the risks to Labor in two marginal seats facing byelections, a new poll by ReachTel for the Australia Institute, released on Sunday, showed that Labor’s Susan Lamb had improved to a 50-50 two-party-preferred result in Longman from a 52-48 deficit earlier in June. The same poll contained bad news for the Liberal candidate Georgina Downer in Mayo, finding that she trails Centre Alliance’s Rebekha Sharkie by 38% to 62%. Campaigning in Longman with Lamb on Sunday, Shorten said he encouraged “my members of the united Labor team to put forward their views on the fair go”. The Labor leader said he had had an “amicable chat” with Albanese since Friday’s speech. “He said he thought [reaction to the speech] was overblown and I agreed with him,” Shorten said. When asked if Albanese should have given Shorten more credit, he replied that in the version of the speech he saw there “was some reference to me, which is nice”. Albanese said it was not good enough for Labor to argue it should be elected because “the other mob are useless”, adding that “from Bill Shorten right through Labor’s team, that is not our approach”. He also credited Shorten and the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, for “acting in the reform tradition” for proposing changes to negative gearing and other taxation. Albanese said Labor “doesn’t have to agree with business on issues such as company tax rates, but we do have to engage constructively with business large and small”. Shorten said Labor was “not concerned about ourselves”. “We’re concerned about the people,” he said. “I think most Australians are sick of politicians talking about ourselves, they want us to talk about the people.” Malcolm Turnbull weighed in on Sunday, saying Labor had demonstrated again and again they were “hopeless” at economic management and its alternative plan in opposition was even worse. “No wonder Anthony Albanese is criticising it,” the prime minister told reporters in Sydney. “He must be just tearing his hair out to see the way Bill Shorten is abandoning literally years of what the Labor party used to stand for.” On Sunday the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said Labor’s opposition to cutting company tax to 25% for companies earning more than $50m “puts Australian workers at a competitive disadvantage”. “[Shorten] should be condemned for that and, I mean, I agree with Anthony Albanese,” he said. Shorten responded that the government was “desperate to leap on any distraction” and was trying to “bully Labor and bully me into voting for these tax cuts this week with some simplistic name calling about being anti-big business”. “Let me make clear my views on big business: I will work with big business, I just won’t work for big business. “I’m not anti-big business. I’m just pro-worker. I’m pro-small business. I’m pro-farmer, pro-pensioner.” On Sunday the shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, said he believed Labor had engaged constructively with business under Shorten. “I had a look at that speech that Anthony Albanese gave after I saw that there was a bit of a fuss about it in the papers, and I don’t necessarily think that Anthony’s interpretation is different from the broader interpretation from Bill and from others,” he said.

Arnovis Guidos Portillo holds his mobile phone away from his face as he struggles to hold back tears, but his six-year old daughter, Meybelin, can still be heard on speakerphone, asking when she will be released from custody in an American detention centre. Though he knows it’s a lie, he tells her that she can’t return to El Salvador because the US government’s plane is broken; the truth is that he has no idea what will become of her. “They’re going to bring you home soon,” he says. “They haven’t fixed the plane.” Portillo, 26, was separated from Meybelin in McAllen, Texas, on 27 May – over three weeks after the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy”, mandating children of undocumented migrants would be removed from their parents. Since then, 2,575 have been separated from their parents. He has spoken to her three times since he was deported to El Salvador on Thursday, but he has no answers to her questions. Donald Trump reversed the separation policy this week, but the US government has offered no plan for families to be reunited. According to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 2,053 children remain in foster care or shelters in the US. It is unclear whether Meybelin will be returned to her father. Portillo has been a single parent since he and Meybelin’s mother split up soon after she was born. He was holding his daughter’s hand when they turned themselves in to US border patrol agents in McAllen. He had hoped to ask for asylum, but says he was never given the chance before the pair were taken to a detention centre and he was charged with the misdemeanor of illegal entry. They were together for 24 hours before she was taken from him. Agents told him they would be reunited after his court date two days later. She never showed up. Portillo emerged from the reception centre for returned migrants at El Salvador’s capital San Salvador late on Thursday afternoon, dressed in the same dark blue shirt he’d been wearing when he fled home on 18 May. He embraced his girlfriend, Joanna Salinas, and piled into the back of a truck for the three-hour journey back to their village on the southern coast of El Salvador, where Portillo earns $7 a day growing corn for cattle feed and fishes on his days off. The windowless one-room house where he and Meybelin lived had been left untouched: her favorite white dress hung on a wire above her bed; her green bicycle leaned in the corner of the room. Portillo is talking to a visitor when the phone rings – it is Meybelin. “Hello, my love!” he says, his voice trembling with emotion. Gripping the phone tightly, he peppers her with questions: has she been given school work; has she gone to church; has she seen a doctor? “No,” she says. “Do you have any friends there?” “Just one,” she replies “Are there a lot of kids with you?” “Yes.” “Are there toys?” “No.” “Meybelin, I love you,” he says. “Me too,” she says. After the phone call, Portillo sits on his daughter’s bed with his head in his hands and wipes his face with his T-shirt, which is emblazoned with an American flag. He starts to cry. “It hurts,” he says. Portillo and his daughter left home on 18 May with just a backpack holding a colouring book and a change of clothes. It was the second time he had fled to the US – both times after death threats from the gangs that dominate his hometown. Since the end of its 1980-92 civil war, El Salvador has been ravaged by a horrific conflict between rival street gangs and the security forces. The country’s murder rate has dropped a little since it reached a peak of 104 per 100,000 citizens in 2015, but the violence has climbed again this year. “I always went to work with the fear I wouldn’t come back,” says Portillo. “The gangs are fighting for territory here. I can’t walk along the street alone for longer than 10 minutes – they’d kill me.” Portillo paid a smuggler a down payment of $2,000 to take them north, to meet up with his brother in Kansas, where he planned to work for the remaining $6,000 fee for their passage. The gruelling journey to the border took nine days, and included 52 hours in the back of a freezing truck. They travelled with his brother-in-law and a friend, who were also with their daughters. When they reached Hidalgo, the Mexican town across the border from McAllen, they crossed under the international bridge to dodge Mexican officials who would turn them back, in the hopes of finding US border agents to whom to hand themselves in and request asylum, he said. Portillo was transferred to an ICE detention center outside Laredo, Texas, where he was held for several weeks. He is unsure what became of the other two men, but he knows they too were separated from their daughters. Several other migrants with whom he was held had also lost their children. He describes seeing three agents hold a migrant down while another agent pulled the man’s child away. “All I hear is my daughter, crying. All I can see is her face when they took her – she was terrified,” Portillo says. El Salvador has said its consulate in the US is refusing to release the documents America needs to deport parents separated from their children at the border. But parents can ask to be returned without their children. Portillo says he eventually agreed to return on Tuesday after agents threatened him. “I signed because they hadn’t told me where my daughter was and they said they’d send her back to El Salvador right after me. They told me she’d stay detained until I signed the papers,” he says. “I regret signing, but the agents told me it was the only way I’d see my daughter again.” Portillo repeatedly asked where his daughter was, but the answers were always vague: “Florida or New York, maybe.” On Saturday, he finally got an answer, when an American lawyer, Jonathan Ryan, called to tell him that Maybelin was being held in a shelter in Phoenix, Arizona, run by the Texas-based non-profit Southwest Key Programs. Ryan is the executive director of Raices, an organisation providing legal services to immigrants along the Texas border, and he told Portillo they had taken up Maybelin’s case. According to Ryan, US officials have become more willing to refuse migrants their right to apply for asylum. “The Trump administration has devolved much of the authority in these individual cases to officers who are handling them. It’s all totally uncoordinated – people on the ground are making it up as they go along,” he said. “They have been planning this for over a year. Yet, from what we’ve seen, there appears to be no real plan to reunite children and their parents. Chaos is the goal.” With little government help, advocates and attorneys have stepped in to fill the void. Raices has received more than $17m since the administration started separating children from their parents, and a host of other legal aid organisations have taken on some of the more than 2,300 cases. Since January, 7,167 Salvadorans have been detained as part of a travelling family, according to US Customs and Border Protection statistics. While the harsh measures may deter some potential migrants, many say they will keep trying to reach the US. “This policy won’t stop most people – especially those asking for asylum. Their lives are at risk. They’d rather deal with the consequences, even with a small chance of success, than be killed,” said Alberto Xicotencatl, the director of a migrant shelter in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila. Portillo’s girlfriend Salinas, 19, says she hopes Portillo flees again to avoid being killed. But he is unlikely to get asylum, after Sessions ruled that those fleeing gang violence would no longer qualify. According to Ryan, it is too soon to say what will happen to Meybelin, but Raices is working to reunite her with her father. As he signs the papers authorising Ryan and his team to represent his daughter, Portillo looks down the road, and, speaking to no one in particular, says: “When she gets back, if she gets back, she’s going to ask me why I left her, why I didn’t stop them from taking her. I don’t know what I’ll tell her.” Reporting for this article was funded by an Adelante fellowship from the International Women’s Media Foundation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/23/sweden-janne-andersson-angry-germany-celebrations-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T23:31:27Z","webTitle":"Sweden’s Janne Andersson angry with Germany over last-gasp goal celebration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/23/sweden-janne-andersson-angry-germany-celebrations-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/23/sweden-janne-andersson-angry-germany-celebrations-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Sweden’s Janne Andersson angry with Germany over last-gasp goal celebration","bodyText":"Janne Andersson lashed out at the Germany coaching staff after seeing his Sweden team beaten by a sensational 95th-minute Toni Kroos winner, accusing them of gracelessness in victory and “rubbing it into our faces”. There were angry scenes at the full-time whistle after Germany’s 2-1 win, which resurrected their World Cup hopes. Both benches clashed with Andersson getting into a heated argument with Oliver Bierhoff, who is a member of Joachim Löw’s backroom team. Sweden had led at half-time through Ola Toivonen only for Marco Reus to equalise before Kroos’s last-gasp winner from a free-kick routine. They were heartbroken but know that a victory over Mexico in their final Group F tie will still see them qualify for the last 16. “Some of the group leaders of their team celebrated by running in our direction, rubbing it into our faces by making gestures,” Anderson said. “That really got me annoyed and angry. We had fought it out for 90 minutes and at the end you should shake hands. So I was very angry with that. “People behaved in ways that you do not do,” the Sweden manager added. “You should leave your opponents to feel sad. You do not act in the way they did. We reacted very strongly.” Sweden had been stunned when Jérôme Boateng’s clear last-man push on Marcus Berg did not result in the award of a 12th-minute penalty. Boateng would be sent off for a second bookable offence on 85 minutes – a reckless tackle on Berg. “I have not watched it but the people on my team who have say this is a clear penalty,” Andersson said. “If you have this VAR system, it is unfortunate that the referee feels so secure in the situation not to have a look. There are so many feelings around right now, but it is the most disappointing end to a game I have ever felt.” Kroos, who was at fault for Toivonen’s goal, suggested that he and his team-mates had been motivated by the impression they had that some Germany fans wanted them to lose and go out. The reaction to the team’s opening defeat against Mexico had been extreme. “Of course the first goal is down to me – no question,” Kroos said. “But you’ve then got to have the balls to play like that in the second half. If you play 400 passes in a game, sometimes two will fail. “The way we’ve fought until the end – we deserved to win. One had the feeling that some people in Germany would have been happy today if we were eliminated. But we’re not making it that easy for them.” Löw, the Germany manager, reported that centre-back Mats Hummels should be back to fitness for the final group game against South Korea after a neck injury. “I appreciated that we didn’t lose our nerves, we didn’t break out in panic after conceding,” Low said. “We kept a level head. I appreciated the spirit of the team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/23/mexico-juan-carlos-osorio-versatility-tactics","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T22:00:08Z","webTitle":"Versatile Mexico validate Osorio's tinkering with second World Cup win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/23/mexico-juan-carlos-osorio-versatility-tactics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/23/mexico-juan-carlos-osorio-versatility-tactics","fields":{"headline":"Versatile Mexico validate Osorio's tinkering with second World Cup win","bodyText":"One of the main criticisms of Mexico’s coach Juan Carlos Osorio in the lead up to Russia 2018 was his constant rotations of players, starting each of the 48 different games he coached during the lead up to the World Cup with 48 different line-ups. But on Saturday, with Mexico’s 2-1 victory over South Korea in the Rostov Arena, the hidden benefits of the strategy are becoming more clear. El Tri showed a new versatility as they were able to secure a win by keeping possession of the ball and deploying innovative offense, as opposed to their historic opening win against Germany that was based on solid defense and effective counter-attack. What all the rotations have accomplished, it seems, is that through trial and error the Colombian coach has been able to test and retest the success of different formations on the field. Now that he grasps how the strengths of individual players work in different combinations, he doesn’t have to switch up the starters during the big tournament. Only one player – Edson Alvarez – was substituted between last Saturday and this one. The switch turned out to be smart, with Álvarez’s superior speed helping to avoid attacks from South Korea’s Hwang Hee-Chan. The other change was moving Carlos Salcedo from a position of back forward to be a central defender, where he was able to be at the right place at the right time over and over again to cut off attacks. As jubilant Mexican fans broke out into renditions of “Cielito Lindo” in the stands, the Mexican players were able to thwart South Korea’s well-ordered defensive line with tactical discipline that drove the action to the sides of the field. The Mexicans knew how to create depth in their plays towards the goal by widening out their placement on the pitch. Mexican Miguel Layún, Hirving Lozano and Javier “Chicharito” Hernández dislodged the solid Korean defense by constantly carrying the ball to the flanks. The moves paid off in the first goal when Hernandez, a center forward, broke out to the left side of the field to receive a ball from Hector Herrera and he passed it to Andres Guardado. When Guardado tried to put the ball in the box, it met the hand of South Korea’s HS Hang, leading to the penalty that earned Mexico’s goal by Carlos Vela. Then in the second goal, “Chucky” Lozano was able to move quickly through the center to the left side to break away from South Korean players Lee Jae-sung and Moon Seon-min. From half court he delivered the ball to Hernandez, who dribbled it to squeeze a shot into the net. With that goal, Chicharito reached a new milestone in his career. He has now joined legends Rafael Márquez and Cuauhtémoc Blanco as one of only Mexicans in the country’s history to score at least once in three World Cups. The definition of a strong coach is one who has a solid enough read on his players to know how to perfectly deploy their talents in coordination with their teammates. On Saturday, it was Lozano’s strengths that were perfectly positioned. He showed off his ability to swing like a pendulum from side to side across the field. At minute 12 he moved swiftly from an offensive position all the way to the defensive side to block South Korea’s attempt at a goal. The most striking thing about the team’s moves against South Korea, however, were how different they were from the game against Germany. That match was dominated by control in the midfield, with Héctor Herrera and Andrés Guardado thwarting Germany’s attempts to drive plays through the center. It was also from the center that Carlos Vela consolidated his reputation as Mexico’s most creative player, when he was able to receive the ball from the midfielders and push it towards end zone and pass it off for Lozano’s epic opening goal. Now with the two wins under their belt, Mexico have taken a giant step toward a place in the knockout round where the real test still remains. El Tri have participated in six consecutive World Cups and never made it past the last 16. The key question is: will Mexico show up to its next game against Sweden with a totally different tactical plan that can be expertly executed? If the answer is yes, it could help to vindicate Osorio’s coaching decisions after months of withering critiques. Fans – many who were chanting Osorio’s name at the end of the game – are staying tuned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/23/toni-kroos-germany-sweden-world-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T19:59:06Z","webTitle":"Toni Kroos brings off late miracle for Germany to stun Sweden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/23/toni-kroos-germany-sweden-world-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/23/toni-kroos-germany-sweden-world-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Toni Kroos brings off late miracle for Germany to stun Sweden","bodyText":"Joachim Löw had been asked about the curse of world champions past. Three of the previous four World Cup winners had exited at the group phase – France (2002), Italy (2010), Spain (2014) – and the Germany manager knew his team stood to be the next. After the debacle that had been the defeat against Mexico in the opening Group F tie, the pressure was on. It pulsed against German temples because everybody knew that Sweden were likely to be a tough nut to crack. Their goalkeeper, Robin Olsen, had entered the game having not conceded since October last year. It was pretty much win or bust for Germany because even a draw would have left them without control of their destiny in the final round of group matches. On a wild night, they once again showed their defensive frailties and it was a glaring example of their indiscipline when Jérôme Boateng, who had been booked, leapt into a reckless 85th-minute tackle on Marcus Berg to leave his team with 10 men. But at the other end, they attacked with abandon during a thrilling second half and, with 18 seconds of the five minutes of stoppage time remaining, they got their reward, their reprieve. The angle to the left of the penalty area looked to be too tight for Toni Kroos as he stood over a free-kick. But he made it slightly better by touching the ball to Marco Reus, who gave it back and what happened next was a contender for goal of the tournament. Kroos’s technique was flawless, the bend on the shot wicked and it fizzed beyond Olsen into the far, top corner. Germany roared; Sweden were broken, even though a win over Mexico in their final game would see them qualify, and there were angry scenes upon the full-time whistle, as the rival benches clashed. “Some of the German bench celebrated by running in our direction and rubbing it into our faces by making gestures and that really got me annoyed,” Janne Andersson, the Sweden manager, said. “We fight it out for 95 minutes and then you shake it out and leave so I was very angry. People behaved in ways that you do not do. This is probably the most crushing end to a game I’ve experienced.” It was a result that got away from Sweden because, make no mistake, they could have been home and hosed at the interval, after a first half in which they scored through Ola Toivonen and might have had more. There was the highly contentious decision on 12 minutes not to award them a penalty after Boateng had pushed Berg when he was the last man, which looked to be the wrong call and the impression would only be strengthened with each TV replay. Don’t mention the VAR. The video assistants did not come into play. Löw was brave and fortune favoured him. He had made four changes from the Mexico game – the most eye-catching of which were the omissions of Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil – and he lost the former’s replacement, Sebastian Rudy, to a broken nose after half an hour. Rudy was bloodied after being caught, inadvertently, by Toivonen. Löw introduced Mario Gomez for the second half, with Timo Werner moving to the left wing and Thomas Müller pushing up as a second striker, and he and his players threw everything into the salvage operation. The sense of adventure was pronounced. Jonas Hector, the left-back, wandered into an inside-forward position at times and Löw’s final move in the 87th minute was dramatic. He withdrew Hector, despite being a man down, and sent on the attacking midfielder Julian Brandt, who promptly rattled a post with a ferocious drive. Joshua Kimmich and Antonio Rüdiger were the only recognised defenders on the pitch at the end. Thanks to Kroos, the gamble paid off. Kroos had been the villain for Germany in the first half. He gave the ball away, uncharacteristically, to Berg and, when it was worked wide, Viktor Claesson crossed for Toivonen. The striker took an excellent first touch on his chest and the second was even better – a glorious lob that gave Manuel Neuer no chance. Germany played on the front foot but the worry for Löw was how threatening Sweden looked in the first half on the counterattack; how easily they carved apart his team. It was extraordinary to see a German defence in such open and obliging mood. The penalty controversy followed a simple pass that set Berg clean through – the chasing Boateng not only shoved him, he also appeared to trip him – and when Emil Forsberg drove an opening on 44 minutes, he had two yellow shirts in glorious positions. Where were the defenders? He picked out Claesson but he decided against the first time shot, which was a bad move. Hector got across to tackle. Berg also worked Neuer with a glancing header. Germany had gone close early on through Julian Draxler and Hector while the substitute Ilkay Gündogan extended Olsen with a deflected long-ranger but they were a different team after half-time. Reus, who more than justified his selection ahead of Özil, got the equaliser from Werner’s cross and it was all Germany. Reus could not flick home with a trailing leg from Kimmich’s lovely cross; Werner lifted high; and, after Andreas Granqvist had extended Neuer at the other end, the 10 men almost snatched it only for Olsen to tip over from Gomez’s header. The sting in the tale was still to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/23/merchant-navy-wins-dramatic-diamon-jubilee-royal-ascot-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T18:03:53Z","webTitle":"Merchant Navy survives rough passage to win Diamond Jubilee at Royal Ascot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/23/merchant-navy-wins-dramatic-diamon-jubilee-royal-ascot-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/23/merchant-navy-wins-dramatic-diamon-jubilee-royal-ascot-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Merchant Navy survives rough passage to win Diamond Jubilee at Royal Ascot","bodyText":"A lot of drama can be packed into 72 seconds, as racegoers learned on Saturday while trying to absorb everything that happened in a wild Diamond Jubilee Stakes, won in a head‑bobbing finish by Merchant Navy. He would have been an unlucky loser having been shunted sideways by the third horse in the closing stages. But the runner-up, City Light, surely beat himself by rearing as the stalls opened while Harry Angel detonated any chance he had with his pre-race antics which reached a climax when he stuck a hind foot on a ledge along the side of the stalls shortly before they clanged open in front of him. Paddock watchers knew Harry Angel, the 5-2 favourite, was making things hard for himself from the trouble he gave as Adam Kirby was trying to mount him. He continued to play up in the stalls, kicking out with his hind legs, which was how he got his foot wedged awkwardly and sustained an injury, the extent of which will only become clear on Sunday. “Adam couldn’t see, because the horse had his stalls rug on,” Harry Angel’s trainer, Clive Cox, said. “The starter can’t see that, either. “It’s a dreadful shame. He got quite a bad puncture wound on his hind leg. It was very sore when he came off the track. So I just hope we can get him back as quickly as possible. With his leg being up on the side when the stalls opened, I’m worried that he might have pulled something high up, but we won’t know for an hour or two.” Harry Angel lost many lengths at the start, with Kirby looking round in the first few strides as if sensing something had gone wrong, but City Light made an even worse beginning to this race. As soon as the stalls opened he was up on his hind legs, giving everything else a start, though he reached top gear remarkably quickly after returning to earth and was within two lengths of the eventual winner after perhaps a furlong. “It didn’t look a race to begin with as there were horses everywhere,” said City Light’s trainer, Stephane Wattel. City Light gave the Deauville‑based Wattel his first British success after 27 years as a trainer when he won on all-weather finals day in March. Here, he came within inches of giving Wattel his first Group One race success anywhere. Instead, Merchant Navy did just enough to hold on after shrugging off the wayward US runner Bound For Nowhere, who leaned on him in the final furlong. The winner has only been trained for a matter of months by Aidan O’Brien, having been Australian-based until the spring. His former owners still have a stake in him and their celebrations were among the most raucous of the week here. His first trainer in Australia, Ciaron Maher, was present to see the colt make good on the promise he showed when based with him at Caulfield. While he is bound to reflect on what might have been if the horse stayed with him, Maher seemed genuinely elated. “They sold him for a fairly healthy sum. You can’t have your cake and eat it, but it’s just great to see the horse win. He’s come through our system. Now, to do it up here, he’s going to have a good time at stud. He’s going to be very busy in both hemispheres. “He’s got an unbelievable set of lungs and I think he’s still developing. He was a later foal. Look at the horse, he’d be better again next year.” Maher had hoped to have a runner at the Royal meeting last year until his Jameka fell ill. He promised to come back one day with a contender of his own. “It’s an unbelievable atmosphere and racecourse. It doesn’t get any bigger than this.” O’Brien’s aim now is to persuade Merchant Navy’s owners to let the horse stay with him at his Ballydoyle yard for long enough to run in next month’s July Cup at Newmarket. “The plan was that he’d run here and then go back to Australia, as I think there’s a lot of mares waiting on him there,” the Irishman said. He had thought the colt faced an “impossible” task at the weights with Redkirk Warrior, who beat him in Australia in March, but that rival was very disappointing and ran as though he had not coped well with his journey round the world. Royal Ascot-winning jockey fails breath test A jockey who did a sponsorship deal with a pub was stood down from competing at Royal Ascot. Charles Bishop, who started this week on such a high by winning the Queen Anne on the 33-1 shot Accidental Agent, was reported by the stewards to be above the threshold level for breath samples and had to give up his four booked mounts. “He’s ashamed and disappointed,” said Eve Johnson Houghton, the trainer of Accidental Agent, who had booked him to ride her Ice Age in the Wokingham Handicap. “Let’s hope he only does it once. It’s disappointing for him. They tell me he was only just over the limit. If his first ride had been in the second race rather than the first, he might well have passed.” Bishop declined to comment when contacted by the Racing Post. The news is tinged with irony, in view of a sponsorship deal Bishop struck two years ago with the George &amp; Dragon pub at Upton, close to the West Ilsley stables of his main employer, Mick Channon. Bishop posed for pictures at the time with the pub name written down the side of his breeches, but the deal has presumably lapsed as he was wearing plain breeches for Accidental Agent’s success. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Ascot said he had been pleased by how few incidents of bad behaviour there had been when the total attendance was expected to exceed 300,000. “There’s been evictions for the use of drugs,” Nick Smith said. “We’re perfectly up front about that. It’s minimal in the context of the crowd but it’s an important message that, yes, people have been evicted.” Smith said advance warning of the use of sniffer dogs had got a point across to racegoers about bringing drugs to the races. “Racing has acted very responsibly, hasn’t hidden from the issue.

The British designer mined the Dior archive for inspiration to pay tribute to the man who established the fabled brand in 1946. “The collection is really based on Mr Dior’s personal life,” Jones told the Observer at a preview in the Rue Marignan atelier. “It is the idea of looking at different parts of his life.” Jones made his debut in Paris on Saturday afternoon as artistic director for Dior Men, the rechristened Dior Homme, completing the changing of the guard for the spring/summer 2019 season. In a tribute to Dior and to his own heritage, Jones invited Prince Nikolai of Denmark to start the show. “I’m half Danish and Mr Dior always had that thing with royalty, and so I thought it would be nice to open with a prince – quite glamorous isn’t it?” Jones had only been at the brand for three months, following his departure from Louis Vuitton in January, and admits he didn’t have much time to dig deep. The elements he focused on in this first collection, however, will resonate with aficionados of the fashion house. Toile du jouy patterns from the wallpaper in the first Dior boutique were used on jacquards and leathers; botanical emblems referenced Dior’s love of horticulture; the famous cut used by Dior himself inspired the tailoring and the name of the new jacket, the Tailleur Oblique; and pink and grey, shades synonymous with the brand, were used throughout. This aesthetic approach lends itself to a softer, more relaxed Dior Men than we are used to seeing. Jones’s predecessor, Kris Van Assche, who has since moved to fellow LVMH-owned brand Berluti, favoured dark palettes and sharp tailoring during his 11-year tenure. Before him, Hedi Slimane was lauded for his skinny suits – Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld was said to have lost more than 40kg to fit into one of Slimane’s creations. The show notes said that this was about “translating a quintessentially feminine couture identity into a masculine idiom.” This intention mostly resonated with the striped tailoring that appeared to be similar to the lining of a suit, but had sheer organza overlays. It is also a progression from the streetwear influences of which Jones was a proponent during his time at Vuitton. He was the man behind its sellout collaboration with Supreme last year. “I’ve moved away from that a bit,” he explained. “[That’s] easy modern menswear; this is a lot more elegant and sophisticated and a little bit romantic too, which is what Dior is.” There were, however, sportswear influences; footwear featured trainer, shoe and boot hybrids, while baseball pumps and caps completed most looks. In the new Dior Men world order, this is representative of “contemporary masculinity”. To elevate the collection, Jones featured couture techniques with pieces such as the appliquéd feather and bead-embellished shirts. Trench coats were crafted from embroidered tulle and organza, while hand-sewn florals were layered with screen printed silk. Through transparent vinyl, florals and feathers – representing the ceramics found in Dior’s personal archive – could be seen. “We wanted to have very light touches, so that it has an ease to it and makes it effortless,” explained Jones. The bags will be a main takeaway from the collection. The brand’s famous Saddle bag has been made for the first time for men, and came in taupe and black backpacks, cross-body and belt-bags. The latter swung as the models walked to the sounds of Underworld’s Born Slippy and Orbital’s Halycon in a soundtrack mixed by the DJ Diplo. There were plenty of playful accessories that will, no doubt, attract a young audience. Dior’s favourite dog was called Bobby, so Dior Men’s jewellery designer, Yoon Ahn, created rhinestone-embellished dog-bone keyrings, as well as a perfume dispenser in the shape of the dog and its owner. Double rings (for two fingers) are made from precious stones, such as lapis lazuli, onyx and amethyst, while iPhone cases have finger grips spelling out the brand’s name so that “when you take a selfie in the mirror, you can see Dior”. Jones has also collaborated with New York-based artist Kaws, otherwise known as Brian Donnelly, on reimagining the famous Dior bee, the emblem synonymous with the house. This came embroidered on floral shirts, as well as accessories. Donnelly created a BFF doll (already popular on Instagram) dressed in clothes from the spring/summer 2019 Baby Dior collection. He also created the set for the show, with an imposing 10ft floral BFF version of Mr Dior – made from pink, white and black roses and peonies – holding a white version of the Bobby perfume bottle. Elsewhere, Matthew Williams of 1017 Alyx 9SM made the metal buckles seen on accessories, while milliner Stephen Jones reimagined headwear from the archive also. Jones is happy to share the limelight with his collaborators and encourages new design talent. The London-born Central Saint Martins graduate has been prominent on the fashion scene since his teens. After setting up his eponymous label shortly after graduating, Jones was headhunted by Dunhill to be its creative director, only to be poached by Louis Vuitton to design its menswear line three years later, a role he held for seven years. He has previously spoken of insisting on higher wages for his design team at Louis Vuitton when the number of collections they were producing per year increased along with revenues at the house. While Jones was in charge, revenues continued to grow at the brand year on year, while his Supreme collaboration was said by LVMH to have significantly contributed to its overall 23% profit increase in the first quarter of last year. Only two weeks before his Saturday debut, the 44-year-old was in London supporting friends Edward Crutchley and David Beckham at their London fashion week men’s shows. (Beckham was the first person to wear one of Jones’s Dior creations, at last month’s royal wedding). There’s a lot of love for Jones. Models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, who both walked the lap of honour with Jones as he took his final bow at Vuitton, Victoria Beckham, rapper A$AP Rocky, actor Gwendoline Christie and Kim Kardashian were among friends who arrived early in Paris to congratulate Jones in the Dior atelier as he completed final fittings. So too, was Virgil Abloh, Jones’s Vuitton successor, who showed his first collection on Thursday. Jones, who was there cheering, told the Observer that Abloh and his mentor, rapper Kanye West, used to sleep on his sofa 12 years ago when they were all trying to make it. “It’s nice to go full circle with friends,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27553","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-04T23:00:14Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,553","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27553","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27553","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,553","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27550","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T23:00:52Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,550","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27550","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27550","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,550","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/25/most-australians-dont-feel-gains-of-26-years-of-growth-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T18:00:35Z","webTitle":"Most Australians don't feel gains of 26 years of growth – poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/25/most-australians-dont-feel-gains-of-26-years-of-growth-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/25/most-australians-dont-feel-gains-of-26-years-of-growth-poll","fields":{"headline":"Most Australians don't feel gains of 26 years of growth – poll","bodyText":"After 26 consecutive years of economic growth most Australians either believe they have not benefited or don’t know if they have gained, according to a new poll. The national poll of almost 3,000 people for the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia is evidence of what it calls an “economic disconnect”, with perceived winners including large corporations and executives. The results are published in CEDA’s Community Pulse 2018 report, released on Monday, and provide grist for political arguments about addressing wage stagnation through tax cuts. CEDA is holding a two-day conference on the state of the nation in Canberra at the start of a sitting week in which the government will press on with a bill to cut taxes for companies earning more than $50m a year. After the Coalition passed its $144bn personal income tax cut package last week, it faces an uphill battle on company tax with One Nation, Centre Alliance and independent senators Derryn Hinch and Tim Storer all opposed to the final plank of its package. Labor has argued for an income tax cut package with bigger benefits for low- and middle-income earners and promised to block or repeal the company tax cut. The CEDA poll found just 5% of people “believe they have personally gained a lot” from 26 years of consecutive growth, compared with 40% who said they had “gained a little”, 44% who did not feel like they had gained at all and 11% who did not know. Some 74% of people thought that large corporations and senior executives had gained a lot. Other identified winners included foreign shareholders, white-collar workers and Australian shareholders. The CEDA chief executive, Melinda Cilento, attributed the results to “a decade of stagnant incomes and cost-of-living pressures in areas like health and electricity”, adding that: “Waning trust in business and politics are also likely factors.” Cilento said traction for economic reforms becomes more difficult “if the community feels removed from the benefits or have lost trust that the benefits from growth will be broadly shared”. “The poll results support this,” she said. “Key issues around supporting business competitiveness, from reducing the company tax rate and red tape to supporting new industry, ranked as least important for poll respondents.” The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, will tell the CEDA conference on Monday that after passing income tax cuts the Coalition is “equally serious” about passing the last phase of company tax cuts to “back businesses to invest and create more jobs”. In extracts of his speech seen by Guardian Australia, McCormack argues that income tax cuts “must be shared by all working Australians” by delivering the full seven-year $144bn package. “Under our plan, 94% of Australian workers will end up with a marginal tax rate of no more than 32.5% in the dollar – that’s compared with 63% if it had been left unchanged.” A ReachTel poll by the Australia Institute, released on Sunday, found that majorities in byelection seats Longman and Mayo thought that the tax rate for large companies should be increased or stay the same. The result is support by the CEDA survey which found lower company tax and less business regulation were among the least important national issues, along with a strong private school system, increased humanitarian intake of refugees, and fewer restrictions on using our natural resources. Respondents said the top priorities for Australia were high-quality public hospitals, limiting foreign ownership, high-quality aged care, increasing the pension and toughening criminal laws and sentences. Mode of employment was the strongest predictor of whether respondents felt they had gained from growth. Those working full-time permanent jobs mostly said they had gained a lot from economic growth (8%) or a little (50%), with those on contracts and self-employed also recording majorities who had felt growth. Just one-quarter of casuals with temporary employers felt they had gained, a figure rising to 30% for casuals with fixed employers. People in rural and regional areas and those over 50 also had majorities that did not feel they had benefited from growth. Some 31% of people reported they are finding it difficult to live on their current income, and almost one-third would like to work more hours to earn more. Some 79% of people said they believe the gap between the richest and poorest Australians is unacceptable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/25/centrelink-automation-hurting-australias-most-vulnerable-anglicare","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T18:00:35Z","webTitle":"Centrelink automation hurting Australia's most vulnerable – Anglicare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/centrelink-automation-hurting-australias-most-vulnerable-anglicare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/centrelink-automation-hurting-australias-most-vulnerable-anglicare","fields":{"headline":"Centrelink automation hurting Australia's most vulnerable – Anglicare","bodyText":"The automation of Centrelink is “deliberately designed to make it hard for people”, according to a new report from Anglicare Australia, with stories of errors, delays and up to two-hour phone wait times. Anglicare’s social workers said they spend so long helping clients with Centrelink they were devoting the equivalent of 343.2 full-time employees across Australia – 13,041 hours a week – just to help clients navigate the system. Kasy Chambers, Anglicare’s executive director, said automation and increasingly difficult processes were having a disproportionate effect on the country’s most vulnerable people. “The more vulnerable you are, the more likely it is that you have quite a complex issue,” she said. “Automation isn’t a problem in and of itself. But when you have a number of issues, that’s when it’s really difficult to interact with an automated system. “We are not having a go at Centrelink staff – they are as frustrated by this as we are. But there is a need for more tailored services. There are times when all of us would have a question too complex for a computer.” The report recommends the government boost funding to provide more flexible services, face-to-face options and training for staff to recognise and cope with customers with trauma or mental health issues. It also recommends a rise to the base rate of payments like Newstart. Social workers and recipients found many payments were “too low to achieve a minimum standard of living”. Five million Australians rely on income from Centrelink, and in 2016-17 there were 168,709 recorded complaints against the system, a rise of 54,974 from the previous year. The report attributes these complaints to the controversial “robo-debt” program and an increasingly difficult user experience. The survey of 218 Anglicare staff and their clients was conducted in southern Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia. It found that the equivalent of 6.6 full-time employees were spending their time dealing with just Centrelink issues – extrapolated to 343.2 staff nationwide. The survey collected stories from clients of long wait times, poor treatment and staff giving out inconsistent information. “The publicly stated average time [16 minutes] is never the experience I’ve had in all the years I’ve been contacting Centrelink,” one social worker said. “There is nothing under an hour.” One client said the information she received was frequently inconsistent and varied depending on who she spoke to. “There’s no predictability – it’s basically who you get on the day,” she said. In Tasmania, Anglicare workers pointed to a case where inflexible criteria for the disability support pension had led to an unreasonable delay in processing claims. New rules in 2015 required that applicants could only be assessed by doctors who had been contracted by the Department of Human Services. But there were no department-approved medical practitioners in Tasmania. This meant assessments had to be conducted by phone or video call with approved practitioners on the mainland. “My client was required to set up a Skype-type interview with a psychologist of Centrelink’s choosing but the Centrelink office would not make their computers available for this,” one social worker said. “We had to use an Anglicare laptop with a camera, install the software, complete a test ... If this client did not have a community service worker with her she wouldn’t have been able to complete the process and would have fallen at the last hurdle.” Sixty-six per cent of Anglicare’s surveyed staff said the anxiety and distress caused by Centrelink’s poor service meant clients often needed additional support in mental health and other areas. Thirty per cent said they spent so long on Centrelink issues it reduced the time they had to help other clients. “That’s what made us do the research,” Chambers said. “All staff sensed they were spending a lot longer dealing with sometimes quite simple Centrelink issues. “This would be happening to the Salvos, to Centacare, to anybody who is providing this kind of service. It’s not just Anglicare.” The general manager of the Department of Human Services, Hank Jongen, said vulnerable people could still access specialist support, and new staff had reduced phone waiting times. “The department is undertaking major business transformation which, when completed, will ensure a significantly enhanced customer experience,” he said. “We recognise that not everyone wishes to, or can access digital solutions. Our additional service options through digital channels has not reduced the ability for vulnerable people to access face-to-face support. “Those requiring an even more intensive level of support can also access our national network of more than 700 social workers and 230 specialist staff, including Indigenous and multicultural service officers. He said Centrelink could not comment further on the specifics of Anglicare’s case studies, but “we do recognise that there is always room for improvement”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/24/japanese-language-live-blog-world-cup-2018-japan-senegal","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T17:19:11Z","webTitle":"【ライブブログ】2018年W杯：日本2−2セネガル","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/24/japanese-language-live-blog-world-cup-2018-japan-senegal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/24/japanese-language-live-blog-world-cup-2018-japan-senegal","fields":{"headline":"【ライブブログ】2018年W杯：日本2−2セネガル","bodyText":"では、遅い時間までお付き合い頂き、誠にありがとうございました。28日（木）の24時にキックオフする、ポーランド戦も同じくライブブログで追求しますので、宜しければまた一緒にテンション高く試合を楽しみましょう！おやすみなさい！ とにかく、この後のコロンビア対ポーランドの結果を問わず、日本にとって3戦目のポーランド戦で引き分け以上では必ず突破できる、という状況になりました。 コロンビア対ポーランドの結果次第、ポーランドがどんな状況でその試合に臨むかが大きく変わるでしょうが、とにかく日本は2戦目を終えて強い立場にいます。 朝からお仕事という方も多くいらっしゃると思いますが、27時（朝3時）にキックオフする、ポーランド対コロンビア試合も日本にとって本当に大事な一戦になる。日本の都合でいえば、引き分けが理想的かな？いえ、コロンビアの勝利ではポーランドの敗退がその場で決まるので、28日（木）の日本対ポーランドでは日本にとって有利な状況になるでしょう。 忘れてはいけないのは、本田圭佑選手が2010年と2014年に続き、2018年W杯でもゴールを決め、3大会連続のゴールとなった点。コロンビア戦では投入されてから早速アシスト、今日は投入されてから早速ゴール。意外とスーパーサブの役割でも強力かもしれない。 香川真司選手が「1試合目から2試合目に向けて、改善がしっかりできた。繋げるように修正できた」というふうに指摘した。確かに、西野ジャパンになってからの短い間では、攻守ともに少しずつ纏まってきた気がする。 本田圭佑の試合後インタビューを要約すると： 「次、大事なんでね。ただ、コロンビア戦よりもいい戦いができたと思う。ポーランド戦は負けたら敗退もあり得る、大事な試合なんで、緊張感もあるんですけど、しっかりポーランドも分析して、チームとして準備したいと思います。」 今日も良い試合だったわ。勝てたのに、という思いも強いけれど、2回もリードを許してから2回も同点したというのは、評価しなければならない。これまで、「メンタル」が問題視されてきた日本代表が経験を生かして、苦しい状況でもぶれないチームになったのかも。 94分：大迫が右サイドで失って、セネガルのカウンターをファウルで止めた長谷部にイエロー。FKには何とか対応したのが、この試合でラストプレーだ。 93分：あと1分… 92分：今回はカットインする宇佐美が持ち過ぎてボールを失う。両チームがまだ、勝利にこだわっている。このままだと、本当にこのグループHが尚更予測しづらくなる。そしてセネガルのFKから3本の高いクロスが入ってくるが、大迫が勇気を見せて相手と接触しながらも強く頭でクリア。 90分：クリバリのロングフィードからセネガルのチャンスになりそうだが、その宇佐美がボールを受けて自ら運んで、ハーフウェイラインを超えたところでFKを獲得する。自ら起点を作れるというアピールになった。アディショナルタイムは4分だ。 88分：完全に私情を挟む発言にはなるが、ガンバ大阪のサポーターとして私はブレイクする前から宇佐美の活躍を見ているので、やはり26歳になった今こそ、W杯で爆発して欲しいという思いが強いな… 87分：日本、3枚目の交代。乾に代わって、宇佐美貴史だ。 85分：だが、セネガルも諦めていない。FWのマメ・ビラム・ディウフが準備しているが、どうやらニアンが負傷して、2トップにするのではなくそのまま入れ替えるようだ。吉田や本田といった経験豊かな2人がしっかりとコーチングして、集中力が落ちないようにケアする。 83分：前線の中央には2枚が居るので、乾が左サイドでよりワイドの位置を攻めるようになって、本田と酒井宏樹の居る右からサイドチェンジの可能性を感じる。 81分：バドゥ・ンディアイェに代わって、シェイク・ンドイェが入りました。しかし攻撃的な4−4−2、いえ、ほぼ4−2−4になった日本は攻め続け、またサムライブルーのペースになっている。 77分：2つの交代を経て、日本はどんどん高い位置から守備するようになって、レスターで活躍する岡崎も前線で岡崎らしさを見せて高い位置から起点を作っている。右サイドからのクロスをGKのK. ンディアイェがパンチングしようとするも合わず、左の乾まで流れる。そして冷静に本田まで折り返して、冷静に左足で流し込む。 また同点！！カモン！！ 74分：岡崎が投入の準備をしていたが、ワゲのゴールを受けて西野監督がプランを変えて、香川に代わって本田を投入した。そしてCKから大迫のシュートが、サネの手に当たったのか？VARの確認などないようだ。そして早速、日本が2枚目の交代も。原口を下げて、岡崎を投入。これで本田が右で、岡崎がトップ下かセカンドストライカーのようなポジションを取ったようだ。 70分：マネの個人技で左サイドのタッチライン付近からサバリへループパス。サバリがサイドからエリアへ攻め、グランダーのクロスをニアンが若干そらしてファーの右SB、ワゲが強烈で流し込む。スコアが1−2、再びセネガルがリード。 サールの飛び出しから少し元気を取り戻していたセネガルが再びリード。 67分：乾も原口もしっかりと守備も頑張っているが、スピードに乗ったサールに対するファウルで、乾がイエローをもらう。そして右サイドからセネガルのFKへ。 65分：セネガル、1枚目の交代。アルフレッド・ンディアイェに代わって、シェイフ・クヤテが入りました。 64分：惜しい！乾、クロスバー！大迫のヒールパスを受けて左サイドで裏を取り、右へ高いコースで柔らかいシュートを放つが、惜しくも惜しくも枠に当たる。 62分：サールが右サイドから自らボールを運んでエリアを攻めようとするが、日本がまた冷静に対応して逆襲へ。タイミング良く右の大外で相手の裏を取る酒井宏樹が何とかボールを残すが、最終的に大迫のクロスが失敗。 60分：絶好のチャンス！！柴崎が右サイドから相手ラインの裏に好コースでグランダーのクロスを入れるも、右足で流し込もうとする大迫が空振り。左足だったらどうかな… 58分：スタンドで試合を観戦するU19の日本代表選手が映像に抜かれる。中でやはり久保君が注目される。セネガルが後半からフィジカルも激しくなっている模様で、ニアンの上でが顔面に当たった昌子が倒れる。ニアンにはイエローが出ている。先程、長谷部もずっと鼻血が止まらなかった。 56分：宇佐美、本田、遠藤、酒井高徳らがウォーミングアップをしている。 55分：後半開始からセネガルがボールを支配することが多くなり、もう少し高い位置を取るようになったバドゥ・ンディアイェがシュートを試みて枠の外へ飛ばしたシーンもあった。またニアンがエリアの外からグラウンダーのシュートを放ち、川島の正面へ。 HT中、BBCではパブロ・サバレタがこんな話をしていたそうです。 「セネガルは2点目を取れなかった。コミュニケーションが良くなかったし、結果、長友に走られた」、ドログバ「右サイドはポジショニングが良くない。戻るところは戻らないと」、フィル・ネヴィル「1点目は川島のミス。あそこでパンチングはない。乾のフィニッシュはブリリアント」 https://twitter.com/route268/status/1010913859274620930 47分：後半開始からセネガルの方がボールを回し、サールのクロスからCKを獲得するが、柴崎が対応する。 後半は、日本が画面上の右側へ攻める。選手交代は無かったようだが、セネガルの並びはちょっと確認したい。 基本的にポジティブな流れになってきている中で恐縮ですが、ちょっと川島の話に一旦戻ろうと思います。様々な言葉をマスターするように若い頃から努力して、国内外ともに活躍するGKとして個人的にすごく尊敬しています。英語でインタビューさせてもらったこともあり、当時はベルギーでプレーしていたことから若干フランス語訛りで可愛らしくて流暢な英語で喋ってくれて感心しました。そして2010年～13年？の頃はプレーの活躍にも確かにあまり文句がありませんでした。 しかし、少しその判断が気になる試合が、ここ数年増えてきたことは否定できない。今日の失点もそうでしたし、コロンビア戦のFKもちょっと見る側として悔しかったです。39分、飛び出してニアンのチャンスをブロックしたのは確かに良い判断だったとは言え。 本当だったらハリル時代から東口や中村にもう少し出場機会を与え、W杯の前に世代交代の準備をしておけば良かったかもしれません。 11分、マネに先制点を許すも、少しずつ自分たちのペースで試合をコントロールするようになった日本は34分に乾のゴールで同点に追い付いた。ビハインドになった後の、日本代表の反応やプレーぶりがなんか、心強い。 45分：いやぁ、今回は日本の守備のプランが面白かった。ペナルティエリアのラインで相手と駆け引きを繰り返し、ボールが入ったところでエリアを攻めるセネガルの選手が全員オフサイドとなった。アディショナルタイムはわずか1分。 44分：セネガルが左サイドでCKを獲得して、グランダーをニアでそらすプレーが面白いが、日本はクリア。しかし、それが暫くしたら、左サイドでセネガルのFKへ。アルフレッド・ンディアイェが入れる… 42分：そういった、セネガルの縦の攻撃やカウンターを食らうことはまだまだ要注意だが、同点ゴールの後もほぼ完全に日本の時間帯と言って良いだろう。最初は相手選手に囲まれて少し静かっだ大迫が、益々目立つようになり、得意な後ろ向きのプレーでポイントを作れている。そして特に左サイドの乾と長友が積極的に攻撃に参加してオプションを提供している。 39分：と言いながら少し久しぶりにセネガルのチャンス。縦のフィードから吉田の裏を取ったニアンが放ったが、前へ飛び出していた川島がしっかりとブロック。 37分：この日本代表は勝負が強くなったかもしれない。相手の強い守備の組織を崩すのに苦労しそうな時間帯になっていたが、日本は冷静にパスを繋ぎ続け、収まったところから逆サイドでSBや2列目の選手がポジティブな動きを見せ、フィードの選択肢を提供し続けた。なかなか決定機に繋がっていなかったが、乾がワンチャンスを見事にものにした。 34分：如何に崩せるか、と言いながら崩した！昌子の斜めフィードを、左サイドを攻める長友が受けて折り返す。乾が受けて、ワンタッチでカットインして、低いコースで得意なシュートを左から右へ流して、ファーでキレイにゴールネットを揺らす。 日本、同点！！ 29分：セネガルの攻撃が終わって、SBやMFの選手が元のポジションに戻る前に日本が素早くカウンターを展開しようとしても、ナポリのクリバリを中心にやはり守備の組織が相変わらず良くて、タイミングを選んで高いところでうまく対応している。サイドの裏へ縦のボールを入れても、クリバリがSBの後ろまで流れて片付ける。如何にその相手の組織を崩せるのか。 27分：セネガルが右サイドで3本目のCKを獲得。ニアンが入れて、アルフレッド・ンディアイェが一旦受けるが、柴崎が何とか対応する。 24分：なかなか大迫や原口に良いボールが来ない。というのは、セネガルの中盤3人が非常に横幅狭く守っており、日本が中央で縦のパスを入れようとしてもすぐに囲まれてしまい、溜めを作るのが結構困難のようだ。 22分：ショートコーナーの作戦が失敗して、逆にカウンターを食らうことに。右サイドのクロスからサールが難しいシュートを放つが、力が入らず川島が拾う。また日本が直ちに攻めに行き、ハーフウェイラインを超えたところでFKを獲得。 20分：空中戦でセネガルが柴崎のクロスを跳ね返すが、またすぐ日本のボールへ。酒井宏樹が右サイドでサバリを相手に飛び出してCKを獲得。 19分：先制点を許してから日本はなかなか良い反応を見せている。激しくプレッシャーをかけに行くわけではないが、高いポジショニングを取り、相手のパスコースを遮ることによりGKのK. ンディアイェにロングキックを蹴らせている。そのロングキックを日本の最終ラインが回収して、素早く攻撃へ切り替える。左サイドでFKを獲得して、柴崎がクロスを入れる・・・ 15分：どうですかね、川島の判断… と膨らましたいところだが日本に初チャンス！左サイドの攻撃からまた中央、エリアの外で待っていた長谷部へ。低いコースのシュートを放つも乾に当たってしまう。 12分：セネガルが先制した！ちょうど打っていたところだが、「逆サイド」の対応が日本にとって非常に大事になりそうな流れとなっていたが、まさにそこで失敗してしまった。右SBのワゲがクロスを入れて、ファーで対応した酒井のヘディングに力が入らず左サイドのサバリへ。彼のシュートを川島が地面に近いところでパンチングでクリアしようとするが、ボールがマネに当ってゴールイン。 ちょっと… 10分：やはり「切り替え」が1つのキーワードになりそう。右のワゲに続き、左SBのサバリもかなり高い位置を取っており、酒井宏樹の外側と裏を狙う。セネガルは前線が3枚で、ニアンがその真中に居るが、彼もポジションを落としたりサイドへ流れたりして、ビルドアップに絡んでいる。 7分：ボールさえ収まれば、日本もテンポ良く攻撃できそうだ。バドゥ・ンディアイェも加わった、セネガルの中盤には確かに体の強い選手がいるが、大迫や乾、香川に一旦ボールを預けて素早く逆サイドまでパスを繋ぐことができたところから、日本もかなり素早く人数を前にかけている。 5分：どちらかというとセネガルのほうが切り替えが速く、右サイドを中心に縦の攻撃を繰り広げている。またCKを獲得するも、日本はまたしっかり対応。 3分：ニアンの蹴ったCKが逆サイドまで流れるが、セネガルのプレーが続いて2本目、3本目のクロスも入ってくる。しかし、日本はしっかりと跳ね返す。序盤は両チームが攻撃的なアプローチを見せていて、ボールが収まったほうからどんどん前を見て、早めに相手陣内に人数をかけてボールを回している。 2分：予想通り、日本は基本的に前戦と同じく4-2-3-1の並びだ。そしてセネガルはポーランド戦での2トップから、今日は4-3-3の模様だ。結構前から激しくプレッシャーをかけており、攻撃に人数をかけたい雰囲気をセネガルが出しており、右SBのワゲが早速攻撃に参加してグランダーのクロスを入れる。同じサイドでサールもボールを運んで攻め、CKを獲得。 日本がキックオフする。テレビ画面上、前半は左側のゴールを攻めることになった。 日本時間では日付が変わるところですが、皆様、まだ起きてますよね？大事な大事な試合が間も無く始まりますよ！もし良ければ、このページの一番上にある連絡先までコメントや質問などもどうぞ送って下さい。 続いてはセネガルの国歌、『Pincez Tous vos Koras, Frappez les Balafons』です。「コラを弾け、バラフォンを叩け」という意味で、西アフリカの伝統的な楽器のことだそうです。 国歌です。まずは君が代。 選手たちがトンネルで待機しており、間も無く入場です。ピッチ上では、両国の大きな国旗が広げられています。選手たちが階段を登り、入場！！ 今夜の会場となるのはエカテリンブルクです。天気は晴れの模様で安心しました。このスタジアムは、屋根の外側まで続く臨時スタンドが話題となっているのですが、21日のフランス対ペルー戦ではペルー人のサポーターたちが試合前から雨でビショビショになって大変そうでした。 因みに、英国ならではのフットボール報道、ガーディアンのライブブログが朝日新聞にも紹介して頂きました。 サッカーワールドカップ（Ｗ杯）ロシア大会の日本対コロンビア戦を、イギリスの新聞「ガーディアン」のブログで実況していたイギリス人がいる。しかも日本語で。 しかも日本語で。 セネガルのアリウ・シセ監督が2002年W杯のメンバーでもありました。あのときは初出場で快進撃を見せ、ベスト8まで勝ち上がりましたが、今年はまた高い目標を設定しているようです。 「少なくとも2002年の世代と同じ結果を残したい。あれは美しい世代だったが、今年の世代もそうだ。今の選手達は長年、代表チームでプレーし続けているし、ビッグクラブに所属している。新しい歴史を刻みたいという思いを持っている。我々は毎年、W杯に出られるわけではないし、彼らにとってこれが最後になるかもしれないというのも分かっている。その強い思いで試合に臨む。」 西野朗監督は予め、コロンビア戦での戦い方がこの試合のベースにもなるというふうにコメントしていたので、スタメン変更が1つもないというのはあまり驚きではないでしょう。 それに対してセネガルはクラブメイト同士の入れ替えが1つあります。FWのマメ・ビラム・ディウフに代わって、MFのパパ・アリウヌ”バドゥ”ンディアイェが先発に入りました。2人とも、昨シーズンはイングランドのストーク・シティでプレーしていました。今日は2トップではなく、4-3-3のような並びになりそうです。 いやぁ、日本在住で日本を愛するイングランド人にとっては、今日はめっちゃテンションが高いんですよ。まさかに立て続けにイングランド戦と日本戦が同じ夜に行われるとは。1日中、ドキドキしてます。 イングランドも日本と同様に、初戦は先制してから一旦同点に追い付かれ、最終的に再び勝ち越して2-1のスコアで勝利しました。そして今夜の2戦目では、パナマを相手に何と6対1で圧勝し、1試合を残してグループステージの突破を決めました。 日本の2戦目も同じような展開になると最高なのですが…！ セネガルの先発メンバーは以下の通りです： K. ンディアイェ サバリ、クリバリ、サネ、ワゲ P. ンディアイェ、A. ンディアイェ、ゲイェ サール、ニアン、マネ それでは早速、日本代表の先発メンバーです。やっぱりコロンビア戦と同じ11人となります。 川島 酒井宏樹、吉田、昌子、長友 長谷部、柴崎 原口、香川、乾 大迫 毎度、まいど。大阪在住の英国人コメンテーター、ベン・メイブリーと申します。さて、いよいよ日本代表が今年のW杯で2戦目となる、セネガル戦を臨みます。今夜もコロンビア戦に続き、このガーディアン紙の「ライブブログ」にてリアルタイムで試合の展開や感動を追求します。是非とも一緒に試合をエンジョイしましょう！ ではでは、日本代表の準備がめちゃくちゃだったとか、2位通過でも非常に厳しいとか、1試合でも勝てないかもしれないとか言ったのは誰でした？あ、そうだったね、私でした。誠に失礼致しました。 開幕前まで悲観的だったのは決して私だけではなかったと思いますが、やはりW杯というのは短期決戦です。それまでの3年半、4年間の準備が幾ら良くても、本番の数試合だけが全てです。その為、このタイミングでの幸運や、勢いというのが意外と大切なものになります。たった2ヶ月前に監督を変えた日本代表にとって、 どこよりも スペインを除いてどこよりもこの「勢い」が必要です。 コロンビア戦では色々なハプニングがありましたが、大迫勇也のゴールによって日本が貴重な勝利を収めた結果、この「勢い」もつきました。あの人、半端ないって。そして、27時KOのポーランド対コロンビアの結果次第にはなりますが、もし今夜も勝利することができれば、1試合を残してラウンド16への進出が決まるかもしれません！もちろん、現状に甘えてはいけませんが、この短期決戦のW杯の途中から突然、楽観的な見方も可能となってきました。 今夜、24時キックオフ、セネガル戦です。週末がまだ終わってませんよ！"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/24/germany-sweden-toni-kroos-joachim-low-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T08:00:20Z","webTitle":"Germany’s

refusal to admit defeat made their improbable win inevitable","bodyText":"And that’s why they’re the champions. More than that, that is why they are Germany. Of all the countries, of all the situations to find themselves in: 30 seconds from leaving the World Cup just 10 days in, only 10 men on the pitch. Then Toni Kroos, a cunning free-kick and a ball curled inside the far post. This time, it really didn’t look like it was coming, but then it did. OK, mathematically, Germany would still have had a chance had Kroos not taken control. But the reality was that, with one game in Group F left, the world champions would have been sitting in third place. With Sweden still to play leaders Mexico, an amicable draw would have suited both teams. Like Germany and Austria in 1982, maybe they would have found a way. Those are all counterfactuals now. If Germany beat South Korea by two goals they will progress to the next stage, maybe even top the group. There are many questions about this team that remain unanswered. In short, here are a few: the form of Jérôme Boateng, the positions occupied by their full-backs, the wild variations in tempo, the apparent lack of an effective number nine. But all of them seem less significant than the fact that Germany remain Germany and they’re still in the World Cup. The more you think about it, the more Kroos’s moment seems uncanny, not just improbable but impossible. As mentioned, the situation on the pitch was dire. Off it, things weren’t much better. Joachim Löw’s team had come into the match on the back of a week filled with discord. The camp was, apparently, at odds. Former national team favourites, with a desire to have their opinions heard, had decried the character of the team. Mario Basler, for example, claimed Mesut Özil displayed “the body language of a dead frog”. Which, you suppose, implies a lack of assertiveness. There was a team meeting that was apparently eerily quiet. There were no games of darts with the media. Come game day, there were changes. The dead frog had been given the chop. Sami Khedira too, while Boateng’s defensive partner Mats Hummels had suffered an unlikely-sounding neck injury. They started like they had rediscovered their groove, with Özil’s replacement, Marco Reus, showing smart movement behind Sweden’s centre-halves. But after a while, the good start stalled. For all the consideration that had been given to the German psychodrama, the possible activity inside Swedish heads had gone largely unremarked upon. But this side proved once more that if they are anything they are smart. Sweden got to Russia by outmanoeuvring first the Netherlands and then Italy. They know how to make the most of being underdogs. They stay compact with two lines of four players, with another in front and just Marcus Berg alone up front. On the ball they look to counterattack, not with pace but exactitude, the emphasis always on playing the ball into the right places. In the first half the tactic worked a treat, culminating in Ola Toivonen’s delightful opener. Each moment of it was pinpoint precise: from Viktor Claesson’s cross, bent like Beckham would, to Toivonen’s chest and then, delightfully, the chip with the tip of his toe. As the ball arced over Manuel Neuer and into the net the moment seemed to last for minutes (this was not the case with Kroos, it was inexorable therefore it happened quickly). Sweden had more chances in the opening 45 minutes, and should perhaps have built a lead of more than a single goal. But they did not. Germany had been, once again, ragged off the ball and not determined or canny enough on it. But they still had an opportunity for redemption. The champions emerged for the second period reinvigorated once more and within three minutes they had equalised. Then the clock began to tick down. With 30 minutes to go a German winner looked inevitable; with 20 the Swedes were once more a threat. With under 10 minutes remaining Boateng was dismissed and Germany went to 10 men. Löw responded by throwing on another attacker. With 90 seconds to go John Guidetti was set free in the Germany area but shot straight at Neuer when he could have cut back to Emil Forsberg or, even better, kept possession. These are the moments. Up the other end the ball went and Jimmy Durmaz made a tackle he should not have which will linger in his mind for the rest of his life. Up stepped Kroos. The pendulum swung improbably but decisively. The Germans probably have a compound noun for that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/23/england-sophie-ecclestone-new-zealand-south-africa-t20-international-women-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T21:16:32Z","webTitle":"England’s Sophie Ecclestone rips into New Zealand for big fightback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/23/england-sophie-ecclestone-new-zealand-south-africa-t20-international-women-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/23/england-sophie-ecclestone-new-zealand-south-africa-t20-international-women-cricket","fields":{"headline":"England’s Sophie Ecclestone rips into New Zealand for big fightback","bodyText":"England’s women bounced back with style to split the difference in their T20 double-header, clinically accounting for New Zealand by 54 runs after losing an error-riddled thriller to South Africa earlier in the day to all but secure their progress to the tournament final. Key to the victory was the left-arm finger-spinner Sophie Ecclestone, who ripped the heart out of the White Ferns’ chase of 173, claiming four for 18 in her best display yet as an international cricketer. She was given the nod as player of the match ahead of Nat Sciver, who top-scored with 59 from 37 balls – her best outing of the summer. The England captain, Heather Knight, said that it had been a test of her side’s character how they responded to the chaotic loss against the Proteas. Then, the hosts were unable to defend 160, dropping four catches along the way. Opener Tammy Beaumont propelled them to that middling score after batting first against the side they built a world record score against three days earlier, out in the penultimate over for 71 on the back of three centuries. That they still had nine runs to play with when the final over began flattered the home side but Sune Luus (63 not out) left no doubt about the final result for the resilient visitors by hitting three boundaries to confirm the win with three balls to space, sealed with a six. She finished the work of powerhitter Lizelle Lee, who launched the ball over the leg-side rope six times on the way to a 37-ball 68 that silenced the healthy Taunton crowd. Second time around, England were able to get rid of New Zealand’s equivalent, their powerful opener Sophie Devine holing out in the second over having already belted two sixes. More crucial again was Katherine Brunt’s beautiful bit of seam bowling to trap the talismanic Kiwi captain, Suzie Bates, lbw for 23. She was yet to get in the book herself but Ecclestone was crucial to that wicket having sent down a maiden the over before to build the pressure. The tall teenage twirler’s main weapon on the day was her quicker delivery from round the wicket that went through the gate and past the inside edge of right-handers on three occasions. She was also twice helped out by Sarah Taylor stumpings when she beat the outside half of the blade when players tried to take the attack to her. After play, the Lancastrian said she was still “bricking it” every time she walks out for England. That never showed on Saturday. After their record onslaught on Wednesday, England hit only one six in their 40 overs at the crease. It made Sciver’s 59 all the more impressive that she did not need to shift into overdrive to reach the required results. She entered at an almost identical time in the first rubber and threw it away after getting a start. Against New Zealand she took responsibility as the senior pro to insist a healthy total would come. Her placement through point, in particular, was a standout. Knight had a smile on her face after striking within two balls of bringing herself into the attack in a match against New Zealand that had plenty riding on it – as the first of a raft of fixtures the sides play against each other in the coming weeks. That it was from a sharp return catch to see the back of the dangerous Amy Satterthwaite, her teammate in the Women’s Big Bash League, must have added to her glee. England play New Zealand once more at Bristol on Wednesday in their final group game before the final next Sunday. With a vastly superior net run-rate to South Africa, it would take something outlandish for Knight’s side not to reach the decider. This trophy does not mean a lot in isolation, but in a World T20 year everything matters. And if Ecclestone can keep proving her match-winning credentials she will be one of the first on that plane to the Caribbean."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/23/eddie-jones-england-south-africa-third-test-jonny-may","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T20:55:26Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones says England are 'coming to a peak' after win over South Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/23/eddie-jones-england-south-africa-third-test-jonny-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/23/eddie-jones-england-south-africa-third-test-jonny-may","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones says England are 'coming to a peak' after win over South Africa","bodyText":"Eddie Jones says he would love to arrange another Test against South Africa this Saturday, following England’s stress-relieving 25-10 victory against the Springboks. The visitors will fly home as series losers but the head coach believes his team showed crucial signs of improvement in their final game. Assisted by a 14-6 penalty count in their favour, England led for the majority of the match to record their first win against South Africa in Cape Town. “We just handled the big moments better today,” Jones said. “We kept our composure and just focused on the next play. “We’d like to play South Africa next week because we’re coming to a peak now, so we’re trying to arrange a game at Twickenham for next week.” Jones also paid tribute to England’s try-scorer Jonny May, who has now touched down in each of his past five Tests, one short of the English record held by Rory Underwood. “Jonny May has been outstanding on this tour. He’s scored three tries and was probably involved in two or three others. He’s been incredible. He nearly gave them a try, then he saved a try, then I thought he was going to run into one of the corporate boxes in the far grandstand.” Among other players who impressed Jones in the third Test were Chris Robshaw, Tom Curry, Joe Marler and Danny Cipriani, whose cross-kick created May’s crucial score. “I said before the game we might not have many opportunities. There was one opportunity for us to score a try, it was a beautifully weighted kick and we scored, so I’m sure he’ll be on the front page of The Sun.” The Springbok head coach, Rassie Erasmus, however, said his third Test selection had been partly experimental with the series already in the bag. “We experimented with the Championship in mind ... you can’t really experiment against the All Blacks,” Erasmus said. “We weren’t at the same level intensity‑wise today.” Overall, however, Jones believes the series was a positive one for Test rugby. “I thought it was a great series. For the health of Test rugby it was fantastic. The South African side are revitalised, well coached with a good balance of players. “For the first two games South Africa were too good. They deserved to win the series but there were only small margins in it. I feel better than I did on the first two weekends but that only lasts for about three or four hours. Then you’re back on the treadmill again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/23/shock-specialist-aliou-cisse-hoping-to-rekindle-winning-spirit-of-2002","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T17:46:41Z","webTitle":"Aliou Cissé: ‘Senegal players know this could be their last World Cup’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/23/shock-specialist-aliou-cisse-hoping-to-rekindle-winning-spirit-of-2002","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/23/shock-specialist-aliou-cisse-hoping-to-rekindle-winning-spirit-of-2002","fields":{"headline":"Aliou Cissé: ‘Senegal players know this could be their last World Cup’","bodyText":"Aliou Cissé exudes the kind of gentle composure to suggest he is not easily thrown, but he needed a few seconds to consider how best to answer the kind of question he clearly didn’t expect on the eve of Senegal’s second Group H match against Japan. It was a curveball seemingly from nowhere. How did he feel about being a sex symbol to Russian women? Cissé broke into a nervous smile. “I don’t know,” he said cautiously. “There are millions of Cissés in Senegal and around the world. But it’s good to be loved.” The manager of Senegal is making an impression beyond the usual footballing parameters but deep down what concerns him is only the quality of the job he is able to do with his team. He gave off a mixture of determination and quiet optimism about the consequences of this match. “The team who wins will be nearly qualified,” he said, emphasising the nearly. He knows from experience that the joy of winning an opening tournament match brings no guarantees and must be a force for motivation rather than relaxation. In 2002, he was captain of the legendary Senegal team that created shockwaves with a World Cup win against the might of France, before pressing on to the last eight. He wants his team to emulate that mix of mental toughness and the freedom to play ambitious football. Something about this generation reminds him of the class of 2002 and he has set them the challenge not just to match previous feats but to exceed them. “We want to do at least as well as the 2002 generation,” he said. “That was a beautiful generation but so is this one. But only by winning matches we can do better than 2002. We have won only one match already. The mentalities are different between these two groups – mostly in the head. We had more extrovert characters then, they are more introverted now.” The preparation for this key match takes that into account and Cissé wants his team to focus on building a strongly disciplined platform, from which their most speedy and skilled performers can spring. “These are players who have grown. I am with players who have been in the national team for a long time and they are at big clubs. They want to write their own history. We don’t have a World Cup every year. They know that this could be their last. That is close to their heart.” As if to press home the value of this opportunity he reminded everyone that Japan are competing in their sixth consecutive edition, whereas this is Senegal’s second – their only qualification since 2002. Senegal and Japan have had excellent wins against Poland and Colombia respectively. Akira Nishino sounded realistic, though, about the scale of problems he faces against a team that pose very specific challenges. Senegal’s physical prowess, in size and speed, was an issue bought up repeatedly. “The image we have about African teams is that their physicality is superior,” he said. “We have to cope with that. These past several days I have been telling Inui and Oshima [two of the smallest players] to gain 5kg and grow 5cm but that failed. So we have to do something else. We are going to take Senegal on using the ball. We have to use our brain rather than physique.” He confessed that he had been discussing a plan to contain Sadio Mané. “We are giving all players information about Mané. It might be one-on-one or three-on-one. He also has an influence on other players and that is what we are concerned about.” Mané brushed that off. “It’s personal pride to hear everyone talking about me but also an important trap to be avoided,” he said. “The whole group is important for Senegal. We are going to try to concentrate on ourselves and what we have to do. It’s the team who won last time, thanks to the big boss who did all the work, who made the strategy, which has worked really well. There will be no worries if we work together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/25/england-ruben-loftus-cheek-chelsea-loan","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T21:29:14Z","webTitle":"Ruben Loftus-Cheek will stay at Chelsea but may still go on loan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/25/england-ruben-loftus-cheek-chelsea-loan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/25/england-ruben-loftus-cheek-chelsea-loan","fields":{"headline":"England’s Ruben Loftus-Cheek will stay at Chelsea but may still go on loan","bodyText":"Chelsea will not entertain offers for the permanent transfer of Ruben Loftus-Cheek this summer, but could consider loaning the midfielder out for another season to maintain his development with regular first-team football. The 22-year-old youth-team graduate made his first World Cup start in Sunday’s 6-1 demolition of Panama having broken into the senior national set-up while enjoying a productive season-long spell at Crystal Palace. Loftus-Cheek made 24 top-flight appearances last season, despite missing three months mid-season with an ankle problem, having made only 22 over the three previous years at Chelsea. He played a major role in Palace finishing 11th after the worst start in Premier League history. The midfielder expects to report back for pre-season training at Cobham late next month after enjoying an extended break post-tournament, but has already made clear he has no intention of reverting to a mere bit-part role at the club whose academy he joined at the age of eight. Palace are among a number of clubs, including West Ham and Everton, who would be interested in securing his services on another 12-month arrangement if Chelsea were willing to sanction the move. Other suitors had even hoped to secure the player permanently but Chelsea, regardless of the identity of their head coach next season, have already decided they will not consider a sale. The hierarchy at Stamford Bridge are convinced Loftus-Cheek has a significant role to play in Chelsea’s long-term future, even if they complete a deal for the Nice midfielder Jean Michael Seri this summer, and there is the possibility any loan move could yet be accompanied by a new long-term contract. His current deal expires in 2021. Maurizio Sarri is still expected to be appointed as Chelsea’s new head coach, succeeding Antonio Conte, ahead of the new campaign and the former Napoli manager would not have long to assess Loftus-Cheek first-hand before making a decision on his future in time for the early closure of the transfer window on 9 August. Yet the player’s focus, at present, is solely on playing a part in England’s challenge at the World Cup."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/sep/03/move-over-ivo-van-hove-europe-hottest-theatre-directors","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-03T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"Move over Ivo van Hove: Europe's hottest theatre directors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/03/move-over-ivo-van-hove-europe-hottest-theatre-directors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/sep/03/move-over-ivo-van-hove-europe-hottest-theatre-directors","fields":{"headline":"Move over Ivo van Hove: Europe's hottest theatre directors","bodyText":"Susanne Kennedy (Germany) Susanne Kennedy turns actors into avatars and makes human life seem alien. On her candy-coloured stages, masked figures glitch and glide like animatronics. Instead of speaking, they lip-sync along to recorded, distorted dialogue. Yet her shows mostly sit in banal, suburban settings. She turned the small-town Bavarians of Marieluise Fleißer’s 1924 play Purgatory in Ingolstadt into pallid zombies, and made a mannequin of Fassbinder and Fengler’s Herr R, the petit-bourgeois conformist who ultimately cracks. For Jeffrey Eugenides’ The Virgin Suicides, her teenage girls were flowered idols on a stage caught between shrine and shopping mall. Kennedy’s dislocated style exposes the emptiness of neoliberal life. Her shows loop round in circles as if stuck on repeat. Born in Friedrichshafen, Kennedy began her career in Dutch theatre, directing Sarah Kane and, tellingly, Enda Walsh, but was hailed as a significant voice on returning to Germany in 2009. She had two shows selected for consecutive Theatertreffen festivals and joined Chris Dercon’s directorial team at the Volksbühne – the first theatremaker in his cross-disciplinary programme. The move made sense. Her theatre borders on installation. “I see a theatre where the voice no longer belongs to the body, the face is no longer the conveyor of emotion,” she has written. “In the end, the actor becomes imperceptible.” Julien Gosselin (France) Julien Gosselin goes long. His four-hour adaptation of Michel Houellebecq’s novel The Elementary Particles was dwarfed by a 12-hour stage version of Roberto Bolaño’s unfinished epic 2666. No bother: Gosselin’s swaggering style staves off longueurs, marrying pop sensibility with a keen self-awareness. His latest marathon, which premiered in Avignon last month, mashed up three Don DeLillo novels – Players, Mao II and The Names – to track the evolution of terrorism over 10 hours. It was exhilarating: the offspring of Ivo van Hove’s exhaustive stage adaptations and Katie Mitchell’s live films. Starting on a closed set, the action only visible on a big screen, it allowed terror groups to tear apart a toy world. The stage opened up, the cinematography grew glossier, terror became part of the picture. On graduating from Lille’s Théâtre du Nord school, Gosselin set up a collective, If only you could lick my heart. Its debut was documentary theatre: Fausto Paravidino’s interrogation of a protestor’s death at the 2001 G8 summit, Genoa ’01. But the company immediately swerved into surrealism with Anja Hilling’s play about six friends caught in a forest fire, Black Animal Sadness. Gosselin swamped the whole stage with smoke. At 26, he became the youngest director invited to the Avignon festival and, if critics cocked a snook at his Houellebecq, audiences took Gosselin’s verve to heart straight away. Next year, there’s more DeLillo: Falling Man, the story of a 9/11 survivor, opens in Amsterdam in March. Yael Ronen (Austria) Eight Romany actors stand on stage in Rome, all in white, and proclaim themselves a pan-European army. One’s a drag artist from Sweden, another’s Serbian and identifies as queer. A third is blonde with a home counties accent. It’s December 2017 and, in just six months time, Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, will announce a compulsory census of Roma people. This is the territory Yael Ronen works in: hotly political and intensely personal. Her devised shows draw on her actors’ lives and identities, mingling fact with fiction in a way that teases comedy out of significant conflicts – Yugoslavia’s civil war in Common Ground, Israel-Palestine in The Situation.Her work places great stock in the stage as a space for unity, bringing people together across political divides. Her companies, whether her Roma Army or the Gorki Theatre’s new Exil Ensemble made up of immigrants from Afghanistan, Syria and Palestine, stand as symbols of collaboration. Like the work of Lola Arias and Rimini Protokoll, Ronen’s shows practise what they preach. Caroline Guiela Nguyen (France) Saigon set Caroline Giuela Nguyen apart. Since its premiere last year, it has zipped around Europe non-stop, festival to festival. At home, it won its writer-director a second Molière award nomination. Staged in a replica Vietnamese restaurant, the four-hour piece swung between Saigon in 1956, as French colonialists shipped out post Dien Bien Phu, and Paris 40 years later, as Vietnamese exiles faced the prospect of returning for the first time. Nguyen made that trip at 16, with her mother, but Saigon was not straightforwardly autobiographical. It grew out of two years of research with her cast, and the show swam with ghosts, grief and dreamy nostalgia as it kept various storylines spinning like plates. That’s a mark of her beginnings – not only as a sociology student, but in reshaping literary classics for the stage. Having first worked with novels, including a two-parter that chucked Madame Bovary into today’s world, her company, Les Hommes Approximatifs, changed tack, focusing on overlooked stories and underrepresented lives. She began collaborating in prisons with Joël Pommerat and, in her shows, started to focus on the scars left by colonialism. Her shows have a gorgeous, unreal aesthetic, but the language is radical too: by refusing surtitles for multilingual shows, Nguyen pushes against old hierarchies and privileges. Oliver Frljić (Croatia) On a wall in Vinkovci, eastern Croatia, the words “Death to Oliver Frljić” appeared overnight. He has drawn protests and faced violent threats, lost festivals their funding and seen politicians vow to remove him from post. Frljić is one of the continent’s most controversial theatre directors – and one of its most necessary. A strident and unapologetically political artist, Frljić’s work scrutinizes and satirises the political fallout across the former Yugoslavia: the fruits of war, the rise of far-right nationalism, the meekness of democracy. He counters with shock and scorn. One show has actors urinating on a map of the region. Another sees a woman extract the national flag from her vagina. He might push unruliness to extremes – gratuitously so, perhaps – but this is no time for politeness. Frljić is a frontline artist. For all its messy anarchism – he once had teenagers instruct audiences in bomb-making – Frljić’s theatre is calculated, too. He challenges the form and questions its limits, writing fake personal histories for his actors, quoting and critiquing other shows in his own and flicking between representation and reality. His theatre, as one critic put it, is “nothing more and nothing less than the search for the right artistic tool to stop the descent into national hell”. ‘I wanted to channel the anger’: Europe’s fearless political playwrights"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/26/bras-womens-breasts-getting-bigger-larger-cups","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"Are women's breasts getting bigger - or is it just our bras?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/26/bras-womens-breasts-getting-bigger-larger-cups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/26/bras-womens-breasts-getting-bigger-larger-cups","fields":{"headline":"Are women's breasts getting bigger - or is it just our bras?","bodyText":"‘In 20 years of doing this, I’ve probably fitted about three 36B ladies who actually said they were a 36B,” says Kelly Dunmore, chief lingerie stylist at Rigby &amp; Peller. It’s one of those ambient truths; we all know that what we think is our bra size is probably wrong. Josie Fellows, Kelly’s bra-fitting apprentice, walks me through this tactfully. “It’s often, 85% of the time, a big shock in the fitting room.” We are in the fitting room. “People think E is the biggest size there is.” That’s more or less what I thought. “They think of D as such a full size and they’ve been buying a B for 20 years.” Yup. “And to compensate for the fact that their cup’s too small, they go up in the back and think they’re a 36.” OK. “So you’re a 32D.” She fits me in a bra, and I have to hand it to her, they do look different, more like breasts, less like a sideways banana in a Waitrose bag. But this is absurd. I’m a 36B. Fellows says ruefully: “If you say to a client they’re a G cup, it’s like saying to someone who thinks they’re an 8 that they’re actually a 14.” We will consider in due course what has led generations of women to think their breasts were a size they categorically weren’t. But this is also a story about a mistaken market. Bras have been misfitting for years; suppliers failing to approximate women’s actual shapes. Perhaps in the olden days, when materials were less yielding and there was a strong call for structure and upholstery, the lack of range was more explicable, the way you don’t expect to get a sofa in 90 different varieties (although … Loaf?). But more recently it has been hard to escape the sense of a generalised market failure, driven by fashion, which sees breasts as an impediment to design, not so much a secondary characteristic as a nuisance. As for the mass delusion among bra-wearers themselves, it’s partly cross-pollination: “All the glamour models say: ‘I’m a 34 DD.’ Well, they’re not, I can tell you – they’re probably an F,” says Dunmore. Plus, there are a lot of women simply changing shape and not keeping on top of it, because who would? But it’s no accident that we think of D and E as mega-sizes, F and G as outsize and H to K as non-existent, even though that is miles away from the truth. These F, G and H sizes have long been part of the high-end market. “They’re our bestselling sizes,” Dunmore says. “Marks &amp; Sparks have just started to talk about F, which is what we’ve been doing for 75 years.” But on the high street, until 20 years ago, they were non-existent; even now, you can only get them in Bravissimo. Ellie Corney, a director of Bravissimo, says: “If you think about 1995, before the internet, it was such a negative experience for someone with big boobs having to find bras. There would be 200 really pretty bras in John Lewis and you’d say: ‘What’s available for me as an F cup?’ You’d be led to this dark corner and there’d be this horrific, flesh-coloured, thick-strapped granny bra.” I have a friend of one of these outlier (yet, in reality, incredibly common) proportions and, in the old days, when we were young and still bought stuff, it was like a group mission to find her a bra. I remember triumphantly finding one in a market in Uzès, in the south of France, only to discover it was actually €32, not a 32E. Bravissimo is the entrepreneurial dream scenario, the gap in the market that turned out to be a chasm. Sarah Tremellen was 25 when she had a baby and set it up, according to the manager of her Oxford Circus store, Jess Jaddour, 28, “out of her own frustration. Ladies with average body size but big boobs just couldn’t find a bra.” (Note to prospective parents: the opposite can also result.) It started as a mail-order company in 1995 and opened shops in 1999, of which there are now 21. “It came from this really authentic place,” Jaddour says, “and right from the beginning we had this very clear objective, which was to give women the best choice possible, but also to have this celebratory tone, your body is absolutely great. Because women were being made to feel so bad about themselves. It was all: ‘Your size is really difficult, your body is the problem.’” The success of the mail-order operation was mostly on the demand side: it remained extremely difficult to get suppliers to produce what women wanted. “We’d say: ‘We’ve got all these customers, and they’d really like a plunge bra.’ And a lot of the suppliers said: ‘They’re not suitable. It’s really complicated. They won’t be supported.’” It is true that bra engineering, or brarchitecture, if you prefer, is complicated: “The bigger your cup size, the more work it’s doing,” Jaddour says. “It is a job. It’s not a T-shirt.” The couture brands have historically been better at big sizes, because there are more layers of complication; a bra that costs £80 will have twice as many components as one that is £40. “There’s a lot of engineering that goes into it, and the ones that do it well, they’ve been doing it well for centuries,” Dunmore says. But there is also a patriarchal backstory (isn’t there always?) that stopped the market evolving to suit the people it was for. Corney ascribes Bravissimo’s success to the fact that “we’re women and we’re talking to other women. A lot of lingerie retailing in the past has been very much talking to men. It was ‘Hello Boys’ on the Wonderbra advert.” The consumer was conceived as a man buying underwear for a woman. And men do buy underwear for women, but you couldn’t subsist on it. It is a running Bravissimo joke that they have a rush on lacy red sets just before Christmas and they are all returned in January. Bras do not have to be fantastically expensive in order to work (although you would struggle to get a well-structured bra for less than about £30). “I don’t agree that you should be buying your underwear where you’re buying your cheese,” Dunmore says waspishly. But you do have to specialise. Bravissimo, hitting brick walls with suppliers, started to design its own bras, and the logistical stock challenge is enormous: one bra, in one colour, running sizes 28 to 40 and D to L, as they do, would come in 90 SKUs (that’s a stock-keeping unit, or a single item for sale); if you do that in three colours, that’s 270. And if your USP is that you want to make every woman, whatever her size, able to find the bra she wants, that is an epic number of SKUs. The modern bra-fitting happens by eye, not with a tape measure, and nobody uses the historical plus-four method, where you measure the under-bust and deduce back size by adding four inches (so if your under-bust is 28 inches, you would be a 32). This fit isn’t firm enough, and the backstrap, which should provide 80% of the support, can’t manage it, kicking the weight on to the straps and the cups, which, for anyone over a D, will give them sore shoulders, bad posture and back aches. “There has definitely been an evolution,” Dunmore says. “We never in the UK or anywhere in Europe did a 30 back: the French thought we were mad when we asked for those. As a nation, we are smaller backed and fuller cupped than they are, and they also don’t fit as firm as we do. We are historically known as firm fitters in the back band. As soon as a 30 came on the market, they were selling out in days.” The cup should have no gaping but also no squishing, so if any part of the wire is sitting on your actual breast tissue, that’s too small; and if you’re spilling over the top, so your silhouette looks like four breasts, that is also too small. There is a residual superstition around the “big” letters, as Jaddour says: “Society tells us that G is massive, but a 28G would be a pretty small woman, and a 32H would look completely different on five different women.” Since properly fitting bras have come on the market, women have started to flag up other things that have never worked on boobs: fitted shirts, various dress styles, an array of pretty standard clothes that have never been designed to accommodate breasts. The working fashion assumption is, to put it bluntly, that women with a larger cup size are most probably fat, and this simply isn’t true. Most Bravissimo customers are size 8 to 18 – and the company sells a range of dresses, tops and sportswear alongside lingerie. Women are changing, too – Dunmore says that younger girls are much fuller-breasted than they were 20 years ago; she sees 13- to 15-year-olds wearing a G-cup (“There’s no scientific evidence for this, but I’m sure it’s down to hormones, the prevalence of the pill”). Technology is changing faster. Materials have more movement, more breathability, more strength, and styles that may once have been impossible in bigger sizes – the bralet, which is, broadly, a bra that is also a top – now aren’t. But the real revolution has been the normalisation of sizes that were, in real life, already normal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/25/david-goldblatt-south-africa-dies-aged-87-photographer","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T14:17:14Z","webTitle":"Photographer David Goldblatt, South Africa's visual conscience, dies aged 87","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/25/david-goldblatt-south-africa-dies-aged-87-photographer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/25/david-goldblatt-south-africa-dies-aged-87-photographer","fields":{"headline":"South African photographer David Goldblatt dies aged 87","bodyText":"The photographer David Goldblatt, whose work chronicled apartheid-era South Africa, has died, aged 87. Goldblatt documented the racial divide of his home country during some of its most turbulent years, and was credited with bringing a strong moral and ethical dimension to his work. Through photographing simple scenes, such as children playing or exhausted workers sleeping on their bus journey home, he revealed the power imbalance at the heart of South African society. “During those years my prime concern was with values – what did we value in South Africa, how did we get to those values and how did we express those values,” Goldblatt once reflected on his work. “I was very interested in the events that were taking place in the country as a citizen but, as a photographer, I’m not particularly interested, and I wasn’t then, in photographing the moment that something happens. I’m interested in the conditions that give rise to events.” Goldblatt was born in 1930 in Randfontein, a city 25 miles to the west of Johannesburg. He took up photography aged 18, the year apartheid was enforced, choosing to work almost entirely in black and white. Over the decades he developed a style that captured quiet, almost tranquil moments, which nevertheless spoke deeply of the trauma caused by his country’s imposed racial divide. His 1964 photograph, A Farmer’s Son With His Nursemaid, shows the titular pair both turned towards the camera, the boy’s hands on the nursemaid’s shoulder in front of a barbed wire fence. It was these subtle moments, rather than dramatic historical turning points, that most fascinated Goldblatt as a photographer. In a 2017 interview with the Guardian, Goldblatt talked about the peculiar relationships he observed between white plot owners and the black servants who lived on them. “Many [owners] were deeply racist. They had a profound fear of black people. At the same time, they had a relationship with them on their plots that was intimate and affectionate, generous to a degree that surpassed what I knew from my middle-class urban life.” Goldblatt’s photography has been exhibited all over the world, including shows at Moma in New York, London’s Barbican and a highly acclaimed retrospective at the Pompidou Centre in Paris earlier this year. His most renowned works include the 1973 book On the Mines, a collaboration with one of his key influences, the Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer, and 1975’s Some Afrikaners Photographed – the result of extensive travelling around his home country. A statement from the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg, which holds much of Goldblatt’s work, read: “It is with great sorrow that we announce that David Goldblatt has died, aged 87. He passed away peacefully in the early hours of this morning at his home in Johannesburg. David’s passing is a significant loss to South Africa and the global art world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/25/brexit-referendum-tv-reliving-11-hours-agony","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T15:16:14Z","webTitle":"The Brexit referendum on TV: reliving 11 hours of agony","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/25/brexit-referendum-tv-reliving-11-hours-agony","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/25/brexit-referendum-tv-reliving-11-hours-agony","fields":{"headline":"The Brexit referendum on TV: reliving 11 hours of agony","bodyText":"Imagine an opportunity to rerun the EU referendum vote – effectively the demand of last weekend’s marchers – with the distinct possibility of another outcome, and the stomach-churning anxiety involved for both sides. Now imagine reliving the whole thing already knowing the outcome would be the same. Why would you put yourself through it? Why did I? On the second anniversary of the Brexit vote, BBC Parliament offered viewers another opportunity to watch the Beeb’s coverage of referendum night – all 11 hours of it – but during the day, beginning at 9.55am. “Good evening and welcome to the end of this momentous day,” said David Dimbleby, two years after the polls closed. You might justifiably consider this a poor way to spend a sunny Saturday in June. You are immediately reminded that 23 June 2016 was actually a terrible day, with torrential rain and flash flooding. It is the first of many what-if questions this rerun prompts: what if the weather had been better in London and the south-west? Even after all this time, it is like being poised at the start of a rollercoaster ride. A young-looking Jeremy Vine stands in a CGI Downing Street, explaining in some detail why it is all much less complicated than it seems – with a referendum, only the tally matters. In the absence of any numbers, two pieces of news are being chewed over: the first, that 84 Tory MPs have just signed a letter insisting David Cameron should stay on as PM whatever the result – the so-called “Save Dave” letter; the second is that the pound is soaring as markets bet on remain. Some fuzzy footage arrives of Nigel Farage after his early and now notorious concession, telling supporters he thinks the government’s extension of the registration deadline will clinch it for remain. “I hope I’m wrong,” he says. Farage, like the other main players in the referendum, is almost an off-stage character in the coverage. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson never appear. Theresa May is neither seen nor mentioned. Instead, we have a giddy Iain Duncan Smith, thinking, perhaps, that punditry might be his future. It won’t. Finally, a result: Gibraltar goes heavily for remain – expected and, in the scheme of things, no big deal. In the studio, Alastair Campbell sounds a prescient note of scepticism: “I don’t believe the bookies and the markets always get it right,” he says. At this stage, most of the chatter is about the dangers of a too-narrow remain win, and the need to heal divisions. Commentators refer to remain and leave camps, or just in and out, but nobody uses the word Brexit. Not yet. In hindsight, you can see it’s all over with the first big results: Newcastle votes remain, but by a surprisingly slender margin; Sunderland comes out for leave, by a lot. Analyst Prof John Curtice says that “maybe the champagne’s gone back in the fridge” at remain HQ. Jeremy Vine says: “Don’t anyone go to bed yet.” At 12.45am, a cliff-faced graph of the pound tanking is displayed, but there is only one really compelling number: the one in the corner showing the lead changing hands. At 1.19am (lunchtime for me), leave creeps up to 25,869 while Dimbleby and guests discuss Cameron’s future. Somebody mentions article 50 for the first time. By 1.45am, the words “Close result expected” have become a permanent feature of the banner at the bottom of the screen. David Davis makes an ill-advised joke about shorting sterling. “A senior Labour figure has just contacted me to say that leave is going to win,” says Laura Kuenssberg. But then, at 2.23am, the lead changes hands again. It is possible that Newcastle and Sunderland were outliers. Fewer than a tenth of the voting centres have reported, and hardly any from London. Even now, two years later, I find myself thinking that remain could still pull it out of the bag. Some time after 3am, Jacob Rees-Mogg turns up to say: “There will be no recession because of Brexit.” Nor is he worried about our relationship with Europe. “We are their biggest customer,” he says. “It’s hugely in their interest to trade with us.” At 4am, Farage appears from the shadows to call the vote “a victory for decent people”, adding that “we will have done it without a single bullet being fired”. It is a remarkably crass thing to say a week after the murder of MP Jo Cox. But at 4.40am, the BBC declares a leave win. It would be a good moment to go to bed, if it weren’t teatime. It is the stage of the rollercoaster ride where the cars stop and you’re left waiting for the attendant to lift up your safety bar. There are hours to go before the climax we know is coming: Cameron’s resignation. The gap is mostly filled with a succession of pissed-off remainers apportioning blame, ashen-faced Brexiters calling for calm and ex-Cameron adviser Steve Hilton being optimistically woolly about the whole thing. Even without the benefit of hindsight, it is clear all the wrong people think the result is good news. Shortly after 6.15am, a bulletin contains the first non-Brexit news item of the night: the weather forecast for the coming day. It’s going to be lovely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/26/palm-oil-disastrous-for-wildlife-but-here-to-stay-experts-warn","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T12:00:34Z","webTitle":"Palm oil ‘disastrous’ for wildlife but here to stay, experts warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/26/palm-oil-disastrous-for-wildlife-but-here-to-stay-experts-warn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/26/palm-oil-disastrous-for-wildlife-but-here-to-stay-experts-warn","fields":{"headline":"Palm oil ‘disastrous’ for wildlife but here to stay, experts warn","bodyText":"It is consumed daily by billions of people but palm oil is “disastrous” for wildlife such as orangutans and tigers, according to an authoritative new report. However, the analysis warns that alternatives are likely to drive biodiversity losses elsewhere, rather than halt them. The analysis, from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), found that rainforest destruction caused by palm oil plantations damages more than 190 threatened species on the IUCN’s red list, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia. It also found that palm oil certified as “sustainable” is, so far, only marginally better in terms of preventing deforestation. However, alternative oil crops, such as soy, corn and rapeseed, require up to nine times as much land and switching to them could result in the destruction of wild habitat in other parts of the world, such as Brazil and Argentina, the report warns. It recommends stronger action to ensure new palm oil plantations do not cause forests to be felled. Palm oil provides a third of the world’s vegetable oil, from 10% of the land used for all oil crops. It is used in a huge range of food products and eaten by half the world’s population, with a quarter of production used in cosmetics, cleaning products and as biofuel. “When you consider the disastrous impacts of palm oil on biodiversity from a global perspective, there are no simple solutions,” said Inger Andersen, IUCN director general. “If we ban or boycott it, other, more land-hungry oils will likely take its place.” “Palm oil is here to stay and we urgently need concerted action to make palm oil production more sustainable, ensuring that governments, producers and the supply chain honour their sustainability commitments,” she said. Deforestation for palm oil frequently takes place despite legal bans. The new report from the IUCN Oil Palm taskforce estimates the total area of industrial scale palm oil plantations at 18.7m hectares, with smallholder plantations taking the total to 25m hectares, equivalent to the area of the UK. Despite the controversy over palm oil, there are no easy solutions, said Erik Meijaard, the IUCN report’s lead author. “Palm oil is decimating south-east Asia’s rich diversity of species as it eats into swaths of tropical forest,” he said. But, quoting US writer HL Mencken, he added. “For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.” One issue is that it is often easier to cut down virgin forest for new plantations, rather than deal with the complicated ownership issues that come with already degraded land. Another is that while some communities can benefit from plantations, as Indonesian and Malaysian governments argue, other communities can suffer. Furthermore, plantations are often created in poor locations, meaning yields are low. “A lot of oil palm planting seems to be dumped in places wherever people can get hold of land,” said Meijaard. “There needs to be pressure on countries like Malaysia and Indonesia to start seriously looking at how to optimise this sector.” Sustainable certification is intended to demonstrate that palm oil has not caused deforestation but is currently poor, according to Meijaard: “Certification is nowhere near as good as it should be. But [we] still think it is needed as the only objective way we can judge whether palm oil adheres to certain principles. The [certification body] needs to step it up and improve.” A spokeswoman for the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which certifies almost 20% of all palm oil, said: “While we acknowledge that the certification system is not perfect, it has made a real contribution against deforestation.” RSPO said it was currently strengthening its standards. Arguments over palm oil have been bitter with the most recent flare-up occurring over the European Union’s decision to ban palm oil from use as biofuel, though not until 2030. In the run up to the decision, Malaysian minister Datuk Seri Mah Siew Keong warned of a multi-billion dollar trade war: “Don’t expect us to continue buying European products.” Malaysia also called a recent academic paper on huge orangutan declines “hyperbolic” and media reports on it “fake news”. “We’ve come to expect nothing less from our opponents in Europe and the environmental minions who do their bidding,” said the Malaysian Palm Oil Council. Richard George, at Greenpeace UK, said: “Time and time again we’ve caught RSPO members destroying forests for palm oil, including trashing orangutan habitat. If the RSPO wants to have a future, it must adopt ‘no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation’ standards and ensure they are rigorously enforced.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jun/27/queens-new-york-food-restaurants-immigrants-foodie-tour","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T05:30:30Z","webTitle":"The world on a plate: the diverse kitchens of Queens, New York","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jun/27/queens-new-york-food-restaurants-immigrants-foodie-tour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jun/27/queens-new-york-food-restaurants-immigrants-foodie-tour","fields":{"headline":"The world on a plate: the diverse kitchens of Queens, New York","bodyText":"I’m waiting for what will turn out to be the most impressive sandwich I’ve had in recent memory. In the small dining room in the back of Beky’s Bakery, owner Roberta Torres sits at the head of the table, as her family eats breakfast around her. She wears her trademark Frieda Kahlo apron and keeps one eye on the line of customers forming at the counter. The ceiling is strung with fake flowers and a telenovela plays on the TV. We could be in Puebla, Mexico, where Roberta is from, but we’re not; we’re in Queens, New York, one of the most ethnically diverse boroughs in the US, where perhaps more languages are spoken than anywhere else on the planet, and Beky’s is just one of nearly 6,000 restaurants representing the 120 nationalities that call this county home. It was the success of Roberta’s pushcart — selling tamales on a street corner — that allowed her to open up this small spot, squeezed between an insurance agency and Juanita Salon. I would never have known to come here if I weren’t a guest of food blog and tour company Culinary Backstreets, which was launched in Istanbul in 2009, and has since expanded to nine cities, including Tokyo, Lisbon, Rio de Janeiro and, in April 2017, Queens. But back to the sandwich. It’s a cemita: a toasted sesame-seed topped bun stuffed with melted queso oaxaca, chorizo, and avocado with a smoky kick from the chipotle. The trademark ingredient, however, is papalo, a Mexican herb with a unique floral edge. Our guide, Esneider Arevalo, 50, a deeply knowledgable and charismatic man with startling green eyes, orders two for our group to share. One woman speaks for us all: “Every once in a while you eat a sandwich that changes your life.” This is the third stop on the tour, which moves through Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Corona – the neighbourhoods with the largest foreign-born populations in Queens. Everyone else in our group of five – an academic bunch, all women – has taken a Culinary Backstreets tour before. They recommend I pace myself. As we walk along Roosevelt Avenue, the borough’s main thoroughfare, lined with dollar stores, pharmacies, and cafes, Esneider tells me about his childhood, pausing to let the rumble of the elevated subway pass overhead. He left Medellín, Colombia, at 17 to join his mother, who had moved to Queens two years previously. He soon found work as a dishwasher. I asked how he ended up as a guide with Culinary Backstreets. “I come from foodie royalty,” he says. His mother, Maria Cano, is the well known but now retired Arepa Lady, whose pushcart on 79th Street and Roosevelt Avenue drew acclaim from Chowhound’s Jim Leff and the late Anthony Bourdain. Esneider himself worked his way up to become head chef of Angelica Kitchen, New York’s original farm-to-table vegan restaurant. His and his mother’s story is the stuff of American dreams, even if that dream has been complicated by the current political climate. We stop at Seba Seba, a 30-year-old corner diner where locals eat plates of pollo asado (seasoned grilled chicken), to pick up a bag of Colombian pastries: pan de yuca, almojábana, and buñuelo. The buñuelo steams as Esneider breaks it with his hands to share between us, passing out napkins from his tote bag of supplies. “It tastes like a Colombian hushpuppy,” one of the group says, referring to deep-fried maize dough balls that are particularly popular in the American south. This whole experience is pleasingly low key – there’s no being corralled into restaurants that accommodate tourist groups – and Esneider brings not just culinary expertise but testimony to the immigrant experience of 48% of the borough. He has also travelled extensively through his work with Brazil’s Landless Rural Workers’ Movement and touring in his DIY punk band Huasipungo. Right now, he is the sole operator for Culinary Backstreets New York. We pass a corner usually populated by street vendors, but there’s just one woman, her cart piled high with food including over-ripe mangoes. The day before there was a police raid on unlicensed vendors. “The pushcart has been the traditional port of entry into the economy for a lot of immigrant families,” Esneider says. “But there is a cap on licences and people without them are vulnerable to police harassment. They say they want to control quality, but it’s part of the gentrification process. By increasing police presence in neighbourhoods they want gentrified, they squeeze out local businesses.” The next stop is food truck Hornado Ecuatoriano to try hot morocho, a sweet-spiced corn drink similar to rice pudding, and a popular midday snack in Ecuador. As we eat, we talk about how high-end restaurants with trendy food trucks monopolise the licences needed by immigrants. This is not a tour for the Instragram-happy foodies (though Esneider might benefit from it); it pushes you to look more deeply into your food choices, to examine how what we eat intersects with the economics of immigration and gentrification. I always try to eat sustainably, but until now I had never considered the socioeconomic ramifications of which food trucks I frequent. The tour continues to El Molino grocery store, where Esneider points out ingredients from cactus to panela (unrefined cane sugar), offering us recipe ideas as he goes; then onwards to La Caridad, a Cuban-owned botánica (a shop selling alternative health products and folk medicines), its shelves stocked with effigies, candles, and colognes promising to deliver everything from salvation to revenge. A shop next-door sells white dresses as crisp as frosting for girls’ quinceañera, Latin America’s coming of age tradition – like sweet sixteen but coming a year earlier. We keep eating: alfajores (a dulce de leche cookie), a chivito (a steak sandwich), and champús, a spiced Colombian drink of mashed lulo (a citrus fruit native to northern South America), corn, and pineapple. At this point everything is blending into one delicious cultural medley. This is not a tour for Instagram-happy foodies. It pushes you to look at your food choices We turn down 82nd Street and for the first time we see chain stores like Gap and Old Navy. While Jackson Heights was designated a Historic District in 1993 its protections don’t extend this far. Despite local resistance, the Jackson Movie Theatre was demolished after 90 years serving the community and will soon to be replaced by a Target department store. “A Target will give 15 jobs but take 30 from local businesses,” says Esneider, who campaigned against the re-zoning. As we enter Elmhurst the restaurants shift from Latin American to Pan Asian. We pick up some Hainanese chicken rice at the tiny Thai restaurant Eim Khao Mun Kai and a box of momos (south Asian dumplings) from Lhasa Liang Fen, where two Buddhist monks are watching a documentary on Tibetan hip hop. We take our wares to the historic Moore Homestead Playground for a picnic in the spring sunshine. Two older men argue over a game of Chinese checkers while kids play handball on the courts below. Esneider talks us through each dish, navigating its history and geography. I think about how there is no linear narrative to the migrant kitchens of Queens.

It must be abolished","bodyText":"The United States is in a legal and moral emergency, and lawyers have a special responsibility to speak up. Lawyers, as the protectors of the rule of law, must demand the end of indefinite family detention centers, must insist that all children get guaranteed legal representation, and should join the growing movement to abolish US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). It is not an accident that Donald Trump can use Ice and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as tools of unconstitutional illegal behavior: it is part of the structural flaw of the agencies themselves. Ice undermines what we aspire to be as Americans, and is an unaccountable and inhumane political tool, treating all immigrants as national security threats. Ice and CBP are tools of lawlessness, so rife with substantiated abuse incidents that we cannot treat these incidents like a few bad apples. Ice and CBP are so politicized that they are not credible as law enforcement agencies, and so deeply connected with illegal behavior that they are no longer credible as self-governing agencies. Instead, they have become tools of arbitrary power and cruelty; the opposite of law. The Trump administration has been ruthlessly separating families at the border, failing to reunite them. In response to the collective outrage, the president then committed to an inhumane and illegal public policy of indefinite detention, ostensibly so the families can be kept together, replacing one atrocity with another. On Sunday, Trump doubled down and took direct aim at our constitutional order when he tweeted: “When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.” This is a direct affront to the most foundational principles of public morality and law. Our constitution insists that “no person shall be … deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law”. It should not need saying, but undocumented immigrants are persons. Even if some process is slapped together despite Trump’s outrageous tweet, what kind of due process exists when a six-year-old child must represent herself in immigration proceedings? But the problems with Ice and CBP go far deeper than this ongoing atrocity. Ice is stunningly unaccountable, by design, and the horrors that we see today are part of a structural problem that George W Bush created and that we can and must fix. Let’s be clear: Ice is a fairly recent development. When the George W Bush administration successfully pushed to place immigration enforcement within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), it transformed decades of past practice where internal immigration policy was conducted by the justice department. The new policy sent a clear and chilling signal: immigrants should be treated as criminals and a national security threat. The criminalization of immigrants came into stark view at Trump’s State of the Union, where Trump publicly praised an Ice officer as a “leader in the effort to defend our country” who gets “dangerous criminals off our streets”. The “dangerous criminals” that Ice in fact targets includes families and individuals who have lived in the country for decades with no criminal record. By treating immigrants as criminals and national security threats, Ice – and CBP, also placed with DHS in 2003 – enhanced its own power and decreased oversight. The new design makes it hard to stop abuse and lawlessness, as Ice and CBP operate in the shadows, largely free from public scrutiny. Unsurprisingly, an unaccountable structure has led to rogue behavior. There is a long history of illegality within Ice and CBP. According to documents from the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which reviews complaints against Ice and Border Patrol, there were 1,124 allegations of sexual abuse and assault from 2010 to 2017, primarily from detainees in Ice custody. In fact, Department of Homeland Security OIG officials earlier indicated that they had received some 33,000 abuse complaints from 2010 to 2016. Remember, these assaults and abuses are visited upon people who have already faced unimaginable hardship. People traverse the dangerous journey to the US because of deep fear. They are often escaping brutality, even life-or-death situations. There are reports that before making the trek, women start taking birth control because it’s almost expected that they’ll get raped on the way. They come to the US out of desperation and devastation, and then, with our current policy, are confronted with mass trials, with lack of process, often with a failure to respect international refugee treaties, and with the threat of having their children taken and lost. The children are treated as tools at the most vulnerable developmental times in their lives. We won’t rest until every family is reunited and until the policy of indefinite detention is totally abandoned. And as attorney general, I will use my powers to block the federal government’s illegal programs, to use the full reach of New York law to get information from the administration about the family separation program, and to protect the rights of separated children and parents. But we need to go beyond the current moment and deal with the structural threat. We, as lawyers, must point out that unrestrained power is almost always abusive. Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. It is not an accident that Ice and CBP have become tools of illegality: it is part of the design. Therefore, we must abolish Ice.

One journalist described the institution as “the worst place in Sarajevo apart from the morgue”. It is more than 20 years since I first arrived in Sarajevo in late summer 1996. The destruction in the city was jaw-dropping: rows and rows of broken, bombed-out high-rise flats, shell craters and explosion indents everywhere; libraries, offices, factories all in ruins. This was city-wide destruction – a late-20th-century Dresden or Stalingrad. The Bosnian war had ended in 1995 and Sarajevo was enjoying its long-awaited peace. Sarajevans took to its scarred streets in huge numbers, eating ice cream and drinking coffee safe in the knowledge they wouldn’t be struck down by a sniper or shell. It was a time for simple pleasures. Anxieties about the future, unemployment, PTSD and rebuilding their city would come later. Sunday outing, Sarajevo, 1998. Photo by Edina Hrnjic aged 14. In 1997 I set up a darkroom using donated equipment from Scotland and started a small photo class in the basement of the orphanage. I taught the children, aged six to 16, basic photography techniques – shooting with 35mm SLR film cameras, developing their films and printing. There were no themed assignments or teaching of preconceived notions of what photography was, and the language barrier would not allow for the teaching of technicalities. The children from the orphanage and surrounding neighbourhood ran around their playgrounds and streets documenting anything that came into their viewpoint. They had free rein to photograph what they saw and what they wanted to capture. They photographed friends, strangers, destruction, peace-keeping soldiers, old ladies nosing out of windows, dogs in the park, street scenes, shopkeepers. I ran the project voluntarily for three consecutive summers before training up one of the local students, Edina Hrnjic, to take over and run the project for the younger children. Most of the photographs taken by these young people lay forgotten as negatives for more than 20 years and have only now been developed and scanned. The photographs show an honest and unique perspective on a Sarajevo that no longer exists. Its war-scarred buildings have been repaired and huge shopping malls and skyscraper apartments now fill the skyline. Dina Džihanić in Sarajevo in June 2018, photo by Chris Leslie.

She lived in the same neighbourhood as Bjelave orphanage and frequently helped out with the younger children. Today she works in microfinance as a marketing manager. When the photo project was set up, she saw it as something special that she was lucky to be involved in. As a young child, she says, her experiences of war had been better than those of peace. “War was the norm and everyone was equal: no one had anything,” she says. “But after war as people returned they had nice clothes, nice school stuff. The years after the war we really struggled – we had to wear old clothes that were too small for us. These were the worst moments for me.” Oggi Tomic, aged 13, in Sarajevo, June 1997, photo by Chris Leslie. Click or tap the image to switch to a self-portrait by Oggi in Cambridge, June 2018. Oggi Oggi Tomic (who is also pictured in the main image) was born with water on the brain and abandoned at birth – doctors gave him just months to live. He survived surgery and spent his earliest years in several orphanages in the region. In 1993 war made life impossible, and he ran away to the besieged city of Sarajevo. He entered a children’s institution there and stayed until 2004, when he was told to leave. A few years later he won a place to study documentary film and TV at the University of Wales and came to the UK on a student visa. He graduated with honours and set up his own successful film and video production agency in Cambridge. Photos by Oggi Tomic. The graves of Edina Hrnjic and her son Nedim in 2018.

I would be a huge patriot. But as I look over this city today with its beautiful views, I no longer see it as such. The political situation disgusts me. People who were born in this city and who live here are treated as second-class citizens.” Rina Trifkovic in her local neighbourhood in June 2018, photo by Chris Leslie.

Two children were killed, and several were taken off the bus at a Bosnian Serb militia checkpoint. Rina Trifkovic (right) learns photography in 1998. Photo by Dzenita Katovic. In 1997 Rina and 30 other children were returned home to Sarajevo amid much of the same controversy that accompanied their evacuation. The war had ended and Bosnian officials insisted on bringing the children back to their native country because as Bosnians they belonged in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Muhamd Muhamd Bosnjo lived in Bjelave orphanage after being abandoned at two months old. His mother had mental health issues and couldn’t care for him. During the war the children lived out a modern-day Lord of the Flies as their carers fled or were placed on the frontline. Muhamd and the other children would beg and steal to survive. At the age of eight he was wounded by a shell that fell in his playground, severely damaging his leg. When he was 10 he was held captive by Serbian forces for several months as they interrogated him for information. He was later released in a prisoner exchange. Robna Kuća shopping centre, 1997. Photo by Muhamd Bosnjo. He later married and lived briefly in London before getting divorced. The Home Office then told him he had to leave the UK and he was sent back to Bosnia. Today he works for a security company in various shops across the city. It is a tough job with poor pay. Ten years ago Muhamd’s mother committed suicide by jumping off a high cliff at the edge of the city. On his one day off work he always sits by the spot where his mother died.

Nusret Nusret lost both his parents at the start of the war in 1992 when a shell hit their apartment. He and his brother where then sent to the Bjelave orphanage where they fought hard to survive as the siege of Sarajevo raged. When he was 15 he and brother were kicked out the orphanage and he hit hard times, living homeless and begging on the streets. His brother died of an overdose. For a brief time he managed to come off drugs and settled down and got married, having a young baby son. The child was later taken from him by the authorities, who claimed it was at risk, and placed in the same orphanage Nusret once called home.

Tragically, his child was one of six babies killed when a fire swept through the orphanage in 2007. Today, Nusret is off drugs and no longer begging or homeless on the streets. A local mosque has provided him with monthly rent and he now spends his time at the mosque praying and doing odd jobs. After years of struggle, he has finally found “home”.

This week the supermarket ditched transparent plastic bags in favour of recyclable paper ones, in a move it said was prompted by customers’ worries over pollution. But the step is likely to have unintended consequences and trade one environmental challenge for another. The Environment Agency found that paper carrier bags, across their lifecycle of production, use and disposal, had a greater global-warming impact than plastic ones. The agency’s study found paper ones were only better than plastic if they were used four or more times, but that was unlikely due to durability of paper bags. While the research was published seven years ago, the government’s top waste and recycling advisers, Wrap, said the findings were still relevant today. Chris Goodall, an author and environmental expert, said: “This is a retrograde step, moving back to paper.” He agreed the impact of plastic pollution on marine life was very serious, but said: “Most of the plastic in the sea comes from a small number of rivers, it does not come from me buying green beans in Morrisons.” Compared to using plastic bags for loose fruit and vegetable, paper bags were a backwards step in climate and energy use terms, Goodall said. One reason for the greater climate impact is that using paper will lessen the life expectancy of produce, he argued, leading to more food waste in landfill, where it generates methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. However, Friends of the Earth said that it welcomed Morrisons’ switch and that green issues other than climate change should be factored in. Julian Kirby, a campaigner at the group, said: “The thing about climate change is because it’s such a huge worry it has eclipsed other very serious environmental and health concerns, and that would include … pollution. “With a paper bag, if it escapes into the environment it will biodegrade very soon. That is not the case with a plastic one.” The supermarket appeared aware of the trade-off, saying it had weighed the environmental impact of paper against the potential pollution from plastic. “We have listened to customers and they are telling us that the overuse of plastic is the most important environmental issue for us to deal with,” a spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jul/04/world-cup-quiz-only-connect-guardian","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-04T09:57:42Z","webTitle":"Only Connect: the Guardian World Cup edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/04/world-cup-quiz-only-connect-guardian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jul/04/world-cup-quiz-only-connect-guardian","fields":{"headline":"Only Connect: the Guardian World Cup edition","bodyText":"The Only Connect format is pretty easy to get the hang of even if you’ve never seen the show.

Its bourgeois facade masks its anarchic, rebellious side, and it has friendly people, an entrepreneurial spirit and artistic vibe. I also appreciate its intimacy whenever I return from tours, and its flat, bike-friendly geography giving the sense that everything is nearby, including the countryside. With all that, I think Poznań – halfway between Warsaw and Berlin – might be the best starting point for tourists new to Poland. After all, this is where our country was founded, back in the 10th century. Oskoma This restaurant deserves Michelin stars. Its muscly tattoed head chef, Adam Adamczak, may look like a ruffian but actually he’s a visionary, creating delicate dishes that are traditionally Polish but with ultra-modern twists. I once had beef tartare served with an upside-down wine glass of hay smoke atop. Every detail, down to rare little mountain flowers, is beautifully crafted, every ingredient top quality. Follow the staff’s recommendations: though some combinations sound odd, they work amazingly well. • Four-course tasting menu £28, Mickiewicza 9, oskoma.pl Noriaki street art I love graffiti, so it’s pleasing that one of the world’s great street artists is from Poznań. He’s known only by the tag Noriaki, after the Japanese ski jumper Noriaki Kasai, and he has his own distinct monochrome style. His main character is a stick figure called The Watcher, who has a periscope eye and can be spotted everywhere – on road signs, pavements and on walls. The best place to see it is the old town, on the corner of Szkolna and Paderewskiego streets. Noriak’s Watcher can also be spotted in Shoreditch, east London. • instagram.com/noriakinoriaki Mercure Poznań Centrum pastry shop This traditional bakery is the only place where I buy Poznań’s speciality: the St Martin’s croissant (rogale świętomarcińskie). On 11 November every year, St Martin’s Day commemorates a young priest who cooked croissants for the poor; today, we consume tonnes of them all year round, and there’s even a museum devoted to them here. Folded exactly 81 times and shaped like a horseshoe, the croissants are filled with a paste of white poppy seeds, almonds and raisins, then topped with icing and more nuts. You need a special licence to bake them, and the Mercure’s shop makes the best. • Roosevelta 20, accorhotels.com Zemsta Zemsta is hugely important in Poznań. It’s a small, neatly decorated anarchist bookstore where you can read unusual texts, eat vegan food, drink Zapatista-made coffee and meet free-thinkers or radicals. Poland has seen a shift to the far right, so places like Zemsta, whose owners hail from Poland’s oldest squat in Rozbrat, are really important as they encourage political debate and change. • Fredry 5/3a, zemsta.org, closed Sundays Glanc In Poznań, having coffee without eating something sweet feels weird. Beside the central Baltyk Tower skyscraper, shaped like a giant glass staircase, sits an old printing house that now houses design companies. Also here is Glanc, a hip cafe with marble tables and iron chairs. The coffee is good but people really come for the homemade desserts and cakes. Beautiful and vivid, they include Portuguese tarts, praline pastries, Belgian chocolate-piped buns and macaroons with little dollops of colourful cream. Yum! • Zwierzyniecka 3, on Facebook Świetlica “Świetlica” means a children’s playgroup but this cafe is for adults. It’s inside the modern part of Zamek (the imperial castle) – actually a neo-Romanesque palace built under German rule in 1910 and now an arts centre that hosts over 2,500 annual events, from film festivals to concerts. Above the Great Hall’s two galleries, this cool cafe-bar is open until 10pm. I like to sip a non-alcoholic bomba (spinach, pineapple, orange juice, banana and linseed) here before playing a concert, or catch up with friends over a few glasses of prosecco. In the foyer below, there are huge beanbags to chill out on. • Święty Marcin 80/82, on Facebook Tylko U Nas – U Dziadka U Dziadka (pronounced “o-jadka”), as it is known to everyone, is a local institution popular with workers and students. Close to Old Market Square and run by Paulina, it’s like going to your grandparents’ house for lunch. Its chunky pan-fried pork chops are legendary, served with buttery potatoes and cabbage salad, and so cheap (£3). Everyone eats together at one long communal table, or you can get takeaway. • Szkolna 7, on Facebook, closes 6.30pm weekdays and 4.30pm weekends Klub Dragon When first entering this place, close to Old Market Square, you think there’s only one room but beyond the first dimly lit bar, corridors and stairs lead to a courtyard and balconies, to corners for quiet chats, to basement raves, secret restaurant and room that holds 80-100 people for jazz or improv gigs. Often open until dawn, Dragon also serves great food – I love the French fries with orange sauce or red-curried shrimps. Above all, it’s full of artists: if Poznań’s famous film-music composer Krzysztof Komeda were alive today, he’d be here drinking cherry vodka. • Zamkowa 3, on Facebook Lodziarnia Kolorowa This shop sells Poznan’s best ice-cream, and you’ll probably have to queue to get it. While the city has seen a craze for liquid-nitrogen parlours in the last two years, Kolorowa serves “natural” ice-creams and sorbets made the old-fashioned way. I normally order strawberry cream, but the Snickers and blackcurrant-and-mascarpone flavours are really popular, and chocolate-filled cones are available on request. Opposite the Okrąglak building, its prices are sensational but it’s cash only and there’s no seating. • Around £1.60 for two scoops, 27 Grudnia 21, no website Bo.Poznan Named after its owner, Borys, this restaurant – next to Zamek – is the best breakfast place in town. Borys serves food to rival modern fusion restaurants, for around half the price (£3.20), and frequently changes the menu. You can choose between shakshuka, salads, porridges and french toast, all with unusual twists like beetroot tartare or red-onion jam from old family recipes. I recommend the brioche with black pudding, poached egg, bacon and caramelised onion – it’s astonishing! • Kościuszki 84, on Facebook, open from 8am, closed Thursdays and Fridays Getting there Wizz Air flies direct to Poznań from Luton, Birmingham and Doncaster/Sheffield. Where to stay Airbnb has options across the city but many are run by agents, so try for a genuine local home like Magda’s top-floor flat (from £30 a night) in the hip district of Jeżyce. Best time to go Between June and late August, urban beaches open along the Warta River’s grassy banks, linked at weekends by the dinky Water Tram. Exchange rate £1 = 5 zlotys.

As a young Nirvana fan, she heard their cover of Lead Belly’s Where Did You Sleep Last Night and started hunting down American acoustic blues, then sought guitar lessons from a teacher who introduced her to John Fahey, the pioneer of American primitive guitar music. Fahey echoes throughout her mesmerising debut album (there’s even a track called Requiem for John Fahey). So much so that hearing it blind you would refuse to believe it had been recorded by a Brighton resident originally from Wales. Surely this stew of bluegrass, blues and haunted Americana could only come from a land where cotton and tobacco grow. The opening track, Off to See the Hangman Part I, is a red herring, Raymond picking out a droning, Arabic-inflected melody on an old violin. But on the second, Sometimes There’s Blood, the fingerpicking begins and never lets up. It’s a wonderful and mysterious album: Raymond plays everything herself, with attention to detail not just in playing but in instrumentation (a 1920s Bradley Kincaid “Houn’ Dog” parlour guitar included).

The size of a golf ball, it sits bold and white on the brain stem, a part of the organ that sends messages back and forth between body and brain. In many ways it is the master controller: from the top of the spinal cord, the brain stem conducts every heartbeat, every swallow, every breath. For this young man, the cancer came to light in dramatic fashion. The growing tumour blocked fluid draining from his brain, triggering a huge seizure. Now doctors must work out the best way to treat him. Raj Jena, a neuro-oncologist at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge, has pulled up the image to explain how doctors plan radiotherapy for patients. For a case like this he might need to study more than 100 images, each showing a thin slice of the brain. Then, image by image, Jena must carefully mark out the border of the tumour and the contours of sensitive brain regions that should be spared the radiotherapy beams: the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, the pathways to the brain’s vision centres, for example. The process can take hours. But only once it is done can computers start calculating how to hit the tumour with radiotherapy beams without frazzling important parts nearby. “Until we define where the tumour is and have defined the healthy tissues we want to protect, we cannot start the treatment,” says Jena. “This is the bottleneck. The quicker you get this done, the quicker you can get the patient into treatment.” With artificial intelligence (AI), the painstaking task can be completed in minutes. For the past six months, Jena has used a Microsoft system called InnerEye to mark up scans automatically for prostate cancer patients. Men make up a third of the 2,500 cancer patients his department treats every year. When a scan is done, the images are anonymised, encrypted and sent to the InnerEye program. It outlines the prostate on each image, creates a 3D model, and sends the information back. For prostate cancer, the entire organ is irradiated. The software learned how to mark up organs and tumours by training on scores of images from past patients that had been seen by experienced consultants. It already saves time for prostate cancer treatment. Brain tumours are next on the list. Automating the process does more than save time. Because InnerEye trains on images marked up by leading experts, it should perform as well as a top consultant every time. The upshot is that treatment is delivered faster and more precisely. “We know that how well we do the contouring has an impact on the quality of the treatment,” Jena says. “The difference between good and less good treatment is how well we hit the tumour and how well we avoid the healthy tissues.” A mile or so from Addenbrooke’s, Antonio Criminisi, the lead researcher on InnerEye at Microsoft Research, explains how automatic processing could pave the way for even smarter radiotherapy. Because it is so time-consuming and expensive, tumour images today are marked up only once, before radiotherapy begins. If it was fast and cheap, patients could have “adaptive radiotherapy” where scanning, image mark-up and beam planning are done before every treatment session. That way, the radiotherapy beams are sculpted to the tumour’s size and shape on the day, not when it was first imaged. “This could be transformative,” says Criminisi. “It could enable a new way of treating cancer that is faster and a lot less burdensome for patients and the NHS.” Computer engineers are fond of asserting that data is the fuel of AI. It is true: some modern approaches to AI, notably machine learning, are powerful because they can divine meaningful patterns in the mountains of data we gather. If there is a silver lining to the fact that everyone falls ill at some point, it is that the NHS has piles of data on health problems and diseases that are ripe for AI to exploit. Tony Young, a consultant urological surgeon at Southend University hospital and the national clinical lead for innovation at NHS England, believes AI can make an impact throughout the health service. He points to companies using AI to diagnose skin cancer from pictures of moles; eye disorders from retinal scans; heart disease from echocardiograms. Others are drawing on AI to flag up stroke patients who need urgent care, and to predict which patients on a hospital ward may not survive. “I think it’s going to create a revolution,” he says. Technology will not transform the NHS overnight. Like any other innovation, AI systems must be tested, validated and approved. And systems that learn often need careful interpretation. A patient’s blood test may reveal sure signs of life-threatening cancer, but an AI may rate the patient as low risk if that cancer can be treated very well. What may help drive AI through the NHS is the hope that, in some instances, the innovations can save money as well as lives. If patients are triaged faster, tests performed more efficiently, and good diagnoses made more swiftly, the whole system becomes streamlined. One technology the NHS has embraced is called HeartFlow. Spun out of Stanford University, it draws on CT scans that are taken routinely for patients suspected of having coronary heart disease. HeartFlow uses AI to create a personalised 3D model of the heart and the flow of blood around it. From this, doctors can see how specific blockages disrupt blood flow in individual blood vessels and better decide what treatment, if any, is needed. In tests, more than half of patients who had HeartFlow analysis avoided an invasive angiogram, a common but costly procedure that squirts dye into the heart, cutting costs by a quarter. “People ask how can we afford to have these kinds of technologies in the NHS? My answer is we cannot afford not to,” says Young. It is early days for Vishal Nangalia, a consultant anaesthesiologist at the Royal Free hospital in London, but his company, Life Engine.AI, is honing an AI that crunches blood test results and other data to predict which patients are most likely to die, or have serious problems such as kidney failure, when they are admitted to hospital. Trained on nearly 1bn blood test results from 20 hospitals, the program spots subtle changes in red and white blood cells, and electrolytes such as sodium and potassium, which suggest a patient is going downhill. It does not tell doctors what to do, but helps them intervene sooner by flagging up those patients who might benefit from tests, a scan, or a review from a specialist. “What machine learning can do is help identify issues and bring them to the attention of doctors,” Nangalia says. Will AI replace doctors, or diminish their role? Back at Addenbrooke’s, Jena shakes his head. “I’d rather spend my time thinking about how to optimise a patient’s treatment than clicking a mouse,” he says. “For many oncologists, we are coming in at weekends and on evenings. With this, we are freed up to do the things that we bring real expertise to.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/28/its-about-time-the-black-and-asian-bands-decolonising-british-indie","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-28T12:18:47Z","webTitle":"'It's about time': the black and Asian bands 'decolonising' British indie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/28/its-about-time-the-black-and-asian-bands-decolonising-british-indie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/28/its-about-time-the-black-and-asian-bands-decolonising-british-indie","fields":{"headline":"'It's about time': the black and Asian bands 'decolonising' British indie","bodyText":"This is not your standard punk-rock gig, even if the scruffy venue used to be a warehouse and guitars are being liberally thrashed. That’s mainly because the 150-strong crowd is not uniformly white – more than half are people of colour. Then there’s the figure crooning with restrained menace on stage. She goes by the name Ms Mohammed, specialises in “rock’n’dhol” (referencing a type of Indian drum) and says she’s part of a resurgence in British POC guitar bands. “It feels like a burgeoning scene, and it’s about time really,” she says. Ms Mohammed was a headliner at last weekend’s Decolonise Fest, a three-day event in south London featuring only bands of colour. In the festival’s second year, organisers received more than 100 applications to play – proof, they say, that the talent is out there, despite few POC being prominent in UK guitar music (they also run regular POC nights under the name DIY Diaspora Punx). In the US, bands such as Vagabon and Mitski have been breaking American indie’s white mould. Why hasn’t the same happened in multicultural Britain? British guitar music wasn’t always so white. People of colour were vital in founding the UK’s punk and indie scenes. But while everyone knows the Sex Pistols and the Smiths, Poly Styrene from X-Ray Spex is hardly a household name, while the contribution of Zeke Manyika to Orange Juice is often overlooked. Decolonise was set up in part to confront this “whitewashing”, says organiser Jon Bellebono. “Bands with people of colour have always existed and lots of them have been successful.” Their legacy, Bellebono argues, is just not celebrated in the same way. In Britpop, regarded by many as the last golden era of British guitar music, bands led by POC such as Cornershop and Echobelly again tend to be left on the story’s fringes. Both were popular at the time, although their members’ heritage frequently influenced how they were perceived. Echobelly’s Sonya Madan feels too much attention was given to her background – Melody Maker once described her as a “tiny, kickboxing Indian”. But, ultimately, she considers the era’s exploration of British identity as a positive one: “The scene was pretty inclusive,” she says. “Britpop was many things, but it was not a racist movement.” Perhaps Britpop is more to blame for what it left behind. Apart from helping to revive fantasies of Britain’s cultural greatness, guitar music grew less diverse in its wake. By the late 90s, indie had become synonymous with whiteness, which endures: Bloc Party’s Kele Okereke, a rare exception among predominantly white guitar bands, has described the British scene as “one of the few arenas where diversity is not encouraged”. London’s self-proclaimed “three-tone” punk trio the Tuts are getting mainstream attention: they’ve sold out small clubs on nationwide tours and played Glastonbury. And yet they remain unsigned. Drummer Beverley Ishmael thinks that with guitar music less popular than it used to be, labels don’t want to gamble on POC. “They’re going to go with the safe option, which is white-man bands,” she says. This is why events such as Decolonise are so important, Ishmael adds, inspiring young POC to get up on stage themselves: “If you see someone who represents you, who looks like you, has hair like you, you’re gonna be like, ‘Oh yeah, I can do that, too’.” The Tuts’ singer and guitarist Nadia Javed, who appeared on a panel at this year’s Decolonise festival, has no illusions about the hurdles faced by POC indie bands. “I feel like white cis men get away with being mediocre,” she says. “When people see women, and then women of colour as well, they expect twice the amount of work.” And even when there is recognition, bands of colour often find themselves on otherwise all-white lineups. “Everyone is trying desperately to get that one slot that’s available to them,” says Javed. “There have been times where I’ve legitimately doubted myself: have I got this really good gig because of my music, or am I ticking a diversity quota?” says experimental industrial-rock artist Kapil Seshasayee, another Decolonise headliner. As well as making an album about oppression in the Indian caste system, Seshasayee is a DIY promoter in Glasgow. “A lot of the time with diversity, I have to force it to happen,” he says. The Tuts have found themselves put on a festival’s “urban” stage alongside MCs and grime artists, while critics describe Big Joanie, an emerging black feminist punk band, as “soulful”. “We’re closer to Nirvana than a soul band,” says singer-guitarist Stephanie Phillips. “The whole idea that you see black women and they should be there warbling out some Beyoncé to you – it’s [about] not being able to critique what’s in front of you because of your own ingrained prejudice.” It was Phillips who thought up Decolonise, having felt a “vacuum” existed since her teenage years in Wolverhampton, “and remembering there was literally nothing, no kind of acceptance for people like me”. Bands such as Nova Twins, Skinny Girl Diet and Sacred Paws are attracting attention, although Phillips is cautious: “It’s a long-term thing, it’s not going to change overnight.” But Ms Mohammed wonders if a flagging scene can afford to continue overlooking POC bands. She has a message for the industry: “We are the future, so stop fucking ignoring us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global/2018/jul/01/joe-cole-actor-interview-i-was-ready-to-deliver-a-kicking","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"Joe Cole: ‘I was ready to deliver a kicking’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jul/01/joe-cole-actor-interview-i-was-ready-to-deliver-a-kicking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/jul/01/joe-cole-actor-interview-i-was-ready-to-deliver-a-kicking","fields":{"headline":"Joe Cole: ‘I was ready to deliver a kicking’","bodyText":"You might know Joe Cole as a Brummie, from Peaky Blinders, where he played John Shelby, the much-loved gangster kid brother to Cillian Murphy’s Tommy. Or maybe as a Manc, from the Hang the DJ episode of Black Mirror, in which true love was shown to triumph in an age of algorithm-sanctioned pairings. Or, if you catch him in his latest film, A Prayer Before Dawn, where he’s a Liverpudlian boxer turned Thai prisoner turned Muay Thai fighter, using mostly non- verbal gestures to ask to fight or to plead for drugs. “I’ve not done my own accent in years,” says Cole, 29, his own voice deep, slightly gruff, with a south London twang. Last night, he was watching the World Cup with mates in a bar near where he lives now, in Brixton, but today we’re in a Hitchcock-themed hotel on the outskirts of the capital, drinking in the bucolic surroundings of Epping Forest. He’s on a rare break from filming, having been working almost solidly since he chucked in his old job of selling carpets. Apart from the football, he’s been going to auditions, but there can’t be many accents left for him to tick off. Scottish? “I just went in for Scottish the other day,” he smiles. Cole has become one of those actors whose presence is usually an indication of quality, particularly on TV, though A Prayer Before Dawn, which called for a complete transformation and total immersion in a tough, violent world, could do for his big screen career what Bronson did for Tom Hardy. He was raised in Kingston-upon-Thames, the oldest brother of five (three of the five are now actors). “I was a bit of a wind-up, a joker,” he remembers, but puts it down to growing up in a busy house. “And my mum used to look after kids after school, so there were always at least 10 people in the house. Always.” Recently, he moved into a one-bedroom flat on his own, for the first time in his life, but the isolation didn’t stick. “I quickly realised it wasn’t for me. I love my own company, but not permanently. I’m used to a house of people coming and going. I don’t think I ever remember being on my own in the house.” Now, he lives in a houseshare with friends, and one of his brothers. He started acting at school, where one particular teacher – “an inspiring, amazing teacher, Miss O’Shea” – made drama seem like fun. “Our school didn’t have as much money as the surrounding schools, but her and the music teacher would go out of their way to make these productions better than they should have been,” he recalls. Up until his GCSEs, he was a high achiever, top set, and found it all easy, but when A-levels came around, he started to falter. “When I actually had to put in some work, I realised I was middle of the pack, and for me that wasn’t enough, so I didn’t do any work, messed about, went out, and it wasn’t going to plan.” He calls his later teenage years “tricky”. “I had a bit of a bad break-up, I didn’t get into university, I felt very sorry for myself,” he laughs. “Perhaps I shouldn’t have, but I did. I got arrested. I was just getting up to nonsense, really.” He went back to school, in his brother’s year, and retook his exams, after realising that his current life as a carpet salesman wasn’t quite right. “I mean this with no disrespect at all, but it wasn’t for me.” Then he applied to the National Youth Theatre – and got in. Cole puts a lot of his success down to self-belief and optimism, to a certainty that, once he’d decided he was going to be an actor, he was passionate enough to do the work he needed to do to make it happen. “I remember watching Skins when I was at college, when I was fucking around and fucking my life up, and I was watching Skins, like, I could be there. I’ve got more fire in my belly, I’ve got more to say, and I reckon I could go and do that. And that was my mindset.” It didn’t take long for it to come to fruition. One of his first breakout roles was as Luke, a drug-dealing bad boy, in series six of Skins. “To see me come out of the other side of that and flourish was just a relief for my mum,” he explains. Given that he’s got an angelic sort of face, with long eyelashes and plump lips, it’s perhaps surprising he’s cast as a rogue as often as he is. But Cole has a long line in bad boys and hard men, from an early role in Offender, set against the backdrop of the 2011 London riots, to the short film Slap, in which he played a cross-dressing boxer. Then, of course, there was John Shelby, the baby Peaky Blinder, who met a gangster’s fate at the beginning of series five. The show has been a bona fide hit and, as well as winning awards all over the place, it’s set a fashion precedent, unlocking many men’s desire to look like a 1920s criminal. “The haircuts?” he smiles. “People absolutely love it, it’s amazing. With television, people respond in a different way, it’s crazy. I have some friends who’ve done big films and stuff, but the love for Peaky Blinders just completely takes over from that.” It was Cole who decided to step away from the show, despite its huge success. “We started shooting in 2012, so it’s five series, but it’s gone on for six years. I’ve had a great run and loved every minute, but I’m trying to push on, to do new things and challenge myself. For me it was definitely the right time.” He says that people were so gutted by John’s exit, they still come up to him in the street, “crying and stuff, which is mad. What more can you ask for as an actor, if people respond to your work like that?” He was pleased to get the part of Frank in Black Mirror almost as soon as he’d decided to leave Peaky (as he calls it) because it showed what he already knew – that he had the range to play a romantic lead as well as a tough guy. But he’s returning to the hard stuff for A Prayer Before Dawn. It’s an adaptation of a memoir by Billy Moore. He was locked up in a brutal Thai prison for three years and found a kind of salvation in prison-sanctioned Muay Thai fighting. Shot over three months, somewhere north of Bangkok, it’s distressing, clammy and harrowing, and almost entirely mute; many scenes were improvised, and the language barrier, deliberately maintained between Cole and the Thai cast, prevented a lot of talking. Instead, much of the communication is done through fists and feet. “I was ready to put myself on the line, and spar for real and fight, and get the shit kicked out of me, and deliver a few kickings as well,” Cole says. “I was ready to go there, and I’m not sure everybody would go there, even if they say they would. I’d like a few of the lads to prove me wrong, but we’ll see.” He’s sporty anyway, so enjoyed the Muay Thai training and getting ripped for the part. “It was simple, but regimented. Train every day, eat the same food, a couple of press-ups.” Just two? “I did two press-ups. Amazing, right? One at the beginning of the shoot and one right at the end,” he says. “I should get in touch with Men’s Health.” Cole says he’s not one for “method” acting – he does disdainful inverted commas with his fingers when he says the word – but admits he found it difficult to shake this one. “It was long, heavy hard days with a lot of fighting every single day. I remember getting on the plane and feeling very emotional. Sounds a bit naff, but I did. It’s the first job I did where I’ve felt emotional afterwards. I thought, even if this turns out to be a pile of shite, it’s been one hell of a ride. We all felt we were making something special.” He applies the same kind of logic to his career so far. “Listen, the rug could be pulled out at any time,” he says, an apt metaphor for a former carpet salesman, “so let’s not get ahead of ourselves. But even if I had to quit tomorrow, I’m pretty happy. I am content. And I think mainly I’m content because of this film.” Still, that’s not to say he’s ready to coast. He’s been working on his own scripts, and has a couple of writing projects on the go that he’s quietly confident about. And he’s about to star in Channel 4’s new drama Pure, in which he’ll play a recovering porn addict – and he’s doing close to his own accent in this one… On Twitter, Cole’s handle is “theotherjoecole”, but you get the sense any mix-ups between him and his footballing namesake will be happening less and less. Though he says the postman still seems disappointed. “‘Oh my God, I thought you were gonna be famous. I thought you were gonna be the footballer,’” he mimics, grinning. “Nah, not me mate. Just a regular Joe.” A Prayer Before Dawn is in cinemas from 20 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/jun/27/britain-mid-sized-cities-government-uk-prosperity","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T06:17:32Z","webTitle":"Britain is full of powerful mid-sized cities.

Let's unlock their potential","bodyText":"In theory, cities have been at the heart of the government’s plans for economic growth outside London. In reality, the government has tended to focus its attention on the UK’s largest cities like Manchester or Birmingham rather than mid-sized cities. A new report, Key Cities: Unlocking Potential, sets out how involving mid-sized cities like Blackpool and Plymouth more closely in the design and implementation of policy would reap substantial rewards – not just for the government, but for society and the economy as a whole. A closer look at the June 2016 EU referendum result highlights the value that closer engagement with the UK’s mid-sized cities might bring. While 56% of people in the 10 large core cities voted remain, 60% of the 5.6 million people living in the 20 small and mid-sized key cities comprising the Key Cities group voted leave. In 2017, a study by the National Centre for Social Research indicated that a sense of exclusion from the political and economic life of the UK strongly influenced the leave vote. The referendum result presents clear evidence that the government needs to engage with mid-sized cities to reconnect with leave-voting communities. As chair of the Key Cities group, I know that we are well-placed to take on the role as the authentic voice of urban Britain, a voice that would serve as an intermediary between the government and communities that feel left behind by national and global politics. Such collaboration may also help meet the ambition of the industrial strategy white paper to boost the UK’s economic productivity, which currently lags 15% behind the G7 average. The 20 Key Cities are already helping to address the UK’s productivity challenge. Bournemouth, for instance, was the No 1 UK city for employment growth in 2017; Sunderland was named Britain’s top exporting city in 2017 by the Centre for Cities; Wakefield has one of the highest housing growth rates in the country; and Southampton, Norwich and Portsmouth are listed in the top 10 UK cities for expected GVA growth. The UK’s mid-sized cities also have a growing reputation as hotbeds of creativity and innovation. Newport has received significant investment to host a facility to manufacture compound semiconductors, which will drive forward next generation technologies such as driverless cars and 5G, while Wakefield will be home to a new national innovation centre for the creative and digital sector as part of the city’s new five-year plan to boost economic growth. Meanwhile, the pioneering Bradford Pathways model not only seeks to train the city’s young people in the core skills needed for today’s jobs, but also aims to give them the resilience and flexibility needed to take on the jobs of the future. These examples invite the question: what more could these cities achieve with greater support, powers, freedoms and flexibilities from the government? A growing body of research demonstrates that mid-sized cities provide enhanced economic and social returns on infrastructure and other investment compared to larger cities. The 20 key cities are worth more than £116bn a year to the UK economy. Raising their collective productivity could, we estimate, enable these 20 places to contribute an additional £214bn to the UK economy over the next decade. Mid-sized cities are not merely the drivers, but the accelerators of growth. These cities’ economies are agile and ripe for investment, with land available for expansion and a collective population who voted overwhelmingly for Brexit because they believed this would change their lives for the better. In order to respond effectively to 21st-century post-Brexit economic and social challenges, the government must work with the UK’s mid-sized cities.

These 6mm beetles, also known as oak pinhole borers, have a remarkable trick of cultivating ambrosia fungi, which produces alcohol, hence their liking for beer. The beetles, Platypus cylindrus, carry spores of the ambrosia fungi about with them so that when colonising dead or dying trees they can start growing the fungus on which they and their offspring feed. One of the benefits for them in farming this particular fungus is that alcohol is toxic to many competing beetles and fungi so they carve out a patch untroubled by competition. Scientists investigating the life cycle of these beetles used alcohol as bait on trees to attract them. Concentrations found in the average pint brought in the most beetles. Until recently these beetles were relatively rare in Britain but the great storm of 1987 changed all that by providing a massive load of fallen and damaged timber. Unlike other wood boring beetles ambrosias do not pose a threat to healthy trees or furniture since they live on the fungus they farm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/27/wednesdays-best-tv-stath-lets-flats-mortimer-whitehouse-gone-fishing","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T09:31:47Z","webTitle":"Wednesday’s best TV: Stath Lets Flats; Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/27/wednesdays-best-tv-stath-lets-flats-mortimer-whitehouse-gone-fishing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/27/wednesdays-best-tv-stath-lets-flats-mortimer-whitehouse-gone-fishing","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday’s best TV: Stath Lets Flats; Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing","bodyText":"Stath Lets Flats 10pm, Channel 4 Created by Jamie Demetriou (and co-written by Robert “Friday Night Dinner” Popper), this new comedy set in the lettings agency world looks highly promising.

There is no real desire within the club’s hierarchy to part company with a striker who has become a useful squad player under Jürgen Klopp, but the 25-year-old craves regular first-team football and recognises he will struggle for game-time on Merseyside. He will depart with Liverpool’s blessing. Ings’s desire to prove himself under Klopp had seen him reject prospective moves in each of the last three transfer windows in which he has been fit and available for selection, with interest having been expressed by Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham, as well as his former clubs Burnley and Bournemouth. There will be suitors from Premier League clubs this time round too but, intriguingly, interest also from abroad. Internazionale are believed to be monitoring his situation, while a trio of Bundlesiga clubs – RB Leipzig, Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen – could also formalise their pursuit of his services. Ings will depart reluctantly, but retains ambitions to prove himself at the highest level and a desire to regain a place in the England setup. It is a sign of the strength of the relationship between player and manager that Liverpool are unlikely to price him out of a move away. The £6.5m signing from Burnley has seen his time at Anfield horribly interrupted by two serious knee injuries, but he recovered sufficiently to make 14 appearances last term for the Champions League finalists, scoring once in a 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion in April. He has worked extensively with a personal trainer over the current closed season to ensure he will be fit and ready for the new season – Liverpool actually return to pre-season training next Monday – and has two years to run on his current contract. Ings was capped by England, under Roy Hodgson, against Lithuania in October 2015 before damaging his anterior cruciate ligaments in Klopp’s first training session as Liverpool manager. He suffered a further ligament injury at the start of the 2016-17 season and, as a result, did not actually start a Premier League game between October 2015 and April 2018. Yet his desire to force a way into contention at a club boasting mouth-watering attacking options saw him reject chances to leave where others, including Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi, sought loan moves to rekindle their careers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/26/muslim-group-accuses-tories-of-turning-blind-eye-to-islamophobia-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T21:00:20Z","webTitle":"Muslim group accuses Tories of turning blind eye to Islamophobia claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/26/muslim-group-accuses-tories-of-turning-blind-eye-to-islamophobia-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/26/muslim-group-accuses-tories-of-turning-blind-eye-to-islamophobia-claims","fields":{"headline":"Muslim group accuses Tories of turning blind eye to Islamophobia claims","bodyText":"The Muslim Council of Britain has accused the Conservative party of hoping allegations of Islamophobia in its ranks will “magically go away” and complained that the party’s chairman has not responded to its call for an internal inquiry. Three weeks after it first raised the issue, the group wrote again to Brandon Lewis on Tuesday highlighting further allegations of anti-Muslim prejudice within Tory ranks. It said it was not acceptable to turn “a blind eye to legitimate concerns about bigotry”. The MCB said further examples of alleged Islamophobic abuse had emerged, including the former party chair Sayeeda Warsi saying she had been racially abused at meetings, and a pro-Tory Facebook group that contained a string of anti-Muslim threats. The MCB letter, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian, says: “Three weeks ago we wrote to you requesting an inquiry into Islamophobia within the Conservative party. Sadly we have neither received an acknowledgement nor a reply. “We cannot have an approach where you are hoping that the issue would magically go away so that it could avoid a bruising inquiry into anti-Muslim prejudice.” The MCB also cited comments by a former parliamentary candidate, Shazia Awan, who said she had quit the party because it had “a notion that Islam is not compatible with British values”. Although Lewis did not respond directly to the MCB letter, he wrote an article for Conservative Home 10 days ago in which he said the party would work with the anti-racism group TellMama, would make diversity training available to party members and would remind local associations of the standards of behaviour expected. “A single case of abuse is one too many, and since becoming chairman I have taken a zero-tolerance approach,” he wrote. The MCB said it welcomed “at least your willingness to talk about Islamophobia” but added that it had been approached by “other individuals [who] have shared with us their stories of experiencing Islamophobia” who did not want to be named because they were afraid of damaging their prospects in the party. One Tory member had told it about a local party leader who said another member looked “too Muslim” and “wouldn’t be accepted”, and it had also heard of “five BME Tory members being seated on a single table at the back of a room at a Conservative association dinner”. Relations between the MCB and the Conservatives have been fractious ever since the group called for an internal inquiry at the end of May. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said shortly afterwards that the MCB “does not represent Muslims in this country”, prompting the MCB to accuse him of “shooting the messenger”. At the time the MCB asked why no action had been taken against Bob Blackman, the Harrow East MP, after he retweeted an anti-Islam message from the hard-right activist Tommy Robinson, and hosted a hardline Hindu nationalist, Tapan Ghosh, in parliament. Blackman said he had retweeted the Robinson post accidentally and had not known in advance that Ghosh was being invited to an event last October. Harun Khan, the secretary general of the MCB, said: “We earnestly hope that the Conservative party addresses concerns of Islamophobia with the seriousness it deserves. The true extent of the problem can only be achieved via an independent inquiry.” The Conservative party declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/26/american-librarians-laura-ingalls-wilder-award","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T14:57:34Z","webTitle":"American librarians defend renaming Laura Ingalls Wilder award","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/26/american-librarians-laura-ingalls-wilder-award","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/26/american-librarians-laura-ingalls-wilder-award","fields":{"headline":"American librarians defend renaming Laura Ingalls Wilder award","bodyText":"The American Library Association (ALA) has stressed that its decision to drop Laura Ingalls Wilder’s name from its children’s literature award due to racist sentiments in her books is not “an attempt to censor, limit, or deter access” to the Little House on the Prairie author’s books. The organisation announced on Sunday that the board of the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) had voted 12 to zero in favour of changing the name of the Laura Ingalls Wilder award to the Children’s literature legacy award. The prize was first awarded in 1954 to Wilder herself, and has been won by some of America’s best-loved children’s authors, from EB White to Beverly Cleary. The ALA first proposed a possible name change in 2017, feeling that its values of diversity and inclusion were not consistent with the “complex legacy” of Wilder, “as her books reflect racist and anti-Native sentiments and are not universally embraced”. Wilder’s legacy has long been controversial due to the attitudes in her autobiographical novels. The phrase “the only good Indian is a dead Indian”, is repeated three times in Little House on the Prairie, while in On the Banks of Plum Creek, Mary tells Laura: “You’ll be brown as an Indian, and what will the town girls think of us?” In Little Town on the Prairie, Laura’s father takes part in a minstrel show, while Laura’s mother’s dislike of Native Americans is made clear: “She looked as if she were smelling the smell of an Indian whenever she said the word. Ma despised Indians. She was afraid of them, too.” The ALA cited an article by the academic Frances Kaye in its decision where she wrote: “I honestly cannot read Little House on the Prairie as other than apology for the ‘ethnic cleansing’ of the Great Plains.” Another academic, Debbie Reese, whose focus is the representation of Native Americans in children’s books, responded to the ALA’s decision: “Wilder’s depictions of African Americans and Native people are flawed and racist. Some will argue that at the time she wrote the books, things like blackface and stereotyping weren’t seen as wrong. But, of course, African Americans and Native peoples knew them to be wrong.” In a survey of librarians, around 300 ALA members said the prize’s name should be changed, and around 150 said it should not. Those who supported the change cited racism and the negative impact of Wilder’s books on child readers amongst their reasons. Those against changing the name cited censorship, “bowing to PC pressure”, and not judging people from the past by today’s standards. In a joint statement by ALA president Jim Neal and ALSC president Nina Lindsay acknowledged that Wilder’s books were “deeply meaningful to many readers”, and that the series “holds a significant place in the history of children’s literature”. But they said the books are also “a product of [Wilder’s] life experiences and perspective as a settler in America’s 1800s”, and therefore “reflect dated cultural attitudes toward indigenous people and people of colour that contradict modern acceptance, celebration, and understanding of diverse communities”. Neal and Lindsay said changing the name of the award should not be viewed as an attempt to censor Wilder’s books, “but rather as an effort to align the award’s title with ALSC’s core values”, stressing that the change “should not be viewed as a call for readers to change their personal relationship with or feelings about Wilder’s books”. “We are not demanding that anyone stop reading Wilder’s books, talking about them, or making them available to children. We hope adults think critically about Wilder’s books and the discussions that can take place around them,” they said. The ALA is now looking to examine its other prizes, including the Geisel award, to see if further changes need to be made. Geisel, named for Theodore Geisel or The Cat in the Hat author Dr Seuss, has also come under recent scrutiny, with a US librarian arguing last year that his illustrations “are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes”. In 2015, HP Lovecraft was dropped as the image of the World Fantasy award after a campaign described the Cthulhu author as an “avowed racist” with “hideous opinions”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/26/jerusalem-review-jez-butterworth-rooster-byron-watermill-newbury","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T12:31:04Z","webTitle":"Jerusalem review – Jez Butterworth's Rooster Byron is back for Brexit Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/26/jerusalem-review-jez-butterworth-rooster-byron-watermill-newbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/26/jerusalem-review-jez-butterworth-rooster-byron-watermill-newbury","fields":{"headline":"Jerusalem review – Jez Butterworth's Rooster Byron is back for Brexit Britain","bodyText":"It takes courage to revive a play that was deemed by so many to be the best British stage production of modern times. And even more courage for a lead actor to risk comparison with the original star, Mark Rylance, who won an Olivier and a Tony for his role in it. So the Watermill shows daring in its staging of Jerusalem, which had a sensational run at the Royal Court in 2009 followed by the West End, twice, as well as Broadway. If Jez Butterworth’s play exposes the grim realities of rural life and pierces the idealised vision of an Albion idyll, director Lisa Blair here flags up its relevance to Brexit Britain. This is the troubled English countryside many did not acknowledge before the referendum, variously neglected or oppressed by bureaucracy, and in which Old England’s feudal landlords have been replaced by council officials driving non-taxpayer and refusenik Johnny “Rooster” Byron off the land. Teenagers from the Wiltshire estates who tramp up to the woods for Rooster’s all-night raves and “whizz” are the “Friends, outcasts and leeches,” of his Mark Antony-like address. They want to haul up the borders: “I leave Wiltshire, my ears pop”, says one who never wants to leave home. The Watermill’s rural Berkshire location is certainly a better fit than a city for a play that engages with the notion of a lost pastoral. The set is dominated by a caravan and a beaten-up sofa with bottles of booze, much like the original. But the intimacy of the space makes the woodland more vivid and darkly oppressive, bringing an anarchic element to the staging: the audience is sprayed with water, cigarette smoke wafts into the stalls, the thump of rave music shakes the ground beneath our feet. Jasper Britton does not – thankfully – channel Rylance but goes his own way. His Rooster is a slurring, red-faced, black-fingernailed Hell’s Angel of sorts in leathers. In moments of self-mythologising, he sounds like a pub raconteur rather than the mesmeriser that Rylance became when speaking of coming back from the dead, of talking to giants, of having blood that could never rot in the earth, and this has its own charms. Britton inhabits his dramatic monologues with greater intensity as he goes along. The comedy carries a similar momentum, waning at times, brilliant in others. Peter Caulfield plays Ginger with fantastic physical comedy while Richard Evans’s absent-minded Professor delivers the poetic whimsy in his lines like a Shakespearean fool. There are bursts of real spectacle and flared intensity – the powerful opening scene with Phaedra, a New-Age raver, singing the lines of the hymn Jerusalem, which segues into the sounds of a rave when she gets to the “dark Satanic mills”; and Rooster’s bloodied curse on the land in the final scene, though there might have been more of these high-fever moments. As it is, the play – more than three hours long and fairly static – sometimes feels its length. Yet its message – and delivery for the most part – is made new. Just as Butterworth’s The Ferryman plays with a mystical notion of Ireland, so Jerusalem reveals a yearning for a bygone Britain that never existed – a once magnificent “Holy Land” of fairies, Arthurian legends and Stonehenge giants. The reminder could not be more relevant. At the Watermill, Newbury, until 21 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jul/03/liam-charles-recipe-blackberry-peanut-blondie","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-03T05:00:28Z","webTitle":"Liam Charles’s recipe for blackberry and peanut blondie crumble bars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/03/liam-charles-recipe-blackberry-peanut-blondie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/03/liam-charles-recipe-blackberry-peanut-blondie","fields":{"headline":"Liam Charles’s recipe for blackberry and peanut blondie crumble bars","bodyText":"Oh gosh, I love blondies.

Not so basic any more! Enjoy! Blackberry and peanut butter blondie crumble bar Prep 30 min Cook 30 min Makes 24 For the blondie 250g unsalted butter 420g light soft brown sugar 3 large eggs 1½ tbsp vanilla extract 330g plain flour 1½ tsp baking powder 1 tsp salt Zest of 2 lemons, finely grated 250g blackberries, fresh or frozen 200g smooth peanut butter For the crumble topping 150g plain flour 90g caster sugar 100g butter, cubed For the white chocolate and peanut whip 300ml double cream 100g white chocolate 1 tsp vanilla extract 75g honey-roasted peanuts, crushed To make the blondie, put the butter in a saucepan and melt, then continue to cook to a brown butter, until the milk solids are an almost-burnt, deep-amber colour. Take off the heat and pour into a bowl to cool. Heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5, then grease and line a 28 x 33cm baking tray with greaseproof paper. Mix the sugar into the brown butter, add the eggs one by one, then add the vanilla extract. Tip in the flour, baking powder, salt and lemon zest, and fold together. Fold in the blackberries, then tip on to the baking tray and spread out evenly. In a saucepan, gently heat the peanut butter until it has loosened. Dollop spoonfuls of the peanut butter evenly on top of the blondie mixture, then, using a knife, swirl the peanut butter to create a marbled effect. Now make the crumble: tip the flour and sugar into a large bowl and mix well, then add the cubes of butter and rub into the flour until the mix resembles breadcrumbs. Sprinkle this on top of the blondie and bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown. Leave to cool completely in the tray. Meanwhile, make the whip. Melt the chocolate in the microwave in 20-second bursts. In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk the double cream until it forms soft peaks, then add the melted white chocolate. Continue to whisk until the mixture forms medium peaks, then fold in the vanilla extract and nuts. Cut the blondie into slabs and serve with a generous dollop of the whip.

Dusty odds and ends, including an order of service from 1902, were found in the abbey when stalls were removed for restoration work. The most intriguing discovery, however, was two coins bearing a picture of Satan and the legend Civitas Diaboli on one side and 13 Maj Anholt 1973 on the other. Experts figured out the coins were linked to the story of a Danish eccentric who perpetrated an elaborate 40-year hoax that was only discovered almost a decade after his death. The date on the coins refers to an episode that took place on the island of Anholt, between Denmark and Sweden, in May 1973. Thirteen “ritual sites” were discovered by residents that prompted an investigation by police from the Danish mainland. Police puzzled over the meaning of the sites, where items included strange masks, weird stone formations, bones wrapped in string, black candles and a (fake) shrunken head on a stake. The story was picked up by the Danish national media and salacious stories of satanic cults on Anholt abounded. Coins like those found at Bath Abbey began to be discovered in churches and museums across Denmark. Some were accompanied by letters claiming to be from a satanic high priestess named Alice Mandragora. In 2013, the Danish newspaper Politiken ran a six-part investigation into the coin phenomenon, revealing that the Anholt mystery was a hoax perpetrated by Knud Langkow, an office clerk at the National Gallery of Denmark who died in 2004, aged 73. His niece Lene Langkow Saaek told the newspaper he was not a satanist and the hoax was just his sense of humour. “I think normality annoyed him,” she said. ‘He did not like ordinary.” Some coins may have been minted by Langkow but others are thought to have been created by independent experts who were in on the joke. Bath’s Anholt coins are in the care of Wessex Archaeology and will be included in the final site archive, alongside artefacts dating from the Roman through to the modern period. Bruce Eaton, the project manager, said historians and archeologists were used to written artefacts telling an untrue story, but not physical ones. “As archaeologists we set great store by the integrity of the physical objects we recover. To discover finds that are a fabrication, designed to mislead, is both fascinating and a timely reminder that we should always view any discovery with a critical eye.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/26/worcester-install-more-cooling-stations-horse-racing-prepares-heatwave-british-horseracing-authority","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T09:45:02Z","webTitle":"Worcester install more cooling stations as racing prepares to deal with heatwave","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/26/worcester-install-more-cooling-stations-horse-racing-prepares-heatwave-british-horseracing-authority","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/26/worcester-install-more-cooling-stations-horse-racing-prepares-heatwave-british-horseracing-authority","fields":{"headline":"Worcester install more cooling stations as racing prepares to deal with heatwave","bodyText":"Worcester will have extra cooling stations available at Wednesday’s meeting when the course hosts the first afternoon jumps meeting since the current heatwave began. The abandonment of racing at the Midlands track in 2009 after horses collapsed with heat exhaustion was the first time a meeting in Britain had to be called off owing to high temperatures. Worcester’s clerk of the course, Jeremy Martin, told the Racing Post: “To put it simply, we’ll be having more buckets of water available and more cooling down stations than usual.” There were problems at Cheltenham this year when the course took the unprecedented decision to call off one of its races after officials concluded the three‑and‑a‑quarter‑mile distance was too extreme on one of the hottest April days on record. The decision followed the death of a runner after crossing the line in the opening race. Measures to assist runners in the conditions were in evidence at Southwell on Monday after the clerk of the course, Roderick Duncan, announced that “horses won’t be coming into the winner’s enclosure to assist us in cooling them down and to enable ius to get plenty of water to them”. Temperatures are expected to peak in midweek but the hot weather is forecast to last until into next week with National Hunt fixtures at Cartmel and Uttoxeter also scheduled over the next few days. The British Horseracing Authority has a detailed list of instructions for tracks, trainers and jockeys with measures to alleviate the effects of hot weather which are sent out when temperatures start to approach 30C. The BHA will also be releasing a video this week to highlight the work they do to alleviate the risks to horses and riders during heatwaves. Meanwhile, Frankie Dettori is set to be booked for Epsom flop Knight To Behold in the Irish Derby at The Curragh on Saturday. Trainer Harry Dunlop, who believes Knight To Behold can bounce back from a disappointing run in the Derby, said: “We think Frankie Dettori will ride. It’s not completely confirmed, but that’s hopefully the plan.” His runner had impressed when an all-the-way winner in the Lingfield Derby Trial prior to Epsom and Dunlop believes his runner went off too fast. “They went very quick early on at Epsom and we got rather involved in that. Things just didn’t go quite to plan on a very stiff track,” said Dunlop. “He’s in very good form and we are looking forward to Saturday. Richard Kingscote got off him last time and said Epsom didn’t really suit. “We might ride him a bit differently [on Saturday]. The main thing is to try to get him to relax and get home, which we felt wasn’t the case last time. We will try and ride him a bit more conservatively.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/from-the-archive-bad-hair-days-in-1984","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"From the archive: bad hair days in 1984","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/from-the-archive-bad-hair-days-in-1984","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/from-the-archive-bad-hair-days-in-1984","fields":{"headline":"From the archive: bad hair days in 1984","bodyText":"As the reluctant owner of a head of ‘knackered hair’, I wish I’d been alive in 1984 and able to promenade my distressed locks with gusto. Trevor Sorbie, the celebrity hairdresser declared 1984 the year of terrible hair. In our archive issue this week the Observer delves into the trend for unkempt barnets and the newfangled technology revolutionising the hair industry. You could make a strong argument that the definition of ‘good hair’ is as much based on condition as it is on style - not so in 1984. Simon Forbes, owner of London’s legendary Antenna salon, the birthplace of hair extensions, said: ‘My clients aren’t bothered about how their hair feels. That has been sacrificed to the cause of looking good.’ This sounds like a visit to his salon involved a lot of gel and a finished product that can only be described as matted. George Orwell imagined 1984 as a year where humans were terrorised by technology and omnipresent surveillance equipment – in many ways he was right. Take for instance the ‘U’ view, a new-age contraption that salon-goers had never seen the likes of before. ‘At the push of a button, a screen displayed the cut of your choice superimposed on to your head.’ High tech indeed, except that, like a bad filter on Snapchat, the styles rarely lined up with one’s head. These new devices may have not made the cut (sorry), but old hair grooming tricks such as vinegar rinses, daily shampooing and grandmother’s 100 strokes also faced the chop (soz) in favour of products creating ‘plastic-coated, hard-wearing hair’. I’m sick of seeing manes of lustrous, gleaming hair in magazines, on the red carpet, on Love Island. It’s time we ditched the leave-in conditioner and embraced our horrible, dirty, knot-ridden hair.

Khalid Ali, 28, disappeared in 2011 from his family home in north London and dropped out of sight for nearly six years while he built hundreds of bombs at an al-Qaida-linked Taliban training camp in Afghanistan. Upon his return to Britain in November 2016 he was stopped at Heathrow and his fingerprints were matched to records held by the FBI in the US, who had found the same prints on bomb components seized in Afghanistan. The match triggered a UK investigation into Ali involving covert surveillance. Ali, a plumber, was ultimately stopped in a dramatic arrest that was caught on video in April last year near the Palace of Westminster. He was carrying three knives. Further investigation revealed he had staked out potential targets including New Scotland Yard, the MI6 headquarters and parliament. On Tuesday he was convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey of two counts of possessing an explosive substance in relation to his activities in Afghanistan and one count of preparing terrorist acts in relation to his plans in Westminster. The deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, Scotland Yard’s senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, said “Ali was an incredibly dangerous individual who had returned from a training camp in Afghanistan with a determination to kill police officers, the military or parliamentarians here in the UK.” Ali, a naturalised British citizen, told his parents he was going to Birmingham on a plumbing job before he disappeared in 2011. “He left the UK and ended up in Afghanistan, in a Taliban training camp affiliated to al-Qaida, where for several years he helped terrorists make hundreds of bombs capable of mass murder,” Haydon said. In October 2016 he resurfaced at the British consulate in Turkey, where he requested temporary travel documents to return to the UK. When he came through Heathrow in November 2016 he was stopped and his fingerprints were taken. They were shared with US authorities who matched them to bomb components found on two caches of explosives recovered in 2012 in Afghanistan. He told officers at time he was part of a charity convoy to Palestine in 2010, and claimed to have gone to Pakistan after he was put pressed into marrying a “gold-digger”. He also claimed MI5 had tried to recruit him as a “James Bond”-type spy before he left the UK. With an investigation under way, Ali was seen in April last year buying knives in Edmonton, London, and dumping the packaging in a bin. The same night the police received a call from his mother raising concerns about his aggressive behaviour after she found four knives in his bedroom. After speaking to officers, Ali left the family home and the knives behind. But on 28 April he rearmed himself at a shop, Wilko, in Ealing, where he bought three knives - an 8in chef’s knife and two 3.4in paring blades - and other items such as a potato masher. He went to a gym in Ealing where he put the knives in a rucksack and discarded the other items, before heading to central London on the underground. When firearms officers arrested him metres from parliament he had a knife in each of his jacket’s pockets and the other knife in the waistband of his trousers. On his way to parliament he had thrown a phone into the Thames on Victoria embankment, which was recovered by officers. Ali’s internet history and phone data revealed he had conducted detailed Google Street View searches of the MI6 building, and he also had numerous images of police officers. Police also trawled through CCTV footage that showed Ali’s whereabouts before his arrest. This included footage of him carrying out “hostile reconnaissance” in relation to potential targets including the MI6 building, New Scotland Yard, the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street and Westminster Bridge. Asked how it was possible for Ali to get so far before he was stopped, Haydon said: “There was surveillance but we won’t go into any further details of that surveillance. Police and security services were managing any potential risk that he posed. He was arrested at the most appropriate time. We are convinced he was going to target the police, military, our security services or parliamentarians.” Asked if there was any evidence of Ali continuing to access extremist material after he returned to UK, or was in contact with extremists in the UK or overseas, Haydon answered: “His acts were years in the planning … I’d describe him as a lone actor. We have no evidence to indicate he is part of a wider network and associated with others here in the UK. Most of his activities and training were in Afghanistan. He’d come back here with murderous intentions.” The government’s anti-radicalisation Channel programme, part of its Prevent strategy, was not considered appropriate for Ali, as it deals with people who are yet to commit – or not yet suspected of committing – a criminal offence. Haydon said: “When he was arrested and interviewed, he boasted to officers initially that he had built about 300 different bombs. If you go to the region of Afghanistan and into the borders of Pakistan, where the Taliban and al-Qaida are most active, I’m in no doubt those bombs were used against coalition forces and to kill, maim and injure coalition forces. He posed a significant risk but that was a risk we were managing [by] various covert means.” In police interview, Ali said he wanted to deliver a “message” to British authorities, but claimed the knives were for protection. When asked if he had returned for jihad, he replied: “Jihad is what we do. We are mujahideen.” He admitted involvement in IEDs in Afghanistan, even bragging he detonated more than 300 devices, although he later backtracked. Giving evidence, Ali went on to claim he had been held captive by the Taliban and forced to make bombs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/26/seventeen-injured-in-cambridgeshire-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T12:23:14Z","webTitle":"Two dead and 18 injured after Cambridgeshire bus-lorry crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/26/seventeen-injured-in-cambridgeshire-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/26/seventeen-injured-in-cambridgeshire-crash","fields":{"headline":"Two dead and 18 injured after Cambridgeshire bus-lorry crash","bodyText":"Two men have died after a crash between a bus and a lorry in Cambridgeshire, which also injured 18 other people, seven seriously. The collision happened at about 7.30am on Tuesday on the A47 Thorney Road in Guyhirn, a village near Wisbech. The incident was attended by paramedics, a Magpas air ambulance, fire and rescue crews and police. The dead men were from Northamptonshire and Norfolk, according to Insp Jamie Langwith of Cambridgeshire police. Speaking of the injured, he said: “We’ve got injuries consisting of broken legs up until brain injuries. There are no life-threatening injuries at this stage but they are serious.” Langwith said the bus driver was among the injured, but the lorry driver was not. The two dead men were passengers on the bus. The collision happened outside Bretts Transport depot. The transport operator First Bus confirmed one of its vehicles was involved, but a spokesman did not comment further. A three-mile stretch of the A47 remains closed. Footage from the scene shows the bus, which had been travelling eastbound, lodged into the side of the lorry, which appears to have been heading westbound. A Cambridgeshire police spokesman said: “A total of 20 people [including the two who later died], who were travelling in the bus, were injured. They have been taken to Peterborough City hospital and the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King’s Lynn.” An East of England ambulance service spokesman said the trust had dispatched seven ambulance crews, three ambulance officers, two rapid response vehicles, a hazardous area response team and a Magpas air ambulance to the scene and several seriously injured patients were been cared for. Dan Read, a critical care paramedic for Magpas air ambulance, said: “We can’t praise the East of England ambulance service and paramedic crews enough for their excellent teamwork.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/25/roseanne-calls-herself-a-hate-magnet-but-her-thinking-is-depressingly-mainstream","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T16:35:07Z","webTitle":"Roseanne calls herself a ‘hate magnet’, but her thinking is depressingly mainstream | Suzanne Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/25/roseanne-calls-herself-a-hate-magnet-but-her-thinking-is-depressingly-mainstream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/25/roseanne-calls-herself-a-hate-magnet-but-her-thinking-is-depressingly-mainstream","fields":{"headline":"Roseanne calls herself a ‘hate magnet’, but her thinking is depressingly mainstream","bodyText":"Can “hate-magnets” be rehabilitated? This is how Roseanne Barr described herself while talking about how she was “impaired” because of sleeping pills when she posted a racist tweet that she now regrets.

It was groundbreaking and she was loved. But, long before the new series of Roseanne was aired, she had revealed herself on Twitter to be a Trump-supporting conspiracy theorist.

As with Morrissey, there will be those who claim in retrospect to have seen all this coming from the get-go. It is excused, then ignored and then everyone falls over themselves to condemn the bitter old viper. What so often happens with these people is that much is excused as simply liberal-baiting. It’s outrageous being un-PC! It’s iconoclastic! Never mind that would-be iconoclasts are ten a penny, saying racist rubbish in the rightwing press. Never mind that they all think much the same. What has changed is that such thinking is now mainstream. So these figures must be cast into the void because no one wants to admit that culture we once valued can be made by people whose views we abhor. But the truth is it can.

The Liverpool forward is reportedly unhappy with the Egyptian FA at being used for political ends, includingbeing pictured with the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a man accused of numerous human rights violations. Egypt were based in the Chechen capital Grozny during the WorldCup, with Kadyrov making Salah an honorary citizen of the Russian republic. A miserable tournament for Cúper’s Pharaohs ended with a surprise 2-1 defeat by Saudi Arabia in Volgograd, which left them pointless and bottom of Group A. Speaking about Salah potentially quitting the national team, Cúper said: “I don’t think so, I don’t think so. I don’t think it’s true because all of those who are here – and those who couldn’t come – really, really support and appreciate the opportunity of playing for the national team, so I don’t think that’s true.” Both teams were already eliminated before this dead rubber following successive defeats against Uruguay and Russia. Salah lobbed Egypt ahead with their first World Cup goal from open play since 1934 but his celebration was notably subdued. The 25-year-old, who also scored with a penalty in the previous match against Russia, then missed a golden chance which could have helped them end the competition on a high. After Egypt’s 45-year-old goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary – the oldest player to appear at a World Cup – saved a penalty from Fahad al-Muwallad, the Green Falcons turned the game around thanks to a second spot-kick, converted by Salman al-Faraj, and Salem al-Dawsari’s dramatic injury-time winner. Despite finishing with three defeats from three games, Cúper felt his players performed well in Russia and were unlucky to lose two games to late goals. “I think we have played well. It’s true that the results weren’t good. We have lost all three matches,” said the Argentinian, whose contract expires at the end of the World Cup tournament. “And I am disappointed that we have lost two games – one in the 90th minute [Uruguay], and the other one in the 95th minute [Saudi Arabia]. That’s what makes me sad and disappointed. “I’m not going to give an evaluation one to 10 of my team. I think that a score from one to 10 is not the right thing to do.” Saudi Arabia’s win was their first success at a World Cup since they beat Belgium 1-0 in Washington at USA ’94. Their coach, Juan Antonio Pizzi, was pleased with how his players reacted to losing their two opening games and said it was up to the Saudi Arabian Football Federation to choose whether he will continue to lead the team. “The association will have to decide. It doesn’t depend on myself,” the former Spain forward said. “We’ll see what happens over the next few days. I am really, really happy with the players, the way they have responded.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"membership/2018/jun/27/podcast-positive-news-we-need-to-talk-about-supporters","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T15:11:58Z","webTitle":"Contribute to a podcast on the importance of positive news coverage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/jun/27/podcast-positive-news-we-need-to-talk-about-supporters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2018/jun/27/podcast-positive-news-we-need-to-talk-about-supporters","fields":{"headline":"Contribute to a podcast on the importance of positive news coverage","bodyText":"Supporters’ voices are essential to our monthly podcast, We Need to Talk About…, whether our subject matter is Brexit, nationalism or the environment. In our next podcast, we’ll consider the impact of the modern news cycle on our health and wellbeing, and whether a greater focus on positive, hopeful and light-hearted stories would help to mitigate this. Our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, promised in a speech on the future of the Guardian recently, “we will develop ideas that help improve the world, not just critique it. Despair is just another form of denial. People long to feel hopeful again – and young people, especially, yearn to feel the hope that previous generations once had.” Rapid developments in technology in recent decades mean that news now reaches us on our phones, TVs, and social media profiles every hour of the day, every day of the week – some of it very distressing. Even when we try to switch off from it, news seems to find a way to reach us. With the dawn of the internet and improved mobility for journalists across the world, we can access vivid, uninterrupted images and footage of events moments after they happen, in the palm of our hands. This onslaught of negative news has a cumulative effect on our collective mental health and our perception of our own worries. It can create a sense of disempowerment and apathy, and exacerbate our feelings of isolation and fear. Conversely, positive news often carries a message of hope and activism: those who have made a difference – for example, by saving a pub, library or park, working closely with a local community, inventing a tool to solve a problem, fundraising for an underreported cause – and whose work has captured the public imagination on a small or wide-reaching scale. Two years ago, the Guardian launched a pilot project, Half Full, to see how readers would respond if we deliberately sought out the good things happening in the world. Several hundred articles later, we had proven out our theory that there’s a huge appetite for positive news stories among our readership. Off the back of this success, we were able to launch our series The Upside, supported by the Skoll Foundation, which has so far examined everything from urban gardening to maternal health in India, prosthetic arms and the four-day working week. We’ve invited the series’ editor Mark Rice-Oxley into the studio to join our next podcast and we’d love you, the Guardian’s supporters, to pose questions for the discussion. The Guardian isn’t alone in experimenting with the publication of good news – the New York Times, the BBC and other major global news outlets are providing their readers with content to which readers can retreat when the atrocity and conflict starts to become overwhelming. That’s not to mention dozens of blogs dedicated to marking the unsung heroes, pioneers and everyday acts of selflessness that could restore faith in even the most jaded consumer of news. Perhaps you feel it’s flippant or unnecessary to mark these more trivial or jovial moments? Are they simply a distraction from what really matters? Or do you feel they are more important now than ever? How can we prevent so-called ‘news fatigue’? Have you found yourself switching off from the news cycle? Do you crave more light news? We are also really interested to know what your favourite positive story of the past year has been. Has there been good news on a particular issue that has given you hope? Do you worry about the effect of news coverage on children or more vulnerable groups in society? Has a positive news story inspired you in some way? Please do get in touch, wherever you are in the world: we would like to hear your questions, views and experiences.

Despite being more popular than it’s ever been, much of today’s rosé isn’t quite up to this task: the fashion everywhere is to make rosé in a light, pale style that is closer in spirit to white wine than red. Well, not quite everywhere. The southern Rhône Valley’s rosé specialist appellation, Tavel, continues to make rosés of a darker hue and greater density that work brilliantly with meat, oily fish, and heavier, big-flavoured salads – as seen in the aptly named, well-priced Les Gourmandises with its delicious ripe strawberry-and-spice flavours. Zafeirakis Limniona Rosé, Thessalia, Greece 2017 (£16.50, Bottle Apostle) One complaint that rosé sceptics have about the style is that it lacks the diversity of red and white wine – that winemakers are operating with a much more limited palette of flavours and textures when they’re making pink. This is undoubtedly true – the distance from, say, a souped-up 16% alcohol Californian Zinfandel to a feathery cool-climate pinot noir is many times further than that between the pale pinks of Provence and even the most robust of Tavel rosés or Spanish rosados. But just because the stylistic differences are less extreme, that doesn’t mean they’re not significant. Rosé is to red wine what watercolours are to oil paints, trading for the most in subtlety and delicacy rather than the bold or the primary. Certainly, that’s the best way to judge Zafeirakis’ Greek pink, which uses the local variety limniona to fashion something stony-cool, wild strawberry-scented and rather beautiful. Marks &amp; Spencer Marlborough Rosé, New Zealand 2017 (£11) Much of the flavour and texture of wines made from red grapes comes from the skins. But given that rosé wines are made by keeping the juice in contact with the skins for a matter of hours rather than days, weeks or months, as is the case for reds, it’s not perhaps surprising that varietal character – the taste of the grape variety – is rather more elusive in rosé wines. One exception is pinot noir, which can impart a similar kind of silkiness to pinks that it does to reds. It forms a mere 50% of the blend (along with 40% white grapes) but makes its presence felt in M&amp;S’s delightfully red berry tangy, light (9.5% abv) Marlborough Rosé. And it makes the effortlessly refreshing, fragrant, gently complex Bird in Hand Pinot Noir Rosé, Adelaide Hills, Australia 2017 (£14.95, Old Bridgewine.com) all by itself.

We now value ‘balls’ more than talent","bodyText":"So many things are wrong with Argentina we do not know what is wrong; so much is happening no one knows what is happening. You could start an article on the news pages with that same line but they fit on the sports pages too because these are turbulent times for our football. It was not always like this. For many years, football made up for our long political, social and economic decline. There is no identifiable moment when it all started, nor one place where it began, and there is no dominant theory. What is true is that bit by bit we got further away from the ball, the one thing we loved more than the game itself. We got further from a style that used to draw us to the stadium, where we longed to shout “olé!” every time we saw someone dribble, trick an opponent, tease them; every time we saw a lightning one-two or some expression of cunning, that astuteness – that was our life. There was talent of the highest quality and in the greatest quantity and we allowed ourselves an act of genius once in a while. Football matters to us; it allows us to feel like we are among the best in the world at something with huge popular significance. Its relevance is such that, to give but one example, through football we thought we had recovered the Malvinas in 1986 thanks to Diego Maradona, a national hero ever since. So the disaster of the national team leaves us with a feeling of neglect and emptiness that is hard to explain. How are we supposed to know what to do with football if we don’t even know what to do with Lionel Messi? Let’s go back to the start. The street was always our school, which had the great virtue of teaching us the trade, giving football a cultural weight and developing and celebrating players who were different. But the street as a formative stage has gone and no one has known how to replace it with an educational model like those in countries such as Germany or Spain. We always had too little money, organisational ability and vision – and, in our arrogance, too much confidence in our status as a predestined footballing power. On top of that, an imperious, almost delirious need to win overcame the enjoyment of playing. The desire to win at all costs sweeps away your values. Dividing the world into winners and losers is an illness that infected football at a formative stage. At the same time a passion for football was overcome by a passion for a team, as if a society that has become ever more individualistic needed something to reconnect it with tribal feeling. Turning clubs into mini-nations constructs an identity, a community that must be defended as a matter of life and death. In the stands violence took over; on the pitch, we said goodbye to the olés and welcomed in a world where huevos – balls – are more important than talent. We saw that against Croatia. People were shouting at the players to show more huevos and sitting in the stands Diego expressed that by grabbing his testicles. Yes, Diego: the man who represented better than anyone else the best of what we had, our former style. That desire to fight turns every game in the Argentinian league into an indecipherable swarm like an ants’ nest, where someone kicks it and everyone runs more than they think, and where in the middle of it all it can be hard to work out who the good player is. There are other variables in the equation: economic crisis, institutional chaos, televised football as a political weapon, corruption at all levels among those who run the game. The world did not help either: globalisation made us an export economy in which any player, however mediocre, is three goals away from being sold abroad. This premature escape, our footballing diaspora, saw us lose one of the great teachers: emulation. Maradona is a purely Argentinian product; Messi is a mix of his origins in Argentina and his development and completion in Barcelona. Nor do I want to overlook something of great importance: the mediocrity of the debate, where a base crassness more suited to bad actors than good journalists bastardises the play and denigrates players. This infernal racket conditions everything, a deafening noise that surrounds everything and made the Argentinian people believe that if Messi does not win a World Cup he will never be Maradona; that made Messi himself believe it. Thirty-three titles later, Messi has taken that message to heart and when the World Cup starts he becomes a tortured soul who carries the fierce demands of 45 million people on his shoulders. And yet it’s not true: Messi has defended Argentina’s footballing pride like no one else for 15 years now and he has done so with an astonishing, scandalous consistency. But that perception became received wisdom and Messi is treated as if he was any old player by journalists who demand an excellence from him they cannot even dream of. In Russia, it has all come together. The crisis of talent. (Did we really only find out on the day Croatia put three past us that we do not have anyone comparable to Luka Modric or Ivan Rakitic?). The lack of leadership. (Is there really no one around the national team who can shake them out of it with words worthy of the impending crisis?) The vulgarity and paucity of the debate. (Have we really forgotten what it was that made us great?) We have to evolve and after the tournament we must begin a revolution in education that can return our lost prestige. We have the genetics that can help us, a history that can propel us, a pride that will give us energy and strength. But education requires time, not haste, and in Argentina we have all lost patience and calm. How can we come up with an urgent solution with problems of such magnitude? As we wait to play Nigeria, the team appear lost, the rumours about internal conflicts spreading, and no one knows what is going on inside the head of Messi – one of the best-known men in the world but whose silences no one can interpret. If Argentina think their problems will be resolved by appealing to courage and fight, their emotional and footballing collapse will follow and with it their discipline. We will finish the third game with someone sent off, a red card to add to the disaster. The decline begins with culture, and we have to recognise the lads gave all the huevos the fans demanded. But huevos are not enough. To wear down a team like Iceland, to overcome a great team like Croatia and to confront Nigeria’s sense of adventure, we will need all the qualities and the values that Argentinian football has lost along the way. Skill, quality, fantasy, cunning, precision; we need to bring that together in a style that can create a collective conviction, an identity, capable of turning this disparate group into a team. Not even a genius can make up for so many failings. Still less, a genius who is dispirited.

But there is no need to go over to an elected Lords to get rid of them. Adopting Bruce Grocott’s bill now before parliament would abolish them simply and swiftly. Readers might ask why the Electoral Reform Society, formed to campaign for a change to more proportional voting systems, is denigrating the current Lords and demanding an elected alternative. The answer is simple. By common consent an elected Lords would not be chosen by the same first-past-the-post system as the Commons. Indeed, if the Lords were elected more proportionately, it would arguably have more legitimacy than the Commons, forcing the Commons to go over to a more proportional system. Like Hughes I would welcome such a system. However, as democrats we have to remember that the 2011 referendum went against such a change. Better to campaign openly to reverse that result than to try to subvert it by turning the House of Lords into a rival for power with the Commons. David Lipsey House of Lords • Parliament can’t afford to be left behind, affirmed Gaby Hinsliff (Our politics has lost touch with the way we live, 23 June). Just as millennials do their politics differently so too, I suggest, do those of us who have experienced politics over a much longer period. The Houses of Commons and Lords exist largely unchanged, when 20 years ago political power was devolved to most parts of the UK, except England. Now Westminster operates regardless of this change. The House of Lords remains a sanctuary for retired politicians and those enjoying political patronage. Our electoral system no longer reflects the will of the people, but rather entrenches a two-party system. Our democracy requires a radical overhaul; where are the politicians able to transform a system no longer fit for purpose?

People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally,” Trump said via Twitter on Monday. “Children brought back to their country......” He continued in a second tweet: “If this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it’s [sic] tracks – and at very little, by comparison, cost. This is the only real answer – and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!” The statement is tantamount to a proposal for the suspension of law. But Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, defended the position and insisted a judge was not always required for due process to be observed. “Virtually all Americans agree that it makes no sense that an illegal alien sets one foot on American soil and then they would go through a three- to five-year judicial process to be removed from the country,” she told reporters, though she did not providing polling data to back this claim. “Thousands of illegal aliens are removed every month without seeing an immigration judge as a result of procedures in current law including voluntary removal and expedited removal. Just because you don’t see a judge doesn’t mean you aren’t receiving due process.” Sanders said that Trump was focused on securing the borders and finding “a very legal and easy immigration process”, adding: “The president would certainly like to see more expedited removal.” The question of due process compounds an already confusing situation as Republican lawmakers scrambled to build a consensus around immigration legislation, and federal agencies work to reunite migrant families separated under Trump’s policy, with many children now scattered across the US without their parents. The Department of Homeland Security stated over the weekend that it had reunited 522 children with parents so far. The agency also claimed to have a “well coordinated” process for reuniting families, following chaos and confusion last week. The Pentagon is preparing to temporarily house immigrants at two military bases. In Texas on Monday, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, said agents had temporarily stopped referring for criminal prosecution cases involving parents who crossed the US border illegally with their children. He said the zero-tolerance policy remained in effect but that halting prosecutions in these instances was necessary to comply with Trump’s executive order. The House is preparing to vote this week on a broad Republican immigration bill that is expected to fall short amid Democratic opposition and a lack of consensus among GOP lawmakers on how restrictive US immigration laws should be. The legislation attempts to resolve twin crises created by Trump: it seeks to provide a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, who were brought to the US as children; and to end the practice of separating families at the border. The bill would also give Trump $25bn funding towards building his border wall and impose new restrictions on legal immigration. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said lawmakers continued negotiations on the immigration proposal over the weekend. But asked what he expected would happen when it came up for a vote this week, Meadows told Fox &amp; Friends: “I would think fail right now.” On Monday, Sanders echoed Trump’s attempts to shift the blame to his political opponents. Democrats, she said, had made it very clear they did not want to work with the president and did not want to fix the immigration system. “They’d rather have open borders and rampant crime,” she alleged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/28/maradona-stojkovic-oleary-italia-90-nigel-benn","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-28T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"Maradona, Stojkovic and O'Leary at Italia '90 plus an epic surf ride | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/28/maradona-stojkovic-oleary-italia-90-nigel-benn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/28/maradona-stojkovic-oleary-italia-90-nigel-benn","fields":{"headline":"Maradona, Stojkovic and O'Leary at Italia '90 plus an epic surf ride","bodyText":"1) The knockout stage of the World Cup begins this weekend, as good an excuse as any to relive the brilliant 1990 version.

Iceland didn’t quite have enough quality to make it out of the group; Croatia meanwhile rested most of their team, won anyway and move on to a decidedly winnable tie with Denmark. Bye! You’ve seen the players, now rate the players! Gudni Bergsson says: “What can you say except, ‘Thanks.’ The team gave everything tonight, but it just didn’t go our way. The time is bright. Go Iceland.” Apparently, however, only six of Kovacic’s completed passes went forwards, putting him joint 14th out of tonight’s 28 performers. Mateo Kovacic attempted 80 passes in this game, 10 more than anyone else (and 24 more than Luka Modric in third place). Of those, 77 found their mark, 15 more than anyone else (and 28 more than Luka Modric in third place). Saturday is an absolute write-off now. I’ve got a few hours in the morning to lamely interact with my family while I pretend not to actually be thinking about the World Cup. So Argentina will play France in Kazan on Saturday, for the right to face the winner of Uruguay v Portugal in the quarter-finals. Meanwhile Croatia play Denmark in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday, for the right to play the winner of Spain v Russia in the quarter-finals. “It’s weird to feel sad now about Iceland leaving the World Cup since I never expected us to be represented there,” writes a philosophical Kári Tulinius. “Tomorrow I will feel happy again that Iceland reached the World Cup, but for now I will let the sad feeling run its course. Then I will enjoy the rest of the World Cup and then I will start looking forward to the documentaries about this golden age of Icelandic football.” The winning goal came after Emil Hallfredsson, who throughout was very keen on trying to trick his way past Croatians but largely unable to actually do so, attempted a wildly foolish pirouette 10 yards outside his own penalty area. Here are some reports on tonight’s two matches: Iceland had a good spell towards the end of the first half, but couldn’t quite capitalise on it and though they did equalise their grip on the game relaxed the longer it went on. With Croatia making nine changes, they couldn’t have asked for a better chance. There were several occasions when the ball didn’t quite fall their way inside the penalty area, but the fundamental issue is that the idea of this Iceland team is considerably better than this Iceland team. 90+5 mins: It’s all over! Croatia win the group, and Iceland are out! 90+4 mins: Iceland swing the ball into the mixer. One defender heads it into another defender, and it falls just out of the forward’s reach. The corner hits Lovren and flies over the bar. 90+3 mins: We’re well into the third of four indicated minutes of stoppage time. Iceland have yet another corner, which floats over everyone and out of play. 90+2 mins: Now Rakitic shoots just wide, from 20 yards. 90+1 mins: Perisic is sent into the left side of the area, and he crashes in a high left-foot shot, which Halldorsson gets two hands to but only pushes higher into the corner of his net. And that’s decided it! It’s Croatia and Argentina for the knock-out rounds, and Iceland are heading out! 89 mins: Kramaric slams a shot wide of the near post from the edge of the area. 88 mins: Argentina have scored, and lead Nigeria 2-1. This is great news for Iceland, who now only need one goal to go through. 87 mins: The ball is at the wrong end of the pitch, as far as Iceland are concerned. Croatia have a free kick, and are taking their time over it. 86 mins: Iceland bring on Albert Gudmundsson and take off Finnbogason. 85 mins: Perisic’s shot from the free kick dips and curls, but not quite enough. 84 mins: Seconds later, Kalinic having punched clear, Saevarsson is booked for bringing down Perisic, who should by then have passed to one of the two unmarked team-mates busting their gut to get into the penalty area, but decided to do it all himself instead. 83 mins: Jedvaj is booked for bringing Berg Gumundsson down on the left wing. Iceland have another set piece. 82 mins: Iceland are now knackered, and also just not quite good enough in attack. They continue to fling the ball about gamely, though. 81 mins: Another substitution, Croatia showing off by bringing Rakitic on for Kovacic. 78 mins: It’s up for grabs now, though if the other match ends in a draw Iceland need to score a couple more. The viking hand claps ring out. And Sigurdsson sends it down the middle and high into the roof of the net, with the keeper diving out of the way! 75 mins: Iceland cross from the right, and it hits Lovren’s left arm. There’s clear movement of arm towards ball, and that’s as clear as you’re going to get. 73 mins: Iceland’s greatest chance! The ball is played down the right for Finnbogason, the linesman waves play on, and he picks out Bjarnason, beyond the far post, who sidefoots wide! I think VAR would have disallowed it for offside anyway, but it should have been in the net. 71 mins: Iceland take off Ragnar Sigurdsson, and bring on Sigurdarson. 70 mins: Croatia bring on Lovren, replacing Pjaca. It’s time for Iceland to go all in here. 69 mins: Pjaca sits down, while the game goes on around him. He is, presumably, suffering from cramp. Or he’s tired. 66 mins: Sigurdsson jinks into the area and from an unlikely angle blasts a shot wide of goal. 65 mins: A first substitution, Croatia bringing Bradaric on for Modric. 63 mins: The ball is played into the area and dummied at its edge, allowing it to roll into the six yard box. Finnbogason didn’t anticipate this, so Kalinic was always going to reach the ball first, but as a matter of principle Finnbogason slid in anyway, and is therefore booked. 61 mins: The wind appears to be leaking out of Iceland’s sails. Croatia have completely dominated the last few minutes. 59 mins: Hallfredsson is booked, for sliding into Pjaca with the ball long gone. 56 mins: And now they hit the bar! It’s Ingason again, this time from a corner, and he rises unchallenged to head a fraction too high! He should have scored there, really. 55 mins: Now Iceland nearly equalise. A long throw is flicked on, and Ingason’s header is tipped over the bar! Croatia take the lead! They benefit from a succession of handy deflections and bounces before finally the ball heads to Badelj, who controls his volley beautifully and sends it crashing into the net from 10 yards! 52 mins: Victor Moses slots in the penalty, and Nigeria have equalised. As it stands, the Super Eagles are soaring into the knockout rounds. 51 mins: Croatia hit the bar! Badelj carries the ball towards the area before blasting in a shot that flicks off a defender’s calf and clatters into the woodwork. 51 mins: Elsewhere, Nigeria have a penalty against Argentina. 48 mins: Now they have corner. With Sigurdsson taking them, sooner or later one of these is going to come off. 47 mins: Iceland turn the set-piece tap back on, but Sigurdsson curls his free-kick into the hands of Kalinic. 46 mins: Peeeeep! Croatia get the second half started. The players are back out, and they’re the same players that went in. The world wants, deserves and need an Iceland goal to spice up the second halves. From their perspective, Croatia look promisingly uncommitted. 45+3 mins: That’s all, for now. Iceland have had a terrific second half of the first half, and probably deserve to lead. As it stands, one goal is all they need! 45+2 mins: Iceland’s best effort yet! A good move works the ball down the right, from where it’s touched back into the path of Gunnarsson, whose shot is tipped wide! 45+1 mins: And another chance! Kalinic comes out and pats the ball limply down to Bjarnason, whose shot hits a defender’s leg and the goalkeeper’s foot before bouncing to safety. 45 mins: Magnusson’s volleyed cross is vicious and dangerous, but is cleared behind by a defender. Another corner. 44 mins: Iceland have another optimistic shot, Hallfredsson blasting high from 30 yards. 43 mins: I apologise for the technical problems that stopped the MBM from updating for a bit. Somebody sent me a picture that our software didn’t much like. 41 mins: Great chance for Iceland! Croatia dwell on the ball and Finnbogason wins it, turns, runs towards the area, exchanges passes with Sigurdsson and shoots just wide from 18 yards! 40 mins: The referee is a little overfond of free kicks, and it isn’t helping this game’s entertainment levels. 37 mins: Croatia have a shot! Perisic is given the ball, 25 yards out and central. He controls, spins, and volleys well wide. 35 mins: The corner briefly threatens to lead to something as it’s headed down to Bjarnason, but his shot was taken while off balance, sent into a thicket of players, and ended with a throw-in. 33 mins: Croatia are still dominating possession and passes, but they haven’t looked remotely like scoring. Iceland, on the other hand, are making chances. Half-chances after set pieces, but chances all the same. They have just won another corner. 31 mins: Sigurdsson shoots, but Kalinic gets there in plenty of time and catches. 30 mins: Iceland are winning a succession of set pieces. Hallfredsson was tripped by Kovacic for the latest. 28 mins: An effort on goal! Iceland have a corner on the right wing, and Magnusson rises highest at the far post and heads well wide. 27 mins: Danger! A long through for Iceland, flicked on at the near post by Magnusson, and it looped across goal and wide of the far post. 25 mins: More than a quarter of the game gone, and I still haven’t had a shot to tell you about. 23 mins: A singe Argentina goal doesn’t really change much for Iceland, who had to win anyway and would move into second if they take the lead. 22 mins: A lengthy exchange of Croatia passes ends with the ball being given away in midfield and Gylfi Sigurdsson very nearly being played through on goal. 20 mins: Bjarnason returned to the fray for a while, but has now been sent back to the touchline to have fresh cotton wool crammed up his nose, and for a change of shorts. 19 mins: Still 0-0. 17 mins: I am of course entirely impartial, but I find the idea of a France v Argentina second-round match quite enticing. 15 mins: Argentina are a goal up against Nigeria, a certain Lionel Messi with it. 14 mins: Pjaca has been booked, while Bjarnason is on his feet and carrying his blood-soaked towel to the touchlines. There didn’t seem a lot of intent there, but there certainly was impact. 12 mins: Bjarnason, harrying Pjaca from behind, gets a flailing arm in the face and goes down, bleeding. 11 mins: Finnbogason has the ball on the right wing, while away to his left Bjarnason runs into an empty area, entirely unmarked. Any kind of decent cross would have given him an excellent goalscoring chance, but sadly it was not forthcoming. “Am in a bar on a promise they would be showing Croatia,” writes Ian Copestake, “but both screens are filled with Messi running through the middle before losing the ball. I am too English to move of course.” I am not sure why a neutral would want to watch Iceland v Croatia reserves instead of Nigeria v Argentina, but I’ll be here to fill in the gaps. 9 mins: Pjaca picks up the ball, shields it from Gunnarsson and, when he’s a yard outside the area, goes down. He ran about 10 yards under the same amount of pressure and chose the best moment to go down, and for this cynicism the referee refuses to award the free kick. He was being impeded though. 7 mins: But then Iceland have the first significant attack, Gylfi Sigurdsson sending in a low cross that was cleared by a defender. 6 mins: Latest completed pass statistics: Croatia 39, Iceland 1. 5 mins: Iceland have just moved off 0% pass accuracy, with 14 seconds of the fifth minute to play, after the ball was rolled gently back to the keeper. 3 mins: Croatia aren’t so much dominating possession as entirely monopolising it. 1 min: Peeeeeep! Iceland, in white, get the game under way and immediately pump it long into the penalty area. And Ihave pictures! Not before time: the ball is in the centre circle, the players ready to go. The players are out (I’m assuming; the BBC haven’t started their coverage of this match yet)! The surnames of Iceland’s starting XI average 11.4 characters each (Croatia’s average 7.8 characters). Get ready, typing fingers. You’re in for a busy night. A nice little story from Kari Tilinius: “Iceland wasn’t good at football when I, or anyone older than six, was growing up, but now football is centre stage. To give an example, the song Ég er Kominn Heim (I have come home) was an obscure old pop song but was taken up by Iceland supporters. I bought a songbook for my three-year-old this spring and the first song in it was Ég er Kominn Heim. All of us Icelanders are aware that we’re living through a golden age of Icelandic football and we’re going to enjoy every second that’s left for us in this tournament, whether we continue, or as is more likely, go home. Whenever the team gets home they will be serenaded with Ég er Kominn Heim.” Here’s a video of the Iceland supporters singing the song at Euro 2016: One of the most notable things about the World Cup, though perhaps mainly notable to journalists, is the number of ridiculous surveys, normally funded by betting companies, that are sent to you by PR people during the tournament. My favourite so far arrived today, funded this time by a brand of deodorant (Sure Men Sport Cool, which is surely just four random words put together rather than an actual thing) and revealing that seven out of 10 British males believe a Batshuayi to be a kind of cheese. The teams in full: Iceland: Halldorsson, Saevarsson, Ingason, Ragnar, Sigurdsson, Magnusson, Gunnarsson, Hallfredsson, Johann Berg Gudmundsson, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Bjarnason, Finnbogason. Subs: Schram, Fridjonsson, Albert Gudmundsson, Sigurdarson, Arnason, Eyjolfsson, Olafur Ingi Skulason, Gislason, Traustason, Bodvarsson, Ari Freyr Skulason, Runarsson. Croatia: Lovre Kalinic, Jedvaj, Corluka, Caleta-Car, Pivaric, Modric, Badelj, Pjaca, Kovacic, Perisic, Kramaric. Subs: Livakovic, Vrsaljko, Strinic, Lovren, Rakitic, Brozovic, Bradaric, Mandzukic, Rebic, Vida, Subasic. Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (Spain). So after this afternoon’s matches we know that the winners of this group, almost certainly Croatia, will join Spain and Russia in the bottom half of the draw, and will play Denmark in Nizhny Novgorod at 7pm BST on Sunday. The runners-up head into the top half of the draw, along with Uruguay and Portugal, where they will play France in Kazan at 3pm on Saturday. So Croatia keep Modric and Perisic, and change everybody else. Iceland make three changes. And here’s Croatia’s: Iceland’s team is out: So, the basics: Croatia are through, and will win the group if they don’t lose, or if Nigeria don’t win, or if they do lose and Nigeria do win but the goal difference swing is less than five. For their opponents the situation is considerably more complicated. Iceland must win if they are to qualify for the knock-out stages. If the Nigeria v Argentina match ends in a draw, Iceland must win by two goals, and score at least one more goal than Nigeria, to go through. If Nigeria win, they are out whatever they do. If Argentina win, Iceland must simply match their result (though if Iceland’s winning margin is precisely one worse than Argentina’s with both teams scoring the same number of goals themselves, say by Iceland prevailing 2-1 while Argentina win 2-0, the teams would be divided by disciplinary record; Argentina have so far had three players booked, and Iceland none). Here’s the Group D table: nd here’s what the Iceland coach, Heimir Hallgrimsson, thinks about Iceland’s chances of going through. If it’s the Eurovision Song Contest we always think we’re going to win it. It’s the same here – we think we’re going to win all the games. And even if we lose we think we’re going to win the next one. I think it is in the genes – optimism. Croatia are expected to rest several players for this game. “I don’t care what other teams are saying. We mind our own business,” says their coach, Zlatko Dalic. Hallgrimsson does not believe this will give his side an advantage: It’s strange to say it but I think the players who have played in the first two games could be demotivated, thinking about not getting injured or not getting yellow cards. There are no rubbish players in the Croatia squad. Now for a few facts and figures: Croatia are yet to concede at this World Cup. Their all-time World Cup clean sheet streak is 281 minutes, which they will surpass if there is more than three minutes of stoppage time in today’s game. Iceland are the only team not to have had a player booked or sent off so far in this World Cup. Croatia have had six bookings. Croatia’s players have made 29 tackles at the World Cup, and Iceland’s 28. The teams with the fewest tackles are England, with a scarcely credible four, followed by Belgium with five, which probably says something about the merits of Panama and Tunisia. With 43, Croatia have given away by some margin the most free kicks of those teams still to play their final group games. Next is Sweden, with 33. Iceland have given away 25 (Japan, with 17, are the cleanest team by far). Iceland have only scored one goal so far, to Croatia’s five. But they have had 21 goalscoring opportunities, one more than Iceland’s 20. Luka Modric is the passiest player in either squad, having attempted 109 passes in the tournament so far. This puts him joint 74th on the overall list. There are four England players above him: Kyle Walker, John Stones, Harry Maguire and Jordan Henderson. Iceland’s passiest player, Hannes Halldorsson, has attempted a mere 63, and no team has attempted fewer passes than Iceland’s 481 (Sweden are 31st in that ranking, on a distant 630). The referee, Antonio Mateu, is a PE teacher from Spain. His favourite memory is the 2014 Copa del Rey final, which he officiated in his home town, Valencia. So, that’s the scene set. Let’s do this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/house-of-commons-london-a-nasty-taste-in-my-mouth-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T05:00:31Z","webTitle":"House of Commons: ‘smell of boiled cabbage’ – restaurant review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/house-of-commons-london-a-nasty-taste-in-my-mouth-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/house-of-commons-london-a-nasty-taste-in-my-mouth-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"House of Commons, London: ‘A nasty taste in my mouth’","bodyText":"Strangers’ Dining Room at the House of Commons, Westminster, London SW1A 0AA. Visit parliament.uk to book. Meal for two including drinks and service £180 Many wretched schemes have been devised within the Houses of Parliament to separate the British from their money, in return for scant reward. There’s the poll tax, which was a charge on breathing. There are VAT increases, instituted to sort out a financial mess you didn’t make. To these should be added one more: the shameful price they are charging to serve mediocre cooking to hapless members of the public. The idea is delightful. The Houses of Parliament belong to us all. Security allowing, we should be allowed in. So why not open up the dining rooms to those eager to dine literally like a lord, or even just like Michael Gove? Periodically they open bookings for tables in the Members’ or the Strangers’ Dining Room. The dinner service in the Strangers’ Dining Room continues on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings until mid-July. Further dates will soon be announced, which is unfortunate. There is a complex online booking process. You need to fill in a form, give a credit card number and promise to bring ID. But they do big the whole thing up. There is talk of “award-winning chefs” without saying which awards they’ve won. They mention “top-end British cuisine” and that “classic styling comes in the form of white tablecloths”. Be still my beating heart. So you turn up and they x-ray your bag and search you (though, interestingly, never ask to see that ID). Through the great echoing vault of Westminster Hall you trot, up the stairs and into the grandly painted lady that is the Central Lobby between the Commons and the Lords. Stop and look up at the glorious ceiling. To be here at the epicentre of our democracy is a thing. Please be a little awestruck and breathless. It will help you put off breathing in for as long as possible. Because when you do you will be whacked by the essence of British institution: the fetid smell of boiled cabbage. I wouldn’t normally complain. This really is a British institution. Inside it looks like every minor public school or corrupt Oxbridge college that ever spat out a mildly dysfunctional beta male with a quiet interest in ornithology, onanism and flagellation. It should smell of boiled cabbage. But here’s the thing. The dinner menu in your future is going to cost you – deep breath – £65 a head, before drinks, service and self-loathing. All that, and the smell of stewed brassicas. Still, onwards we go to the Strangers’ Dining Room, around the corner from the Lobby, or more correctly into an overflow room next door. The wood panelling is thick, the paintings glower, the carpet is a violent migraine-floral and beyond the window, the Thames shimmers as dusk approaches. The front-of-house staff are loyal retainers of a certain age. They feel like Westminster lifers, here to serve, in a sturdy way, until their hips give out. This incursion by the public, and that table of Japanese tourists over there, seems to unsettle them. I want to give them a hug and whisper that we’ll all be gone soon along with our filthy, raised expectations. Certainly, they don’t co-ordinate anything with each other. They’ll all have a cheery crack at taking your order even when it’s been taken. Each will try to pour your wine even when you’ve already asked to pour it yourself. That £65 three-course menu offers four choices per course plus petit fours, coffee and a side order of profound regret. It’s an overwritten document name-checking lots of flavours that go missing in action. Likewise, the food it describes represents a kitchen straining at a modernity it might have read about once in a magazine. White crabmeat is mixed in with too much crème fraîche, until loose and floppy. It’s meant to slap you with mustard but doesn’t. There’s a disc of flavourless kohlrabi over the top. It claims there’s fresh chilli in there but we can’t find it. On the other hand, there are lumps of pineapple. What I have thus learned: pineapple and crab hate each other. Another starter brings a serviceable salt beef terrine with capers and what is called “beef dripping sourdough crisp”. Look, if you’re going to promise me rendered cow fat, I want to taste cow fat. I can’t. Both mains are roast dinners that have been at Mum’s dressing-up box. They look like grown-up plates of cooking but the more you dig in the less you get. There are over-reduced Marmitey sauces, and vegetables that have been less trimmed than given the full Brazilian. What the hell happened to the rest of them? My lamb dish looks like Mr McGregor’s garden. They’ve sliced all the baby carrots off at the knees so they stand vertical. There are two small pieces of lamb and “almond croquettes”, which taste not of almond. The potatoes on a chicken dish are so small and turned they look like those grooved dowling rods Ikea gives you to assemble a set of bookshelves called Billy or Hemnes. And back we swirl to price. Imagine £15 of that £65 went on the starters. It’s outrageous, but let’s just try imagining that. It means they’re charging £40 or so for those mains. Chuck on a £35 bottle of wine because there’s little choice below that and with service you’re on £180. You can go to 98% of restaurants in London for less than £180. The waiters will be pleased to see you and the room won’t smell of ruined cabbage. Instead you’re here, waving in a tiny £10 marzipan tart which is light on the marzipan and a rhubarb mousse that tastes of existential angst. Oh, and it takes just 70 minutes. We sit down at 8pm. At 9.10pm, desserts are cleared. It’s meant to be accessible to the public, but cost is its own special barrier. What’s most troubling is I suspect they don’t know. The kitchen probably thinks this mediocrity is cutting-edge stuff. It’s not. It’s banqueting food at a ring-road hotel. It’s cutting edge as cooked by people who haven’t eaten out enough. And yes, I know the building needs renovating but that’s what I pay my taxes for. I’m not subsidising the works by overpaying for sliced bloody carrots. It could have been a carnival of Britishness: of perfect suet puddings, ribs of beef with horseradish followed by trifle. Instead, as well as a nasty taste in my mouth, it left me thinking that the problem with parliament really isn’t just the politicians. News bites If you want that British institution thing done right, head to the Guinea Grill just off Berkeley Square, central London. It’s the place for prawn cocktails, steaks, Beef Wellington, smoked salmon and steak and kidney pie. Their mixed grill is a thing of beauty and includes ox heart, calf’s liver, lamb’s kidney and a bunch of other things besides. The wine list is big on huge French reds (theguinea.co.uk). Chef Alexis Gauthier of his eponymous Soho restaurant plans to take the entire menu vegan within two years. Speaking at a Restaurant Magazine conference recently, he said he would not ‘be creating any new dishes involving meat and fish or things with eggs and butter’. It’s always interesting to see what the bestsellers are from Amazon’s online grocery business. Right now the No 1 bestseller in confectionery is a pack of Grenade High Protein Low Carb bars. And No 2? A massively high-carb collection of retro sweetshop classics.

Do we need to be seen drinking beer and eating bacon sandwiches?” The aggravation is heartfelt because Najib is chairing a local initiative in Bradford intended to bring diverse communities together around their shared values. And he’s doing it largely in the name of faith. The management committee of the Greenmoor Big Local project that he chairs is made up of Muslims, Christians and those of no religion, working together for the benefit of the whole community. There are youngish business people and accountants. Najib himself is a former policeman and lawyer. At the meeting I attended, the discussion focused on whether it was worth keeping local city councillors on the committee when they never attended meetings. Big Local was devised as a way of attracting National Lottery funds to 150 of the country’s most poverty-stricken areas which had not benefited before – though the residents of those areas had certainly contributed enough in terms of buying lottery tickets. The result is that each community receives £1m over 10 years to spend on improving their neighbourhoods. Each community decides on local priorities and how to manage the money, whether for tidying up the area, setting up job clubs and youth activities, advising on debt problems, or renovating the housing stock. Now into their fourth or fifth years, some projects have been more enterprising and successful than others. Many of them have faith group involvement. It is not a case of religious groups seizing control of the money or using it to proselytise: they are specifically forbidden from doing that. The groups I visited across the Midlands and north of England – to write a pamphlet for Local Trust, the body which oversees the scheme – disavowed it as an intention. It is more that in many inner-city estates, churches and sometimes mosques are the only community buildings – so faith leaders such as vicars are the only people locally with the experience and knowledge to organise groups, manage money and challenge the authorities. Many of the groups actually view the National Lottery as a form of gambling and disapprove of it – but believe that, if the money is available, it ought to be put back into the communities from which it has been leached. “My building is one of the few community facilities here. In this area, one of the biggest problems is a lack of education among the under-35s. They have levels of apathy and negativity I have found almost impossible to break through,” says one vicar. “People here find paperwork and organisation difficult. I qualify as a resident and have skill sets that are difficult to find in others, so I had to take the project on.” That is not the case in Bradford. The group Najib chairs is unusual in that its management committee is largely made up of young Muslim professionals. They have not moved out of the area as some of their white counterparts have done elsewhere, but still live near to their families, some of whom came to Bradford from India and Pakistan 50 years ago to work in the mills and factories. One of the projects Greenmoor Big Local is sponsoring is a weekly lunch club, held in St Wilfrid’s Church of England parish hall, for older Sikhs and Hindus, many of whom, especially the women, still cannot speak much English after decades in Britain. Their needs – local doctors and public transport – are just the same as those of other older residents. It is up to each group to organise itself, consult locals and manage the projects it runs. In Collyhurst, a historically deprived inner-city estate north of Manchester, the priority has been tackling debt issues, with an advice centre set up in the local parish church on the initiative of the vicar, the Rev Chris Fallone. The trained volunteers have managed to reduce the debts of local residents from an estimated £1.3m to £700,000 in just a year. North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, attracted national coverage two years ago when it was discovered that G4S had painted front doors of houses set aside for asylum seekers bright red. This led to houses being targeted, and following the scandal, the company repainted the doors a variety of colours. The area is full of streets of small Victorian terrace houses, many dilapidated and most privately rented. They are among the cheapest in Britain: they cost about £20,000 and many have been bought by absentee landlords. Here, Big Local is buying up and renovating properties to be rented to responsible tenants. “I want the people of the parish to live in decent homes in a good community,” says local vicar Dominic Black. “What faith groups do is offer hope in what otherwise might be a hopeless situation.” In Bradford, the motivation is the same. Says Najib: “Religion is one of the motivators of volunteering. We give our time as a religious duty. There is a belief that the Almighty appreciates activism in the community. It’s part of the motivation to get involved and effect change.” Greenmoor’s priorities include lobbying for improved local amenities: allotments, community gardens, an IT club for older residents, unemployment advice and improved health facilities: in other words, exactly the same sort of priorities as other faith groups involved in Big Local. The Rev Al Barrett, board member of Firs and Bromford Big Local – located in the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham – says: “We had a struggle to persuade people that the church was not interested in the money. What we are interested in is building the local community, across genders, faiths and generations. We are not arguing about how to spend the money for the church, but for our neighbourhoods.” Stephen Bates’s pamphlet Community Spirits is published by Local Trust • This article was amended on 27 and 28 June 2018. An earlier version said that in Middlesbrough, G4S painted front doors of houses set aside for asylum seekers bright red “to identify them”, and that the doors had since been painted green. The company has said that this had not been done deliberately, and the doors have since been painted a variety a colours, not just green. The Rev Al Barrett was described as chairman of one Birmingham Big Local; the chair of the Firs and Bromford Big Local in Birmingham’s Hodge Hill area is Florence Parkes, who is not a member of any faith group and reinforces the point that there is no faith control of the group’s funds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/jun/26/pet-food-is-an-environmental-disaster-are-vegan-dogs-the-answer","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"Pet food is an environmental disaster – are vegan dogs the answer?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jun/26/pet-food-is-an-environmental-disaster-are-vegan-dogs-the-answer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/jun/26/pet-food-is-an-environmental-disaster-are-vegan-dogs-the-answer","fields":{"headline":"Pet food is an environmental disaster – are vegan dogs the answer?","bodyText":"Animal microbiologist Holly Ganz cannot talk about the pet feeding regime known as biologically appropriate raw food without laughing. The increasingly popular diet is known by its unfortunate acronym, Barf. “It’s bizarrely named,” she says, laughing. It certainly runs contrary to the twee language usually reserved for the pet realm; such as Kitty Biome, a project Ganz recently raised $23,000 (£17,000) for via Kickstarter, which invited cat owners to pay $100 to have the microorganisms in their cat’s droppings analysed. The common term for the environmental impact of pet-keeping has a cute name too: pawprint. But, with humans increasingly demanding human-grade meat for their four-legged family members, pet food is estimated to be responsible for a quarter of the environmental impacts of meat production in terms of the use of land, water, fossil fuels, phosphates and pesticides. And this trend for raw food is, environmentally speaking, a step backwards. It is this carbon pawprint that Ganz is working to reduce. She has been drafted in to assess the gut-friendliness of a vegan pet-food product launching in the US in July called Wild Earth. Its first offering is a dog treat made from what the blurb calls an “ancient Asian” fungi called koji. “We’re hoping,” she says, “that it will support bacteria that will help to fight inflammation and maintain healthy digestion and nutrition.” Ask Wild Earth’s CEO, Ryan Bethencourt, what the future of pet food looks like and he has one word: “Massive.” In 2017, the global pet-food market was worth $94bn, and it is projected to grow even further as new markets open up. In China, where pet ownership is rare, the market grew by 100% last year. “If China follows the trends, we are going to see hundreds of millions more pets in existence,” says Bethencourt. He thinks these pets can be fed sustainably with his koji protein while, for the longer term, the company is working on lab-grown meat, culturing meat cells that would not require rearing or killing animals. They have already created a mouse-meat prototype for cats that, it says, will beat lab meat for humans to market because there is less red tape to navigate. But it will be some time before the technology can be scaled up accordingly. In the meantime, can eco-conscious cats and dogs survive on a vegan diet? “Cats are obligate carnivores,” says Ganz, which means a lot of what they need comes from meat, “whereas dogs are more scavengers and have amylase genes so they can digest starch.” But even a scientifically designed vegan or vegetarian diet for dogs, says Ganz, can be difficult to devise. Gudrun Ravetz, the president of the British Veterinary Association, agrees: “Theoretically, you can feed a dog a vegetarian diet, but it’s not something you do lightly and you definitely need to do it with a nutritionist. A lot of what cats need is found in animal protein. It may well be in this fungi, but I’d want to see evidence that these are in the fungi and they’re available to the animal.” Bethencourt describes koji as a “whole food” with a great “amino acid” profile and 10% more protein than you would expect to find in a decent steak. “We have to add a few supplements, just as any meat-based protein company does, to make sure it has the right vitamins and minerals. The food has to be enough, nutritionally, for the animal to survive, and we found our protein is easily digested by dogs.” Bethencourt, who is soon to release a nutrient profile and digestibility study, was the first guinea pig for his dog food. And while pet food is usually tested by animals in labs, Wild Earth employs a humane process where the dogs used live at home and are volunteered by their owners. He is confident that a nutritional cat food will follow. “Cats really need [the amino acids] carnitine and taurine in their food,” says Ravetz. “They are important for vision, the heart and the immune system, among other things. A lack of them can cause all kinds of problems. “We think we can get the right nutrition relatively easily by supplementing koji, but cats are picky, so what we need to do is make sure they really love their food.” There is already a more sustainable source of animal protein out there: insects. While the food industry struggles to make them more appetising to western humans, dogs have no trouble lapping them up. When Haley Russell began experimenting with her own small-scale cricket farm, her discerning goldendoodle, Wren, devoured the insects whenever she got the chance. Russell and the co-founders of Chipper Pet went on to talk to veterinarians, who, she says, “confirmed that insects are great for dogs. In fact, you get a different mix of amino acids that are really helpful for food variety, which is important for people and great for dogs, too.” Like Wild Earth, Chipper Pet is starting with a dog treat in peanut, pumpkin and cricket flavour, with the tagline: “Save water. Save land. Chip in.” Crickets could serve as a main meal, too, high in iron and omega-3 oils and vitamin B12. “It’s a complete animal protein, so there isn’t a deficiency, meaning it would be a suitable daily food.” The challenge lies in convincing pet parents that their animal will love it and a treat is merely a way for them to get used to the idea. There is also a supply issue, while edible insect farmers scale up. Again, a cat food will follow because, says Russell, “cats can be a little bit more finicky”. Meanwhile, “premium”, “natural” and “human-grade” pet foods are on the rise with “cat casseroles” and venison sausages on the menu, and more people are home cooking for their pets. “I cook for my dogs,” says Ganz. “I have a 16-year-old, and she just won’t eat anything else. My co-founder says my dogs eat better than her children, but I didn’t have children, so they are my children.” She says there are a growing number of companies offering home-cooked pet food, too. “People are spending a lot more money on their pets,” says Ganz. There is also a new trend for grain-free food, which vets say has no known benefits for cats and dogs, and is another way meat consumption is going up. It is a repetitive diet Ganz partly blames for the 10% of pets she has found to have digestive conditions. Her company, Animal Biome, based in Oakland, California, has big-name pet food manufacturers, such as Nestle Purina PetCare, and individual clients on its books. Customers come to her with pets that are vomiting or are suffering with diarrhoea or constipation. Animal Biome offers an “oral faecal transplant capsule”, AKA poo from a healthy animal’s gut, which “can shift the microbiome to a more balanced state – we call that a gut restoration”. Just as in humans, a diverse diet is the route to a healthy gut, and eating the same food all the time means pets are “more likely to develop food allergies”, says Ganz. She rotates different meats for her dogs, but says “these are just debates – we don’t have answers”. However, in bad news for the planet, many of her customers report positive results from shifting to the Barf diet. “The idea is that you’re feeding the animal food similar to its natural diet. What cats would have eaten up until the 20th century was mice and birds.” Despite there being only anecdotal evidence of benefits, it is popular in the UK, too, with raw food products such as Nature’s Menu widely available, but, Ravetz warns, “it’s tricky if you’re preparing it at home to make sure it’s nutritionally adequate. We see nutritional deficiencies with homemade diets [in general] – it’s understanding what an animal needs in the right ratio. We’re extrapolating from the human need and not necessarily getting it right.” Human health is another consideration with raw feeding. “There is some research showing that there’s potential for more contaminants – campylobacter, salmonella – which animals can pass in their faeces, so they can infect other dogs and humans.” By far the biggest dietary issue for pets, though, is being overweight. “We’re overfeeding our cats,” says Ravetz. “We may be feeding them the right amount of cat or dog food, but then giving them treats, coupled with more animals being left at home for long periods of time, and this could correlate to less exercise.” Instead of reaching for the treats, which is also bad for their pawprint, Ravetz suggests other rewards such as playing with them, taking them for a walk, stroking them or letting them sit on your knee. “If you do want to give treats, certainly during the training of young animals, look for treats that don’t have a high calorie content. Dogs will eat tiny pieces of raw carrot, or even pieces of their normal dry food. But take that away from their daily allowance so you’re not giving more than is needed.” And again, home feeding can increase the risk of obesity: “What might look like a bit of salmon to us,” warns Ravetz, “to a cat with a significantly smaller body size, it could be humongous.” People should not feel guilty, she says, about how they feed their pets: “Nutritional quality doesn’t always correlate with price.” In a healthy cat, a vet-recommended dry food can be excellent. “If a cat has a certain comorbidity, we may look to use a different food, and sometimes if a cat is having urinary problems, we may look to increase its water intake and wet food, which contains significant amounts of water,” says Ravetz. Wild Earth will be introducing a wet dog food and, eventually, aims to work nutritional variety into the range. “Right now, we think it’s a really clean protein source and that’s a really good place to start,” he says. “If you look at most dogs’ diets, they’re not diverse.” The ultimate vegan pet food, says Ganz, “would be if they could lab-grow a carcass. Cats and dogs need the blood, the bones and organs, not just the muscle meat.” But for the moment, that’s still a tall order."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2018/jun/27/john-lewis-to-close-five-waitrose-stores-after-warning-on-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T12:31:22Z","webTitle":"Five Waitrose stores to close after John Lewis issues warning on profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/27/john-lewis-to-close-five-waitrose-stores-after-warning-on-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/27/john-lewis-to-close-five-waitrose-stores-after-warning-on-profits","fields":{"headline":"Five Waitrose stores to close after John Lewis issues warning on profits","bodyText":"The John Lewis Partnership has said it will make no profit in the first six months of this year and is to close five Waitrose stores as tough trading on the high street takes its toll. The group, which operates 50 John Lewis department stores and 350 Waitrose shops, said full-year profits for the year to January 2019 will also be substantially lower than last year. JLP blamed the likely fall on market uncertainty and significant extra costs as it invests in IT and suffers the pinch from Brexit-fuelled inflation, at a time when it has been forced to cut prices because of widespread discounting by ailing competitors. The group said it would be gradually slimming down its high street presence over time, beginning with the sale of four Little Waitrose convenience stores to the Co-op and the chain’s supermarket on Camden High Street, north London, to Aldi, which will affect about 200 staff. The convenience stores changing hands are in Spinningfields and near Piccadilly station in Manchester, Colmore Row in Birmingham and Portman Square in central London. While John Lewis said it had no plans to carry out the kind of mass closures happening at rivals House of Fraser and Marks &amp; Spencer, at least two department stores are also to be slimmed down in size – including Peterborough – as the retailer said it was looking at leasing space to other retailers. Sir Charlie Mayfield, the JLP chair, said the difficulties being experienced on the high street were not short-term: “It is very important that we feel the jeopardy of what is happening right now. This isn’t a blip, it is a major shift and it has a while to run.” Waitrose is expected to achieve profit growth but that will be offset by a decline at John Lewis in the year ahead. The group said it hoped to bounce back after 2019. The group said: “It is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through a period of generational change and every retailer’s response will be different. For the partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation, not scale.” To emphasise that difference, the stores are to change their branding over the next five years so that both chains include “&amp; partners” in the name. John Lewis will ditch its trademark green and white and Waitrose its lime and grey in favour of black and white livery. The change, which will kick off in September, will be combined with an increased emphasis on service from its employee-owners as a way to fight the competition. Mayfield said John Lewis was aiming to bring in more own-label and exclusive brands as well as improved services such as personal shoppers in the department stores and trained baristas or diet experts in the supermarkets. “We are determined to be innovators and disruptors in this market,” he said. “This is no time to bring the legions closer to Rome. You can’t win defensively but [only] by developing newness and innovation.” In order to fund revamped stores, online and IT development and lower prices with £400m to £500m of investment a year, the group will be cutting costs at its head office, stopping investment in new stores, reviewing its pension arrangements and reining in marketing spending. Retailers have been hammered by rising costs and falling consumer confidence, with several high-profile casualties this year resulting in hundreds of store closures. Chains, including House of Fraser, New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare are closing stores, with thousands of jobs at risk, as a result of higher costs and a shift to buying online."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/27/brexit-bank-contracts-worth-trillions-at-risk-says-finance-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T11:37:58Z","webTitle":"Brexit: bank contracts worth trillions at risk, says finance watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/27/brexit-bank-contracts-worth-trillions-at-risk-says-finance-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/27/brexit-bank-contracts-worth-trillions-at-risk-says-finance-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: bank contracts worth trillions at risk, says finance watchdog","bodyText":"Britain’s chief financial watchdog has warned that contracts worth trillions of pounds between UK and European Union banks remain at risk of collapse following Brexit, after Brussels’ failure to implement protective legislation. In a warning to EU officials that time is running out before next March to devise rules for EU banks, the Bank of England’s financial policy committee (FPC) said £29tn worth of contracts could be declared void. Derivatives contracts, which provide banks and corporations with protection from interest rate rises, could come to an end without fresh legislation from the UK and EU, the committee said in its latest quarterly health check on Britain’s financial services industry. The warning will be seen as a direct response to the European Banking Authority, which argued earlier this week that the UK was dragging its feet preparing for Brexit. In an increasingly bitter war of words, EBA officials said there was little preparation by the UK authorities and individual banks for life outside the EU. The FPC hit back, saying the Treasury was well advanced in its efforts to bridge the gap between banks in London and those on the continent, but Brussels had made little obvious effort to support its own financial institutions. “The biggest remaining risks of disruption are where action is needed by both UK and EU authorities, such as ensuring the continuity of existing derivatives contracts. As yet the EU has not indicated a solution analogous to a temporary permissions regime,” it said. The committee said a technical working group co-chaired by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, was a welcome development. But it added that there was as yet no proposed remedy to reassure banks and their customers that contracts would be valid after next March. Banks in the UK are well prepared for a serious economic downturn ahead of stress tests later this summer, the committee said, despite a strong rise in consumer debt. It said limits on the riskiest loans and a clampdown on high loan-to-value mortgages had kept the banking system resilient while global risks had increased."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/28/student-mental-health-must-be-top-priority-universities-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T23:01:51Z","webTitle":"Student mental health must be top priority – universities minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/28/student-mental-health-must-be-top-priority-universities-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/28/student-mental-health-must-be-top-priority-universities-minister","fields":{"headline":"Student mental health must be top priority – universities minister","bodyText":"The government has issued an ultimatum to vice-chancellors on student mental health, warning them it is not good enough to suggest that university is about academic education and nothing else. With as many as one in four students seeking help from counselling services at some institutions, the universities minister, Sam Gyimah, is calling on vice-chancellors to prioritise student mental health and take a personal lead on the issue. The minister, announcing plans for a new deal on mental health for students, said: “There are some vice-chancellors who think that university is about training the mind and all of these things are extra that they don’t have to deal with. “They can’t do that, they’ve got to get behind this programme. It can’t be something that belongs to the wellbeing department of the university. This requires sustained and serious leadership from the top.” One of the key measures now being considered is asking students if they want to opt in to an alert system authorising their university to contact their parents in an emergency if they find themselves in a mental health crisis at some point during their studies. Until now universities have been unable to share a student’s private information because of data protection restrictions, but parents of students who have killed themselves have complained of being kept in the dark about their child’s illness when they might have been able to help had they known sooner. Under the proposed scheme, outlined by Gyimah, students arriving in their first week at university would be asked if they would like to opt in to the system by nominating either a family member or friend to be contacted in case of serious mental health problems. The minister said it would be entirely voluntary and any students would be entitled to withhold information from their parents or change their preferences at a later date. Gyimah was due to outline his plans on Thursday at a student mental health summit in Bristol where the issue has come under the spotlight with the deaths of 10 University of Bristol students since October 2016. A further two students from the University of the West of England (UWE) in the city have also died. A number have been confirmed as suicides. James Murray, whose son Ben took his own life last month while in his first year at Bristol university, has been a leading voice calling on universities to be allowed to contact parents if their child is suffering from serious mental health problems. He welcomed the minister’s intervention. “I do feel like this is a turning point. I’m thrilled that Sam Gyimah has decided that this is something that could help save the lives of others and avoid the situation we experienced with Ben. We will think of this as Ben’s Rule,” Murray said. Universities have reported a huge surge in demand for counselling services in recent years, with as many as one in four students either being seen or waiting to be seen by counselling services in some institutions. Official figures published earlier this week revealed that 95 university students killed themselves in the 12 months to July 2017, which equates to 4.7 suicides per 100,000 students. As part of the new student mental health package, the minister announced plans for a student mental health charter which would detail basic criteria that universities need to meet in order to demonstrate to prospective students and parents they meet the required standard for student mental health support. The Department for Education is also launching a review of the transition between school and university to ensure students are getting adequate support in their first year when they are particularly vulnerable. “We want mental health support for students to be a top priority for the leadership of all our universities,” the minister said. “Progress can only be achieved with their support – I expect them to get behind this important agenda as we otherwise risk failing an entire generation of students. “Universities should see themselves as ‘in loco parentis’ – not infantilising students, but making sure support is available where required. It is not good enough to suggest that university is about the training of the mind and nothing else, as it is too easy for students to fall between the cracks and to feel overwhelmed and unknown in their new surroundings.” Prof Steve West, the vice-chancellor of UWE and chair of the Universities UK mental health in higher education advisory group, said: “Universities cannot address these complex challenges alone. Partnership working with students, staff, government, schools, colleges and employers, the NHS, local authorities and third sector organisations is vital if we are to help students and staff to thrive.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

A new mural could help","bodyText":"The Eiffel Tower, Sydney Opera House, Singapore’s infinity pools, the street art of Shoreditch, São Paulo and Melbourne – scrolling through your Instagram feed can feel like Groundhog Day, with the same spots, in the same city, shot from a handful of angles, millions of times. Blame “influencers”. As Instagram has become more popular, hotspots have emerged either organically or by design (see: San Francisco’s Museum of Ice Cream, built to look good on Instagram, but of questionable educational value, and the Rabbit Town “selfie theme park” in West Java, Indonesia). The popularity of certain sites on Instagram has not only resulted in a one-note depiction of cities, but a potential hazard. The Indian state of Goa recently identified 24 “no-selfie zones” along its coastline after a spate of deaths and injuries of truly committed content generators. A potential solution? A mural exclusively for the discerning social media personality. On Tuesday, an Instagram-friendly mural of a pink heart and angel wings appeared in a parking lot on Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles – next to another winged mural already popular on social media. This one, however, was different, claimed its creator, Jack Wagner: “Influencers work so hard every day to curate beautiful feeds and inspire us all, we wanted to make something specifically for them. Most of the best murals in LA are already posted too often, which is why this mural is for verified influencers only (or people with more than 20k followers).” An “armed security team”, he said, had been hired to “guard the mural” against those without the prerequisite blue tick. If Wagner’s words and oh-so-ironic Instagram handle – @versace_tamagotchi – didn’t make it clear, the mural is a stunt to promote his forthcoming video-streaming series, Like and Subscribe, described as a satire about internet fame. Yet it angered those who took it literally, among them non-verified influencers and those who just loathe influencers. Like tourists, who have prompted a backlash across Europe, said influencers tend to mindlessly pack into one spot, often to the benefit of the economy but to the detriment of locals’ quality of life.

On the surface the Beam appears to be a relatively simple product. It’s an all-in-one soundbar that connects to your TV via HDMI or optical cable and is controlled by the volume buttons on your TV’s remote. That means there’s a single cable running to your TV and one for power – no other cables leading to other speakers or a sub is required. It can’t get any more simple to use just as a dumb TV speaker. But the Beam is more than a simple soundbar, being a fully-fledged Sonos smart speaker as well. Like the Sonos One, the Beam has Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant support built in, with Google Assistant promised too at a later date. That makes the Beam a jack of all trades, capable of handling all your TV audio duties, answering your questions and commanding smart home devices via Alexa, while acting as one of the best multi-room music speakers money can buy. Setup Setting up the Beam was simple. Plug the included HDMI cable into a port on your TV that’s labelled ARC (audio return channel), plug in the power cable and fire up the Sonos app on your iPhone or Android device. After a quick tutorial you’ll be up and running. If you have an iPhone, you then have the option of performing what Sonos calls TruPlay tuning, which involves waving your phone around while loud sounds play through the room to calibrate the speaker to best fit the space. Using it When used as a TV speaker you simply make sure TV is selected as the audio source in the Sonos app for the Beam and then use your television as normal, controlling the volume via your normal remote. TV audio comes through very tightly controlled with excellently clear and rounded dialogue – a weakness in many TV speakers let alone compact soundbars. The Beam works as a 3.0 speaker with dedicated centre channel speakers that project straight towards you, plus left and right channel speakers projecting their sound at an angle from the ends of the bar. The stereo separation of the left and right channels is very good for such a compact soundbar, and is certainly a step up compared to TV speakers. The Beam doesn’t come with a sub, but you can add one and some rear speakers if you want (more on that later). As such it lacks real thundering bass, so those looking for deep rumbling from the latest blockbuster might be disappointed. But the Beam makes a surprisingly good attempt at full range sound from just one slim box, with more depth than you might expect given the size. You’re left under no illusion what’s happening in action scenes with sound effects full of attack and drama, while sport such as the World Cup has a reasonable amount of atmosphere from the crowd without drowning out the commentators with vuvuzela blasts. Two optional sound modes tweak the audio. Night mode crushes dynamic range so that loud sounds are suppressed and quiet sounds are made more audible, which helps to hear what’s going on when listening at low volumes out of courtesy to your neighbours. Dialogue enhancer further boosts dialogue, but I never found I needed it to hear what was going on, even in hushed scenes. You can also adjust the bass, treble and “loudness” of the speaker using the equaliser. Most will be pleased with the default setup, but if you want a bit more bass you can crank it up. Music While good for TV, the Beam comes alive when you feed it with some good music. It sounds similar to Sonos One in audio quality, just with a wider and more immersive sound stage thanks to the multiple speakers in one box. It shines with all the clarity, punch and energy you would expect from a Sonos speaker, with great separation of instruments, exciting highs, driving treble and enough bass to round out the sound. It is certainly powerful enough to fill a room and then some. More than 60% was overkill in my lounge, but the sound stayed clean and crisp all the way up. The beauty of Sonos’s audio solution is that it will accept pretty much any music service, and makes them all searchable and playable from the single Sonos app, meaning you’re not tied to just one company’s music service or input source. The Alexa integration works just as well in the Beam as it does in the One – it could hear me at all times, even over very loud music, and had simple and effective control over Spotify. You can control the volume at any time, including when watching TV using Alexa, which was good. The Beam can be used on its own, but it will also play nicely with a variety of other Sonos speakers. Should you want to add more bass you can, with Sonos’s wireless sub, while rear channels can be added using a pair of any of the company’s other speakers, including the Play:1, Play:5 or Sonos One. Equally, with other Sonos speakers you can make the Beam part of a multi-room audio group and can even send your TV audio to multiple rooms as an input source. Observations Volume control via the TV remote was a bit variable, often skipping up to six steps in one button press You can’t control the volume of the Beam with the TV remote when playing music or another source (you need voice, the apps or the buttons on the top) There are touch-sensitive volume, pause/play, track skip and microphone mute buttons on the top of the Beam An optical to HDMI adapter is included in the box should your TV not have ARC through HDMI The Beam can be wall mounted, which its relatively small depth, size and weight makes easy The Beam works with Spotify Connect and will work with Apple’s AirPlay 2 Price The Sonos Beam costs £399 and is available for pre-order in black or white, shipping on 17 July. For comparison, the larger Sonos Playbar or Sonos Playbase both cost £699. The Sonos Sub also costs £699, a Sonos One costs £199, the Play:1 £159 or the Play:5 £499. Verdict Despite being £300 cheaper than Sonos’s other TV audio solutions, the Beam is expensive for just a soundbar. The thing is, it isn’t just a soundbar. It’s one of the most compact and aesthetically pleasing soundbars that still has full-range sound without needing a sub. It’s also an excellent multi-room audio speaker, which can be combined with other wireless speakers to make a wireless 5.1 home cinema set up. And it’s a very good Alexa-powered smart speaker that sounds great. The beauty about Sonos’s audio gear is that it’ll work with the music services you already use and make using them a more enjoyable experience. Those looking for earth-shattering explosions and heart-thumping bass will have to look elsewhere, but the Sonos Beam is a great sounding, easy-to-use compact soundbar that’s a jack-of-all-trades and very easy to live with, particularly in smaller rooms or apartments. Pros: compact and attractive, great, room-filling sound whether TV or music, easy set up, Alexa, easy to add to with more speakers Cons: relatively expensive, no room-shaking bass, takes up a port on your TV, no HDMI pass-through, no support for Dolby Atmos Other reviews Sonos One review: the best smart speaker for audiophiles Sonos Play:5 review: one of the best wireless speakers money can buy Amazon Echo second-generation review: smaller, cheaper and better Google Home review: the smart speaker that answers almost any question Apple HomePod review: Siri lets down best sounding smart speaker"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/27/nederlands-dans-theater-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T12:54:28Z","webTitle":"Nederlands Dans Theater review – a superb troupe of dancers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/27/nederlands-dans-theater-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/27/nederlands-dans-theater-review","fields":{"headline":"Nederlands Dans Theater review – a superb troupe of dancers","bodyText":"Nederlands Dans Theater is a company of outstanding dancers and variable choreography. The gap looks widest in Shoot the Moon by house choreographers Sol León and Paul Lightfoot, a distended piece portraying two involuted relationships, one a pairing, the other a triangle. The marvellous rotating set shows three flock-walled interiors, interconnected by doors and windows, and the dance style, characteristically, uses a bedrock of ballet technique topped with a thick layer of mannerism: affected gesticulations, agape mouths, relentless stop-start phrasing. Philip Glass’s score wallpapers along in the background, and the whole piece feels like a classy commercial with serious-drama ambitions. At first, Marco Goecke’s Woke Up Blind, to songs by Jeff Buckley, seems cut from the same middlebrow cloth, more or less ignoring Buckley’s swoopingly emotive vocals in favour of gestural quirks and elastic leg extensions. But once it starts tapping the musical force, the piece sparks into life with a thrumming, fire-in-the-belly energy that burns through its seven dancers’ polished technique. NDT’s associate choreographer Crystal Pite is in demand around the world – and you can see why. The Statement reprises her partnership with the playwright Jonathon Young, with whom she created the astounding Betroffenheit, as well as an idea taken from that earlier piece: a kind of bodily lip-syncing to a spoken soundtrack. Here, the four dancers enact a high-tension script about a team tasked with inciting war in order to profit from it. The vocal rhythms, pitches and registers form an exacting template for their accusing fingers, nervous flinches, shocked about-faces and wily manoeuvres. It’s performed with the frame-by-frame urgency of a graphic novel and – herein lies its brilliance – even as you are gripped by the drama you see its composition with startling clarity. Closing the programme, León and Lightfoot’s Stop-Motion is choreographically more adept than their opener. Though sometimes in thrall to its own vague beauty – exquisite costumes, slow-motion black-and-white film – its interknit scenes, varied pacing and chalk-dusted imagery manage both to complement its superb troupe of dancers and to attain a kind of poetic mystery – if not a profound one.

Justices at the UK’s highest court unanimously found in favour of Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, declaring that their human rights had been breached. In an initial response, an Equalities Office spokesperson issued a non-committal statement saying it would said consider the judgment with “great care”. The prime minister’s official spokesman later said more time was needed for “the government equality office to consider all aspects of civil partnerships for heterosexual and same-sex couples. This is currently under way and we will consider its conclusions in due course.” But Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary and equalities minister, is understood to be sympathetic to opening up civil partnerships to everyone. Dawn Butler, Labour’s shadow minister for women and equalities, called for the law to be changed. “The government should have already legislated to ensure all couples have equality of choice,” she said. “Labour is calling on the government to take action and change the law to ensure all people have access to civil partnerships and are able to choose what is right for them.” Tim Loughton, a Conservative MP who supports the couple’s campaign, is due to meet a Home Office minister on Thursday to discuss the issue. He has also submitted a private member’s bill, which has government support, that commits ministers to carrying out an investigation into different civil partnerships. Steinfeld and Keidan, of west London, believe the institution of marriage is patriarchal and sexist. They have fought a prolonged legal campaign to open up civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples. At present, heterosexual couples may only marry, while same-sex couples can either marry or take up a civil partnership. Steinfeld and Keidan had lost earlier legal challenges at both the high court and the court of appeal. In their decision, the five supreme court justices formally declared that the ban preventing opposite-sex couples from obtaining civil partnerships was incompatible with their human rights and amounted to discrimination. The government should have eliminated the inequality of treatment between same-sex and opposite-sex partners when the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act came into force in 2014, the judges said. “This could have been done by abolishing civil partnerships or by instantaneously extending them to different-sex couples … Taking time to evaluate whether to abolish or extend could never amount to a legitimate aim for the continuance of the discrimination.” In the three and a half years since they launched their legal claim, Steinfeld and Keidan have had two children. The couple’s commitment to equality and rejection of marriage because of its patriarchal associations is such that rather than give them a double-barrelled surname they have the fused family name of Keidstein. The only jurisdiction in the British Isles that permits opposite-sex civil partnerships is the Isle of Man. Some couples have travelled there for ceremonies, but the unions are not recognised in the UK. Other countries such as South Africa, New Zealand and the Netherlands allow couples to choose either civil partnership or marriage. In the Netherlands last year there were 64,400 marriages and 17,900 civil partnerships, suggesting there is demand for both arrangements. Abolishing civil partnerships for same-sex couples to end the discrimination could mean dissolving legal ties that unite 63,000 gay couples – a course of action that would trigger political furore and legal uncertainty. Even the Marriage Foundation supports extending civil partnerships to heterosexual couples, believing they are “infinitely preferable to unthinking and risky cohabitation”. There are 3.3 million unmarried cohabiting couples. They have no legal rights if a partner dies. If they all entered civil partnerships, it could have a significant impact on the government’s pension costs and tax income. There was applause in court from supporters of Steinfield and Keidan after the judgment was read out. Keidan said: “The government is in a position to complete the circle of equality by making sure civil partnerships are now extended to everyone, to make sure the inequality is remedied.” Steinfield said: “After four years and four equality ministers, we get there in the end. I’m frustrated that the government made us go through this at the cost of all this money.” Steinfeld and Keidan’s case was funded through the website Crowdjustice. In a joint statement, they said: “We have fought this battle not only on our own behalf but for 3.3 million unmarried couples in England and Wales. Many want legal recognition and financial protection, but cannot have it because they’re not married and because the choice of a civil partnership is not open to them. The law needs to catch up with the reality of family life in Britain in 2018.” Louise Whitfield, the couple’s solicitor, from the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn, said she was delighted at the unanimous supreme court victory. She said it was rare for rulings to have a personal impact on her life, but she would be going home to ask her husband for a divorce so that they could enter into a civil partnership instead. “I’m a feminist,” she said. “That’s why I took this case on.” An Equalities Office spokesperson said: “The government is very aware of its legal obligations, and we will obviously be considering this judgment of the supreme court with great care. “We recognise the sensitive and personal issues involved in this case and acknowledge, as the supreme court does, the genuine convictions of the couple involved. We will study the court’s judgment carefully and respond in due course.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/27/vagabond-review-agnes-vardas-sandrine-bonnaire","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T12:00:38Z","webTitle":"Vagabond review – Agnès Varda's classic chronicle of a death foretold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/27/vagabond-review-agnes-vardas-sandrine-bonnaire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/27/vagabond-review-agnes-vardas-sandrine-bonnaire","fields":{"headline":"Vagabond review – Agnès Varda's classic chronicle of a death foretold","bodyText":"A young homeless woman is discovered dead in a freezing ditch by an agricultural worker. Pale and still undecomposed, she looks strangely peaceful, as if asleep, and in the mysterious and fractured drama to come, showing flashback episodes in her life descending to this grimly inevitable ending, she is often to be discovered sleeping rough in very much the same situation. As one witness says: “If they’re dead, it’s ugly; if they’re asleep, it’s cute.” This is Mona, unforgettably played by Sandrine Bonnaire; she has evidently changed her name from Justine, to distance herself from a former wage-slave life as a secretary. She took off on the road to nowhere with her tent on her back, sleeping in fields or on roadsides, getting cash-in-hand jobs where she could, sometimes selling sex and sometimes getting raped: always defiant, faintly mutinous, seductive, uncaring, inscrutable. As she says: “Je m’en fous – je bouge” (“I don’t care – I move on”). She is the star of Agnès Varda’s award-winning 1985 film Vagabond, or Sans Toit Ni Loi (No Shelter No Law) now being revived as part of a retrospective in honour of the director’s 90th birthday. This extraordinary film-maker – part of that remarkable and long-lived New Wave generation – is still working, still creating, but this is surely one of her greatest films: enigmatic, possessed of a cool artistry in its structural asymmetries and inconsistencies, and as gripping as any thriller. Varda tells Mona’s story via testimonies of the various people she met: a technique that goes back to Citizen Kane and anticipates Carol Morley’s 2011 documentary Dreams of a Life, about the young woman who died in her London flat without anyone noticing for years. It is a story of someone who has effectively abandoned her identity as well as social status, an outsider, whose existence breaks cover in criminal acts. It reminded me of Rene Allio’s film of Moi, Pierre Rivière … or Cédric Kahn’s Roberto Succo. There is even something Balzacian in the rich spread of characters that Mona encounters. The film pieces together what happened. Sometimes the witnesses speak to an off-camera interviewer just before the relevant scene, sometimes they appear long afterwards, as if to offer an afterthought, and sometimes they will turn in the middle of an encounter with Mona, break the fourth wall and directly address the camera. There appears to be no strict rule or procedural logic in this, and the witnesses seem to have no connection with each other apart from their acquaintance with Mona. But then it appears some of them are related in unexpected ways, a middle-class mesh of prosperity extending horizontally over poor Mona’s head. Wherever she goes, Mona spreads unease. Very often, people secretly envy and admire her and feel discontented with themselves; they are jealous of her freedom and think that for all her poverty she is really alive. But not everyone thinks this way. A hippy and his girlfriend take a shine to Mona and give her some land to work and a caravan to live in. But then they are deeply irritated and disappointed when Mona shows no inclination to get out of bed in the morning. This man tells her that, for all the romantic notions, life on the road, with its grinding poverty, is a kind of living death. Perhaps most complicated is Yolande (played by the Belgian character actor Yolande Moreau) who is maid to a rich old lady and whose uncle is the caretaker of her employer’s semi-derelict chateau. Yolande is one evening to discover Mona and a boyfriend asleep in this property, having broken in. She doesn’t inform on them, envying their happiness. They seem to her to be truly in love – in contrast to Yolande’s sullen relationship with her shifty, petty-criminal boyfriend. Yolande is fortuitously to encounter Mona again, and comes to feel very differently about her. Perhaps she can’t make up her mind whether she has an underdog bond with her, or if she is, in her heart, loyal to the ruling class. It is the chronicle of a death foretold. Perhaps the most arrestingly mysterious episode comes when a stylish university academic (Macha Méril) encounters Mona and winds up driving her around, disgusted by her smell and yet also fascinated by her. Later, this same woman is almost electrocuted in a freak accident after she puts both hands on a poorly fitted electric light. Badly shaken, she tells her nephew that she saw her life pass before her eyes. Perhaps, in some strange sense, like the workings of divine grace, it is Mona herself who has electrified this woman, made her take stock of her own existence. And so we watch Mona (or is it Justine?) stumble from place to place, from pointless guy to pointless guy. We have already seen her dead body. It makes her seem like a dead woman walking. But all these people she meets: aren’t they heading the same way? Aren’t they all dead people walking, talking, and training themselves not to think about the future? An unmissable film from this great director."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/28/patrick-review-beattie-edmondson","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-28T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Patrick review – ​puppy romcom leaves Beattie Edmondson to scoop up mess","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/28/patrick-review-beattie-edmondson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/28/patrick-review-beattie-edmondson","fields":{"headline":"Patrick review – ​puppy romcom leaves Beattie Edmondson to scoop up mess","bodyText":"Beattie Edmondson is the tremendous comic performer who made her name in the BBC’s excellent flatshare sitcom Josh, with Josh Widdicombe and Elis James; now, after some walk-on film parts in Bridget Jones’s Baby and Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie, she gets a quirky starring role in this sentimental and worryingly gag-free romantic comedy. She is Sarah, a klutzy singleton hopeless with relationships and everything else, who inherits an adorable pug called Patrick from her late grandmother. At first she loathes the dog but then grasps that by taking Patrick for walks in the park she gets to meet men, including a hunky vet (Ed Skrein) and a sensitive bloke (Tom Bennett). There’s a cameo for Edmondson’s mum, Jennifer Saunders. An awful lot depends on the awwww effect of those closeups on the pug’s face. If you think that the dog is overwhelmingly lovable then this will supercharge the film with a feelgood factor over and above anything attributable to the script or performances. To be honest I did quite like Patrick, but maybe not every bit as much as I was supposed to. Some of the plot turns on the idea of one of Sarah’s suitors being not quite as nice as initially assumed – but then he shows himself to be nice after all. And Sarah has to be absolutely thrilled at the idea of living on a houseboat, which is unlikely to say the least. It’s a film jam-packed with very good actors and big names, and suffused with a puppyish willingness to please.

Jeremy Corbyn has used prime minister’s questions to repeatedly mock Theresa May about her cabinet divisions on Brexit, saying the splits and indecision are putting thousands of jobs at risk. May has defended her party’s record on tackling anti-Muslim prejudice, after a leading organisation accused the Conservatives of “turning a blind eye” to Islamophobia. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) wrote to party chairman Brandon Lewis, renewing its demand for a wide-ranging inquiry, after receiving no formal response to its call for an investigation last month. Asked about this at PMQs, May said: Anti-Muslim discrimination is wrong. There is no place for it in our society. That’s why, when I was home secretary, I required the police to specifically record anti-Muslim hate crime, so that we could understand better what was happening and better tackle the issue. Within the party, we’ve introduced a new code of conduct. We investigate any allegations of Islamophobia that are made relating to members of the party. Those are investigated, action is taken, and in some cases members have been suspended or expelled from the party as a result. Tony Blair, the former prime minister, has said the EU should change its migration policy to enable the UK to remain a member. (See 2.15pm.) Britain’s bid for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to attribute blame for attacks in Syria has been backed by the international community. As the Press Association reports, the UK’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Peter Wilson, who is also Britain’s permanent representative to the OPCW, said the measure was passed by an “overwhelming” majority of 82 to 24. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, has announced that he is resigning after seven years in the job. Britain’s chief financial watchdog has warned that contracts worth trillions of pounds between UK and European Union banks remain at risk of collapse following Brexit, after Brussels’ failure to implement protective legislation. As Phillip Inman reports, in a warning to EU officials that time is running out before next March to devise rules for EU banks, the Bank of England’s financial policy committee (FPC) said £29tn worth of contracts could be declared void. Derivatives contracts, which provide banks and corporations with protection from interest rate rises, could come to an end without fresh legislation from the UK and EU, the committee said in its latest quarterly health check on Britain’s financial services industry. A claim by Philip Hammond that the government profited by selling off Lloyds Banking Group shares has been questioned by Whitehall’s spending watchdog, which has calculated a loss to taxpayers of nearly £6bn. Damian Hinds, the education secretary, has said he will rely on grammar school bosses who choose to expand to be “true to their word” and admit more poor pupils. Giving evidence to the Commons education committee, he was asked to justify the government’s decision to earmark millions of pounds to allow selective schools in England to create more places. As the Press Association reports, grammars that bid for the cash - available in 2018/19 - will have to submit plans setting out the action they will take to boost the numbers of poorer pupils they admit. Asked what sanctions would be imposed on schools that did expand, but failed to take in more pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, Hinds replied: Generally speaking, I take at their word headteachers, school governors and so on and regard them as honest people who, when they say they will do something, plan to do it. George Hamilton, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, has told MPs that he feels “in the dark” about how Brexit will affect Northern Ireland. Edinburgh is poised to become the first city in the UK to introduce a special levy on tourists as it struggles to cope with a surge in visitors. Environmental campaigners and clean air groups have warned that the government’s green credentials are in tatters after a flurry of “disastrous decisions” that they say will be condemned by future generations. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Gary Gibbon, the Channel 4 News political editor, has written a very good post on his blog about the government’s forthcoming Brexit white paper. Do read the whole thing, but here’s an excerpt. Cabinet members who aren’t on the specialist sub-committee that’s supposed to be guiding Brexit negotiations got a sneak preview of the emerging Brexit policy yesterday just before full cabinet. The UK official leading the Brexit negotiations, Olly Robbins, introduced some slides. Beside him were Gavin Barwell, the PM’s chief of staff and the UK representative to the EU, Tim Barrow. Ministers were told that after the European council next week and factoring in Brussels summer holidays, there are now only “six weeks left” of negotiating time before the October summit at which negotiations are meant to be concluded. Ministers at this briefing came away with a real sense that “time is running out,” one present told me. They also came away with the impression that the document to be put in front of all ministers next week may well lay out “options” on how to deal with the issue of regulating British goods. But ministers are not necessarily being asked to choose between those options. Olly Robbins, it seems, is attempting to get ministerial licence to pursue a series of approaches ranging from a Norway-style rule-taking approach to those with more sovereignty but less access to EU markets. There’s bound to be suspicion that only one of these approaches – the one outlining what is effectively a Norway style approach with the UK in the single market for manufactured goods and agricultural goods – is the one the EU27 would be most likely to engage with. Security and intelligence co-operation between Britain and the EU will suffer as a result of Brexit, a former Nato secretary general has warned. Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, a former Labour defence secretary, said both the UK and the remaining EU 27 would find themselves in a “disadvantageous” position following Britain’s withdrawal. Speaking to the Policy Exchange think tank in London, he said the UK was now paying the price in the Brexit negotiations for its past insistence on excluding European partners from its intelligence-sharing relationships with countries such as the United States. As a result, EU negotiators were now seeking to exclude Britain from programmes such as the Galileo communications satellite and the European arrest warrant, he said. He explained: Now it is being turned against us. People are saying, ‘Hang on, you are out of the club, you’re therefore not going to share in that’. So there is going to be a reduction in the effectiveness of the intelligence gathering that is being done at a European Union level and some of the institutions, like the European arrest warrant, that have proved to this country to be hugely valuable. These are the realities, the chickens that are coming home to roost now. We are going to find ourselves in a disadvantageous position. It is not necessarily a pretty picture for us, nor is it for some of our European allies. The institutions that we helped to create and protect in some ways, we are not going to be part of and that will be disadvantageous to our countries. Elections to Labour’s national executive committee normally receive a modest amount of media coverage. But in years of covering politics, I don’t think I’ve ever read an article about elections to the Conservative party’s national conservative convention board, which is roughly equivalent, but less powerful. Until now. PoliticsHome’s Emilio Casalicchio has written a long read on this year’s contest and it sheds light on one of the more obscure elections in national politics. Here is an excerpt. Voting for each of the five positions takes place online through a website based in eastern Europe. The irony of the Tories holding an online ballot when they refuse to allow trade unions to do the same over strikes is not lost. Limiting the electorate to just association, area and regional chairs (plus the deputies of the latter two) might mean equal association representation across the country, but it means a very private contest takes place. There are somewhere between 700 and 1,000 eligible voters - depending on who you speak to. There are no websites or Facebook campaigns to appeal to wider membership, and candidates aren’t even allowed an email list. They get to upload their leaflet to the voting site, but if they really want it to be seen they send it out by post. A parliamentary committee is to be asked to consider concerns over the refusal of the Vote Leave campaigns director, Dominic Cummings, to appear before MPs. As the Press Association reports, Cummings was ordered to commit to appearing before the culture committee by June 20, but has not done so. Addressing the Commons, Speaker John Bercow said there would be a motion to refer the refusal of Cummings to the committee of privileges. Bercow told MPs: I wish to inform the House that I have received a letter from the Leader of the House seeking precedence to move a motion to refer to the committee of privileges the refusal of Mr Dominic Cummings to attend a meeting of the select committee on digital, culture, media and sport in defiance of the order of the House of 7th June. I am happy to accede to that request and I will invite the leader to move such a motion as the first business tomorrow, Thursday 28th June, after any urgent questions or statements. The committee is likely to find Cummings in contempt of parliament, and MPs may end up voting on a motion to this effect. But the House of Commons no longer has the power to punish people for contempt of parliament and so any vote would just amount to a verbal reprimand. Here is the full text of the globalisation speech that Tony Blair delivered at lunchtime. In his Q&amp;A at the end, Blair said the Brexit vote was a response to “Europe-wide” problems and that the best option would be for the EU to come up with a new migration policy that would allow the UK to “stay in with dignity”. He said: The sensible thing, maybe this is too rational a view, is for Europe to recognise Brexit represented a feeling that was not specific or exclusive to Britain. That is what all these elections have show in the past few months. This is a Europe-wide feeling, it is just Britain just had a referendum, so the sensible thing is for Europe to review its decisions and come to a view about reform in Europe, particularly over these issues of migration, and for Britain to be made an offer that allows us to to stay in with dignity. Blair said the government had not even resolved what it wanted from Brexit. What we cannot have is a situation in which Britain goes out of Europe at the end of March 2019 and does not know what it is getting. I think the government wants to do that, I am afraid, because they have no answer to the central dilemma of the negotiations as you can see from the cabinet. They do not seem to be bound by cabinet or Chatham House rules. One lot wants to keep close to Europe and that would mean regulatory alignment, so the debate becomes “what is the point?” and the other one wants to go for a clean break Brexit in which case those warnings from Airbus become very real, and the debate becomes “what is the prize?” That division has not been resolved. They have not begun negotiating with Europe. And he restated his call for a “meaningful vote” on the final agreement. A meaningful vote should be meaningful in the sense that we know what this new relationship entails. To go out of Europe without knowing what the future is would be a catastrophe for the country. You would be out of Europe without no bargaining power and these Brexit guys could take us in any direction, and we would have no power to retrieve the situation ... The best the Brexiteers now say about Brexit is that it is not as bad as you guys say. You go round the world and there is nobody saying “that is a really sensible thing you have done”. There is no one. A group of Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green Party MEPs have joined forces in a letter to business secretary Greg Clark urging to take heed of the warning by Airbus and others over industry leaders over Brexit. They say they believe the scale of the difficulties for business could be worse than publicised because of non-disclosure agreements companies have been asked to sign in their discussions with government. They also refer to the job losses from the move of the European Medicines Agency, that employs around 900 staff, and the European Banking Authority to Amsterdam and Paris. They say: As cross party MEPs, this warning chimes with the narrative that multi-sector businesses have brought to us since the referendum. Manufacturing is particularly vulnerable to any form of Brexit that sees the UK outside of the single market and customs union, which helps companies comply with rules of origin and brings regulatory equivalence and duty free zones. This news from Airbus follows news that Jaguar Land Rover are reducing their operations in the UK, while Unilever have announced that they will move their HQ to Rotterdam. Moreover, there will be significant jobs losses with the moving of the European Medicines Agency and European Banking Authority out of the UK. You will also be aware that a number of companies appear to have been asked to sign non-disclosure agreements in their discussions with government, and so we suspect the scale of the difficulties facing business and industry following the Brexit vote is much larger than is publicly acknowledged. The letter was signed by 16 MEPs including Labour’s Seb Dance and Claude Moraes, Conservative’s Julie Girling and Charles Tannock, Catherine Beader, a Liberal Democrat and Keith Taylor and Molly Cato for the Greens. Plaid Cymru’s Jill Evans, who is concerned about Airbus plants in north and south Wales, and the SNP’s Alyn Smith are also signatories. Doctors have called for the public to have a final vote on the Brexit deal, warning Britain’s departure from the EU poses a “major threat” to health, the Press Association reports. The PA story goes on: A motion calling for a “people’s vote” on the terms of any agreement was passed at the British Medical Association (BMA) annual meeting in Brighton. Brexit could damage the NHS, patient care and will be “bad for Britain’s health”, delegates heard. Dr Paul Williams, a GP and Labour MP, said support for the motion was “a sign of the growing momentum behind the People’s Vote campaign”. The Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Midwives have also recently supported calls for the public to have a final say on Brexit. The motion called for the BMA “to oppose Brexit as a whole”, support the UK remaining in the single market, and publicly state concerns that Brexit “poses a major threat to the NHS and the nation’s health”. It also said the BMA should “support the idea of the public having a final say on the Brexit deal, now that more is known regarding the potential impact of Brexit on the NHS and the nation’s health”. Dr William Sapwell, who proposed the motion, said the BMA should use its reputation to inform public debate “for the good of the nation’s health”. “The fact is that the government is woefully underprepared to ensure the United Kingdom’s health and well-being is secure in time for the self-imposed deadline of March 29 2019,” he told delegates. “Brexit is bad for Britain’s health, let’s put that on the side of a big red bus and once we have made that clear, the public should vote on the deal.” Dr John Chisholm, of the BMA’s medical ethics committee, branded Brexit “a disastrous act of national self-harm”. The EU is better for “health, the NHS, public health, research, science, universities, access to pharmaceuticals and international co-operation in research”, he told delegates. “We need to speak out about the damage Brexit will do to our patients and to healthcare professionals,” he added. However Dr Robert Harwood, chairman of the BMA consultants committee, warned a “hard-edged” political opinion on Brexit could mean the organisation was isolated from the debate. Responding to the vote, Dr Williams said: “Nobody voted to damage the NHS in 2016, but already Brexit is causing severe problems in staff recruitment and retention. “Instead of the 350 million a week for the NHS we were promised by the Brexiters, we have had cuts and closures as the NHS loses staff and struggles with budgets that are limited by the Brexit economic squeeze. “If Brexit actually happens, it seems certain it will only make things worse - with new drug treatments, investment in research and sustainable funding all under threat. “The BMA, which represents 160,000 doctors in this country, knows all this better than anyone.” This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs on Twitter. There is a bit more praise for Corbyn than for May, but that’s not saying much. Quite a few people seem to think we were in “nul points” territory. From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From the Guardian’s Peter Walker From the Yorkshire Post’s Arj Singh From the Daily Mirror’s Jason Beattie From the Guardian’s Heather Stewart From Politico Europe’s Tom McTague From the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh From the Daily Record’s Torcuil Crichton From the Daily Mirror’s Kevin Maguire From the Guardian’s Claire Phipps From ITV’s Alastair Stewart From the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn From the Independent’s John Rentoul My colleague Dan Sabbagh has posted this from the post-PMQs lobby briefing. In his contributions at PMQs Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, asked about Brexit. Here is the write-up from the PoliticsHome blog. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford says the government is failing to listen to business on Brexit. He wants to know why thousands of car manufacturing jobs are “disposable”. The PM insists the government has been listening to business over Brexit. She notes points at which the government conceded to the business view on a number of points over Brexit. She hits out at the SNP for refusing to back the government on Heathrow. Blackford accuses the PM of failing to answer the question. He turns to the SNP demand to stay in the single market. He wants to know if the PM has completed any economic analysis on the possibility of keeping the UK in the single market and customs union. The PM says foreign investment remained good last year, and she urges Blackford to listen to calls from Scottish business to keep Scotland in the UK. Tim Loughton, a Conservative, asks if the government will back an amendment to his private member’s bill to extend civil partnerships to everyone to implement the judgment of the supreme court this morning. May says the government is reviewing civil partnerships and backs Loughton’s bill. Labour’s Ian Austin asks what the government is doing to tackle the CO2 shortage. A brewery in his constituency has had to stop making beer. May says this is mainly an issue for the industry, but the government has been in touch to see what it can do. Marcus Fysh, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that the welcome allocation of more money for the NHS will not crowd out money for other departments. May says all these issues will be considered in the spending review. May says, not only will she fly the England flag at Downing Street every time the team is playing during this World Cup, she will do the same when the women’s team are playing next year. Johnny Mercer, a Conservative, asks May if she is committed to the UK remaining a tier one military nation. May says she is absolutely committed to ensuring the UK remains “a leading military power”. But the government will look at what it needs to do to respond to changing threats. PMQs - Snap verdict: Often at PMQs, as David Cameron explains well in a recent book, the open goals turn out to be the hardest ones. Corbyn arrived in the chamber with headlines about government disarray abounding. But, despite some perfectly good questions, he never really threw May off her stride and it felt very much like an uninspiring draw. As usual, Corbyn’s problem was his failure to be able to come back with a good follow-up. It was obvious that May would respond to his first question by saying that she backed business, but instead of coming back with evidence to rubbish this, he moved on another (in itself, perfectly sound) question, about a no deal Brexit. She sidestepped that question completely, but Corbyn did not pursue the topic. He had a good line on no deal at the end - no deal is a bad deal - but at no point did his line of questioning ever particularly discomfort May. (Labour’s Mary Creagh has just given a good example of how it can be done, telling May that Johnson’s comment - the “fuck” one, although she did not need to say it herself - expressed very pithily what Brexit would do for business). May was hardly impressive, and eager to change the subject at every opportunity (and her claim that Labour is doing everything it can in the Commons to frustrate Brexit will be a mystery to some who have followed the votes), but she stumbled through it all with the usual stolid fortitude. It was all very forgettable. UPDATE: Corbyn says Labour’s priority is protecting jobs. He quotes a Honda employee saying May will be responsible if his job is at risk. Did Andrea Leadsom speak for the government when she said the customs partnership plan was unwieldy? May says the government is looking at both options. Corbyn says Labour’s priority is delivering jobs. So why does every Labour government leave office with higher unemployment? Corbyn says that is rich from someone with 1m people on zero-hours contracts. He says the only customs option acceptable to the goverment is a no deal one. Ministers have been invited to a pyjama party at Chequers. He says May continues to promote the fallacy that no deal is better than a bad deal. But no deal is a bad deal. He says the real risk to jobs is a prime minister who is having to negotiate with her cabinet to stop it falling apart, instead of negotiating for jobs. May says she can summarise what the government is achieving, and she rattles off a list of what she is achieving. Britain will leave the EU on 29 March 2019, she says. Corbyn says Johnson did not back Heathrow either. But he did his bit for the air indusry by spending 14 hours in a plane for a 10-minute meeting. He quotes the head of BMW, employing 8,000 people in this country, needs to know the government’s plans for customs. Without clarity, they will have to implement contingency plans. He asks May how many more firms are telling May in private what Airbus and BMW are saying publicly? May says she is meeting business. She wants to ensure that trade with the EU is as frictionless as possible, while the UK can trade freely too. She says Labour would not back business; it would raise corporation tax by 7%. Corbyn says Jacob Rees-Mogg is relocating his hedge fund to Dublin. John Redwood is advising people not to invest in the UK. Will May ignore Johnson, listen to workers, and get an agreement that safeguards jobs. May says she is putting jobs at the heart of what she is doing. She says Corbyn was a Brexiteer himself through most of his career. So why he is trying to frustrate Brexit in this House? Jeremy Corbyn says he joins May is paying tribute to the armed forces. And we need to do more for veterans. On Brexit, he says Greg Clark thinks business is entitled to be listened to with respect. Boris Johnson takes a different view, using an Anglo-Saxon term. What is May’s view? May says this government and party has always been one that backs business. They are the backbone of our prosperity. If Corbyn wants to defend business, he must back business or overthrow capitalism; he can’t do both. Corbyn says he takes that as May rejecting Johnson’s approach. Airbus supports 110,000 jobs in the UK supply chain, many well paid and unionised. No deal would make the company reconsider its investments. Will May take the phoney threat of no deal off the table? May says, if Corbyn is that bothered about the aerospace industry, he should have backed Heathrow expansion. She says she does not normally agree with Len McCluskey, but on this she does; he says backing Heathrow expansion will ensure the UK remains a world leader in aerospace. May says she is looking at a number of issues relating to Northern Ireland. She hopes to visit in the next few weeks. Labour’s Helen Goodman says we all celebrate the contribution of the armed forces. She says last year May said no school would face a cut in budget. But schools in her constituency are having their budgets cut, she says. May says she is putting more money into schools. The fairer funding formula will help the schools that have lost out the most. Theresa May starts by saying it is armed forces week. And on Saturday MPs will be marking armed forces day. And today is reserves’ day. She pays tribute to reservists, including MPs who do that role. This is from the Mirror’s Ben Glaze. This is from the Press Association’s Richard Wheeler. It is 11 years to the day since Tony Blair did his last ever PMQs, says Tom Hamilton, co-author of a good new book about PMQs. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the running order. Here is a statement from Theresa May on the resignation of Andrew RT Davies. She said: Under Andrew’s leadership, the Welsh Conservatives have provided a strong opposition to Labour in Cardiff Bay and a strong voice for the people of Wales, both at home and in Westminster. It was a pleasure to join Andrew and the rest of the team at the Welsh Conservative conference last month. I know he will continue to be a passionate champion for the people of South Wales Central in the Assembly, as he has been for more than a decade – and will continue to speak up for the best interests of Wales as we leave the European Union and forge a new role for the whole United Kingdom on the world stage. In a written ministerial statement Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, has announced that the government is partially relaxing its ban on arms sales to Argentina. He explains: Under [extra restrictions imposed in 2012] it has been the British government’s policy not to grant an export licence for any military or dual-use goods and technology being supplied to military end-users in Argentina, except in exceptional circumstances. Our general position now will be to continue to refuse licences for export and trade of goods judged to enhance Argentine military capability. However, where like-for-like equipment is no longer available, we may grant licences where we judge they are not detrimental to the UK’s defence and security interests. In a speech yesterday Greg Clark, the business secretary, urged businesses to make the case for a soft Brexit. He even suggested he would like services to remain in some form of the single market. The Daily Telegraph and the Times have both given Clark’s comments front page treatment - in the Telegraph’s case, with some critical spin. Steve Baker, a Brexit minister, may have had Clark in mind when he posted this on Twitter this morning. As the Telegraph’s Peter Foster reports, the European Services Forum, a group representing European service industries, has written to Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, saying that a 21-month transition period probably won’t be long enough and that arrangements should be put in place to extend it. Here is the key extract from the letter. Based on our experience of trade negotiations, we are concerned that - even with the strongest political will from both sides - a period of 21 months is unlikely to be sufficient to cover all the stages needed to put in place the future relationship (completion of negotiations, agreement in principle, legal scrub of agreed texts, signature, ratification and implementation). We therefore call on negotiators to provide clarity as soon as possible on the withdrawal agreement and to allow for some flexibility in the management and duration of the transition period included therein. The letter also says that, while the Brexit talks have recently focused on trade issues relating to goods (ie, customs), services are essential, representing 74% of EU GDP and 80% of UK GDP. And it also says that goods and services are more closely linked than people often assume; according to the Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database, 37% of the value of UK total export of goods is in fact derived from “goods-related services”. And here is the formal letter from Andrew RT Davies announcing his resignation as leader of the Conservative group in the Welsh assembly. More on the Andrew RT Davies resignation. Carwyn Jones, the Labour Welsh first minister, has described Andrew RT Davies as a “decent and honest politician” in a tribute to him. This is from ITV Cymru’s Adrian Masters. And here is a tribute from Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary. Here is our latest story, from my colleagues Jessica Elgot and Pippa Crerar, on cabinet feuding. The BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has written a good blog on the state of play within the Conservative party. Here’s an excerpt. One minister told me it’s like a bad 45 year marriage: “We’ve stayed together for the sake of the kids, given birth to Brexit which is now ready to leave home and we’re fighting now over who gets what.” A former senior minister said, “it’s just broken”, suggesting that the Cabinet does not understand how bad the situation really is. “They are completely out of touch.” they said, blaming the prime minister’s desire to keep everyone on side on Brexit for the boiling tensions, “Everyone leaves the room thinking she has agreed with them. It’s corrosive. You can argue it out to come to a position but she just won’t.” Her deputy, John Pienaar, was even more outspoken when discussing this on the Today programme this morning. This is a long, long, long way from strong and stable [leadership] ... This is so far from strong and stable government that it is much more like a pub in rough neighbourhood at closing time. Pienaar also said that a minister told him recently that, if Theresa May tried to resign, they would “nail her into her office” because there was nobody else who could hold the party together. This is from Mark Reckless, the former Conservative MP who defected to Ukip, was elected to the Welsh assembly as a Ukip AM after losing his Westminster seat and who subsequently left Ukip and joined the Conservative group in the assembly. Here is Andrew RT Davies’s resignation statement. The leader of the Welsh Conservative, Andrew RT Davies, has resigned, the BBC reports. Davies, who is strongly pro-Brexit, was widely criticised in the party after he accused Airbus, which employs more than 6,000 people in Wales, of exaggerating the threat posed by Brexit. Guto Bebb, the defence minister and MP for Aberconwy, said Davies’s comments were “inflammatory”. David Gauke, the justice secretary, was also on the Today programme this morning. Asked about Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, declaring “fuck business” at a private Foreign Office event, Gauke said: The point I would make is that business drives wealth and prosperity in this country, so I think we should listen to what business has to say and engage with business. Business is hugely important to us, and I certainly don’t think anyone should be dismissive. This was, as I understand it, a throwaway remark at a drinks reception, and probably not wise, but I wouldn’t read any more into it than that. On the Today programme this morning Ed Vaizey, the Conservative former minister, described Liz Truss’s comments about Michael Gove in her speech last night as a “full frontal assault”. He said: It was, although light-hearted, a pretty full frontal assault. I think Liz Truss has achieved what she wanted to achieve, which is re-positioning herself and getting herself much more noticed than perhaps she has been in the past. It’s PMQs today and, with so much evidence of cabinet disunity in the news, Jeremy Corbyn is probably at this very moment having a tough job trying to work out how to cover it all in just six questions. The BBC has been almost leading this morning on the news that Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told a pointed joke about Michael Gove, the environment secretary. Given all the other blue-on-blue target practice taking place at the moment, this is about the least serious example, although the fact that Truss, a relative lightweight who only has “attending cabinet” status feels free to get in on the act perhaps says something about how completely discipline has broken down. Politico Europe’s Jack Blanchard has a good round-up of all the intra-cabinet feuding on his morning email. More on that later. First, though, Brexit, and there is a report (pdf) out this morning from the Commons public accounts committee on the cost of leaving the EU. Remember the government said the cost of leaving would be up to £39bn? The committee says the full cost will be at least £10bn higher. Here is the key paragraph, The Treasury’s estimate of the cost of the financial settlement does not include at least £10bn of costs to the government associated with the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. The Treasury has not included nearly £3bn of payments the UK will make to the European Development Fund, the EU’s main way of providing overseas development aid, after withdrawal. It also excludes an estimated £7.2bn of EU funding that will go directly to UK private sector bodies, which the Treasury has deducted from its estimate of the settlement. Its estimate also does not include parts of the withdrawal agreement that are still to be negotiated which could have associated costs, such as how to deal with the taxation of goods dispatched from the UK during the transition period but do not arrive in the EU until after 2020. The Treasury believe any such costs will be small. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Damian Hinds, the education secretary, gives evidence to the Commons education committee. 9.30am: George Hamilton, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, gives evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12pm: Tony Blair, the former prime minister, gives a speech on globalisation. As Patrick Wintour reports, he will say a return to the dark politics of the 1930s is no longer far-fetched today because of rampant nationalist populism and the widespread rejection of multilateral alliances. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another at the end of the day. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Truss’s speech at the London School of Economics, which criticised overregulation, took aim at Gove’s environmental policies on plastic straws and wood-burning stoves, and came as cabinet ministers also publicly rebuked each other over business leaders’ Brexit warnings. On Wednesday, Ed Vaizey, the former culture minister, took aim at Truss and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. Johnson is under fire for leaving the country during the vote on Heathrow expansion and for a quip at a reception where he is alleged to have said “fuck business” when asked about corporations’ concerns over Brexit. In her speech on Tuesday night, Truss criticised demands by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, for more cash for his department. “We have to recognise that it’s not macho just to demand more money. It’s much tougher to demand better value and challenge the blob of vested interests within your department,” she said. The chief secretary to the Treasury said the government’s role should “not be to tell us what our tastes should be”, adding: “Too often we’re hearing about not drinking too much, eating too many doughnuts or enjoying the warm glow of our wood-burning Goves – I mean stoves. “I can see their point: there’s enough hot air and smoke at the environment department already.” Vaizey said the speech was light-hearted and suggested that Truss was hoping for promotion. “If anyone can take it on the chin, it’s probably Michael Gove,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “If you’re deciding which side of the argument to fall on, protecting our seas and oceans or overregulation, I think most of the public will fall down on Michael Gove’s side. “Liz Truss has achieved what she wanted to achieve, which is to reposition herself and getting herself much more noticed than perhaps she has been in the past.” Vaizey, a close ally of the environment secretary, hinted at backbench frustration with the manoeuvring. “One sees a whole spectrum of approaches from members of the cabinet as we come the final conclusion of Brexit, when it comes to how they position themselves,” he said. The business secretary, Greg Clark, also joined the fray in a speech on Tuesday, setting out a vision for soft Brexit that would keep a form of single market access for goods and for services, stressing the importance of labour mobility. “The business voice puts evidence before ideology and brings the actual experience of trading with Europe and the rest of the world, not a theoretical view of what the world might be like,” he told the Times CEO summit, in comments aimed squarely at Johnson and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Over the weekend, Hunt said it was “completely inappropriate” for businesses such as Airbus to threaten to cut jobs over Brexit disruption. The justice secretary, David Gauke, also criticised Johnson on Wednesday morning, telling the BBC that his colleague’s remark about business was “probably not wise”. “Business is hugely important to us and I certainly don’t think anyone should be dismissive,” he said. The prime minister was forced to use her speech at the summit to smooth over the cabinet attacks on business leaders. “A Conservative government will always listen to your voice,” she said. “It’s right that business makes its voice heard.” May will attempt to bring her warring cabinet together, to finally agree the Brexit white paper to set out the government’s vision for future trading arrangements, at a summit at her Chequers country retreat on 6 July. The long-awaited paper will then be published on 9 July. The full cabinet will attend, which has alarmed some Brexiter ministers who believe there is a soft-Brexit majority in the cabinet, unlike the inner Brexit subcommittee, which is more finely balanced. Most concerned is Johnson, who was given the cold shoulder by the cabinet on Tuesday after outbursts over Brexit and flying to Afghanistan to avoid a crunch vote on Heathrow expansion. Senior Tories have privately suggested that in recent weeks he may have lost the support of backbenchers, who pick the final two in any leadership contest, and with it any chance of succeeding May. Vaizey was also critical of the foreign secretary on Wednesday, intimating that many backbenchers did not want further prevaricating on Brexit. “The frustrating thing for me is every time the prime minister makes progress with Brexit, members of the cabinet … those who might have recently gone to Afghanistan, for example, set out completely alternative versions, which having climbed up the ladder, then sends us back down the snake,” he said. “My instinct as a backbenchers is that we want the prime minister and the party to unite behind one position and that includes senior members of the cabinet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/25/pantera-drummer-vinnie-paul","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T10:52:08Z","webTitle":"Pantera drummer and co-founder Vinnie Paul: ' I wouldn’t want my funeral to be a sad, sappy thing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/25/pantera-drummer-vinnie-paul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/25/pantera-drummer-vinnie-paul","fields":{"headline":"Vinnie Paul: the Pantera drummer whose mission was to have a 'goddamn good time'","bodyText":"Asked in 2013 which music he would like to be played at his funeral, Pantera drummer and co-founder Vinnie Paul said: “I’d really want to choose an album that was a goddamn good time, like fuckin’ Guns N’ Roses. I’d want people to celebrate what we’ve done and the fact that we’d had a great life. I wouldn’t want my funeral to be a sad, sappy thing.” His sentiment echoes the prevailing theme of his career as a musician: that life is about having fun. He and his late brother “Dimebag” Darrell Abbott made this nothing less than their mission. Vincent Paul Abbott, known simply as Vinnie Paul, was born in Abilene, Texas, on 11 March 1964, to Carolyn and Jerry Abbott, the latter a country music performer and producer. He attended Arlington High School and began learning the drums as a child, prompted by his love of Kiss’s 1975 album Alive! At the age of 17, he formed Pantera and invited his younger brother Abbott to join on guitar. The band, which initially featured singer Donnie Hart, guitarist Terry Glaze and bassist Tommy Bradford, played glam-metal, adopting a poodle-haired look in complete contrast to their later, more heavyweight material and image. Bradford was soon replaced by Rex Brown, and four Pantera albums were self-released on the band’s own Metal Magic label. The last of these, Power Metal – released in 1988 and featuring new singer Philip Anselmo – gained the attention of Atco Records executive Mark Ross, who recommended the band to his label. Pantera’s first album for Atco was Cowboys from Hell (1990), a title that explained their ethos perfectly. A band who took the idea of partying to its logical conclusion, Pantera rapidly gained an American and international fanbase after successful shows in support of established metal acts such as Judas Priest and Metallica. Vulgar Display of Power (1992) was the definitive Pantera statement, containing songs that have since defined the modern metal canon such as Mouth for War, A New Level and Walk. Abbott was a world-class guitarist, astounding audiences with his extravagant solos, while Paul evolved an incredibly powerful drum sound. He achieved a trademark “clicky” sound for his bass drums by taping a coin to the spot on the drum head where the beater struck, a sound that has become ubiquitous in metal. Far Beyond Driven (1994), The Great Southern Trendkill (1996) and Reinventing the Steel (2000) continued to spread Pantera’s message, with video releases chronicling the band’s chaotic, debauched tours, but relationships began to deteriorate between Anselmo and the Abbott brothers by the end of the decade. The band effectively split in 2001, with all members launching new projects shortly after. Paul and Abbott formed a new band, Damageplan, and released the New Found Power album in 2004. Hopes among fans that Pantera might reform were dashed permanently when a delusional fan named Nathan Gale murdered Abbott on stage at the Alrosa Villa venue in Columbus, Ohio, on 8 December 2004. Gale, who was shot dead at the scene by police, also killed three other crew and audience members. Paul did not return to the public eye until 2006, when he formed a new band, Hellyeah. Over the next decade the group released five albums and toured the world, but fans and journalists never stopped asking him if he would consider forming a new line-up of Pantera, perhaps with Abbott’s friend and fellow virtuoso Zakk Wylde on guitar. He was adamant that no such line-up would ever be formed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/25/football-transfer-rumours-kylian-mbappe-on-his-way-to-manchester","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T07:37:04Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Kylian Mbappé on his way to Manchester?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/25/football-transfer-rumours-kylian-mbappe-on-his-way-to-manchester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/25/football-transfer-rumours-kylian-mbappe-on-his-way-to-manchester","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Kylian Mbappé on his way to Manchester?","bodyText":"Paris St-Germain are already committed to spending £166m this summer to make Kylian Mbappé’s transfer from Monaco permanent, but rumours that they might be forced to squirm out of the deal at the last minute have got several other deep-pocketed clubs excited. Apparently the French side could be sucked into some kind of financial fair play-related quagmire over the summer and the chaos it causes would be so overwhelming that they will have to cancel the Mbappé deal, allowing Manchester United or Manchester City to sneak in and steal the fleet-footed youngster away. The offer United are considering would involve Anthony Martial heading to Monaco along with a cheque for some £86m – though they might have to come up with another plan if Martial moves to Juventus beforehand, with the Frenchman rumoured to be discussing personal terms – while City, the very model of financial fair play themselves, would probably be able to find that kind of loose change lying around somewhere. City are also ready to push through the signing of Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez, but the player is unexpectedly stalling the deal while he negotiates a so-called loyalty bonus with his current club. Apparently they believe he doesn’t merit one because he demanded the transfer, he believes he does merit one because he later withdrew his transfer request, hence the current grumpy stand-off. Eden Hazard is so keen to move to Real Madrid that his father, Thierry, contacted the Spaniards before the Champions League final to offer them his son’s services. They are yet to make a move but according to Marca it could still happen, particularly if they fail to sign Neymar and decide to sell Gareth Bale. In other English/Spanish news the new Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has been pestering Argentina’s Ever Banega with phone calls in an attempt to lure the Sevilla midfielder to London. Everton want to spruce up their own midfield by signing Chelsea’s Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere, both of whom could be forced out of their London clubs in search of more gametime. The former might be available only on loan while the latter can be signed for free, and Marco Silva is keen on having them both. He seems less keen on having Morgan Schneiderlin, who could soon move to Marseille, or for that matter Ashley Williams and Yannick Bolasie. According to Spanish outlet Sport, Barcelona and Real Madrid are set to battle for the services of Thiago Alcântara, who Bayern Munich are ready to sell for €70m. Barcelona are also keen on PSV’s World Cup-starring Mexico starlet Hirving Lozano but will sell Yerry Mina, Colombia’s giant goalscoring centre-back, with Mundo Deportivo revealing their doubts about his tactical understanding and Real Betis said to be keen. Borussia Dortmund, Fenerbahce or a number of English sides could also swoop for the 23-year-old. Newcastle’s Matt Ritchie could return to his previous club, Bournemouth, as part of a deal that sends the £20m-rated Josh King in the other direction. Yasin Ben El-Mhanni will soon leave Tyneside with Watford, Wolves and Leeds all keen to keep him in England and Sporting hoping to lure the winger to Portugal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/25/countrywide-property-sales-uk-estate-agency-profit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T08:05:08Z","webTitle":"Countrywide seeks fresh funding as property sales slide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/25/countrywide-property-sales-uk-estate-agency-profit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/25/countrywide-property-sales-uk-estate-agency-profit","fields":{"headline":"Countrywide seeks fresh funding as property sales slide","bodyText":"Shares in Britain’s biggest estate agent, Countrywide Properties, have plunged 25% after it issued its fourth profit warning in eight months and called on shareholders to raise fresh funds to cut its debt. Countrywide, the company behind Hamptons, Bairstow Eves, Taylors and Gascoigne-Pees, has been hit hard by a downturn in the housing market in London and the south-east, a botched revamp of the business and growing competition from new online firms such as Purplebricks. The shares fell to a new low of 59p after the warning; four years ago they were trading at more than 600p. “The market in the first half has continued to be subdued and we have experienced longer transaction cycles,” the group said. “As previously announced, the group entered 2018 with our sales pipeline significantly below that of 2017.” Countrywide said adjusted profits in the first half would be about £20m lower than a year ago and the shortfall would not be made up in the second half of the year. The firm is forecasting adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, deprecation and amortisation (Ebitda) of £8.1m for the first half, and £44.7m for the full year – below City forecasts of £51.4m. In 2017 it made profits of £67.4m in what it described as a disappointing year, against £83.5m in 2016. Countrywide wants to cut its debts of £192m by at least half by raising extra capital. It said its largest shareholder, the private equity firm Oaktree, and its lenders were backing the plans. Peter Long leads the company as executive chairman after the chief executive, Alison Platt, who had run the firm since 2014, resigned days after the January profit warning. He announced a “back to basics” recovery plan in March, which included cutting head office staff numbers by a third, the equivalent of 150 jobs. Many senior staff have left in recent years as a result of Countrywide’s decision to shut 200 branches and merge its lettings and sales businesses, hitting its mid-market London business in particular. Under Platt, the group was centralised and branch managers lost the autonomy to recruit, to market locally and to price to win business. Long, the former boss of Europe’s largest travel firm Tui, is seeking to reverse these moves and reshape the group by empowering regional and branch managers. He has called for senior branch staff who left during the Platt years to come back. The register of properties available for sale is broadly back to 2017 levels, up 9% since the start of the year. Demand in the property market has been hit by higher stamp duty and Britain’s vote to leave the EU two years ago. House prices have been falling in London and parts of southern England, but are still rising elsewhere in the UK. Countrywide said there was no update on the search for a new chief executive. Long has been criticised for the number of boardroom positions he holds. As well as running Countrywide, he is deputy chairman of Tui, and chairman of Royal Mail and Spanish leisure park operator Parques Reunidos Servicios Centrales. He is also president of the Family Holiday Association. Anthony Codling, an analyst at Jefferies, believes Countrywide may seek to raise about £125m from investors to cut debt and fund the turnaround plan. “The underlying second-hand housing market is dreadful,” he said. “Even the online challengers are finding that they cannot outperform the current market conditions, and there is little to be done when homeowners stop moving.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/26/internship-scheme-complaints-include-inappropriate-trainer-behaviour","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"Internship scheme under fire for poor conditions and pay delays","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/internship-scheme-complaints-include-inappropriate-trainer-behaviour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/internship-scheme-complaints-include-inappropriate-trainer-behaviour","fields":{"headline":"Internship scheme under fire for poor conditions and pay delays","bodyText":"Two companies providing internships have been suspended and four training providers have had their contracts terminated, documents reveal, with jobseekers complaining of poor working conditions and delays in payment. Interns in the government-backed Prepare Train Hire (PaTH) scheme for jobseekers aged 17 to 24 said they had long waits for their $200 fortnightly incentive payments and in one case a worker said she had been left to work in 37C heat. The documents, released under freedom of information legislation by the jobs department, also showed one trainer had been sacked for suggesting an “inappropriate” overnight excursion. Jobseekers, employment providers and host companies were not named, but the documents showed concerns about compulsory employment skills training, with one jobseeker claiming it was targeted at people from non-English speaking backgrounds and his class had “watch[ed] a Mr Bean film and learn[ed] how to purchase capsicums”. Several others complained it was not appropriate for people with university-level qualifications. The PaTH internship scheme, introduced in the 2016 budget, uses subsidies to encourage employers to trial jobseekers in work placements of up to 25 hours a week after a course of job-readiness training. One complaint labelled “inappropriate trainer behaviour” states that a trainer approached two jobseekers about “going on an overnight excursion”. The jobs department document explained it was “not an endorsed part of the course” and the participants “felt the trainer had inappropriate intentions”. The skills training provider had investigated the matter and terminated the trainer’s contract, it said. One jobseeker called the jobs department “to express disappointment over her PaTH internship placement in a local cafe” because she felt she was “just used as a ‘dish pig’ and was left to wash dishes all day in a 37C room with no air conditioning”. The department’s customer services officer advised “this is not the objective of PaTH” but the worker chose not to make a formal complaint. Two complaints labelled “employment services provider misuse” detail claims that jobseekers had not received the $200-a-fortnight supplement, with delays of up to 12 weeks in receiving payment. Guardian Australia understands these complaints have been resolved. Three training companies have had their contracts terminated by consent since August 2017 and one more was terminated by the department owing to liquidation. Jeremy Poxon, a spokesman for the Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union, said complaints from jobseekers who had not received their $200 fortnightly payments were common. He cited a further example of a young person in Queensland being assisted by the AUWU whose eight-week internship had been terminated after six weeks and who had not yet received a $200 payment. “The $200 fortnightly payment is meant to be paid automatically with a jobseeker’s income support,” he said. Poxon said while jobseekers may not receive their $200 payments owing to “bureaucratic stuff-ups” it showed problems in the processes of accountability, with “grey areas” of responsibility between job agencies and the department to rectify payments. The Greens family and community services spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, said she had raised “major concerns about exploitation, churn, payments below minimum wage, and limited protections for participants” in the PaTH scheme. “It is clear these limited protections are now culminating in problems in the program demonstrated in the document provided by the department after an FoI request,” she said. “The complaints, particularly claims of sexual harassment, are incredibly concerning and demonstrate what we were always worried about, that those on the program would be exposed to mistreatment.” Siewert said the government had not provided enough detail on how it “will tackle these inevitable loopholes” and protect interns’ health and safety. The jobs minister, Michaelia Cash, said the government was “proud of its Youth PaTH programme” and said it was disappointing Labor and the Greens had opposed it. She said it was “delivering real results for young Australians right across the country”, including helping more than 20,000 people into work. “The department of jobs and small business closely monitors all internship placements to ensure program requirements are met,” she said, adding that: “2,847 businesses have taken interns under the PaTH program, of which two have been suspended for failing to meet the requirements of the program”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/25/emil-gayed-special-counsel-to-lead-inquiry-into-surgeon-accused-of-mutilating-women-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T10:46:59Z","webTitle":"Gynaecologist who mutilated women faces inquiry in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/emil-gayed-special-counsel-to-lead-inquiry-into-surgeon-accused-of-mutilating-women-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/emil-gayed-special-counsel-to-lead-inquiry-into-surgeon-accused-of-mutilating-women-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Gynaecologist who mutilated women faces inquiry in Australia","bodyText":"Health authorities in Australia have launched a major inquiry into a disgraced gynaecologist who mutilated and performed unnecessary operations on dozens of women over decades. One patient died after Dr Emil Shawky Gayed operated on her and failed to administer appropriate treatment. The New South Wales (NSW) Department of Health has announced that it has set up an independent special counsel investigation and a dedicated telephone line at each of the hospitals where the surgeon worked. It encouraged women affected by Gayed – who has been banned from practising for three years – to get in touch. What has become a burgeoning public health scandal in Australia’s most populous state follows an investigation by Guardian Australia into the conduct of Gayed at one of the hospitals where he worked in the regional town of Taree, 310km (190 miles) north of Sydney. Dozens of women in and around the mid-north NSW coastal town have sustained infections, psychological trauma and other complications because of treatment they received from Gayed at the Manning Rural Referral hospital. Gayed performed a hysterectomy on one woman even though she could have been offered treatment of painkillers and bed rest. The woman never consented to a hysterectomy, an investigation by the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) found. The NSW medical watchdog also found that Gayed needlessly removed a woman’s healthy right fallopian tube, and failed to realise another woman was pregnant when he performed an ablation procedure, which involves surgically destroying the lining of the uterus. Not only was the surgery unnecessary, but it can seriously harm a foetus. Instead of reporting the catastrophic error to hospital management, as required by protocol, Gayed paid for the woman to go to a Sydney clinic for an abortion, by which time she was 20 weeks pregnant, according to the HCCC report. After Guardian Australia revealed the first cases, the scandal became far more wide-reaching. Dozens of other women came forward to allege they suffered serious infections and what they later realised were needless surgeries at the hands of Gayed, who had been practising for decades. The new investigation will examine three other public hospitals where Gayed is believed to have worked, and will try to establish the extent of his misconduct. It could result in Gayed being banned from the profession for life, and investigators have the option to refer allegations to the police if possible criminal conduct is found. Some women have alleged they were unsupported and dismissed when they told other medical specialists about what they had endured, even as other doctors were forced to correct Gayed’s errors. Vicki Cheadle was one of Gayed’s ablation patients a decade ago, after which, she alleges, she was in agony and felt extremely ill. Eight months later she discovered her uterus was filling with putrid and infected blood because Gayed had sealed her cervix shut. Cheadle needed emergency surgery to treat the infection that had developed in her uterus, and lost one of her fallopian tubes in the process. “The days following the procedure to clear out my infection, I had to visit the surgeon who did the surgery for a follow-up visit,” Cheadle said. “At his clinic, he told me all that he had found wrong in what Gayed had previously done to me, and he told me at length what he would’ve done to treat me if I had been a patient of his instead. He told me flat out that Emil Gayed had botched my procedure, and that basically I would have died if I had been made to wait any longer for surgery to fix it.” Christy Smith was 20 when, in July 2002, Gayed allegedly stitched up tears in her vagina after childbirth. When she went to a GP for a routine smear a few months later, Smith mentioned to her that she had not been able to have sex since giving birth. “When she checked me out, she was horrified,” Smith said. “She said Gayed had stitched my vagina almost shut. She couldn’t even give me a pap smear … she was really disgusted, and she even drew a picture of it for me, of how it looked. She said I needed to go see a gynaecologist and get it fixed. I still feel mutilated.” Smith had corrective surgery with a specialist. Last week the HCCC announced it would examine management at the Manning Rural Referral hospital, including whether staff working with Gayed had failed to report errors or concerns. The HCCC investigation in June found Gayed had removed women’s reproductive organs without their consent, and that many of his patients suffered serious complications. He did not challenge the allegations against him. NSW Health’s deputy secretary, Dr Nigel Lyons, said since the HCCC investigation and the subsequent NSW civil and administrative tribunal ruling, the ministry had conducted an internal investigation. It examined four NSW public hospitals where Gayed previously worked; Cooma hospital (1994-99); Kempsey district hospital (1990-2003); Manning Base hospital (1999-2016); and Mona Vale hospital (2002-07). A special counsel, Gail Furness, was appointed on Monday by the NSW health department to lead a separate, independent inquiry into Gayed’s work across these hospitals. Furness is known for her role in helping to run Australia’s child sexual abuse royal commission. She will be assisted in her inquiry by Dr Greg Jenkins, a specialist obstetrician and gynaecologist. The inquiry will also look at the management of any complaints, adverse events or performance issues relating to Gayed and subsequent action taken by each local health district. Furness has been asked to report back to NSW Health by 30 September. Lyons said: “Ensuring our patients receive quality and safe care is our priority and I am very sorry that this has not been the case for some women treated in the past by Dr Gayed. “Our focus is on ensuring any woman with concerns about the care she may have received under Dr Gayed is provided with advice and any appropriate follow-up assessment.” Lyons said the four hospitals would make direct contact with any patient who had previously raised issues or complaints regarding their treatment by Gayed. He encouraged anyone else with concerns about treatment they received to call the dedicated telephone line at each of the hospitals. A senior clinician would answer questions and make any appropriate referrals for follow-up care. Mayo private hospital in Taree, owned by Healthe Care, said on Friday it had launched an investigation into Gayed as a result of Guardian Australia’s reporting. Gayed was first registered in 1994 and holds a speciality in obstetrics and gynaecology. He obtained his bachelor of medicine at Ain Shams University in Egypt, and became a fellow of the Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1993. He was last seen in Sydney, and has closed down his offices in private clinics, leaving many women struggling to obtain their medical records. The Guardian has tried to contact Gayed about the allegations against him. On Monday a woman who identified herself as his wife answered the door at his Sydney home. She said she was aware of the inquiries but would not speak any more. Neighbours said Gayed had not been seen for weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/26/tamil-family-members-win-injunction-to-prevent-deportation-to-sri-lanka","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T20:06:57Z","webTitle":"Tamil family members win injunction to prevent deportation to Sri Lanka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/tamil-family-members-win-injunction-to-prevent-deportation-to-sri-lanka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/tamil-family-members-win-injunction-to-prevent-deportation-to-sri-lanka","fields":{"headline":"Tamil family members win injunction to prevent deportation to Sri Lanka","bodyText":"Two members of a family of Tamil asylum seekers from the Queensland town of Biloela have won an 11th-hour injunction preventing their imminent deportation. Nadesalingam and Priya and their two young Australian-born daughters have been in immigration detention in Melbourne since March, when they were forcibly removed from their home in Biloela in central Queensland. The family had previously been told by Australian Border Force officials they could be deported as early as Tuesday. But federal court justice Bernard Murphy on Monday granted an urgent injunction prohibiting immigration authorities from deporting Priya and their eldest daughter, three-year-old Kopika. “It’s a good result and we’re all taking a big sigh of relief,” family friend Simone Cameron said. On Thursday last week, the federal circuit court denied Priya’s bid to stay. The court was asked to consider whether her plea for protection should be reexamined by the immigration assessment authority. That decision was subject to a 21-day appeal period. But on Friday, the ABF issued deportation notices to both Nadesalingam and Priya and told the family they could be sent back to Sri Lanka from Tuesday. Advocates for the family said issuing the notices was “underhanded” as they had not exhausted their legal options in Australia. Justice Murphy on Monday restrained immigration authorities from removing Priya and her eldest daughter until their appeal is finalised. A date for their appeal is yet to be fixed. Nadesalingam’s application for protection had been rejected by Australian authorities, and his appeals extinguished. Nadesalingam and Priya arrived in Australia separately and their immigration cases have been dealt with independently. Cameron, one of many Biloela residents who has rallied behind the family, said supporters would continue to campaign for a reprieve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/26/recycling-senate-inquiry-recommends-all-single-use-plastics-be-banned","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T09:47:50Z","webTitle":"All single-use plastics should be banned by 2023 Senate inquiry recommends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/26/recycling-senate-inquiry-recommends-all-single-use-plastics-be-banned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/26/recycling-senate-inquiry-recommends-all-single-use-plastics-be-banned","fields":{"headline":"All single-use plastics should be banned by 2023 Senate inquiry recommends","bodyText":"A Senate inquiry into Australia’s recycling crisis has recommended that all single-use plastics – which could potentially include takeaway containers, chip packets and coffee cups with plastic linings – be banned by 2023. The wide-ranging report also recommends the establishment of a national container deposit scheme as a response to an unfolding crisis in Australian recycling that forced some councils to tip their recycling into landfill. The report sets out a blueprint to create a “circular economy” – where all materials used in Australia are then recovered and reused domestically. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, who chaired the inquiry, said it was “a rare display of political consensus” across Labor, Liberal and the Greens. “The Senate has laid down a clear pathway for Australia to create a circular economy and stop piles of plastic, paper and glass being stockpiled or heading to landfill,” he said. While the report did not define what single-use plastics could be banned, senator Whish-Wilson said it could include takeaway containers, chip packets, plastic bags and coffee cups with plastic linings. Australian recycling is in crisis after China announced it would no longer buy the majority of our recyclable material, starting from this year. Previously, up to 50% of all Australian recycling was being sold to China, because the lack of a domestic market for recyclables could not meet the volume of recycling we were creating. But on 1 January, new conditions meant China would no longer buy 99% of the 1.27 million tonnes that Australia had previously exported there. The unsold recycling began piling up in collection centres, or being dumped in landfill. States have stepped in with emergency funding to ensure collection companies continued to pick up recycling, but only on six or 12 month contracts. Tuesday’s report says the long term solution is to create a circular recycling economy, cut down on waste generation and fund infrastructure to recycle domestically. “It appears that Australians are more likely to be enthusiastic recyclers than they are at seeking to avoid waste generation,” the report said. “The increasing amounts of material generated for recycling is placing the recycling industry under pressure.” Gayle Sloan, the chief executive of the Waste Management Association of Australia, told the committee Australia was being “left behind the rest of the developed world” in failing to create a circular economy. “For every one job involved in landfill and 10,000 tonnes of waste, over four are created by resource recovery,” she said. The report also calls on the government to prioritise waste reduction over controversial waste-to-energy plans, to establish a national container deposit scheme, and for government departments to set mandatory targets for using recycled material. Whish-Wilson said: “Never before have I seen every stakeholder, from right across the economy, call for national leadership on an issue. This report lays bare the need for federal government action and underlines why it can no longer sit on the sidelines.” The report also found that a national container deposit scheme would “inherently improve” the quality of recycling and lower its cost. It said the price of glass collected from South Australia, whose container deposit scheme has been running since 1977, was worth three times as much as glass collected from other states’ kerbside bins. In 2014-15, Australia generated 64 million tonnes of waste – both household and commercial – of which 58% was recycled. In April, a Coag meeting of state and federal environment ministers, who met to discuss the recycling crisis, already agreed to make all Australian packaging sustainable by 2025. Tuesday’s report concluded the current recycling crisis offered an opportunity to reform Australia’s waste system that was “too important to be missed”. “While China’s decision to restrict the import of certain categories of waste has triggered the current crisis in the Australian waste management sector, in fact, there have been underlying problems in the sector for some time,” it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/jun/25/trade-war-fears-hit-markets-trump-targets-china-investments-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T16:42:06Z","webTitle":"EU tariffs force Harley-Davidson to move some production out of US – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/25/trade-war-fears-hit-markets-trump-targets-china-investments-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/jun/25/trade-war-fears-hit-markets-trump-targets-china-investments-business-live","fields":{"headline":"EU tariffs force Harley-Davidson to move some production out of US – as it happened","bodyText":"The escalation of trade tensions has sent investors scurrying for the sidelines, amid growing fears of an all out global trade war. Reports that Donald Trump planned to block Chinese companies investing in US tech companies and could also restrict tech exports to China set the tone for the day. Comments from the US treasury secretary that the reports were inaccurate did little to limit the damage, especially since Steve Mnuchin suggested the restrictions might not apply just to China. On top of that, the impact of EU tariffs at a company level was demonstrated by the decision of motor bike maker Harley-Davidson to move some production out of the US. The final impact on European markets was pretty grim: The FTSE 100 fell 2.24% or 172.43 points to 7509.84, its worst daily performance since 6 February this year Germany’s Dax, already weak on worries about the impact of tariffs on its key car producers, dropped 2.46% to 12,270.33 France’s Cac closed down 1.92% at 5283.86 Italy’s FTSE MIB finished 2.44% lower at 21,355.19 Spain’s Ibex ended down 1.78% at 9617.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 382 points or 1.55%. Here’s our latest report on the trade wars and Harley-Davidson move which is helping cause the market woes: On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Unsurprisingly in the current circumstances, the VIX volatility index is moving higher: Amid the increasing trade tensions, things could get worse from here for markets, says Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index: Trade war fears appear to be ramping up almost daily. Initially traders were rather complacent that Trump’s threats were just a hardball negotiating tactic. However, he has more than proved that his intentions are far more serious and damaging; this realisation has struck market sentiment hard. Global equities are falling sharply today, with indices on both sides of the Atlantic succumbing to losses of over 1%. The fear that is driving the markets here is at what point does this end? How much damage needs to be done to the economies involved and global trade in order for Trump to decide enough. This is a huge uncertainty in this very dangerous game of economic “chicken”, as investors are starting to see US – Sino relations sink past the point of no return. In the absence of any optimistic news over the global trading climate, we can expect the current sell off to intensify over the coming sessions. Regarding that tweet from US treasury secretary Mnuchin, Chris Beauchamp at IG said: The new week has begun on a firmly negative footing, as equity indices around the globe suffer heavy losses, with trade wars getting the blame once more. What’s more, the US administration itself appears divided as the Treasury Secretary tweets out that planned measures regarding intellectual property will encompass all countries and not just China. It seems the US is hell-bent on falling out with everyone, increasing the risk that trade wars will do what all the other worries of the past nine years have failed to do – namely stop the great bull market in equities. The usual havens are in demand as investors seek refuge from the turmoil, with the ten-year Treasury yield dipping below 3% once more – investor concerns about what a 3% yield would do seem awfully quaint compared to the genuine concerns about the impact of trade wars. Falling oil prices in the wake of Friday’s decision by Opec to increase production - Brent crude is down 1.8% - is another factor in the day’s market slump. But the trade tensions continue to dominate, and the markets may have been too complacent up until now about the impact to the global econom. Neil Wilson at Markets.com made a number of points about the state of play: First, markets have been pretty relaxed about the trade war escalation and so the events of recent days necessitate a repricing of risk that is arguably overdue. Second, Donald Trump’s call for restrictions on Chinese investment in US companies does mark step up in tensions and makes a full blown trade conflict more likely. Three, taken on their own the restrictions on investments would have a bigger economic impact - i.e. on corporate earnings - than fairly small beer tariffs would if there is no escalation. Four, US equities are still just about flat for the year, which given the massive ramp up through Jan is not a terrible performance. From a technical viewpoint, as long as we see the Dow hold its 200-day SMA - which at time of writing it is managing to do - we’re still in an upwards trending channel from the April lows. The US should confirm tariffs on Chinese imports and the investment curbs by the end of this week - it could be a pivotal few days but there is still some hope -albeit fading - that the White House will step back from the brink. Harley Davidson’s decision to pull US jobs is a timely reminder to the administration that trade is not a zero sum game that either won or lost. Although some members of Trump’s team seem to be rowing back on the Chinese reports: It is hard to know which would be better: that the US is targeting China alone on technology or that it plans to expand its attacks further afield as well. A bidding war could be on the cards for Britain’s leading satellite company Inmarsat. Earlier this month US group EchoStar had a bid rejected by Inmarsat, and since then it disclosed a 3% stake in its target. Now Paris-based Eutelsat has said it is currently evaluating its own offer for Inmarsat, pushing the UK group’s shares around 4% higher. Wall Street’s decline is accelerating, sending other markets lower in its wake, as the global trade tensions continue to grow. Investors have been increasingly concerned about the fallout from Trump’s actions on tariffs, and today’s developments - the threat of more restrictions on China and Harley-Davidson cutting some US production - are confirming their worst fears. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 are down around 1%, with the Nasdaq Composite nearly 1.4% lower on Trump’s tech plans. In Europe the FTSE 100 has dropped 1.9% while in Germany - whose car production would be hard hit by US tariffs - the Dax is down 1.8%. Shares in Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise company, have dropped more than 8% after it cut its earnings forecast for 2018. In the second quarter it said revenues had risen by 10.4% with earnings per share up from 52 cents a year earlier to 78 cents, helped by higher ticket prices and on-board spending. But increased fuel costs and adverse exchange rates mean that it now expects its full year earnings to be $0.19 a share lower than it forecast in March. A weak start to trading in New York: Ding ding! The US stock market is open for trading....and trade war fears are biting. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 160 points, or 0.65%, to 24,420. Technology shares are dropping, following reports that the Trump administration will block Chinese companies from investing in the US, and also restrict US tech exports to China. Alphabet (Google’s parent company) is down by 1.7%, semiconductor maker nVidia is down 2.1% and aircraft maker Boeing is down 2%. Harley Davidson is also dropping, down 2% after outlining its response to Europe’s new tariffs on US goods. Bloomberg points out that Harley’s sales in Europe hit their highest level since 2011 last year (as a share of total sales). Clearly the company can’t afford to lose sales in such a ‘critical market’ (which is why it will swallow the tariff cost itself, while it moves production out of America). Here’s some reaction to Harley-Davidson’s plans to move some US production overseas, from former White House press spokesman Tony Fratto.... ING economist Carsten Brzeski isn’t impressed either: Peter Alexander of NBC News points out that Donald Trump has previously hailed Harley-Davidson as a great US business. CNN has a good first take on the Harley-Davidson news: Harley-Davidson is already taking a hit in the trade fight between President Trump and European allies. The company is shifting some production of motorcycles for European customers out of the United States to avoid EU retaliatory tariffs. The EU is imposing tariffs on $3.2 billion worth of American goods, including motorcycles, orange juice, bourbon, peanut butter, motorboats, cigarettes and denim. They are a response to the Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe. For motorcycles, the EU is raising its 6% tariff to 31%. That will make each bike about $2,200 more expensive to export, Harley said. Harley is not raising prices for customers. The company said it will take a hit of $30 million to $45 million for the rest of this year. Harley-Davidson’s (HOG) stock fell 2% in premarket trading. Donald Trump won’t be happy to hear that Harley-Davidson is moving some production out of America. The president singled out the motorcycle maker in his first State of the Union speech in February 2017, telling Congress that he would help companies like Harley-Davidson sell their goods abroad. As the new president put it: I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it’s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me — without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it — that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren’t even asking for change. But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. Instead, Trump has provoked the European Union into imposing higher tariffs on £2.5bn of US imports, by slapping tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into America. Harley-Davidson isn’t the only US company being hurt by Donald Trump’s tariffs. A nail manufacturer in the mid-west state of Missouri says it has lost 50% of its business in two weeks, thanks to the new tariffs on steel imports. Mid Continent Nail Corporation imports steel wire from Mexico, so has seen prices surge to uncompetitive levels thanks to the 25% tariff on imports imposed by Trump earlier this year. The company has already laid off 60 temporary staff, and could axe another 200 by the end of July unless it gets a tariff exemption, quickly. According to local news outlet Missourinet, Mid Continent Nail Corporation produces half of the nails made in America, but has seen orders tumble as customers find cheaper products elsewhere. Shares in Harley-Davidson have fallen almost 2% in pre-market trading in New York. Traders are calculating that absorbing the $100m annual cost of Europe’s new tariffs will hurt Harley’s profits. We don’t yet know how many US jobs will be affected by Harley-Davidson’s decision to move some production from America to Europe. But it’s possible that the company’s base in Milwaukee, Wisconsin could be hit badly. Wisconsin is one of the rural states that backed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, heartened by his promise to Make America Great Again and bring jobs back home. Harley’s announcement, though, shows that trade wars aren’t as “good and easy to win” as Trump once claimed.... NEWSFLASH: Harley-Davidson is planning to move some manufacturing out of America in response to Europe’s new tariffs on motorcycle imports. Harley-Davidson has just announced that the EU’s tariffs will have a serious impact on its business. The average tariffs on a Harley will rose to 31%, from 6% today, adding $2,200 to the average price of a motorcycle exported from the US to Europe. Such a burden could make Harley’s uncompetitive in Europe. So the company has decided it must shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the US to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden. The company says: Harley-Davidson expects ramping-up production in international plants will require incremental investment and could take at least 9 to 18 months to be fully complete. It says this is the “only sustainable option” to ensure Harleys can still be sold in Europe (where it sold almost 40,000 last year). It says: Increasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the company’s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe. That could be serious blow to Harley workers in America - and a stark example of the damage that a trade dispute can cause. Europe implemented tariffs on imports of US goods, including motorbikes and bourbon, in response to Donald Trump’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium. In the short term, Harley says it will absorb the cost of the tariffs, rather than passing it onto customers - costing it up t0 $100m per year It says: Harley-Davidson believes the tremendous cost increase, if passed onto its dealers and retail customers, would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region, reducing customer access to Harley-Davidson products and negatively impacting the sustainability of its dealers’ businesses. Therefore, Harley-Davidson will not raise its manufacturer’s suggested retail prices or wholesale prices to its dealers to cover the costs of the retaliatory tariffs. The Stoxx 600 index of European shares is on track for its biggest one-day fall in a month, according to Reuters data. European car firms are partly to blame, following Trump’s threat to impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the EU. Renault are down 2.8%, Daimler has lost 2.5, while car parts firm Continental has shed 3.6% (fewer car sales means less demand for tires and brakes). Analysts at FXPro say traders are shunning riskier assets, thanks to Donald Trump’s repeated threats to impose tariffs on America’s trading partners. Over the weekend President Trump indicated that if trade barriers and tariffs against the US were not removed that he would have no choice but to add further sanctions against those countries targeting the US. The stock market selloff is gathering pace. Britain’s FTSE 100 is now down 96 points, or 1.2%. Mining stocks are helping to drive the selloff, with Anglo American down 3.3% and Antofagasta losing 2.6% - and dragging the sector down to a seven-week low. That reflects concerns that a trade war will hurt global growth, and dampen demand for commodities like iron ore, copper and nickel. Oil giants are also falling, matching a drop in the price of crude after the Opec cartel agreed to raise production levels last week. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With a troublesome US open on the horizon, the European indices saw their losses intensify as Monday went on. The FTSE was one of the worst performers at the start of the week. Not only was the UK index dealing with the same trade war fears gripping its peers, it also had to process Brent Crude’s 1.2% decline, a move that took the black stuff back towards $74.50 per barrel and left Shell and BP down 1.1% and 1.8% respectively. This in turn forced the FTSE 90 points lower, taking the index back under 7600 and only 50 points away from last Thursday’s 7 week nadir. Turkey’s stock market is defying today’s downturn, after Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was reelected as the country’s president last night. The Istanbul bourse has jumped by 1%, although the Turkish lira is sliding after an early rally. Erdoğan’s AKP party won 52.5% of the votes, giving it an unexpected outright majority in a crucial election for Turkey’s future. Turkey’s presidency has sweeping new powers to appoint officials and set security policies, following a constitutional shake-up last year. Erdoğan has promised to use his new powers to fight terrorism and improve Turkey’s troubled economy. But having overseen a crackdown since an attempted coup in 2016, Erdoğan is likely to keep running Turkey in an autocratic manner. Vincent-Freědeěric Mivelaz of Swiss Bank explains: Erdogan is likely to act unilaterally (in politics and economics) without consulting the opposition. Among the five parties making the parliamentary threshold of winning 10% of votes, cooperation will not be easy. The constitutional reform of April 2017 reinforces the power of the president (abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, allowing direct appointment of top officials, allowing intervention in the legal system and state-of-emergency powers) and its allies in the Nationalist Movement Party in the parliament. Erdogan’s “People’s Alliance” is projected to win 342 seats out of 600 in the parliament, giving little power to the opposition. Emerging markets expert Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital warns that Turkey faces troubles ahead. The US stock market is heading for losses when trading begins in almost four hours time. The futures market suggests the Dow Jones industrial average will drop by 150 point, or 0.7%. The technology-focused Nasdaq could lose 1%, amid concerns that tech companies are being dragged into Donald Trump’s trade dispute with China. China’s central bank tried to calm nervous investors yesterday. The People’s Bank of China relaxed the rules on commercial banks, allowing them to hold less cash. That should encourage them to pump more than $100bn of liquidity into the economy, to help Chinese firms. But this wasn’t enough to prevent another day of falling share prices in Shanghai - where the market lost more than 1% today. After two hours trading, European stock markets are falling deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 has now shed almost 1%, down 70 points at 7612. Germany’s DAX has lost 1.2%, helping to knock the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 down by around 1% too. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says it’s a Blue Monday in the markets. The dark mood over global markets returns, on increasing pessimism that a full-blown U.S.-China trade war may be unavoidable. Technology firms are leading the selloff, following those reports that American firms will be blocked from selling some tech to China - and that Chinese firms will not be allowed to invest in US rivals. In London, IT firm Micro Focus has fallen over 4%. Chipmakers such as BE Semiconductor (-3.7%) and Infinion (-2.7%) are also suffering. Odeluga explains why the markets are worried: The latest White House trade restriction against China might be an unprecedented ban of firms, at least 25% Chinese-owned, from investing in “industrially significant” U.S. technology companies. If the Treasury proposals, outlines of which were reported by the Wall Street Journal, are enacted, Beijing would have little choice but to react in kind. That could mean potential clampdowns on U.S. technology firms active in China, from the smallest to the largest. Newsflash: EU banks aren’t properly prepared for the risk of a hard Brexit, according to the industry’s top European watchdog. In a new report, the European Banking Authority has warned that financial institutions haven’t drawn up contingency plans in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal in March 2019. Crucially, the EBA is concerned that London and Brussels may not agree a transition deal that would allow UK-based banks to maintain their current links with Europe, and vice versa. The EBA also urges banks not to assume that politicians will find a magic solution to the trillions of pounds worth of cross-Channel contracts that could be left in limbo after Brexit. The EBA warns that: a) progress in the preparations of financial institutions for the potential departure of the UK from the EU without a ratified withdrawal agreement in March 2019 is inadequate; b) the recent political agreement on a transition period, while welcome, does not provide any legal certainty until a withdrawal agreement is ratified at the end of the process for the departure of the UK from the EU; c) there remains a material possibility that, despite the best efforts of both sides to conclude a ratified withdrawal agreement, this may not be possible, in which case the UK would leave the EU on 30 March 2019 by operation of law without a transition period; and d) the necessary mitigating actions take time, and should be pursued without further delay Here’s the full report Ouch: German business morale has deteriorated, as the threat of a trade war casts a shadow over Europe’s largest economy. Munich’s IFO institute has reported its business climate index has dropped to 101.8 this month, down from 102.3 in May. That’s a sign that German businesses are finding life tougher this year. IFO chief Clemens Fuest explained. Companies were less satisfied with their current business situation. Their business expectations, by contrast, remained slightly optimistic. The tailwind enjoyed by the German economy is calming down. After a strong 2017, the IFO survey has been deteriorating for much of this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING points out that domestic political tensions in Germany are also hurting the economy, as Angela Merkel’s coalition threatens to split over migration The next two weeks could dramatically change the political landscape in Germany and in a worst case scenario even lead to a fall of the government and new elections. For the economy, this would mean further delays of the urgently needed investments, new structural reforms and strengthening of the monetary union. But there’s always hope... Six drops and one stagnation in the last seven months or in other (soccer) words: six losses and one draw. This is clearly not a promising trend. However, as seen last Saturday in the World Cup match between Germany and Sweden, never count out Germany. Hope dies last, even if it takes until the very last second. Even before these latest threats, there were concerns that trade war fears are hurting the global economy. Yesterday the Bank of International Settlements (which represents central banks) warned that growth could falter if nations imposed more protectionist measures on each other. BIS chief Agustín Carstens warned: “Indeed, there are signs that the rise in uncertainty associated with the first protectionist steps and the ratcheting up of rhetoric have already been inhibiting investment.” The Wall Street Journal says the Trump administration is determined to protect US companies from having their tech secrets snaffled by Chinese rivals. We’ve got trillions of dollars seeking our crown jewels of technology,” said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro last week. “There has to be a defense against that.” The Financial Times says Chinese investment in America could tumble, if Trump blocks China from buying into US tech companies. According to the Rhodium Group consultancy, Chinese foreign direct investment in the US plunged more than 90 per cent to just $1.8bn in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period last year. In 2016, Chinese companies made a record $46bn in foreign direct investment in the US. The exact scope of the investment measures has been the subject of internal discussions in the Trump administration in recent days, say people familiar with the debate. It is unclear how quickly restrictions would take effect and if they would apply to Chinese investments in venture capital funds, which provide much of the seed money for US technology start-ups. But according to officials and people briefed on the discussions, the administration has decided to restrict China’s ability to invest in or acquire US companies in the industries identified by Beijing in its so-called Made in China 2025 plan. Xi Jinping, China’s president, has set a goal of leading the world in those ten sectors, which include aerospace, AI, robotics, medical devices and railways. US firms are concerned that they’ll be blocked from selling some tech products to China, says Politico: Like the tariffs that Trump imposed on $50 billion in Chinese imports — and those he has threatened to impose on $400 billion more if Beijing retaliates — the new investment restrictions and export controls are intended to pressure China to stop unfair trade practices that threaten the United States’ technological leadership. Trump is expected to invoke his emergency powers to protect national and economic security to put the restrictions in place. But the administration is already getting pushback from bureaucrats who think it would be a misuse of the export control system, and from businesses that fear the approach will further disadvantage U.S. firms trying to enter the Chinese market Trump’s latest threat against China has hit European markets. Shares are down across the region in early trading, with Britain’s FTSE 100 and Germany’s DAX both losing 0.6%. The threat that Chinese firms could be blocked from investing in US tech companies has worried the City, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains In the latest escalation of the trade war Trump has decided to take aim at Chinese investments. A draft series of restrictions on inbound Chinese investments are due to be published later this week, in a move which could have great long-term consequences on the US – Sino economic relationship. Once again details remain very sketchy, with the scope of such a measure still under discussion. It is now very difficult to get away from the fact that neither side has any intention of backing down in this game of economic “chicken”. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a trade war between America and China have ratcheted up another notch, hitting confidence in the markets. Overnight, it’s emerged that President Donald Trump is drawing up a fresh crackdown on Chinese investment in the US. New rules, which could be announced within days, would prevent firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from acquiring American companies involved in ‘industrially significant technology’, such as robotics, electronic cars and aerospace. Trump is also planning to restrict US companies from selling certain technologies to China, using “enhanced export controls”, according to the Wall Street Journal. Such a move would further damage relations between Washington and Beijing, following the threat of tit-for-tat tariffs. The Trump administration is embracing increasingly aggressive restrictions on what they see as China’s unfair trade practices. These latest measures could undermine China’s efforts to become a world leader in emerging technologies. As the WSJ explains: The twin initiatives, set to be announced by the end of the week, are designed to prevent Beijing from moving ahead with plans outlined in its “made in China 2025” report to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology. The Treasury Department is crafting rules that would block firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in what the White House calls “industrially significant technology.” The ceiling may end up lower than that, according to people familiar with discussions finalizing the plans. The news has hit Asian markets, with Japan’s Nikkei and China’s Shanghai Composite indices both falling by 1%. European stock markets are expected to follow suit, with the FTSE 100 dropping in early trading. Last Friday, Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on European car makers, declaring that they should set up factories in America instead. That rocked the share prices of Fiat, BMW and Daimler. Trump also fired a warning shot at America’s trade partners over the weekend. The president tweeted that they must drop trade barriers and tariffs - even as he slaps them on US imports - or else... No wonder investors are worried.... Also coming up today... We get the new IFO survey of German business morale, which may show another decline, plus the latest US home sales. In Dublin, Ireland’s central bank and the International Monetary Fund are hosting a two-day conference on “the euro at 20”. It will examine the euro’s performance over its first two (sometimes turbulent) decades. IMF Christine Lagarde will give the opening speech this morning.

If the country’s greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trajectory, Australia will miss its Paris target by a billion tonnes of CO2, which is equal to about two years of Australia’s entire national emissions. NDEVR replicates the federal government’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports, but releases them months ahead of the official data. Previous NDEVR reports’ figures have been within 1% of the official figures when they are eventually released. The latest figures include the first three months of 2018 and show Australia’s national emissions up to March were the highest since records began in 2002. It projects that emissions for the year to March, excluding land use emissions, will be 556.9 m tonnes. Even with land-use data included, it projects emissions would continue their upward trend, taking Australia further away from its Paris commitment of a 26% to 28% reduction in emissions on 2005 levels by 2030. Although emissions from the electricity sector had fallen in the previous three quarters, the report identifies a slight increase of 1.7 m tonnes of CO2 in the most recent quarter, due to an increase in fossil-fuel based electricity generation throughout the national electricity market states. The report also finds that fugitive emissions due to increased gas production and exports are at their highest levels ever. As debate over the government’s proposed national energy guarantee continues, NDEVR projects that the Australian electricity sector would meet the proposed Neg target of a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030, five years ahead of schedule, simply if business as usual continues. The reason for this is the ongoing investment in renewable energy developments as well as the impending decommissioning of large coal plants. “Our indicative analysis shows that electricity emissions in a business as usual sense are decreasing faster than what the Neg projects anyway,” the NDEVR environmental managing director, Matt Drum, said. Drum said while the government’s focus was on the electricity sector, emissions were rising across other areas of the economy in the absence of a working climate policy. “The numbers speak for themselves. They’re heading in the wrong direction,” he said. “It’s one thing to focus on the electricity sector – it’s 36% of our emissions. But that leaves 64% of the economy that is essentially untouched by policy or mitigation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/25/mumbai-india-bans-plastic-bags-and-bottles","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T10:14:57Z","webTitle":"Mumbai bans plastic bags and bottles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/mumbai-india-bans-plastic-bags-and-bottles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/mumbai-india-bans-plastic-bags-and-bottles","fields":{"headline":"Mumbai bans plastic bags and bottles","bodyText":"Mumbai has the become the largest Indian city to ban single-use plastics, with residents caught using plastic bags, cups or bottles to face penalties of up to 25,000 rupees (£276) and three months in jail from Monday. Council inspectors in navy blue jackets have been posted across the city to catch businesses or residents still using plastic bags. Penalties have already kicked in for businesses and several, reportedly including a McDonald’s and Starbucks, have already been fined. Penalties range from 5,000 rupees for first-time offenders to 25,000 rupees and the threat of three months’ jail for those caught repeatedly using single-use plastics. “For the pollution situation it’s fine to do this but for the people it is a big problem,” said Kamlash Mohan Chaudhary, a Mumbai resident. “People here carry everything in plastic bags.” Chaudhary, a taxi driver, said he had started carrying a cloth bag and that his local mutton vendor had begun wrapping the meat in newspaper rather than plastic sheets. Local media have reported complaints from vendors who say some inspectors are using confusion over the ban to extort money from businesses. India recently hosted World Environment Day, which this year focused on the epidemic of plastic waste. About 6.3bn tonnes of plastic globally has been discarded into the environment since 1950, most of which will not break down for at least 450 years. Half of the world’s plastic was created in the past 13 years and about half of that is thought to be for products used once and thrown away, such as bags, cups or straws. India’s use of plastic is less than half of the global average: about 11kg a year per capita compared with 109kg in the US. India has among the highest rates of mismanaging plastic waste in the world, according to a 2015 study. Strewn plastic wrappers, cups and bags are a common sight on the streets of Indian cities and beaches and make up part of the mountain-sized landfills on the outskirts of major metropolitan areas such Delhi. Discontent about Mumbai’s ban was made worse on Monday by torrential rain, which Chaudhary said had soaked through the jute or cloth bags many people were using as an alternative to plastic. Messages were circulated on WhatsApp with stories of people who had been fined, prompting many to comply. “We are all very afraid,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/25/exporter-and-western-australia-government-at-odds-over-fate-of-60000-sheep","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T06:50:46Z","webTitle":"Exporter and Western Australia government at odds over fate of 60,000 sheep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/exporter-and-western-australia-government-at-odds-over-fate-of-60000-sheep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/exporter-and-western-australia-government-at-odds-over-fate-of-60000-sheep","fields":{"headline":"Exporter and Western Australia government at odds over fate of 60,000 sheep","bodyText":"The Western Australian government is at odds with Australia’s largest live exporter over the fate of 60,000 sheep bound for the Middle East. The sheep were to depart on the Emanuel Exports ship Al Shuwaikh bound for the Middle East, but that plan was aborted when the federal agriculture department suspended the Perth-based company’s export licence. The state government says it has found a local buyer for the sheep that are potentially stranded in a feedlot near Fremantle Port. But Emanuel Exports, which owns the sheep, does not want to sell. Guardian Australia understands the exporter still intends to deliver the sheep to its buyer in the Middle East and is negotiating with other exporters to use their licence to carry the sheep on the Al Shuwaikh when it arrives in port this week, fulfilling an order placed several months ago. If a deal can be brokered the sheep would be loaded on the ship “within days”. It is understood Emanuel has not been contacted by the WA government about the government’s proposal to have the sheep slaughtered locally. That sparked concern from the farming lobby in WA, because the state’s three largest export-focused sheep meat abattoirs are either closed for maintenance or scheduled to be closed for maintenance for the first three weeks of July. Agriculture minister Alannah MacTiernan told the ABC outside state parliament on Monday that the government had contacted local abattoirs and a “large processor is prepared to buy all the sheep”. “We’ve been on the blower … we have one processor that is prepared to buy all of those sheep, keep them in the feedlot for the next three to four weeks until they can process them all and make sure they are distributed to our markets across the world,” she said. The processor is understood to be Fletcher International Exports in Albany, which specialises in lamb and mutton for the export market. It is scheduled to be closed for the next four weeks. Sheep bought for live export, such as those currently in Emmanuel’s feedlot, are typically older, less fat sheep that are suitable only for some export markets or domestically for pet food. The Al Shuwaikh is the only live export ship listed for sail in the next month. Two other large sheep abattoirs that prepare meat for export, the WA Meat Marketing Cooperative at Katanning and Beaufort River Meats at Beaufort River, owned by live export company Wellards, are both due to close for three weeks from Friday. MacTiernan has repeatedly said the local meat processing industry has capacity to locally slaughter sheep that would otherwise be shipped to the Middle East if the live export trade was banned during the high risk northern hemisphere summer months. About 600,000 sheep were exported live from Australia to other countries, primarily in the Middle East, last year. MacTiernan said previously that she estimated a summer ban would see an extra 350,000 sheep available for slaughter on the local market, and that “there is more than enough capacity in our sheep abattoirs throughout the south-west to really take that up.” She blamed the potential for a backlog over the Emanuel licence suspension on the federal government failing to warn the industry or to implement the suspension before the scheduled winter shut-down, which would have allowed a more orderly transition. “All off our efforts have been to ensure an orderly transition for the summer period – and if a decision had been made by the federal government about Emanuel Exports earlier, that transition may have been more achievable,” she said. “We are continuing to work with key processors to absorb the sheep that will not be transported over the next few months.” Both the WA government and the federal Labor opposition argued for an immediate halt to the 2018 summer trade following the release of harrowing footage recorded on the Emanuel Exports ship Awassi Express last August, and federal Labor has pledged to phase out the trade. The federal government instead conducted a review into heat stress which recommended a 28% reduction in stocking density, a change that some exporters have already said has rendered the trade uneconomic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/26/australia-peru-world-cup-group-c-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T15:53:40Z","webTitle":"Australia out of World Cup as Carrillo and Guerrero strike for Peru","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/26/australia-peru-world-cup-group-c-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/26/australia-peru-world-cup-group-c-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Australia out of World Cup as Carrillo and Guerrero strike for Peru","bodyText":"It would, if we are honest, have been a remarkable achievement for Bert van Marwijk to steer Australia through the first round six months after taking charge, and the final Group C standings offer an accurate reflection of where they currently are. They made a game of things on a muggy early evening in Sochi, just as they had in their previous meetings with France and Denmark, but few sides at this World Cup have looked as woefully short in attack and until players of the right ilk are produced it is hard to see exactly how their position can improve. That gloomy conclusion was cast into stark relief by a Peru team whose struggles in front of goal had brought their own early elimination. This time Peru were a less swashbuckling version of the unit that has won hearts over the past fortnight but they were infinitely more clinical and showed Australia up with two goals to remember. The first, a fizzing volley from the Watford winger André Carrillo, was heartbreaking in the sense that similar heroics earlier in the tournament would probably have taken one of its most vibrant participants through; the second, taken neatly by the captain Paolo Guerrero, was a storybook ending to their adventure and underlined the gulf in quality on show. “We were at least equal with France and against Denmark we were even better,” Van Marwijk reflected of Australia’s campaign, which would have ended regardless of the outcome after their group rivals’ tame draw. “Today I had the same feeling but in all three games we didn’t make the difference with goals and that’s something this squad misses at this level.” Australia were definitely competitive in each game but the dearth of quality is glaring. Tim Cahill’s introduction after Guerrero had scored early in the second half – surely the 38‑year‑old’s last competitive cap – may have sated the romantics but his presence told a tale. He charged around, had a shot blocked and snarled at Aziz Behich when the left-back miscued a potential assist, but his presence did nothing for their cohesion. Australia need a better plan B than just dialling back half a decade. It was hardly as if they had missed a glut of chances before Peru pulled clear, even if they had controlled possession and territory. Tom Rogic was, in the first half, somewhere near his best and was behind their most lucid work, drawing a save from Pedro Gallese after a slaloming run and starting a move that saw Anderson Santamaría deny Mathew Leckie with a brilliant challenge. Had either episode borne fruit then Australia would have been level at half-time; they could have equalised shortly after it if Tomi Juric, a game but limited centre-forward, had brought down Aaron Mooy’s imaginative pass, but he fluffed his lines and Guerrero scored moments later. “The players made a huge effort from all points from all points of view,” Peru’s manager, Ricardo Gareca, said. “We lost two matches and returned to winning ways, which is no small feat, but we did expect greater things.” Peru contrived an opening goal that their fans, a speckled red and white mass who virtually filled the stadium, richly deserved. Australia felt that Guerrero was offside when he latched on to a ball down the left channel that Trent Sainsbury had been unable to clear. Replays showed it was tight; play continued in any case and Guerrero, his head up, aimed for Carillo towards the right corner of the penalty area. The delivery was perfect; the shot, firm and low, was an exhibition of technique and it was probably not the time to remind anyone that Peru had wasted far easier chances in games of greater consequence. Guerrero’s own special moment arrived after Christian Cueva had weaved towards the box and attempted a through ball that ricocheted off Mile Jedinak. The spin and finish from a player whose extrication from a doping ban became a pre-tournament cause celebre were first rate; Peru as a whole do not look far short of being that but Gareca was reluctant to say whether he will be around to carry them forward. “I need to give it some time to think things over with a cool head,” he said, and it is impossible to see the Argentinian lacking suitors. Van Marwijk’s position is rather more clear cut: his was only ever a short-term appointment, with Graham Arnold due to take over for the longer term, and it would be a harsh judge who assessed that he has underachieved with a squad caught between eras, styles and generations. “Not a success but also not a failure,” was his own verdict. “I think everyone saw that we got a lot of compliments for the way we play, only you don’t win games with compliments.” In truth this was an evening when nobody needed to go overboard with the praise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/commentisfree/2018/jun/27/anti-pipeline-activists-fighting-to-stop-line-3","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T17:59:24Z","webTitle":"Anti-pipeline activists are fighting to stop Line 3.

Will they succeed?","bodyText":"American democracy appears to have had at least a little success this week: steadily mounting pressure - including everything from marches to tweets to phone calls to Congress - seems to have convinced President Trump that his approval ratings were in danger unless he back-pedaled on his administration’s abusive immigration policies on the US-Mexican border. So now we have an executive order allowing children to be stored in cages alongside their parents — an admittedly mixed victory, but at least Trump was forced to retreat. And now we have a motivated army of progressive Americans ready to keep on fighting. We’ll need them, because another fierce political battle is about to boil over - this time on the US’s northern border, with Canada. Local citizens there are mobilizing against another controversial project to pump oil from the Canadian “tar sands” to the US. Like the infamous Keystone pipeline through Nebraska or the Kinder Morgan pipeline through British Columbia, this pipeline - known by the innocuous name “Line 3” - has roused grassroots resistance from local citizens concerned about the project’s environmental and cultural impact. The coalition of citizen groups opposed to the massive pipeline has done its homework. Activists have studied the issue closely, producing evidence that, as usual with such a project, it will create next to no permanent jobs in the Minnesota area where the pipeline will run. They’ve detailed the enormous financial cost that an oil spill will exact. And they’ve calculated how much climate-wrecking carbon Line 3 will carry: the equivalent of about 50 coal-fired power plants. But the beauty of the fight goes beyond this picture of citizens in action. Because indigenous groups along the pipeline route — the very people on whose backs the American republic was unwillingly planted, and who have had essentially no voice in the country’s decisions – are playing a key role in the leadership of the anti-pipeline movement. Not only have several tribal nations officially intervened in the case, sending lawyers to battle the pipeline, but tribal members have shown up by the hundreds to public hearings. Winona LaDuke, a veteran Native American activist and remarkable orator, has led a series of horseback rides along the pipeline route. Last year a group of Native youth organized a 250-mile “Paddle to Protect” canoe protest along the Mississippi River, which will be crossed twice by Line 3. If you want to hear what the resistance sounds like, “No Line 3” by Native rapper Thomas X is a good place to start; if you want to get a literal taste of it, Native women have routinely brought traditional breakfasts like frybread with blueberry sauce to the various public hearings over the project, sharing the food with everyone right down to the pipeline lawyers. (If you’d like you can also order some wild rice from LaDuke’s Honor the Earth, one of the premier indigenous environmental organizations on the continent.) If you thought the earlier Standing Rock pipeline protests were a one-time demonstration of indigenous power, you were mistaken: on both sides of the border North America’s First Nations are standing up to remind the rest of us how badly we’ve abused the land we took. All of this organizing and activism seems to be working; this winter an administrative law judge recommended against granting the Enbridge corporation the route it wanted for the pipeline. Minnesota’s Department of Commerce, after a long analysis, found that the state had no need of another pipeline. 68,000 Minnesotans have presented the Public Utilities Commission with arguments against the pipeline, compared with 3,000 in favor. But in a nation where corporate power usually holds sway, all that may not be enough. Oil companies play rough, from high level politics down to the silliest street level: on the first day of a recent series of public hearings, mysterious youth in “Minnesotans for Line 3” t-shirts flooded the line for seats in the hearing - only to disappear with their tickets, reducing the number of citizens who could get inside to voice opposition to the pipeline. In a rational world, anti-pipeline activism wouldn’t be necessary. Any leader would take a look at a proposal to build a pipeline to carry dirty oil for the next half century and say, “On what planet? Not this one, because it’s overheating.” But on a rational planet no leader would look at a toddler and say, “Put him in a chain-link cage.” In the long run, the forces of reason usually win the argument - but they have to win the fight as well. Fortunately, the activists in Minnesota show every sign of having what it takes.

Smith, from Preston, was recently featured in an issue of Take a Break magazine divulging her top fashion tip for the summer party season: exasperated by her search for the perfect fascinator, Smith found a bath puff in her desired shade of blue, then simply attached it to a hair clip and partied on. Hey presto. If not always an entirely serious business, the fascinator has at least a more dignified heritage than Smith’s improvisation might suggest. The headwear that Vanity Fair recently termed “the haiku of hats” emerged in its contemporary form in the 1990s – an evolution of sorts from the doll hats of the 1930s and the cocktail hats of the 1960s. For formal occasions, it offered a more witty and less cumbersome alternative to a full-brimmed hat, and its popularity has yet to wane – this year, fascinators once again made an appearance on the spring/summer catwalks – including Christian Dior and Maison Margiela. The fascinator’s success has been aided and abetted by the milliners Philip Treacy and Stephen Jones, who, for several decades, devoted themselves to devising new and wonderful confections – clouds of butterflies, plastic doll legs, on one occasion, a bacon sandwich. Isabella Blow, for many years Treacy’s muse, was known for her outlandish taste in fascinators: one time, a whole lobster; another, her name written in feathers. Blow said the flamboyant creations allowed her to keep strangers at bay: “I don’t want to be kissed by all and sundry,” she said. “I want to be kissed by the people I love.” Treacy was also responsible for the fascinator worn by Princess Beatrice to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton – a startling piece of engineering that earned comparisons to a lavatory seat. The princess later auctioned it on eBay, earning £81,000 for Unicef and Children in Crisis. For those unfamiliar with the experience of fascinating, imagine walking along, balancing a small, yet elaborate piece of patisserie upon one’s head. They are at heart a delightful and ludicrous frippery, a way to seal an outfit with a flourish. The problem is that, over the past 30 years, the essence of the fascinator has been diluted, so that it now appears as pointless and ubiquitous as the gastro pub drizzle or the barista fern. Five years ago, Treacy himself declared the fascinator “dead”, thanks to the proliferation of glue-gunned high street headbands. “The word fascinator sounds like a dodgy sex toy,” he added. Indeed, to gaze out over the congregation of many a modern wedding is the sartorial equivalent of the music hall turn. That joke isn’t funny any more. So, let us applaud Lillian Smith and her bath puff for rekindling some of the verve and the wit of the fascinator – or, indeed, for drawing its wearisome reign to a close. Either way, Isabella Blow would surely be proud."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/26/durham-brings-back-womens-gala-for-suffrage-centenary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T17:19:23Z","webTitle":"Durham brings back women's gala for suffrage centenary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/26/durham-brings-back-womens-gala-for-suffrage-centenary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/26/durham-brings-back-womens-gala-for-suffrage-centenary","fields":{"headline":"Durham brings back women's gala for suffrage centenary","bodyText":"A Durham councillor is bringing back a women’s gala in the city after a 40-year hiatus to mark the centenary of women’s suffrage. The event was started by members of the labour movement who wanted to provide political education for newly enfranchised women. It ran from 1921-77 and attracted speakers including Barbara Castle, Nye Bevan and Clement Attlee. Maura McKeon, who represents Coxhoe on Durham county council, said: “I was talking to my grandmother about the past and she was telling me about this event where she walked side by side with thousands of other women. The only gala I had ever heard about was the miner’s gala. “After looking into it I realised there was in fact a women’s gala where thousands of women were shipped down in buses and came together in celebration. I thought it would be great to recreate the event.” McKeon’s grandmother, Kitty Callan, carried a banner for Deneside women’s section and was integral to the organisation of past events. The comeback gala will take place at Wharton Park on Saturday and will mark the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which gave some women the right to vote. Speakers will include the Labour MPs Chi Onwurah, Roberta Blackman-Woods, Helen Goodman, Liz Twist and Sharon Hodgson. Banners from Shildon, Stanley and Durham have been located and organisers hope more will be found before the event. A project has been set up to create new ones. McKeon said: “It’s a way of celebrating 100 years since some women were given the vote and all that has been achieved in that time. But we also want to look forward to the next 100 years and think about the areas women still haven’t broken into and where the struggles are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jul/03/rachel-roddy-recipe-aubergine-salted-ricotta-pasta","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-03T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for aubergine and salted ricotta pasta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/03/rachel-roddy-recipe-aubergine-salted-ricotta-pasta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/03/rachel-roddy-recipe-aubergine-salted-ricotta-pasta","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for aubergine and salted ricotta pasta","bodyText":"Our oven in Sicily has two settings – hot and fierce. It is also tricky to light – the little pilot flame may burn enthusiastically, but how long it will take to ignite the whole oven, if at all, is anyone’s guess. Last year, when a lasagne for many had to be baked and I was at the point of throwing the oven out of the window into Via Crispi, my partner Vincenzo took the lighter from me as if disarming me and pulled a chair up to the oven. He then sat with a holiday-coloured drink in one hand, the lighter in the other and stayed there until the oven of a thousand baked pastas, the gas-fired heirloom from his late and much-loved Grandma Sara, burst into life with a gassy poofff. Once lit, I am reluctant to turn it off, even in the height of summer. Occasionally I am organised with a sequence of things – one of the endless savoury tarts that fuel our holidays, a plain cake or tray of easy biscuits. But mostly, after whatever needs cooking is cooked, I end up bowling red peppers or aubergines into the belly of the Bompani beast and turning the dial up to fierce. It was during one of those sessions, with a pair of deepest-purple and pendulous aubergines, that today’s recipe came about. Magical things happen to aubergines when baked whole, although it doesn’t look like it with their skin wrinkling and charring, their taut form collapsing like a deflated bouncy castle the day the fair packs up to move on to a new town. Inside, though, the spongy flesh is transforming into soft almost-silkiness. It’s important, though, to prick them first to prevent them exploding. Aubergines need about an hour – in an oven you can control that’s at 200C/390F/gas 6 – then to be set aside until cool enough to handle. Once their charred skins have been pulled away, the now-collapsed flesh is the most unprepossessing thing, looking exactly like a grubby dishcloth – especially when it is set dripping over the sink. More often than not, I turn this silky, slightly smoky flesh of baked aubergine into a baba ganoush-like dip, which, over time – like much in our edible life – is turned into a pasta sauce. Recently I have changed the method slightly, chopping a clove of garlic, a handful of pine nuts or almonds, and a good pinch of parsley, then cooking these gently in olive oil, before adding the roughly chopped aubergine flesh and seasoning with salt and black pepper. Throwing shape- and sauce-matching rules to the wind, we have eaten this sauce with spaghetti, casarecce, rigatoni and fusilli, and topped, as here, with a blizzard of salted ricotta, which has a sharp sheepishness that’s a perfect match for the satiny aubergine. Don’t forget to turn the oven off. Aubergine and salted ricotta pasta Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 2 large aubergines 500g pasta – spaghetti, rigatoni, fusilli or penne 1 clove garlic 1 small handful flat-leaf parsley 10g pine nuts 5 tbsp olive oil Salted ricotta, grated Salt and black pepper Prick the aubergines all over, then bake them whole, directly on the rack, for 45 minutes to an hour, or until collapsed and wrinkled, then take out of the oven. Once cool enough to handle, pull away the now-charred skin – a task best done in a sieve over the sink – and leave to drip. When they are dry, chop roughly. Put a pan of salted water on for the pasta. Chop the garlic, pine nuts and parsley, fry gently in the olive oil over a medium flame until fragrant, then add the aubergine flesh and stir. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Cook the pasta until al dente, drain and then add to the aubergine. Toss together, divide between bowls and serve, passing around grated salted ricotta. • This article was amended on 20 August 2018 to include an instruction to prick the aubergines before cooking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/26/rising-energy-prices-expected-to-worsen-uk-fuel-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T14:24:29Z","webTitle":"Rising energy prices expected to worsen UK fuel poverty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/26/rising-energy-prices-expected-to-worsen-uk-fuel-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/26/rising-energy-prices-expected-to-worsen-uk-fuel-poverty","fields":{"headline":"Rising energy prices expected to worsen UK fuel poverty","bodyText":"The depth of fuel poverty blighting Britain’s poorest households is expected to worsen because of energy price rises this year, according to official forecasts. The Labour party said it was a national disgrace that the government was failing to turn the tide on fuel poverty. A key measure known as the average fuel poverty gap – between households’ energy bills and what they can afford to pay – narrowed slightly in 2016. But the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy forecasts that the gap will expand by 9%, up from £326 in 2016 to £357 in 2018. The department said the growth would be “mainly driven by increases in fuel prices”. All the big six energy suppliers, and many of the newer challenger firms, have recently raised prices, blaming an increase in wholesale costs. German supplier E.ON last week raised its prices for the second time this year. The proportion of households living in fuel poverty in 2016 rose for the second year in a row to 11.1%, or around 2.55m homes. Fuel-poor households are defined as those with above average energy costs where their income would fall below the official poverty line after paying to heat and light their home. The prospect of deepening fuel poverty comes despite a price cap for millions of vulnerable households, which started in April 2017. “It shows that some households in a risk of fuel poverty are not yet benefiting from the safeguard tariff [price cap],” said Peter Smith, director of policy and research of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action. A wider price cap for millions more households on default tariffs is due to take effect by the end of the year. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: ‘‘It is a national scandal that ripoff energy price rises are increasing the number of people forced to live in fuel poverty.” “While energy bills continue to rise, the Conservatives’ energy price cap is still not in place and is not expected to be until the end of the year, over 18 months after the promise was made.” Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green party, said: “No one should have to choose between putting food on the table or heating their home, and it is outrageous that despite knowing people are living with these choices the government hasn’t done anything to address the issue.” Both parties called for a concentrated effort to insulate the homes of people living in fuel poverty. A business department spokesperson said: “This government is driving £6bn into tackling the root cause of fuel poverty through energy efficiency upgrades installed in some of our poorest homes over the next 10 years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jul/13/from-ball-pits-to-double-denim-this-weeks-fashion-trends","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-13T11:00:08Z","webTitle":"From ball pits to double denim: this week’s fashion trends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jul/13/from-ball-pits-to-double-denim-this-weeks-fashion-trends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jul/13/from-ball-pits-to-double-denim-this-weeks-fashion-trends","fields":{"headline":"From ball pits to double denim: this week’s fashion trends","bodyText":"Going up Desperately Seeking Susan So on the moodboard.

Sabrina Kouider, 35, and her partner Ouissem Medouni, 40, were found guilty last month of murdering 21-year-old Sophie Lionnet at their home in Wimbledon, south-west London, last September. The trial heard they had a deluded belief she was in league with Mark Walton, the ex-Boyzone band member turned music mogul, with whom Kouider once had a relationship. Sentencing the pair, Judge Nicholas Hilliard said there was no excuse for the “horrible cruelty” and “humiliation” they inflicted on Lionnet during taped interrogations before her death. The two-month Old Bailey trial, which was described as stranger than fiction, heard how Kouider, a fashion designer, was fixated with Walton and believed Lionnet was colluding with him to drug and molest the family. Kouider even tried to implicate Walton in Lionnet’s disappearance. The judge said allegations Lionnet was plotting with Walton to abuse the family were a “complete fiction” and motivated by a desire for revenge. Addressing the couple in the dock, he said: “You were both involved in torturing Sophie in the bath in the lead-up to her death in making her think she would drown unless you gave her information you wanted which was not in her power to give because it did not exist. “The suffering and the torture you put her through before her death was prolonged and without pity.” He said their behaviour had its “origins in cruelty and a desire for revenge”. The judge told Kouider she was motivated by an unjustified desire to make Lionnet and Walton suffer. He added: “It is plain from all the evidence that Sophie was a kind, gentle and good-natured girl.” He continued: “I’m sure you knew the way you interrogated her was unacceptable in the extreme, that it was unlawful to assault her and she was in a dreadful state by the time of her death and torturing her in the bath was totally and utterly wrong.” The court heard how Kouider’s delusional disorder triggered her false belief that Lionnet had been seduced into helping Walton. The prosecution said Walton had shouldered the slurs and responded with “integrity and honesty” when he travelled from Los Angeles to give evidence at the trial. Over more than eight hours of recorded interrogations, the au pair was slapped, likened to a Nazi collaborator and called “worse than a murderer” by the couple, the court heard. They confiscated her identity card and phone and stopped paying her in a deliberate campaign to isolate her and force her to confess, the court heard. In her final days, Lionnet was hit with an electrical cable and beaten so badly she had five fractured ribs and a cracked breast bone. She appeared broken and emaciated in a filmed confession hours before she was killed in the bath. The defendants claimed they planned to hand the tape to police as proof against Walton. But the judge suggested it was more likely they would have sent it to the wealthy mogul to force him to give them money. When firefighters investigated pungent-smelling smoke coming from a bonfire in the couple’s garden, Medouni tried to pass off her charred remains as those of a sheep. The defendants later admitted disposing of Lionnet’s body but denied her murder, blaming each other for her death. Kouider acknowledged the suffering she had caused her victim and her family. In a letter, read to the court, she said she was “deeply sorry about what happened to Sophie”. Addressed “Dear Sophie”, it said: “I’m suffering every day thinking of you and what happened to you that dreadful night. I only wish I could turn the clock back, it never happened and you would be alive with us today.” In mitigation, Icah Peart QC said the Kouider’s delusional disorder coupled with an emotionally unstable personality disorder had caused her “irrational and completely overwhelming fear” that Lionnet had been recruited by Walton. He said her behaviour towards the victim was “entirely driven by Kouider’s mental illness in her desperation to obtain evidence of Mr Walton’s abuse”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/26/ban-on-junk-food-tv-ads-may-backfire-says-channel-4-boss","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T14:23:07Z","webTitle":"Ban on junk food TV ads may backfire, says Channel 4 boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/26/ban-on-junk-food-tv-ads-may-backfire-says-channel-4-boss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/26/ban-on-junk-food-tv-ads-may-backfire-says-channel-4-boss","fields":{"headline":"Ban on junk food TV ads may backfire, says Channel 4 boss","bodyText":"A pre-9pm ban on junk food TV advertising before 9pm would cost Channel 4£40m a year, the chief executive has said, suggesting advertisers would move to YouTube and Facebook which can “hyper-target” children. Alex Mahon told MPs that if the government introduced a blanket pre-watershed ban on TV ads promoting products high in fat, salt and sugar it could backfire. “Young people are often watching on digital platforms now, where they are hyper-targeted,” she told the digital, culture, media and sport select committee on Tuesday. “From an advertiser perspective, they might just put that [TV advertising] money into the digital platforms where that can really, really target young people. The government needs to make sure changes don’t have consequences that are worse than the current situation.” On Monday, the government unveiled a strategy to tackle childhood obesity in the UK, which is the most overweight nation in western Europe. The strategy includes a ban on “two for one” offers on unhealthy food and junk food at supermarket checkouts, the sale of energy drinks to children, and a consultation on whether to introduce a pre-9pm ban on junk food ads on TV. Mahon said overall spending on UK TV of ads promoting products high in fat, salt and sugar was £200m. Channel 4 takes about £40m from advertisers promoting such products. She said that while the £40m was only a “few percent” of Channel 4’s TV ad revenue total of more than £900m, it was “still substantial and could make a [big] impact” on the broadcaster’s ability to invest in programming. She said a blanket ban was a blunt instrument that would catch products such as olive oil and chutney, which should not be blocked from advertising before 9pm, and would not achieve the government’s aims. “Our concern is that if every pound previously spent on TV is switched to YouTube or Google and targeted at children I don’t think that is the intention of the obesity strategy,” she said. “The biggest change in viewing [away from TV to online] is occurring with children under-16, that is why we are concerned.” The government’s obesity strategy also planned to consult on how to introduce “similar protection for children viewing adverts online”. Charles Gurassa, the chair of Channel 4, said a blanket ban would affect investment in the creation of new children’s TV programmes. Mahon also revealed an improvement in the disparity between the amount men and women are paid at the broadcaster. Channel 4 has reduced its mean gender pay gap from 28.6% last year to 22.7% this year, which means men are still paid on average over a fifth more per hour than women. “I made clear earlier this year that the size of Channel 4’s gender pay gap was unacceptable, especially for an organisation like ours which champions diversity and inclusion,” Mahon said. “I’m pleased that our focus on the progression of women to senior levels of the organisation has already had an impact, but there remains much more for us to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/26/car-industry-leaders-blame-brexit-for-uk-collapse-in-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T16:05:50Z","webTitle":"Car industry leaders blame Brexit for UK collapse in investment | Phillip Inman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/26/car-industry-leaders-blame-brexit-for-uk-collapse-in-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/26/car-industry-leaders-blame-brexit-for-uk-collapse-in-investment","fields":{"headline":"Car industry leaders blame Brexit for UK collapse in investment","bodyText":"Brexit is to blame for the collapse in car industry investment, which is down by half in the first six months of the year compared to the same period in 2017, industry leaders say. They believe the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations in Brussels, two years after the referendum vote, makes it almost impossible to invest in the UK. Without membership of a customs union and the promise of almost frictionless trade, car companies cannot know how well-connected their UK operations will be with car plants and suppliers on the continent. It might be clear to those close to the negotiations that a fudge, including access to the customs union, is the likely outcome of the talks. But that cannot be the working assumption of executives who spend billions of pounds financing new plants that will still be making cars in 2025 or beyond. Last year the industry’s answer to this dilemma was delay. This year, firms are switching investment to countries they know are definitely inside the customs union. Brexit uncertainty has also made Micra man and Fiesta woman nervous about when to buy a new car, leaving sales in the UK flagging. There were 1.07m car registrations in the first five months to May compared to 1.15m in the same period last year – a fall of 6.8%. Other looming threats to the industryinclude Trump’s eagerness to slap tariffs on car imports in the next stage in his trade war with Europe and the monumentally expensive switch from the internal combustion engine to electric and hybrid vehicles. So it is no wonder the industry’s leaders want, as the very minimum requirement, to know how car parts will travel from the continent to the UK – and often back and forth several times for finishing – without sitting in a lorry park for hours or needing an extra piece of paperwork to clear border controls. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the car industry lobby group, the SMMT, said there is “growing frustration in global boardrooms” at the slow pace of negotiations. As for a Brexit dividend, he said that the “increasingly hostile and protectionist global trading environment” where leaving the EU is yet another problem, means there isn’t one. Remainers will argue that arch eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg needs to listen to the arguments as much as Theresa May and business secretary Greg Clarke. This is not to bow and curtsey before big business, but a recognition of the importance of the car industry and the government support that is needed in a period of huge transition. The car industry is one of the UK’s main employers. There may be only 186,000 on production lines, but there are 856,000 jobs linked to the UK motor industry. It has enjoyed a stellar run since 2012. Until last year registrations were growing at more than 10% a year and production reached 1.67m vehicles, the second-highest figure since the turn of the century. It is not impossible the industry could suffer the same fate as its Italian counterpart, with large swathes of UK motor heritage shut down and moved to Turkey and the Czech Republic. The last UK factory to make Ford vans moved from Southampton to Turkey in 2012. Jaguar Land Rover, currently Britain’s largest car maker, has chosen is to transfer all production of its Land Rover Discovery model from the West Midlands to a plant in Slovakia, potentially putting hundreds of jobs at risk. It already makes its first electric vehicle – the i-Pace – in Austria. It is comforting for those who voted leave to dismiss the industry’s demands as sabre-rattling. After the emissions scandal, it would be understandable if car industry leaders were treated with disdain and told to get their own house in order before lecturing governments. But it is clear decisions are being made at the moment to the UK’s detriment and it will take a change of negotiating tactics to keep what is an almost entirely foreign-owned industry on side."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/26/the-spin-steve-smith-break-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T11:29:54Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith is set to return – maybe this break has done him some good | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/26/the-spin-steve-smith-break-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/26/the-spin-steve-smith-break-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith is set to return – maybe this break has done him some good","bodyText":"It’s been three months since the scandal. Right now, Steve Smith is getting ready for his comeback match. He has signed on for the Global T20 Canada and is set to play for the Toronto Nationals against the Vancouver Knights at the Maple Leaf ground in King City on Thursday. At a rough count, this is the fifth attempt to launch a North American T20 league in the past 12 years or so. A lot of men have lost a lot of money trying to sell live cricket to the Indian diaspora. The media company behind the Global T20 has spent more than most of them. It has hired David Warner too. He’s playing for the Winnipeg Hawks. On his way over Smith stopped in New York, his favourite city. He even proposed to his fiancee last year at the top of the Empire State Building. “Dani and I can spend four or five hours walking the streets without anyone batting an eyelid at us given cricket’s low profile in the country,” he wrote in his autobiography. It’s been a little different this time. Someone snapped a photo of him drinking a beer on his own and staring at his phone, and sold it to the Australian papers. “Disgraced Smith a sad sight in New York” was the Twitter pitch for the Herald Sun’s sorry story. Smith has been in the Toronto’s Globe and Mail, too. Darren Sammy is leading the Toronto team and the paper’s latest headline was “Former West Indies captain welcomes disgraced Australian Smith to Canada T20 League”. Smith is the league’s star turn. The tournament director, Jason Harper, was asked whether he had considered upholding Smith’s ban. “Are you kidding me? Steve Smith is a world-class player,” Harper said. “There is no way we would turn away Steve Smith when the phones open. No way. There is no way. He is welcome.” Now, there was another ball-tampering scandal just a few days back, in the second Test between West Indies and Sri Lanka. Dinesh Chandimal was filmed popping a sweet into his mouth then putting his saliva on the ball. Chandimal said he wasn’t guilty. He and his team refused to take the field for two hours in protest. At the hearing he said it was true he had put something in his mouth but couldn’t remember what it was. The match referee, Javagal Srinath, said the defence was “unconvincing”. Chandimal was banned for a match. Sri Lanka’s coach and manager were fined too, for bringing the game into disrepute. Most fans know that cricketers sometimes use sugary saliva to try to make the ball swing. In his autobiography, Marcus Trescothick admitted doing something similar during the 2005 Ashes. No one had heard of a cricketer using sandpaper before, as Cameron Bancroft did in South Africa. But still, there was a stark contrast in the coverage of the two stories. The Chandimal case passed almost unreported. It barely featured in the back pages, much less the front, it didn’t make the “and finally …” on the evening news, never mind the lead. It was another reminder then, of just how extraordinary the Cape Town scandal was. Cricket Australia has commissioned two reviews to try to find out exactly what went wrong. Neither has reported back yet, and right now, no one’s sure whether they will try to whitewash it or not. A survey that was sent around to the Australian players on the promise their answers would be anonymous was leaked to Fairfax Media just a fortnight ago. What are three things Australian cricket could do to improve the accountability of Cricket Australia? What do you believe are three significant contributors to the current culture in Australian cricket? What were the three primary causes of the events in South Africa? It has taken so long that it has been scooped by Good Weekend magazine, which has just published a brilliant piece by Jane Cadzow under the headline What turned Steve Smith into a cheat? Cadzow sketches a very different picture of Smith to the one we painted for you in the sports pages. She sees him as a man with a case of arrested development, someone who’s been cosseted and coddled by professionalism, who has spent so much time in the bubble that he had no idea what to do when it burst. Cadzow’s Smith is the kid who dropped out of high school so he could go play club cricket in Cheshire, then dropped out of club cricket in Cheshire because he was so homesick. Which fits with that last image of Smith, at his press conference in Sydney airport, in tears while he talked about how upset he was that he had hurt the “old man”. The two of them have been back in the nets again these last few months, just like they used to do when Smith was a boy. Playing cricket is pretty much the only thing Smith has ever known. There is a painful passage in his book, The Journey, when he explains that his agent had to persuade him to develop some interests outside of cricket. So Smith decided to invest in a couple of horses. Only, he said: “I’ve never actually had the chance to make it to the track to watch them race.” Seems the question facing Smith isn’t how many runs he’ll score in his comeback match, or whether he will be able to recapture his best form, but how much he has grown. The man’s done a lot of living in these last three months – more, maybe, than he managed in the past 29 years. This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

The gallery, with the sub-heading “Talk about a knock-out round …”, exclusively featured pictures of women, and was tweeted out with the description “The hottest fans at the #WorldCup” in a social media post that was subsequently removed. “The 1970s called and they want their misogyny back,” said one user in response to the now deleted tweet. A spokesperson for This Fan Girl – a campaign group working to transform the stereotypical image of female football supporters – said: “This list from Getty that has come out today is so disappointing. They need to do better; because of their size and influence, they have a huge responsibility to not perpetuate the toxic male primacy that exists in football.” Not everybody on social media disapproved of the gallery’s theme, with some posters suggesting that “jealousy” from “triggered feminists” was behind the complaints. The gallery has now been removed from Getty’s site, replaced with the message: “Earlier, we published a piece, ‘World Cup 2018: The Sexiest Fans’, that did not meet our editorial standards. We regret the error and have removed the piece. There are many interesting stories to tell about the World Cup and we acknowledge this was not one of them.” Confirming that Getty had not sought individual permission from the women pictured to feature them in the gallery in this way, a company spokesperson said there would now be an internal investigation. They added “Getty Images holds a deep belief in the power of visuals to incite change and shift attitudes and we have done, and will continue to do, much work to promote and create a more evolved and positive depiction of women.” Before the World Cup started, This Fan Girl was involved in a campaign to try to change image search results associated with female football fans. They say that while the World Cup has shown some progress in the portrayal of women at football matches, there is still much work to be done. “Football has come on leaps and bounds – the addition of Eni Aluko and Alex Scott to the World Cup commentary team is great, but then there’s Jason Cundy’s comments [on female match commentators] and Julieth Gonzalez Theran getting groped on camera whilst she was doing a live broadcast. “We started off buzzing about the progress, but every day there is more and more stuff that shows just how much our campaign to shift the focus to be more representative is needed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/27/spanish-exam-entries-on-track-to-surpass-french-in-english-schools","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T23:01:22Z","webTitle":"Spanish exam entries on track to surpass French in English schools","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/27/spanish-exam-entries-on-track-to-surpass-french-in-english-schools","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/27/spanish-exam-entries-on-track-to-surpass-french-in-english-schools","fields":{"headline":"Spanish exam entries on track to surpass French in English schools","bodyText":"Spanish is expected to overtake French as the main foreign language studied in classrooms in England in the next few years, and experts say German could face extinction from school timetables. A report by the British Council says that although the study of languages continues to decline, Spanish is bucking the trend, with entries up in both GCSEs and A-levels. Take-up of A-level French has fallen to 8,300, compared to 21,300 entries in 1997, and German is down to 3,300, but Spanish entries have climbed to 7,600. Based on current trends, Spanish is expected to overtake French as England’s most widely taught foreign language at A-level by 2020 and at GCSE by 2025. Vicky Gough, a schools adviser at the British Council, said: “There is a perception of Spanish being easier to pick up than other languages, which may account in part for its popularity, along with the fact that Spain is the most popular holiday destination for Brits, so young people can imagine having the chance to use it.” The diminishing popularity of languages in schools, sixth-forms and universities has been a source of concern to linguists for decades, and there have been fears more recently that Brexit could add to the trend. The British Council’s language trends survey 2018 found that more than a third (34%) of state secondary schools felt there had been a negative impact on student motivation and parental attitudes towards learning languages as a consequence of the vote to leave the EU. In the last 12 years French has lost nearly a third of A-level students while German is down by 37%. A quarter of state schools that offered German post-16 in the last three years no longer do so. “It’s German I’m really worried about,” said Suzanne O’Farrell, a curriculum and assessment specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders and a former headteacher and head of languages. “I think it’s in danger of extinction. “People are not offering it in schools. We will not have the teachers to teach it. There’s no take-up. As we see the rise of Spanish, it’s signalling the death knell of German.” Despite continuing efforts by the government to encourage the study of languages, recent figures show the proportion of pupils taking a GCSE in a language subject has fallen to 47%. Spanish entries have jumped from 58,000 in 2010 to 90,000 in 2017, while French entries have dropped from 160,000 to 130,000 over the same period. The report suggests new, tougher GCSEs may be deterring some lower-ability pupils from studying languages. Boys are far less likely to pursue a language than girls – 63% of languages candidates at A-level are female, and 56% at GCSE. The British Council report also highlights a growing divide in pupils’ access to the study of foreign languages, with uptake disproportionately lower at state schools in more disadvantaged areas. The report’s author, Teresa Tinsley, said: “The research shows that there is a growing rift between schools where languages are valued and developed imaginatively as part of a stimulating curriculum and those which are struggling to overcome disadvantage and a growth in negative attitudes. “These schools will need support and encouragement if all pupils across the board are to enjoy the enriching experience of learning a language.” The school standards minister, Nick Gibb, pointed out that the proportion of pupils taking a language GCSE had increased from 40% to 47% since 2010, with more disadvantaged pupils studying core academic subjects which include languages. He said: “It is critical that teachers encourage all pupils to take up a language, and we are supporting this through the creation of expert schools that will share best practice across the country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/26/prince-william-honours-holocaust-victims-jerusalem-israel-yad-vashem","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T18:39:52Z","webTitle":"Prince William asked to deliver ‘message of peace’ to Palestinian leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/26/prince-william-honours-holocaust-victims-jerusalem-israel-yad-vashem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/26/prince-william-honours-holocaust-victims-jerusalem-israel-yad-vashem","fields":{"headline":"Prince William asked to deliver ‘message of peace’ to Palestinian leader","bodyText":"Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, has sought to recruit the Duke of Cambridge as a peace envoy before the prince’s meeting with the Palestinian Authority leader, Mahmoud Abbas. At a meeting in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Rivlin asked the duke to deliver to Abbas “a message of peace”, telling him that together they had to build confidence and understanding to bring to an end “the tragedy between us that goes along for more than 120 years”. The duke, the first senior royal to pay an official visit to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, responded that he was “hoping that peace in the area can be achieved”. Talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014. The exchange took place on the first full day of engagements in Jerusalem on a visit diplomats have stressed is non-political. The duke met Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his wife Sara, who last week was charged with fraud and breach of trust for allegedly using public funds to pay for restaurant meals to be delivered to the couple’s official residence. Earlier, the duke paid tribute to the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust, standing with his head bowed before an eternal flame that flickers in their memory at the Holocaust museum Yad Vashem. He laid a wreath and was shown around a virtual cemetery where names and details of millions of victims are recorded on pages of testimony. The duke viewed an exhibit of shoes taken from Jews by the Nazis at a death camp, and the remains of a cattle truck used to transport victims. “It’s terrifying. I’m trying to comprehend the scale,” he said, wearing a black Jewish skullcap, a gift from Britain’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who accompanied him. It was a moment for sombre contemplation for the second in line to the British throne, shared with Holocaust survivors including Henry Foner, 86, and Paul Alexander, 80, who were among thousands of Jewish children who reached Britain and safety on the “Kindertransport”. There was a personal connection, too, for the prince, whose great-grandmother, Princess Alice of Greece, the mother of the Duke of Edinburgh, was granted the highest honour Israel grants to non-Jews for her role in hiding a Jewish family in her Athens palace during the Nazi occupation of Greece. The duke later met surfers on Tel Aviv beach, where well-wishers shook his hand. He also powered home two out of three penalty shots in Jaffa at a sports centre where charities bring together Jewish and Arab people through football. In a speech at a British Embassy reception, the duke pledged to help keep alive the memory of the Holocaust. “Israel’s remarkable story is partly one of remembering this terrible past but, also, looking forward to a much more hopeful future.” There was “an essential vibrancy to this country” he said, adding that ties between Israel and the UK have never been stronger. “Never has hope and reconciliation been more needed. I know I share a desire with all of you, and with your neighbours, for a just and lasting peace.” The duke was scheduled to meet Abbas, as well as Palestinian refugees and young people, in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah on Wednesday. The prince’s visit comes amid growing tensions in the region, with deadly clashes on the Gaza border following protests as Israel marks its 70th anniversary year, and the decision by the US president, Donald Trump, to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed holy city of Jerusalem. The Foreign Press Association (FPA) condemned the prime minister’s office after the Associated Press’s (AP) chief television producer, Nebi Qena, who had been accredited to cover Netanyahu’s meeting with the prince, was apparently barred by security guards who repeatedly asked about his “extraction”. Colleagues of Qena, who is originally from Albania and was educated in the UK, were allegedly questioned about his religion and whether he was a Muslim. The FPA said the incident was “disgraceful” and described it as “ethnic profiling”. An AP spokesman said: “The Associated Press decries this blatant ethnic and religious profiling of an AP journalist and calls on the prime minister’s office to cease such biased practice immediately.” Kensington Palace declined to comment.

Done believably, magic can be, well, spellbinding; but it can just as easily feel like the scoundrel’s way out of gaping plot holes. A trio of recent offerings play the supernatural three different ways: straight-faced, for laughs, and as a whodunnit. The Storm Keeper’s Island by Catherine Doyle (Bloomsbury, £6.99) takes its Celtic myth seriously, transporting 11-year-old Dublin kid Fionn Boyle out of the worrying present (his mum is ill, his dad died long ago, his sister is now a stranger) and into several pasts on an island humming with otherworldly force. Doyle is a dab hand at present-day sniping between siblings and takes a very original route around a magical plotline, in which Fionn’s grandfather holds the evil sorceress Morrigan at bay with candles full of memories – for now. Readers will hand over their disbelief gladly. Gangster School (Kate Wiseman, ZunTold, £6.99), by contrast, is set at a Hogwarts for would-be infamous baddies. In this romp full of wrongdoing, two noobs arrive at Blaggard’s in their first year: Milly – daughter of a forger – and Charlie, a hacker with a secret pet dog. They are, perhaps, a little lacking in the villainy department. When they uncover a plot to take over the school, however, it takes all their scheming to foil the evil Pecunia Badpenny and her levitating, laser-eyed robot hellhound. It’s all such knockabout fun that you overlook the parallels to that other establishment. The Last Chance Hotel by Nicki Thornton (Chicken House, £6.99) is a locked-room mystery in which a menagerie of oddly named guests arrive at the Bunns’ out-of-the-way establishment. In this hoot of a genre mashup, a kindly, reform-minded sorcerer is unexpectedly offed – seemingly by an apricot delice made by the frustrated kitchen boy. Young orphan Seth is actually an immensely talented chef, miserably indentured and bullied by the Bunns’ insufferable daughter; he has to turn sleuth in this magical milieu to figure out who is framing him, and why. Talking cats, mysterious notebooks full of ancient wickedness; what’s not to love? Magic’s appeal has its limits, though; some of the greatest children’s books are set firmly in the everyday. Two recent books share a preference for the real, and a watery theme. Splash is the fiction debut from the model turned campaigner turned author Charli Howard (Nosy Crow, £6.99) and tackles the eternal issue of changing bodies and bitchiness, as girls hit the primary/secondary cusp. Molly is built like the swimmer she is, but that’s not the body shape de rigueur at school, where her former BF, Chloe, leads the tormentors against her. Howard is great on the push-me-pull-you phenomenon of the female “frenemy”, who’s close enough to really wound. Sometimes, the freshest writers for girls are those who have only recently left girlhood behind. Adult novelist Adam Baron turns his hand to childhood’s middle years with Boy Underwater (HarperCollins, £6.99), a page-turner whose details will resonate with today’s young folk: picnic blankets from Decathlon, football on a Saturday, The Simpsons and – oh joy – even the board game Carcassonne all make an appearance. Cymbeline Igloo is the unfortunately named year-four boy who has never been in the water (so dry behind the ears that he has to Google “front crawl”), but can’t back out of a race with a bully. The aftermath of that pool session shakes Cym’s world. Faulty grown-ups, friendship fissures and the resourcefulness of children thrown into uncharted waters make this an absolute corker of a tale, whose delicate themes – mental health, missing loved ones – are handled with fluid grace.

Here’s the pieces you really should be reading. First, David Squires. Next: Argentina in meltdown. And a request for your valuable support. The teams are in for both matches in Group C. And a much-changed France team. And Jonathan Howcroft for the Socceroos moment of truth in Sochi. Join Barry Glendenning here for buildup for the match in Moscow. Great video from our man in Sochi, Christopher Knaus, ahead of Australia v Peru. Aussie fans are fearing that France and Denmark will play out a draw in Moscow, meaning that whatever they manage against Peru becomes immaterial. The World Cup has an uncomfortable history of such events, and one game above all others comes to mind. It is fair to say that Ronaldo is not universally loved. Paul Pogba chose a typically understated means by which to look ahead to France playing Denmark. From last’s night podcast. The social media hype is in full flow ahead of Australia’s big match. Unused sub Tim “#timcahill” Cahill has posted a picture of him sat on a bench. Here’s today’s World Cup Fiver, as penned by Rob Smyth. Rob Emsley emails in from lovely Newquay with a suggestion of how to liven up England v Belgium, the game that nobody, least of all Spanish Bob, seems to want to win. “Hello there, John Brewin. Have you considered the solution for Thursday that England and Belgium consent to switching ends and each attacking their own goal, thereby treating us to a spectacle of a properly fought-out game with the added bonus of goalkeepers who wouldn’t be allowed to handle the ball?” More on footballers being nice in real life. Presumably, this is isn’t Sir Gareth’s actual brother in law. Here’s Guardian Australia reporter Christopher Knaus, who is in Sochi as a Socceroos fan, with a taste of the atmosphere ahead of the match with Peru. It’s a tense atmosphere for Australian fans in Sochi this morning. The green and gold of the Socceroos is noticeably outnumbered by the red and white of the Peruvians, who are in typically high spirits despite being out of the tournament. All week, Peru flags have been raised atop the cabanas along Sochi’s main waterfront strip, which looks out to the Black Sea. The Peruvians have packed out the bars and restaurants since the weekend, and break out in spontaneous singing and dancing on the beaches. Fans are just beginning to leave for the hour or so drive out to Fisht Stadium, part of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics complex. The Peruvians are confident. I haven’t met a single one who doesn’t ardently believe they will smash the Socceroos and go home with pride. When the World Cup and the transfer window collide. Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini had said he will reveal on Sunday whether he stays at Manchester United. “I know where I will be playing next season and I will announce it in the coming days,” said the Low Countries’ answer to Antoine Griezmann and Lebron James. “I’m at the end of my contract and I want to be free in my mind. That’s why I’ll be announcing it next week.” Asked if he would reveal those plans on Sunday, July 1, he replied: “Yes.” Arsenal fans: get ready to celebrate your new signing... More on Pepe then off-field charmer from Robert Lowery. “Your anecdote about Pepe being a decent guy when not acting like a complete $*#@ on the field speaks to a nugget of wisdom I am fond of rolling out. We build these pictures of players characters in our minds often based on little beyond how they behave on the field, what they look like and what they say in brief boring interviews. Which of the Class of ‘92 is the sound one or who from the current England team would make a good brother in law? A friend of mine was even more stark in this regard. He reckoned that it takes such abnormal ego to make it to the very top that anyone looking at a player and saying “Yeah, we’d be mates” was probably making a losing bet.” David Penney here on Pepe. Don’t it make you feel good? “The theory I have on Pepe is that unlike 99.9% of us he doesn’t really view football as a sport, but more as a form of entertainment, like WWE, and when he steps onto the field he’s no longer Kepler Laveran de Lima Ferreira but ‘Pepe The Heel!’ and probably has a lot of fun playing him. I imagine that he’s baffled as to why nobody can understand this, in the same way Stefan Dennis would be if ever taken to task over the misdeeds of Paul Robinson.” The Nationalmannschaft’s most famous fan will not be attending Germany’s match with South Korea in Kazan. According to Associated Press, Chancellor Angela Merkel, under severe domestic political pressure in a dispute over migration, was asked if she would go to the match because she might not get another chance to see coach Joachim Loew’s team. Merkel said she has to be in parliament this week, “but of course I sincerely wish the team all the best and of course I hope for a good outcome after we all went through torture, in the truest sense of the word during the last game.” News from the Belgium camp, via the Press Association. Every member of the Belgium squad - apart from Romelu Lukaku, who continues to be assessed after having a scan on an ankle injury - trained on Tuesday morning. Manager Roberto Martinez has hinted that he will make changes and midfielder Marouane Fellaini said: “If we want to go far in this World Cup, we will need every player. Everybody is ready to play, everybody wants to play. It will be an interesting game against England, but it will be a strange one also because both teams are qualified.” A couple of tweets from readers still exercised by last night’s VAR controversy and general ref rage. A personal view: it’s made what might have been rubbish games into some highly amusing spectacles. And there’s plenty more where that came from. This was a truly excellent game. Who needed Maradona when you had Hagi? How about those Golden Boot standings? Cristiano Ronaldo might have been level with Harry Kane had he not missed that penalty last night against Iran. The Uruguay v Portugal match last-16 tie set for Saturday looks set to be true a VAR nasty, and brings back memories of the 2006 World Cup match, played at the same stage of the competition. It ended 1-0 to Portugal in Nuremburg, but the real scoreline was in the collection of two red cards each and 16 yellows overall. The image of Barcelona team-mates Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Deco sat with each other on a stadium step watching the game play out is indelible but here’s a picture of them doing battle on the pitch and our report from that night. Nobody wants to see football played like that until the chaos descends. After the glory of their opening two matches, Russian fans took losing to Uruguay pretty hard. Andrew Roth reports. And on the home front, here’s some Liverpool news. Roberto Martínez has been speaking ahead of England v Belgium. Asked whether English players had improved technically, he said: “Very good question. I think it’s been a huge evolution. When I started in the Premier League in 2009 it was a real contrast in styles in the league, but I think the English players have developed an incredible awareness from a tactical point of view. That’s been the biggest difference in the last five or six years. Having St George’s Park, having a real structure in the way England teams play, you’ve seen the success with the Under-17 teams, and the Under-20s, the way there is a winning culture, and probably I would say in the last six years the English players have now got that intensity and the real pace, but with a real tactical awareness, that is brought by the way teams are playing in the Premier League.” Kári Tulinius emails in. “One moment from yesterday that I found quite touching, but hasn’t gotten much attention, was seeing Pepe, of cartoonish football villainy fame, console an Iranian player (Pouraliganji, I think, but I’m not sure). It was a lovely, humane gesture from a source not normally associated with lovely, humane gestures.” I am told, by friends who have spoken to him on a regular basis, that Pepe is actually a really nice bloke. My own interaction with him is limited, but when it comes to turning down a chat in a mixed zone there are few more polite in delivering their rebuffs. Anywhere, here’s an image to perhaps change some minds. There have been some cultural issues Down Under. From elsewhere in the world of football, Suzanne Wrack has news on Sheffield FC. Spain got lucky last night against Morocco and they know it. Somehow, they managed to top Group B and will face Russia in Moscow on Sunday. AS and Marca had identical headlines declaring: “Long Live VAR!” Consummate diplomat Sergio Ramos is asking for everyone to cool their boots, while admitting that there is much to be ironed out. “We got through and won the group, that was the objective, but the game wasn’t good at all for us, it’s a night for everyone in the squad to take a look at themselves, we need to get ourselves into gear,” the Kop’s pariah said. “There’s no need to panic, but we do need to evaluate ourselves generally and individually, we can all contribute more and be more balanced defensively and solid so we can make the difference in attack.” Defence looks to be Spain’s biggest problem, judging by their three group matches. “When you play in a team that causes so much damage in attack you have to be a little more careful, that’s what makes the difference, we need to be more solid, there’s no margin for error now, one mistake will throw you out,” Ramos said. “We prefer to do our talking on the pitch and I hope we can have a great game against Russia, who have been playing at a very high level. I hope we can impose ourselves on them, we need to show who we are as soon as possible.” All you hip young gunslingers who use Instagram should sign up to the Guardian Sport account for great stuff like this. David Squires’ latest is here for your amusement and delectation. David Penney emails in. “One reason I love the World Cup is to discover great players that I previously was unaware of. Last time it was Mexico’s Andres Guardado, who is a cracking player. This time, coincidentally another left winger, Denmark’s Pione Sisto; seems like a real handful! Can’t wait to see how he fares against France.” Pre-tournament darlings/cynical hatchet men on our brave boys (delete where applicable) Panama are going home, but not without a final fixture with Tunisia in Nizhny Novgorod. Here’s where pride can be salvaged, in the style of Saudi Arabia’s defeat of Egypt on Monday. Their goalscorer in the 6-1 defeat to England, Felipe Baloy, who will be retiring from international football after the match, has been talking. “We’ve studied Tunisia, who are a difficult rival, but still it is an opportunity to achieve a historic win,” he said on Tuesday. “The experience in Russia has been top-notch, we hope that Panama can keep growing. As a group we’ve had a good coexistence in which we’ve spent time with the youngest players, who will stay on.” Morning all, let’s begin this session with a quiz. “What happened next?” was always the best round of Question of Sport. You’ll have to imagine David Coleman’s gleeful chuckles yourself, though. That’s all from me as I prepare to pass the baton smoothly over to the enlightening John Brewin for more news, quips and commentary on what has been a brilliant World Cup so far. Thanks for your company, and your emails. Goodbye It’s Denmark v France at 3pm BST today and the French press have added a bit of needle by dragging up some pre-tournament quotes from Åge Hareide. The Denmark insists his comments were taken out of context, but could the fact he said France were “nothing special”, they lacked a “leader such as Zinedine Zidane” and Pogba only cared about his haircut come back to bit him? As Ed Aarons reports, these teams have history … Is Jorge Valdano’s damning take on the ugly obsession with winning that is crippling Argentinian football the best football article ever written? Big talk, you say, but Gary Lineker has gone that far … Don’t cry for me Argentina, read it and weep … Belgium could make as many as 10 changes against England, with Roberto Martínez intent on keeping competition for places fierce … The Group G decider seems to be the match noon is too bothered about winning, and here’s why: The Guardian’s top man in Russia Daniel Taylor reckons Gareth Southgate faces a dilemma over Harry Kane for Thursday’s final group game against Belgium. To play or not to play is the conundrum for the waist-coated one: Mark Pearson reckons that it’s not the on-field referees who are to blame for the VAR fails, it’s their fully-kitted friends in the studio. Don’t hate the player, hate the game is the general gist of his email: “In defence of the referee (not something I ever thought I’d say) last night, he got the decision right in the first instance. He was then told by a team of officials with access to multiple replays that he should have another look, which inevitably plants the suggestion in his mind that he got it wrong. From the replays we were shown at home, angle A made it look like a handball (it looked like it dropped straight onto his arm rather than being headed against his arm), where as angles B, C, D, etc, made it very clear that it was accidental. For some reason, the poor ref was only shown the same few frames from angle A again and again, rocked back and forth with the ball hitting the arm. Based on the evidence he was shown, it looked like a stonewall penalty. So the fault is with the guys in the VAR room, not the ref. Another example of VAR poorly implemented.” Des Kelly begs to differ … Maradona, Henderson and a Uruguayan love affair feature in our latest World Cup gallery … Richard Parkin earlier suggested Isco and Jamie Redknapp were separated at birth, but how about Diego Costa and Fernando Hierro. Something of a father and son combo, although I’m not sure which one’s the dad … Another day brings another depressing set of comments from a football dinosaur about the brilliant women who are finally getting a chance on our screens at the World Cup. “High-pitched tone” might not be what you want Jason Cundy, but low-rent sexism isn’t doing it for us … Away from the World Cup for a moment, and Ajax have have admitted to providing “inadequate” on-field medical treatment for Abdelhak Nouri after he collapsed during a pre-season friendly last year. Nouri was living his dream, playing for Ajax, when he collapsed on the pitch and suffered permanent brain damage. Stuart James’s interview with Nouri’s family in Ajax in December was one of the most brilliantly moving pieces of last year and well worth a read … The consensus among Guardian readers seems to be that VAR is good for offsides, violence conduct, etc. But that it falls down when it comes to matter of opinion such as penalties. “The problem with VAR decisions on penalty kicks (or any fouls) is it is simply another exercise of subjective judgement,” emails Robert F Speed. “ I see no real benefit in making a subjective decision again, what with the delays and lack of transparency involved. Better to stick with the real-time, real-life decision. If improvements can be made, focus on improving the on-field decisions (my two cents – two refs, two heads, four eyes would be an improvement in this regard). On the other hand, VAR for offside is brilliant. There are far fewer offside stoppages now – marginal decisions are delayed until the next natural stoppage, and it means the goal chances can proceed without being stopped for (often incorrect) close offside decisions.” Johnny Bennett wants VAR ditched completely. “The problem with VAR – and it always will be a problem – is that almost all decisions made in football are subjective, meaning that a TV replay will not lead to significantly better decision-making,” he writes. “Any improvement in terms of decisions will therefore always be marginal and will never outweigh the cost to the game of introducing long stoppages and a non-human element to what is the most popular game in the world precisely because of its flowing, madcap style. Will they get rid of it before round 2?” Morocco’s Nordin Amrabat gave his verdict on VAR after Iago Aspas’s injury-time equaliser for Spain was given – correctly – on the strength of video evidence. Warning, it ain’t pretty … Thorbjörn Thordárson will be presenting the news in Iceland when around 99.6% of the nation’s tellies are glued to the other channel for the national team’s decisive game against Croatia tonight. Paul MacInnes has tracked down the man no one watches, and asked if he has the loneliest job in the world … Bob OHara was aghast at the award of Iran’s penalty last night, but thinks we are training our anger in the wrong direction. “Was VAR really the problem with the handball last night?” he says via email. “I agree with everybody [except the ref] that it was the wrong decisions, but is the problem that the interpretation of the handball rule?” Fair point Bob. There was a similarly ludicrous handball penalty given in the Saudi Arabia-Egypt game yesterday. Players have arms Fifa, deal with it. “They make you feel like a criminal because you lost a game,” said Jorge Sampaoli yesterday so who knows what he will face if Argentina go out tonight. They must beat Nigeria for a start, and Sampaoli used his pre-game press conference to hit back at reports that a squad mutiny tried to force his sacking. Ed Aarons has the story … Undoubtedly my favourite VAR moment so far was when the referee in the Brazil v Costa Rica game overturned his decision to award a penalty for a ‘foul’ on Neymar. The PSG striker had tried to con the ref – and succeeded – but the ref had the last laugh once he saw the replay. Neymar’s brilliant, no doubt, but his theatrics are infuriating, and if VAR stamps out some of that sort of thing then that must be a good thing. Let us know your best VAR moment. In the meantime thanks to Ian McCourt, formerly of this parish now swanning around Germany last we heard, for this little titbit … Thanks Richard and welcome one and all, wherever you are. Respectably-weathered I don’t know but it’s roasting again in London today. Today’s hot topic is VAR again – where will it end you say! – and no one is hotter under the collar than Alan Shearer, whose MOTD meltdown was something to behold after Iran were awarded a penalty for handball against Portugal’s Cédric Soares. If he [the referee] thinks that’s a deliberate handball then he’s crazy. In his rule-book, every time it hits a hand it’s a penalty. It’s ridiculous. How can he do anything about that? He’s half a yard away and the defender’s eyes are closed. There’s no way on earth that’s a deliberate handball. That was my fear coming into this tournament, that you’re going to get decisions like this. It turns the game into an absolute farce. It’s nonsense, it’s utter nonsense. I’m trying to keep calm without swearing. I’m getting angry here because that’s just a ludicrous decision.” Oh Alan, for once you are so right. And on that note, I think it’s time for Guardian’s mobile floating station off the coast of Australia (where it’s currently hailing) to hand over to somewhere more respectably-weathered. One last correspondence: Hey Richard, this is Arun from Bangalore. What are the chances that France and Denmark will play out a “mutually beneficial dishonourable boring draw” today and kick the Aussies out of the competition? At the same time, if by any chance, the game actually does end in a draw, what chances that both will be accused of colluding? Cheers Arun, it’s a good question. But rest assured. No two European nations have ever colluded at a World Cup to produce a result that benefits them both to the detriment of a plucky upstart nation; or so my Algerian friend informs me. Thanks for your company today - apologies for the terrific tweets/emails we couldn’t pack in but please keep them coming for Rob Bleaney, who will be your man in the hotseat shortly. Alle les Bleus, boo-es les Danes, los geht’s die Socceroos! A little gem that’s surfaced over the past 24 hours is this tweet from 2017, which is entirely hilarious (unless you live west of the Odra/Nysa river), from Poland’s captain, Robert Lewandowski. As we mentioned on this blog when Sergio Ramos was remonstrating with the match officials accusing his Real Madrid buddy Cristiano Ronaldo of simulation during Spain vs Portugal, there are few things more enjoyable than when club-mates become international rivals. We’re calling this some Bayern-on-Bayern banter backfire: (*Ron Howard voice*) “He didn’t”. And with Cristiano Ronaldo having avoided a ban yesterday, for those following #XhakaShakirigate (or no -gate suffix, depending very much on your perspective) there has also been confirmation from Fifa that the two Swiss players have escaped a ban over their goal-celebrations from the match against Serbia. Fans of Germany, Mexico, Sweden or even (albeit remote) South Korea take note should the Swiss qualify, for when the knockout pairings for Groups E and F are decided. Now if you’re a Group D devotee and you’re worried that we haven’t raked the coals sufficiently about Iceland or Nigeria’s chances in today’s match, this is for you - it’s Guardian’s World Cup Football Daily with very special guests Aanu Adeoye and Maggi Mar Einarsson to give some expert insights into their nations’ chances: It’s truth perhaps, amid all the amazing stories that are exploding out of this World Cup thus far, that we’ve hardly spoken about everyone’s favourite little Scandinavian nation that could - Iceland; punching above their weight and threatening to send home Argentina at their first ever World Cup. It’s a remarkable story, and as commenter Zepp rightly points out: Iceland, with the exception of Icelanders, has to be everyone’s second favourite team in this world cup. You’d have to be a herring-hating Norwegian to disagree with that statement, one would imagine. Now a piece that’s been doing the rounds a fair bit among my high-browed associates of the twitter-sphere is the following, and it just so happens to be from your humble friends at the Guardian. If you’re late to the party that is Russia 2018 and trying to understand how it is that Argentina; the Argentina; could be about to exit the World Cup today, then the following from Jorge Valdano could be a fair place to start: Uruguay’s veteran coach, Óscar Tabárez, has been credited with overseeing a revolution of his nation’s footballing philosophy following a spell of just one qualification in four attempts. After yesterday they’ve now never NOT made it to the knockout rounds under his stewardship, thanks to a root-and-branch reform that’s become known as “Proceso de Institucionalización de Selecciones y la Formación de sus Fútbolistas”. If, heaven forbid, Messi and friends depart today, could neighbours Argentina be overdue such an overhaul? Stephen Holliday writes with one more fascinating aspect of the whole VAR gift-that-keeps-giving: Brit living in LA here. Maybe my surroundings are rubbing off on me and my knowledge of anything to do with soccer, aka, football, is waning but do the six or seven VAR chaps really have to be decked out in full on refs kit? Also, it’s not working is it? Here’s a potentially controversial decision, let’s make it more controversial by not quite revealing whether the main ref changes his mind by watching his off-pitch monitor, or whether he’s told to change his mind. It’s an interesting point, Stephen, and as we posted earlier, one that Iran’s coach Carlos Queiroz definitely took exception to; the lack of transparency surrounding the decision making process. Will we eventually enter a brave-new-world scenario where conversation between the room of VARs and the on-field referee are played live to clarify this? As for the necessity of the full kit for VARs, that’s one thing I hope will never change. Like your flatmate getting dressed in a full suit ahead of a cup final on Football Manager, it’s absolutely priceless. I once took Hereford to a European Cup final in Championship Manager. I was in my dressing gown but, and we lost. Not a day goes by that I don’t look out bus windows and wonder if we’d have won that if I was in a Gareth Southgate waistcoat. And some more of your musings. The commenter “Nil-all” (a score you’ll remember is yet to feature in Russia 2018) poses the following conundrum: If VAR can only review red card decisions, penalties and mistaken identity, how come CR7 gets a yellow from a VAR review? Commenter “ollib” muses along similar lines: I thought the Ronaldo elbow was a clear red once the ref had decided to penalise it. An off the ball elbow in the face? That’s a red all day, no? If the ref had decided it wasn’t a foul, fair enough, it was a bit of a 50:50 decision. But if he’s going to give a card it HAS to be red for the foul he’s penalising. Whereas “USfan” appears reasonably fatalistic about it all: Were it not for VAR, there would be an unacceptable number of games in this World Cup whose outcome was determined by poor officiating. As it is, there is merely an infuriating number of games in this World Cup affected by poor officiating. All that said and done, despite VAR-cicle outcomes (real or imagined) I’m inclined to nevertheless land on this as Chris Wilson has: What a night of football last night. What a world cup. Never end. Just, never end. Meanwhile, a vote from our friend “Birbkamp” on the Isco/Redknapp debate: Very tidy work. I think further questions might one day be asked. A name that’s also getting a fair bit of circulation in recent Aust-football-press is Daniel Arzani, who you might recall is the youngest player selected for any nation at this year’s World Cup. The 19-year-old enjoyed a break-out season in Australia’s domestic A-League competition, and has certainly sparkled in his two brief cameos at the tournament thus far. And he’s certainly caught the attention of Opta Stats, who offered this fun fact: Let’s hope the one-time-subject of an alleged bidding war between Australia and Iran hasn’t spent too much emotion following Team Melli’s nerve-jangling exit yesterday and is relaxed and focused for the battle with Peru. You may have noticed Robbie Kruse’s name in that earlier list of ten most talked about footballers (from an Australian perspective) - and the much-maligned winger’s spot has definitely been under threat given the performances of young Arzani. Unfortunately for Kruse, much of the anger comes presumably from his “backpfeifengesicht” (German: face that should be slapped) - with Kruse’s hangdog looks after another missed final-third chance perhaps overshadowing the fact that the Bochum flyer often plays a pivotal role during the build up to attacks with his clever movement and mobility, in the minds of many. I speculate. There’s been a very prominent campaign from outspoken pundits and former Socceroos Robbie Slater and Mark Bosnich to compel coach Bert van Marwijk to select Tim Cahill - he of the golden forehead, and scorer at three consecutive World Cups - a ploy the Dutchman has thus-far resisted at the tournament. In fact an Australian tabloid has gone even further, laying out its stall with this front page instruction: In fact, so strong has been the clamour for selection of the 38-year-old Melbourne City-cum-Millwall substitute against Peru, he’s figured highly on the list of footballers Australia’s talking about at the World Cup - despite not even taking part in the action thus far: Neymar, Ronaldo, Messi, Cahill. Arguably the tournament’s four biggest names right there. But enough of the past; to the future! And for the benefit of our antipodean audience, let’s turn our attention to Australia’s date-with-destiny, and/or Peru. So first, the permutations. How do the 43rd ranked nation navigate a way to just their second ever knock-out rounds? As discussed yesterday, statistical wonks Nate Silver and friends at FiveThirtyEight have Australia as just a 14% probability of progressing; but as Han Solo was want to say, “never tell me the odds” - and I’m almost certain Mile Jedinak has ripped the arm off somebody after losing a game of cyber-chess, so.. Kieran Pender sees it slightly more optimistically for Australia, as he writes from Sochi: Now a result that may have surprised some last night given their stunning form across their first two games was the capitulation of host nation Russia, who appeared to run out of juice against Uruguay, pressing self-destruct inside 45 minutes with a hapless show of defensive urgency and a brain explosion double-yellow, red, for fill-in fullback Igor Smolnikov. Perhaps it is masterful mind-games from the wily veteran coach, Stanislav Cherchesov; lowering expectations in a fixture that ultimately didn’t matter for his side? In Russia’s defence it was a much-changed line up with an eye on yellow cards and resting veterans like Yuri Zhirkov. And while the match as a contest may have ended relatively early on, it also gave rise to a new contest - worst barnet at Russia 2018 - as Uruguay introduced Jar-Jar Binks Diego Laxalt at left back. Jérôme Boateng and Neymar emit a collective sigh of relief. One thing I forgot to mention earlier - so please help me settle a debate here. Isco. Is he just a poor man’s Iberian Jamie Redknapp? Like two peas from a pod. A pod that inherited no genetic material from ol’ ‘Arry. And if Morocco departed the tournament with their reputations and pan-African pride slightly more intact, there was no such luck for north African neighbours Egypt in Group A, who at least allowed Saudi Arabia to save face after a tournament that seemed to go downhill ever since before they even started with coach Bert van Marwijk walking out after qualifying. We’ve seen some late goals across the tournament but 90+5 sure does seem an unnecessarily cruel dagger to take. And then there’s the fallout of whether or not Mohammed Salah has in fact played his last game for the Egyptian national side (see yesterday’s blog). Poor old Héctor Cúper. He seems a nice man. No? The high drama of Iran-Portugal was made even more thrilling with the knowledge that simultaneously all manner of untold fresh mayhem was breaking out in the concurrent fixture between Spain and Morocco. Morocco taking the lead? Morocco re-taking the lead late with one of the best headed goals you’ll see at the tournament? A late Spanish lifeline chalked out for offside; but then re-instated? Iago Aspas! Dr-ah-ma. With Noureddine Amrabat on a one-man mission to just destroy people (by fair means or foul) and Gerard Pique handing out two-footed slides like nobody’s business, it only lacked Diego Costa flicking a switch to full-Hulk-mode to make this one a five-star classic. Bad news for lovers of chiseled dreamboats, therefore. The one, the only Herve Renard has therefore had to leave the tournament. But not before he stole your heart. Twitter and the Daily Mail certainly made a fair bit of the Moroccan coach, didn’t they? Funny, nobody seemed to mention it when he coached Cambridge United. Nor was coach Carlos Queiroz too happy with VAR’s interventions, especially in the decision to award Cristiano Ronaldo just a yellow card for an off-the-ball elbow thrown at Morteza Pouraliganji. In fairness the contact wasn’t as blatant as simulation from Pepe, but depending on your subjective allegiance the biggest name in world football could have been out of the tournament, thanks to the robot men upstairs. Imagine that. On your bike, CR7, hello VAR-heaven. I don’t know. I seem to always get these wrong. Yussuf Poulsen’s handball v Australia was 100% a penalty for mine, and yet Cédric Soares’s one last night in similar circumstances? 0%. Should Ronaldo have gone? Let us know. Yay. Nay. In all honestly, after the fighting way that Iran approached that match, and the pure courage with which they conducted themselves, you can’t help but feel moved by their heartbreak. Coach Carlos Queiroz said the team had no interest in “heroic failure” but unlucky for them; they got it in spades. There were beautiful moments amid the sadness, the manner in which players consoled one another, with genuine sympathy and shared pain spoke volumes to the character of these Iranian men. A lot like how Brazil’s teammates rushed to a tear-ridden Neymar. So four cracking matches ahead. I’m still licking my lips like a kitten at milk following the sudden upgrade from three to four per matchday. But before we delve too deeply into today’s games, how bout that which proceeded last night? Phwoar. Queiroz v his native land; Suárez v the host nation; the Red Sea derby; the Straits of Gibraltar derby (or Alboran Sea derby, if that’s what you prefer) - four great fixtures with more subplots than Cleopatra could clasp to her bosom. Iago Aspas! (A 45 year-old keeper! At the World Cup! A goal-tending Roger Milla!) VAR reared it’s forked-tongued head not once but at least thrice in a tempestuous clash between Portugal and Iran. After 0/12 wins at World Cup 2014 the West Asian giants looked to strike a significant blow for AFC nations; and came within a veritable whisker near the end of doing so. Fans have come within minutes of contemplating the World Cup knockout rounds without either Germany, Brazil or Argentina thus far; but imagine no Cristiano Ronaldo as well? Madness. Poor Mehdi Taremi. We’ve seen our fair share of tears at World Cups over the years but if ever there’s been a soul who wanted the ground to just open up and swallow him whole, it was the Al-Gharafa striker, whose 90 +4 minute shot could have produced one of the all-time World Cup miracles. If you missed any of that match, do take the time to relive the match report. High. Drama. Personified. Unlucky for some, that’s day 13 - and as nations from Groups C and D discover their respective fates who will emerge triumphant, and whose quadrennial dream will be shattered? Yesterday we had 3 out of 4 of the games as “live” fixtures, ie with something very much at stake; but today we can happily report all four of our games could prove very lively, with seven of the eight nations still eyeing qualification to the knockout stages. As pressure goes, few will be under more than Argentina’s beleaguered coach Jorge Sampaoli who has, we believe, survived a palace coup and will coach the side for their decisive clash against Nigeria. Whether or not he’s picked that side remains to be seen. Pressure too on Lionel Messi - who hasn’t cut an entirely calm figure this tournament amid the constant comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo and the expectation that somehow his entire legacy as a player will unravel unless his underperforming Albicelestes colleagues win at Russia 2018. First though, they have to escape the group stage. It’s not entirely in the hands of the five-time finalists, but at least they face their nearest rivals, Nigeria, directly, with Iceland’s hopes rather thin, albeit not entirely impossible. That’s more than their close rivals (alphabetically, at least) Australia can hope for, with Bert van Marwijk’s chargers needing not just a win over an eliminated Peru, but also no acts of charity from France against their European buddies Denmark. Neither are anything near guarantees, and there might be a game-within-a-game distraction as the “will-he, won’t he” furore surrounding whether 38-year-old Tim Cahill will be allowed to save his nation once again escalates as the games near conclusion. Day 13 schedule: 3pm BST/5pm MSK/midnight AEST: Denmark v France, Match 37, Moscow 3pm BST/5pm MSK/midnight AEST: Australia v Peru, Match 38, Sochi 7pm BST/9pm MSK/4am Wednesday AEST: Nigeria v Argentina, Match 39, Saint Petersburg 7pm BST/9pm MSK/4am Wednesday AEST: Iceland v Croatia, Match 40, Rostov on Don So plenty in store - as always please sent your best quips, insights and conspiracy theories to us to join the conversation.

Today, she can rarely stay in the same place for any length of time and is more likely to be keeping her ears alert to signs of danger. At times she needs bodyguards or goes into hiding. “I wake up each morning and thank God I am still alive,” said the Amadiba woman, who has been told she is on a hit list. “I know I am a target. My husband and my family and friends are worried. They tell me to go into hiding. But I can’t do that. It’s not me. I choose this road.” She is battling for her community’s right to say no to the exploitation of their territory. South African judges have been considering this question since 20 April, when Mbuthuma and her neighbours got their day in court against an Australian mining company that has pushed for access to lucrative titanium deposits discovered in the russet dunes where she used to play. Defence of this land – located in an ecologically rich coastal region of Pondoland – has pitted Mbuthuma against her tribal chief and the regional government. Several of her fellow campaigners have been killed after being warned not to oppose a project that would bring jobs and money to one of the poorest regions in South Africa. Mbuthuma is uncowed. She says residents of her village of Xolobeni are overwhelmingly opposed and without their approval, the mining company and its supporters should back off. “The law says we have a right to be consulted, but what we say doesn’t seem to matter. We have told the company many times that we don’t want their mine. How many times do we have to say no?” she asks. The 42-year-old is an accidental activist. During her teens, she found work as guide for foreigners wanting to see the Pondoland biodiversity zone which sits between sub-tropical and temperate climates. As well as a multitude of endemic species, visitors were attracted by whales off the coast and rugged inland landscape that was used for the set of the film Blood Diamond. With the European Union planning to back further eco-tourism projects, it looked for a while as if this could be a turning point in the development of this region, Life changed with the arrival of an Australian mining company Mineral Commodities with still bigger investment plans to turn the area into an opencast pit for the extraction of zircon, rutile and titanium, which is used in countless products including laptop computers, bicycles, golf clubs, watches and drill bits. The proposal, which aimed to generate annual revenues of £140m for the 25-year life of the mine, divided the Amadiba community. Those living in the inland half were largely in favour because their land would be relatively unaffected, they would have a new road and the possibility of jobs. Residents closer to the coast were opposed. They feared they would lose their farms, that rivers would be contaminated, wildlife driven away and future generations condemned to a miserable existence in townships. They also suspected a racial hangover from the apartheid era. During that period of segregation and white rule, Pondoland was designated a homeland under black tribal rule. This meant nominal political autonomy but economic neglect. Twenty-six years on, Mbuthuma says its legacy remains. “Why are they doing this here? Why not in a white area? It is because it is cheaper. Discrimination is still entrenched in our economy.” Her inspiration is her grandfather, a veteran of the 1960 Pondoland revolt, one of the first major protests against apartheid. “He told me all the stories about how he used to fight and why. It was to keep the land and ensure the people are happy. Now he says it is up to me, that my decisions must not hurt the next generation.” She says her tribe’s current chieftain has failed in this task by accepting a directorship in the mining company and a new 4x4 in return for approving a deal he had no right to make. Tradition, she said, dictated that such big decisions could only be made by consensus at a meeting in the great hall of the tribe. The mining company said it was listening to community leaders and opponents’ fears are largely unfounded. It promised not to destroy homes, to leave dunes untouched, to create buffer zones beside ecologically sensitive areas and to restore the land after the work is finished. “The company believes that the development of the mine and the balancing of the environmental impacts with the social and economic upliftment can be managed to the satisfaction of all stakeholders,” said Mark Caruso, executive chairman of Mineral Commodities, which is now in the process of divesting its 56% share in the project. What nobody doubts is that the once strong community is now violently divided. Mbuthuma and others opposed to the mine formed the Amadiba crisis committee in 2007. In 2015, four of their members were assaulted in the wake of a visit by mining consultants. A year later, the leader of the group, Sikhosiphi “Bazooka” Rhadebe – was shot dead after he organised a road block to forestall drilling operations. Mbuthuma feels threatened by the supporters of the mining project. “Bazooka said we were on a hit list. He warned me to go into hiding,” she said. “His last words to me were ‘Go home, stay indoors. Those guys are after us’.” Although she does not trust the police, she has faith in the courts and the power of international public opinion. In the wake of Rhadebe’s killing, the government imposed a moratorium on the mining project. It is due to expire later this year, but Mbuthuma hopes her legal case, which was heard in the Pretoria high court in April 2018, will be decided before then. Her lawyer, Johan Lorenzen, says judges have the chance to clear a hangover of the apartheid era by recognising the right of communities like Xolobeni to say no to mineral extraction. “Mining is South Africa’s original sin. There’s a fetish around it,” he said. “But this case can be precedent-making. If we win, it will dramatically change the power dynamics.” Mbuthuma sees the issue more in terms of choice and participation. She is not rejecting investments, but wants to be sure they are not destructive and that they serve local people over the long term. “When it comes to development, you have to be involved. You can’t just think about now. You have to think about tomorrow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/24/erdogan-claims-victory-in-turkish-presidential-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T06:29:44Z","webTitle":"Turkey election: Erdoğan strikes combative tone in victory speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/erdogan-claims-victory-in-turkish-presidential-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/erdogan-claims-victory-in-turkish-presidential-election","fields":{"headline":"Turkey election: Erdoğan strikes combative tone in victory speech","bodyText":"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has addressed thousands of supporters in Ankara after being declared the victor in Turkey’s presidential election, saying democracy was the winner and that Turkey was “an example for the rest of the world”. “We have received the message that has been given to us in the ballot boxes,” he said, speaking from the balcony of the AK party’s headquarters in Ankara, to a large crowd of cheering and flag-waving supporters. “We will fight even more with the strength you provided us with this election.” He began by apologising for being late to the balcony speech, saying this was due to the fact that a small child was injured in the crowd in Istanbul, where he had been speaking before, and he went to speak to the child’s family. Erdoğan spoke of his commitment to “fight terroristic organisations”, “to continue the fight to make the Syrian grounds freer” and to increase the “international prestige” of Turkey, saying: “Turkey has no moment to waste, we know that.” “Our flag will flutter more freely, the peace of every citizen will be advanced,” he said, before leading the crowd in a chant of “One nation, one flag, one country, one state.” Earlier on Sunday night, the country’s electoral board said the incumbent had won with 97.7% of votes counted. Even before this declaration, Erdoğan seemed sure of the result. “Our people have given us the job of carrying out the presidential and executive posts,” Erdoğan said on Sunday night, even while ballots were still being tallied. “I hope nobody will damage democracy by casting a shadow on this election and its results to hide their failure.” The main opposition party did not immediately concede defeat, but after initially saying Erdoğan would fall well short of a first-round victory, it later said it would continue its democratic struggle “whatever the result”. The official Anadolu Agency reported that, with 99% of votes counted, Erdoğan had won a 52.54% share of the national vote, while the opposition CHP party’s candidate, Muharrem İnce, was on 30.68%. The pro-Kurdish party, known as the HDP, took 11.67% of the vote, passing the 10% threshold to enter parliament for a second consecutive term. This diluted the majority of Erdoğan’s ruling party, the AKP, but fell short of the numbers needed to overturn that majority after a surprise showing by the AKP’s nationalist allies. “This sets the stage for speeding up reforms,” the Turkish deputy prime minister, Mehmet Şimşek, tweeted of the results. The winner of the presidential race is set to assume extraordinary new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year that was marred by allegations of fraud. These include complete control of the cabinet and the power to appoint senior judges and officials, including unelected vice-presidents. The president will also have the power to issue decrees with the force of law. Those powers will allow the victor to transform Turkey’s political scene for years and possibly decades to come, governing until 2028 if he wins re-election. Opposition candidates had pledged to overturn the presidential system if they had won. The results, if they stand, will be a disappointment to the opposition, which had hoped to push Erdoğan into a second-round runoff against İnce, and to wrest control of the legislature from the AKP. Erdoğan and his party have governed unopposed for 16 years. The president called early the snap elections in April hoping to preempt worsening economic trends and to catch the opposition by surprise. He looked set to win easily in a presidential race and in parliament in alliance with the nationalists, projecting an image of a commander-in-chief fighting external enemies inside Turkey and across the border in Syria, and triumphant against terror groups. But the opposition mounted a dynamic election campaign, with its presidential candidate İnce drawing crowds in the hundreds of thousands in rallies in the country’s largest cities of Istanbul, İzmir and Ankara, and criss-crossing the country on dozens of rallies. Turnout at the elections hovered around an extraordinary 87% of the electorate, exceeding that of last year’s referendum. Opposition officials cried foul as soon as results began coming in, with the state-run Anadolu Agency announcing preliminary results more than two hours earlier than expected and opening with a massive lead for Erdoğan and his party’s alliance in parliament. That lead closed over time, but it prompted accusations by the opposition that the state news agency was launching a manipulation operation to influence election monitors into leaving ballot counting stations early. For much of the count, rival vote estimates by the opposition and the state-run agency were published, the former showing Erdoğan winning with less than 50% of the vote, and the latter showing a first-round outright victory. The first result would lead to a second-round contest on 8 July, a possibility that would represent a major psychological blow for Erdoğan, even if he was tipped to win that contest as well. The main secular opposition party, İnce’s CHP, continued to contest the results well into the count, charging that less than 40% of ballot boxes had been opened, and that many of İnce’s strong electoral districts had not yet been counted. İnce urged ballot count monitors to remain at their stations until the counts had been completed to protect against election fraud. Nevertheless, Erdoğan had already been congratulated on a win in the race by Hungary’s strongman leader, Viktor Orbán. The election took place on an uneven playing field, against a backdrop of human rights abuses that Amnesty International described as a “climate of fear”. One of the presidential candidates, Selahattin Demirtaş, ran his presidential campaign from a prison cell in Edirne where he is on trial on terrorism charges. The government has either shuttered, bought or taken over newspapers and TV stations, transforming the vast majority of the nation’s media into a loyalist press. Thousands of people have been detained or dismissed since a coup attempt in 2016, a crackdown that has gone beyond the followers of Fethullah Gülen, the man accused of masterminding the coup from his exile in Pennsylvania, to dissidents of all stripes including academics, students who opposed military incursions into Syria, judges, bureaucrats and police and military officers. Nevertheless, there were few incidents of apparent electoral fraud, with the exception of the province of Urfa, where some apparent attempts to rig the vote were uncovered during the course of the day. Poll stations opened at 8am and closed at 5pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/27/malcolm-turnbull-wont-rule-out-splitting-company-tax-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T01:08:14Z","webTitle":"Turnbull won't rule out splitting company tax bill as One Nation restates opposition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/27/malcolm-turnbull-wont-rule-out-splitting-company-tax-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/27/malcolm-turnbull-wont-rule-out-splitting-company-tax-bill","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull won't rule out splitting company tax bill as One Nation restates opposition","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has refused to rule out splitting the company tax bill to give companies earning up to $500m a year a tax cut but the bid to win crossbench support appears doomed after Pauline Hanson restated One Nation’s opposition to the package. The Coalition has rounded on Labor for confirming it would repeal the tax cut for companies earning between $10m and $50m a year as it continues to lobby the crossbench to cut the rate to 25% for companies earning more than $50m a year. With the government still four votes short, the compromise plan championed by senator Derryn Hinch has come back into play to provide the tax cut to 6,000 more companies but exclude giants such as the big four banks and the grocery duopoly. But on Wednesday morning Hanson appeared to state a final position, telling 3AW radio that she and Senator Peter Georgiou had decided to vote against the bill. She added that the government should “take it to the next election, let’s see what the people say”. Earlier, Hanson told reporters in Canberra she had spoken to the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, on Tuesday evening, but he had failed to persuade her while she made further demands on multinational tax avoidance and a new coal-fired power station. On Tuesday Hanson struggled to defend her numerous positions on the company tax cuts. “I haven’t flip-flopped. I said no originally and then I said yes, then I said no and I stuck to it,” she told the Senate. The government needs the four votes from a group of six senators still opposed to the cuts: Centre Alliance’s two votes, One Nation’s two, and independents Hinch and Tim Storer. Hinch told ABC News Breakfast the government could get a “partial victory” if it cut the tax rate for companies earning up to $500m, as he first suggested in March. But he acknowledged senator David Leyonhjelm has threatened to pull out if the Coalition adopts that compromise. On Sunday Cormann also appeared to rule out that option. “The same as we said we would not be splitting the personal income tax bills ... we will not be splitting the company tax cut plan from here,” he told ABC’s Insiders. But at a doorstop on Wednesday Turnbull said he would not comment on negotiations with the Senate when asked about the $500m threshold. “We don’t engage in public negotiations,” the prime minister said, refusing to rule it out after a follow-up question. “We’ve had a lot of success by engaging with the Senate respectfully and constructively – as you saw last week with the biggest reform of personal income tax in a generation.” The Coalition has gone on the attack after the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, unexpectedly confirmed on Tuesday that Labor would raise $20bn by repealing the corporate tax cut for companies earning more than $10m and was considering whether to roll it back for those earning between $2m and $10m. On Wednesday the treasurer Scott Morrison called on Labor to “end the mystery” about whether it would increase taxes for those businesses. Turnbull accused Labor of “an assault on jobs, an assault on enterprise, [and] an assault on innovation and small and medium family businesses”. The workplace relations and small business minister, Craig Laundy, told Radio National Labor had “nailed its colours to the mast” and “demonstrated the ignorance and the respect they have for small business operators”. “The more money you leave in business operators’ pockets – irrespective of their size – the more they will reinvest in themselves, grow and employ more people,” he said. Laundy said the Labor rollback plan was not a saving but amounted to taking a “sledgehammer to the economy” with a $20bn tax increase. He said wage earners’ and business operators’ profits were theirs “not the government’s”. “We will be back to surplus in 2019-20, a year ahead of expectation, with reductions in tax ... that’s the responsible thing to do,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/27/muslim-ban-ruling-trumps-bigotry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T10:00:36Z","webTitle":"The Muslim ban ruling legitimates Trump's bigotry | Moustafa Bayoumi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/27/muslim-ban-ruling-trumps-bigotry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/27/muslim-ban-ruling-trumps-bigotry","fields":{"headline":"The Muslim ban ruling legitimates Trump's bigotry","bodyText":"The US supreme court has upheld the Trump administration’s Muslim ban. By doing so, the court has genuflected before a deeply bigoted president and has sacrificed constitutional freedoms in the process. It’s almost impossible to describe the mixture of rage and vulnerability that I feel knowing that the ban, a dagger in the heart of the first amendment principle of religious neutrality, is now law. At the center of the court’s 5-4 decision is a degree of deference to the executive branch that is tantamount to nearly blind obedience. Trump’s many bigoted statements and actions denigrating Muslims are well known. And yet the supreme court decided that none of that matters when considering the constitutionality of this ban. This conclusion legitimates Trump’s bigotry by ripping up the Establishment Clause, one of the constitutional protections of religious freedom, into a thousand little pieces. The court’s reasoning is as flawed as it is timorous. Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the notable provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act “exudes deference to the president in every clause”, and since the proclamation articulating the ban “says nothing about religion”, the court cannot concern itself with the motivations of the person who put the ban into motion, namely Donald Trump. The ban is “squarely within the scope of Presidential authority”, Roberts wrote. (Justice Sotomayor is having none of this. “Deference,” she explained in her dissent, “is different from unquestioning acceptance”, and she rues “the majority’s apparent willingness to throw the Establishment Clause out the window and forgo any meaningful constitutional review at the mere mention of a national-security concern.”) The court’s abdication of responsibility to preserve constitutional protections of equality for all becomes all the more glaring when we consider that, earlier this month, the exact same court issued these very words: “In this country, the place of secular officials isn’t to sit in judgement of religious belief but only to protect their free exercise.” That sentence, written by Justice Gorsuch, was part of a concurring opinion in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, which decided that a Colorado baker could refuse his services to a same-sex couple. In that case, members of a state civil rights commission made “official expressions of hostility” toward the baker’s Christian faith. The court then concluded that the baker’s rights had been violated since the state commission did not employ religious neutrality in their deliberations. It appears that American Christians deserve more protections than American Muslims do. If American Muslims attempt to unite their families from, say, the war-torn countries of Yemen or Syria, this bigoted Muslim ban will all but prevent those unifications from happening. Looking at the Muslim ban and Masterpiece Cakeshop cases together reveals at least one more thing. We live in a country where two unnamed state officials are held to a higher standard than the president of the United States. The ban may now be the law, but none of it is based on truth. There still have been no fatal terrorist attacks on American soil from people who emigrated from the banned countries. There really is no meaningful process for obtaining “waivers” from the ban. The addition of North Korea to this list remains an insult to our intelligence. (It’s there only to mitigate the ban’s explicit anti-Muslim basis, as almost no North Koreans passport holders come to the US.) The bizarre idea that toddlers and grandmothers are national security risks is now law. And the racist view that Muslims are a unique national security threat because they are Muslims persists. In fact, it is now emboldened. Most importantly, the ban continues the Trump administration’s vicious assault on multiple forms of immigration. A recent report by the Center for Constitutional Rights has documented how the Muslim ban is tearing apart families, physically keeping parents and children from each other. That ought to sound familiar, reminding us of the unconscionable policy that has rightly occupied our outrage over the last weeks, namely separating migrant children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. This administration revels in novel ways of transforming cruelty into locked-and-loaded patriotism. And now they’ve got the supreme court’s approval behind them. Make no mistake. This decision expands presidential authority significantly and the results could be ominous. The future of this country is far too important for us to let them succeed.

England supporters have begun to trickle over the border from Poland and Lithuania into the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad for the final group game against Belgium on Thursday. Security was tight at both land-entry points but it has emerged that some fans could exploit weaknesses in the visa protocol to enter Russia without tickets. The Football Supporters’ Federation was able to obtain a number of so‑called Fan IDs, which allow visa‑free travel into Russia to those who have a ticket for matches. Stringent checks are supposed to be limited to one Fan ID per ticket. But the organisation managed to obtain a number of them using the same ticket reference number, raising the prospect of hundreds of England fans travelling to Russia without a ticket and hoping to obtain one on the black market. The Guardian understands a number have travelled to Kaliningrad without tickets as a sense of anticipation has grown in the wake of impressive victories against Tunisia and Panama. The Football Association, through the England Supporters Club, has sold its allocation of 1,600 tickets for the Kaliningrad Arena. The newly built stadium holds 35,000 and it is expected that very few tickets will be available through other channels. It is thought the official supporters’ group has had only a slight increase of interest in tickets for the last-16 match. England will play in Moscow or Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia depending on their result against Belgium, which will dictate whether they win or finish second in Group G. Internet searches for flights to Russia went up by 168% after England defeated Panama, according to the website Skyscanner. But more fans are likely to arrive by road in Kaliningrad, which was formerly a German city and was known as Königsberg until 1946. There are a number booked to arrive on chartered coaches from the Polish city of Gdansk to the west and Kaunas in Lithuania to the east on match day. Police have warned supporters to expect a wait of up to five hours at the border as soldiers and armed police inspect documents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/28/mexico-election-the-candidates-the-stakes-and-the-key-issues","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-28T05:30:03Z","webTitle":"Mexico election: the candidates, the stakes and the key issues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/mexico-election-the-candidates-the-stakes-and-the-key-issues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/mexico-election-the-candidates-the-stakes-and-the-key-issues","fields":{"headline":"Mexico election: the candidates, the stakes and the key issues","bodyText":"What’s the story and what is at stake? Latin America’s second largest economy will go to the polls on Sunday to choose its next president and a new congress at a time of widespread disillusionment at unchecked corruption, poverty and violence that has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2007. The presidential frontrunner, a 64-year-old leftist called Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has claimed his widely anticipated landslide victory will represent the fourth great sea change in Mexican history after independence in 1821, the 1857-1860 War of the Reform and the Mexican revolution of 1910. “It seems like a dream but we are just a few days away from achieving Mexico’s transformation,” López Obrador, or Amlo as he is best known, told flag-waving supporters during a recent rally in the rundown satellite city of Ecatepec. Amlo’s foes beg to differ, painting him as a democracy-allergic, Hugo Chávez-style demagogue who will indeed transform Mexico – by crashing its economy. But many on Mexico’s left are not convinced Amlo will be much of a radical once in power, and analysts say that a better comparison is with Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who oversaw a period of economic growth even as he battled inequality. Who else is in the running for the presidency? Amlo’s consistent dominance in the polls has been such that his opponents have often seemed an irrelevance. Perhaps the only man capable of spoiling his party on Sunday is Ricardo Anaya, a shaven-headed 39-year-old lawyer from the National Action party (Pan) who profilers have described as a curious mix of yoga fanatic and cut-throat political operator. In a recent interview with the Guardian one of Anaya’s campaign chiefs, Jorge Castañeda, described him as a “young, dynamic, intelligent, quick-footed [and] very well-trained” candidate with a vision of the future that contrasted with what he called Amlo’s backwards-looking nationalism. Voters seem unsure, however. In recent weeks the campaign of Anaya’s left-right coalition appears to have stalled amid corruption allegations he has denied and questions over his supposedly machiavellian bent. Behind Anaya is José Antonio Meade, a career civil servant standing for the now widely loathed Institutional Revolutionary party, or PRI, to which Mexico’s equally unpopular current president, Enrique Peña Nieto, belongs. Meade’s efforts to project himself as a likable everyman have also failed to impress voters. Bringing up the rear is Jaime “El Bronco” Rodríguez, an eccentric former governor who is running as an independent and boasts the support of just 3% of voters, according to the latest polls. His main contribution to the presidential race has been an incendiary pledge to tackle corruption by chopping the hands off criminals. What are the key election issues? Some analysts have attributed Amlo’s runaway lead to Donald Trump’s attempts to browbeat Mexico’s leaders over immigration and trade. According to that version, Mexican voters are intent on electing a strongman leader capable of hitting back at Trump’s bullying. Amlo has dropped some hints that he might take a tougher line with the US president, including publishing a book called: A New Hope For Mexico: Saying No to Corruption, Violence, and Trump’s Wall or in Spanish simply, Oye, Trump (Listen, Trump!). Last week he denounced Trump’s “arrogant, racist and inhuman” family separation policy. But this year’s election is far more about domestic issues than foreign policy: primarily the rampant corruption and crime that have left Mexico’s 88 million registered voters furious and afraid. In May, Mexico suffered nearly 2,900 murders, its most violent month in two decades. More than 120 political candidates have been killed since campaigning for this weekend’s election officially began last September. Meanwhile the country has been rocked by a succession of eye-watering corruption scandals, including that of Javier Duarte, a PRI governor who went awol in a government helicopter in 2016 after being accused of corruption and whose wife recently turned up living in luxurious exile in one of London’s poshest boroughs. On the campaign trail, Amlo has hammered home his determination to end the bloodshed and theft that have become rampant under the PRI and the Pan, the only parties to have held Mexico’s presidency since its democratic transition in 2000. “This isn’t any old election,” he told the Ecatepec rally. “It’s a vote for more of the same, or for genuine change … It’s change, yes or change, no.” Alan Riding, author of a seminal book on Mexican politics and society called Distant Neighbors: A Portrait of the Mexicans, described Amlo’s success as “a product of total disenchantment” with the Mexico’s ruling elite. “The PRI and the Pan have had their turn and they have failed, time and time again.” So who is the man preparing this shake-up? Amlo was born in the Tabasco river town of Tepetitán, in November 1953, the first of seven children. He became politically active in the late 1970s, working with local indigenous populations, and later moved to Mexico’s capital where he was elected mayor in 2000. Friends and supporters describe Amlo as a taco-loving baseball enthusiast and bookworm who is happier with his head in a book or out enjoying nature than socializing. “He’s a monastic man,” says Azucena Cisneros, a candidate for Amlo’s party in the state of Mexico. “Marvelously disciplined but monastic. He has no social life.” He is also a friend of Jeremy Corbyn and his Mexican wife, Laura Álvarez. And what kind of president might Amlo turn out to be? Critics cast Amlo as a Mexican Chávez or even a Mexican Trump. Some detractors have even accused him of posing as “a tropical messiah”. But many experts believe a better, if still imperfect comparison, might be Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a one-time union firebrand who was elected on his fourth attempt, in 2002. Fears over Lula’s election sent stocks tumbling and had investors in a sweat. But he ruled for two terms as a pragmatic centrist credited with slashing poverty in one of the world’s most unequal societies. Like Lula, Amlo has tempered his discourse in what is his third bid for the presidency (he ran unsuccessfully in 2006 and 2012) and has vowed to rule for the poor. “We will care for everyone. We will listen to everyone. We will respect everyone,” he told the crowds in Ecatepec, home to nearly 790,000 of the 53 million Mexicans stuck below the poverty line. “But we will give preference to the humble. For everyone’s wellbeing, the poor will come first.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/27/tony-blair-return-to-dark-1930s-politics-no-longer-far-fetched","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T23:01:23Z","webTitle":"Tony Blair: return to dark 1930s politics no longer far-fetched","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/27/tony-blair-return-to-dark-1930s-politics-no-longer-far-fetched","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/27/tony-blair-return-to-dark-1930s-politics-no-longer-far-fetched","fields":{"headline":"Tony Blair: return to dark 1930s politics no longer far-fetched","bodyText":"A return to the dark politics of the 1930s is no longer far-fetched today because of rampant nationalist populism and the widespread rejection of multilateral alliances, according to Tony Blair. In a stark speech to the Chatham House thinktank in London, the former British prime minister will say he has never been so worried about the future of the UK. Blair will also tell Donald Trump, ahead of the US president’s visit to Europe next month, that he must act to preserve the transatlantic alliance, or else he will weaken the whole of the west in the struggle against rising nations such as China. Blair is due to say: “We need to know from the current American administration and its president that our alliance matters, that it is regarded, historically and contemporaneously, as a vital American strategic interest.” “We are losing sight of the values which brought the west together, saw it through the menace of fascism and communism”, he will add. Blair also urges the Trump administration to counter “with vigour and urgency” the widely held view that it wants the transatlantic alliance to fracture, saying: “The only people that would gain from this are America’s rivals or adversaries.” Blair, who has defended strong UK-US relations for more than two decades, is clearly concerned that Trump has no feel for the historical depth of his country’s relationship with Europe, and may see the break-up of the EU as something unimportant or even beneficial to the US. The former Labour PM is expected to assert: “The transatlantic alliance is the bedrock of our values system and way of life. Yet the rightwing relegation of it as secondary to national interest rather than part of it and the kneejerk leftwing reaction against anything American-led, is leaving this alliance in danger of fracture“We need leaders both sides of the water explaining its importance and seeking ways of strengthening it.” Blair, who maintains close relations with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, mainly over the middle east, will not directly accuse the president of populism, but his speech makes little attempt to hide his dislike of this political style. He is due to say: “Globalisation and its advocates are on the back foot. Populism of left and right meet at a certain point in denunciation of free trade arrangements, migration and international alliances. All are portrayed as contrary to putting individual national interest first. “Once it is clear the populism isn’t working because, ultimately, it offers only expressions of anger and not effective answers, the populists may double down, alleging that failure is the result of half-heartedness and that only more of the same will work. “Who knows where the dynamic of that scenario takes us. Then the comparisons with the 1930s no longer seem far-fetched.” He will also bluntly tell US diplomats not to imagine that either Brexit or a wider break-up of the EU will be in US interests. “America needs Europe united and standing with it, not isolated as individual nations, able to be picked off one by one by the then emerged new powers”. He will also weigh in on the state of the Brexit talks: “We cannot go on like this. I have never been more worried about the future of our country than now, with competing emotions of anxiety and rage. “We have a government whose every move is a calculation not about the interests of the nation, but the internal balance of advantage between the factions of the Conservative party, with the prime minister more a hostage than a leader. “Meanwhile the leader of the Labour party neglects to lead the fight here at home over an issue which literally determines the future of Britain and where he could play a decisive role.” Blair will call on MPs to assert themselves, adding: “the UK needs to plan now for the possibility we need to extend the March 2019 deadline for the end of the negotiations”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/27/police-restrained-rashan-charles-metropolitan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T16:09:14Z","webTitle":"Police restrained my great-nephew, and he died.

We, his family, ask how","bodyText":"Next month marks a year since my great-nephew, Rashan Charles, died after being restrained by a police officer. After an inquest, the jury found that his death was an accident. It also identified failings by the police officer, known as BX47, but considered the mistakes not significant and said Rashan’s life was not salvageable in any event. We must respect the decision of these randomly selected people; they made conclusions on specifically selected information and on receipt of pointed advice from the coroner. However, it is important to look at the legal processes holistically and, in doing so, it is not difficult to see why all of it has been branded a farce by campaigners. Rashan must share responsibility in death; there has never been doubt on this. He ran away from a clearly marked police vehicle, he could be in no doubt they were uniformed police officers pursuing him, and he placed a package into his mouth. But all recorded footage of the incident shows that he entered a convenience store alive, fit and moving freely with no signs of distress. This was his life state prior to intervention by BX47. An expert in intensive care and resuscitation describes the CCTV showing Rashan “making purposeful, normal movements, clearly alive”. This is the key issue: he was not unwell – his condition changed only after force was applied. The change from fit and clearly alive to critically ill, and then avoidably dead occurred as a direct result of BX47’s interventions. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation and the recent inquest have diverted focus on to the difficulties that police officers experience working in Hackney, the London borough where Rashan died. They say the resuscitation measures were the best efforts. All are distractions from the core issues in this case: namely, were BX47’s tactics appropriate to the incident, and were BX47’s decisions sound? My family has had a close affinity to the police service for several decades, and this, of course, continues. We know this case does not reflect the conduct of every police officer. We are advocates of good policing, not adversaries. We recognise from first-hand experience the core skills required to be an effective police officer and the increasing challenges police officers face. I served 30 years with London’s Metropolitan Police, retiring just under four years ago. For me, there is no question that BX47 had to pursue and detain the fleeing suspect. But he describes the incident as presenting him with limited options, when I know the tactical options available to him were numerous. There are far too many alternative tactics to list. BX47 could have paused before entering the store to communicate his location to his colleagues. This is not unfair, hindsight criticism of this police officer; it is simply trying to fathom why he opted to completely disregard his training as a member of the Territorial Support Group. These officers receive the highest level of training in arrest and restraint. Despite his enhanced, specialist training, BX47 consciously and voluntarily undertook a series of actions, each act increasing the risk of grave harm or injury to Rashan Charles. When I was a police sergeant, I was a member of the Territorial Support Group. When I was promoted to more senior ranks, I was responsible for designing and delivering training to the TSG. I also deployed the TSG operationally to deal with hundreds of incidents, virtually all far more challenging than this stop-and-search encounter. Since learning of this fatality, I have not asked myself: “What would I do in those circumstances?” But rather: “What did I do in those circumstances?” All honest and competent police officers will acknowledge that chasing suspects who attempt to discard or hide evidence is challenging – but it is routine policing. This incident only became extraordinary after the tactics selected and used by BX47. Rashan was obstructing the police. No questions arise here. Although BX47 disputes this, Rashan’s resistance was not at high levels – and we have the CCTV footage to clear up this disagreement. What is beyond dispute, again because we have the CCTV, is that Rashan did not threaten or offer any violence, even when it might have been necessary to save his own life. BX47’s crew and colleagues were in a specially equipped vehicle less than 100 metres away – in fact, evidence given suggests closer, more like 70 metres. On receipt of accurate information from BX47, they could have joined him in seconds. Pausing at the store’s entrance to communicate his location via his radio would not have altered the fact he knew the location of the suspect and he had line of sight on him. Next, he had to decide whether to wait those few seconds for support, or to act alone. He chose to act alone, but we know now that he was not capable of handling the situation. BX47 panicked, and was confused on the tactics he used. His testimony was then aided by two use-of-force experts. I know both men – they are accomplished police trainers, but they are not independent. They have 75 years aggregated service – with the very police service under scrutiny. One of them is still employed with the Met. They are indeed competent trainers, but as fellow police officers, they could not be wholly independent, impartial or objective when assessing this fatal event. Our family’s objective is to determine how Rashan died. The closing of ranks in the police service and the abject refusal of senior officers to make effective decisions post-incident will set community relations back not by months or years – but by generations. • Rod Charles is the great-uncle of Rashan Charles, and former Metropolitan Police Chief Inspector, from 1984-2014"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jul/02/uk-ministers-to-fund-saatchi-campaign-for-tunisian-government","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-02T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"UK ministers to fund Saatchi campaign for Tunisian government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/02/uk-ministers-to-fund-saatchi-campaign-for-tunisian-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jul/02/uk-ministers-to-fund-saatchi-campaign-for-tunisian-government","fields":{"headline":"UK ministers to fund Saatchi campaign for Tunisian government","bodyText":"The British government is paying M&amp;C Saatchi to run a media campaign for the Tunisian government in an attempt to win voters over reforms that have sparked some of the largest protests in the north African state since the Arab spring. The advertising agency – known for its punchy political advertising for the Conservative party – has been hired to run a campaign “targeted towards the Tunisian public”, according to documents. Its objectives are to “improve public awareness of the government’s role in planning and delivering economic reforms” that are being undertaken as part of an IMF-backed plan to cut its budget deficit and boost growth. The same documents – setting out M&amp;C’s appointment – state that an initial phase of the Saatchi campaign, which involves the agency having a base in Tunis, targets Tunisians aged 18 to 35. The country’s young people have been at the forefront of protests that have grown in intensity since the beginning of the year when the government raised prices of staples and introduced new taxes, as it comes under pressure to deliver on the reforms, which are linked to a $2.9bn (£2.2bn) IMF loan. The money for Saatchi is coming from the secretive Conflict, Security and Stability Fund (CSSF), which was set up under the auspices of several key government departments including the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. It has been the focus of significant concern among MPs and the independent aid watchdog over the lack of transparency, accountability and leadership surrounding the £1.2bn pot. A report issued this year by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, which scrutinises UK aid spending and reports to the Commons, also criticised serious shortcomings in the way that the programme operates, including the risk it could be working with human rights abusers. The assistance to the Tunisians comes against the backdrop of a move by the UK to focus more resources on the Sahel, which civil servants have identified as a breeding ground for extremism and source of migrants to Europe. Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour MP on parliament’s international development committee, said: “I can think of no better example of the cynicism of this government than financing a PR campaign to support cuts to the Tunisian state by using state money in Britain that it claims is promoting peace and security overseas. “The government won’t tell the public or parliament what this fund, which is worth over £1bn, is spent on and the little evidence we do have suggests that the rot runs deep.” He added: “In light of these new allegations, it seems prudent to shut down the fund pending the review’s findings.” Asad Rehman, executive director of the charity War on Want, said that projects of the type undertaken in Tunisia “appear to be more about supporting governments with their PR rather than getting at the causes of the protests, which are rooted in deeply economic issues around inequality”. “People would be genuinely shocked to read that once again – whether it’s PFIs or something else – with British companies being brought in to aid governments in forcing through policies which are are highly contested, creates more friction and ultimately lead to a securitised response when people protest against them.” A British government spokesperson said: “In Tunisia, CSSF programmes strengthen democratic governance, security and economic reform. This project supports the Tunisian civil service to transparently communicate with citizens, with initial results showing an 18% increase in the number of citizens that want to learn about economic issues and reforms.” M&amp;C Saatchi were appointed to provide services only to the Cabinet Office and do not work directly with the Tunisian government on this project, according to the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office also pointed out that the ICAI report, while critical in parts, highlights a number of successes from fund’s programmes. M&amp;C Saatchi said it does not comment on government contracts. Tunisia, the country where the 2011 Arab spring uprisings began, has long been the company’s remaining bright spot, although there are fears that its democratic experiment could be put at risk by economic instability. Prime minister Youssef Chahed said earlier this year that his administration is working to reduce spending, revive exports and introduce social measures to meet the concerns of demonstrators."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/26/huw-thomas-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T17:11:51Z","webTitle":"Huw Thomas obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/26/huw-thomas-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/26/huw-thomas-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Huw Thomas obituary","bodyText":"My brother Huw Thomas, who has died aged 79, lived in Bangor, north Wales, where he was chief executive of the Gwynedd health authority from 1983 to 1996. In a distinguished career in NHS management, he also worked in Kenya, running the hospitals in Kisumu on Lake Victoria, and in Zambia. For four years from 1999 he worked with the Aga Khan Foundation in Tajikistan, helping to sort out a huge Soviet-era hospital in Khorog, on the Afghan border. While there he became aware that many baby girls in the region suffered from a congenital hip problem that could be easily rectified if treated correctly. He personally set up and financed a health initiative to provide treatment. When his time in Khorog came to an end, he was presented at a ceremony with full traditional Tajik costume and a carpet with his face woven into it. The local headman said that he “would be remembered for a hundred years”. Huw loved mountains. He gloried in the scenery of the Pamirs in Tajikistan. There was also a special place in his heart for Snowdonia, where for 25 years he served with the Ogwen valley mountain rescue team, making forays into the mountains or controlling the rescue missions from the radio hut at the head of the valley. Huw was born in Gorseinon, south Wales, the son of William, who worked in a bank, and his wife Mary (nee Hatton), who ran a corner shop. His father had mental health issues and Huw was brought up by his mother and grandmother in Warminster, Wiltshire; his parents later divorced. He went to Lord Weymouth’s grammar school in Warminster, studied history at Birmingham University and then gained a diploma in social administration from Manchester, before working in hospitals in Plymouth, Cardiff, Swansea and Bangor. He had his eccentricities. He loved music hall and together with his pals Bernard and Julia (a belly dancer) he created a tribute act to the 1940s entertainers Wilson, Keppel and Betty. Performing in Egyptian costume, Huw and friends appeared in local theatres and for charity events. For many years Huw was a leading light with the Llanfairfechan community players, portraying five contrasting roles in a production of Under Milk Wood in 2015. An idealist, he fought for local health issues, cleared footpaths, collected rubbish on beaches, stocked the local food bank and supported the local credit union. He was an avid Guardian reader.

Now, under the Trump administration, workers are facing another hazard – the threat of deportation. “We were working in the plant and the agents showed up with machine guns and started taking everyone outside,” 20-year-old “Carlos”, a meatpacker at the Fresh Mark meatpacking plant in Salem, Ohio, told the Guardian. Last week, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents conducted their largest workplace raid to date at Fresh Mark, arresting more than 140 workers. The Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) says that in addition to those arrested, Ice is currently holding unexecuted arrest warrants for another 110 Fresh Mark workers employed at several facilities throughout Ohio. The news is striking fear in the heart of the region’s growing immigrant communities. Carlos, who wished not to be identified, arrived from Guatemala four and half years ago to help his undocumented father, who has been living in the US for 15 years, by sending money back home to his two younger siblings in Guatemala. Like many of his colleagues he is now worried that an industry dominated by undocumented workers has become the favorite hunting ground for Ice officers determined to pursue Trump’s tough crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The Ohio raid followed the arrest of more than 100 immigrants in a raid in April on a plant owned by Southeast Provisions in Morristown, Tennessee. With Trump announcing that he plans to quadruple the number of workplace raids, organized labor and immigrants’ rights groups are responding rapidly in the hopes that rapid legal aid and education will help immigrants workers successfully fight off deportation. The RWDSU has set up a resource center in the basement of St Paul Catholic church in Salem, providing food, diapers and gift cards to families that have lost their breadwinners. The union is also giving workers access to immigration and workplace safety attorneys. “We are all family and we are all one, and if one of us is down, we are all gonna be there to help pick up,” said Juan Moscoso, an immigrant from Peru working as a shop steward at a nearby sister plant in Ohio. “We are a union and we are going to stand for one another.” But the immigrant communities are still feeling particularly vulnerable. Meatpacking is dangerous, fast-moving work that relies on undocumented workers. Census data indicates that one-third of meatpacking jobs are done by immigrants, although that percentage is probably much higher due to underreporting, especially in the current environment of low unemployment where employers are scrambling to find workers. Undocumented workers are also less likely to report violations for fear of attracting attention – and deportation. A week before the raid on Fresh Mark’s Salem facility, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined Fresh Mark $211,194 for three separate incidents in which proper guards for dangerous machinery were not in place. OSHA found that the lack of safety guards resulted in the death of an undocumented worker. Last December, Domingo Ramos, a 49-year-old undocumented worker from Guatemala, was killed when his foot was sucked into a rotating auger, ripping off his lower leg and leading to him bleeding to death. Many in organized labor suspect that the media attention following the death of an undocumented worker at a Fresh Mark facility in Ohio may have resulted in increased scrutiny being placed on all of Fresh Mark’s Ohio facilities. It’s unclear why Ice chose to raid the plant. Ice did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication. The plant had been the site of tension between the growing Latino community working in the meatpacking plants and the surrounding white rust belt community. The anti-immigrant Ohio Jobs and Justice political action committee held protests outside the plant over the company hiring undocumented workers in 2011, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. However, despite the increased scrutiny on meatpacking plants, workplace safety activists say that the raids on poultry facilities are unlikely to make a dent in the high turnover immigrant workforce employed by them. Instead, the raids will probably lead to more dangerous conditions for newly arrived immigrant workers to these communities. “These raids send a real signal to immigrant workers not to speak up and we feel like these raids enable employers in the most dangerous industry to cut corners and violate labor standards,” says Debbie Berkowitz, who served as chief of staff of OSHA under Obama from 2009 to 2013 and now serves as the director of the worker health and safety program at the National Employment Law Project (NELP). The raids come as statistics show that enforcement at OSHA is dramatically down according to a new report put out by the NELP. In 2017, the first year of data under the Trump administration, there were 1,071 fewer enforcement inspections by OSHA than in 2016. More startling, the report showed that in the first five months of 2018, enforcements were down by 1,163 from the already low level for 2017. Instead of focusing on protecting workers, workplace safety experts say that decreasing workplace safety standards under Trump will make more meatpacking workers scared of speaking out. “Meatpacking is a very dangerous industry – rather than hold employers accountable for violating basic work protections, this administration has chosen to target and arrest the workers,” said Berkowitz."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/27/morning-mail-travel-ban-upheld-socceroos-out-gayed-subpoena","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T21:02:24Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Trump's travel ban upheld by the supreme court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/27/morning-mail-travel-ban-upheld-socceroos-out-gayed-subpoena","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/27/morning-mail-travel-ban-upheld-socceroos-out-gayed-subpoena","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Trump's travel ban upheld by the supreme court","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 27 June. Top stories The US supreme court has upheld Donald Trump’s travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries, in a significant victory for the administration and a blow to anti-discrimination advocates. In a 5-4 ruling handed down on Tuesday US time, the court accepted the government’s argument that the ban was within the president’s power to craft national security policy and his authority to “suspend entry of aliens into the United States”. Trump has issued three executive orders curbing travel from five Muslim-majority countries: Syria, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. Minutes after the ruling was issued, Trump tweeted: “SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!” Opponents of the ban have said it has not made the country safer, while singling out Muslims for unfair treatment and violating constitutional protections against discrimination on religious grounds. The Socceroos are out of the World Cup after being defeated 2-0 by Peru overnight. Peru scored a goal in each half to end Australia’s far-fetched hopes of glory. Needing victory to progress to the last 16 for the first time since 2006, the Socceroos were outclassed by superior opposition, reflecting Australia’s problems up front and lack of real depth across the squad. “The Socceroos are simply not good enough and to do not have enough world-class players to defeat the best countries in the world,” writes John Davidson in his analysis of the match. As the Socceroos pack their bags, look back at their time on the world stage in our photo gallery. Australia’s peak body representing obstetricians and gynaecologists has revealed it was subpoenaed for information about Emil Shawky Gayed 18 years ago. But the disgraced doctor was not barred from practising until 2016. Four public hospitals in NSW are the subject of an independent inquiry ordered by the health department after revelations by Guardian Australia that Gayed unnecessarily operated on women who could have been treated with painkillers and bed rest, and needlessly removed some women’s reproductive organs. One woman died. An expert from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it was “not uncommon” for court authorities to request information about a college member. Labor has warned the government that new subsidies for coal as part of any internal settlement on the national energy guarantee will scuttle the chances of securing peace after 10 years of warring over climate and energy policy. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, told Guardian Australia that the construction of any new coal-fired power stations “will paralyse Australia’s transition to clean energy” and “run against all the advice of industry and business, including Snowy Hydro”. The warning comes as Josh Frydenberg on Tuesday cleared the decks to take the Neg to a critical meeting of state and territory energy ministers in August, but despite the victory he still faces a noisy internal campaign to give coal a fillip. The Lord’s prayer would be abolished from the start of Senate sittings under a push instigated by the Greens. Today Senator Lee Rhiannon will move a motion for a Senate inquiry into the proposed alternative: “Senators, let us in silence pray or reflect upon our responsibilities to all people of Australia and to future generations.” The plan is supported by a letter signed by progressive religious leaders. Senate sittings begin with the Lord’s prayer, a Christian prayer including the words “our father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name”. Rhiannon said the statement that opens parliament “should be inclusive of people of all beliefs and faiths”.

Thinking time Hannah Gadsby’s trailbrazing standup show Nanette was a gamechanger when it toured in Australia – but now that it’s on Netflix, it has set the internet alight. Don’t expect the classic set-up/punchline joke format though. “Gadsby wields her craft like a weapon, lancing out [her] trauma and forcing us to look at it,” writes Jane Howard. “And by opening out from a two-act joke to a three-act story, she creates the space for audiences to build on this third act themselves.” Fernanda Dahlstrom grew up with her mother behind bars and believed her to be an innocent woman persecuted by the system. Later, as a junior solicitor with the Aboriginal legal service in the Northern Territory, she saw the failures of the whitefella legal system up close, and came to realise her whole understanding of the world was built on a lie. “Not every day was like Trainspotting.” Darren McGarvey – better known as the rapper Loki – grew up in a Glasgow mired by poverty, addiction and abuse.

First, they have their own destiny in their hands and would go through to the knockout phase with a two-goal win against South Korea. And second, their problems are readily identifiable: a midfield that does not protect the defence in transition and a forward line that, so far, has lacked an edge. Jogi Löw, the Germany manager, has been concerned enough to have “a lengthy chat” with Thomas Müller. “After the match against Mexico we tried to analyse his way of playing with the help of videos and clips,” Löw said. “He is somebody who is very open to comments and also critical in self-appraisal.” There is not much Löw can do about that, and the carousel of four rotating forwards he fielded in the second game looked extremely dangerous until Sweden took the lead and provoked a measure of panic. The structure of the side, though, is his department. Mexico and Sweden were gifted opportunity after opportunity to counterattack down the flanks as Germany’s full-backs pushed up with no real cover offered by the back of midfield, even if Sebastian Rudy, who has a broken nose and will not be available, and then Ilkay Gündogan made a better fist of it in the second game than poor Sami Khedira, his legs seemingly gone, did in the first. That has been a persistent problem of late, with Germany conceding in each of their past seven games, a run stretching back to the 0-0 draw with England in November. The return of Mats Hummels from a neck injury should help but Jérôme Boateng is suspended. “If you look at all of those matches we are vulnerable to fast breaks and counterattacks,” Löw said. “It’s not always down to the defensive line: if we have three or four players racing towards the defensive line it’s an unfortunate situation. Against Sweden we were better in transition to a defensive action.” Better, but far from perfect. “South Korea have players who can use the space when it opens up,” Löw said. “It would be helpful on the whole if we could lose the ball less often.” In terms of player development and tactical approach, Germany have seemed recently a beacon of modernity, but there is a curious sense with this side that they are surviving on more traditional virtues. Two things changed for Germany at the 2006 World Cup, when Löw served as assistant to Jürgen Klinsmann. As they embraced progressiveness, two things were supposed to have been laid to one side: the dependence on Führungsspieler – leaders on the pitch – and the belief in themselves as a Turniermannschaft – a tournament team; one, that is, that had a mental strength that meant they did not really have to play well to make progress through a tournament, just as the stodgy 2002 side had somehow reached the final. This was all part of Klinsmann’s revolution, itself part of the wider process of Das Reboot that overhauled academies and embraced the pressing game to which Germany had for so long been resistant. Yet Germany won the last World Cup and are still in this one because, when they needed it, they found the requisite inner drive and ruthlessness: there is a steel beneath the beauty. It allowed them to scramble through against Ghana and Algeria in 2014, and to stifle France and Argentina, and that quality was there again in abundance against Sweden. Toni Kroos, making up for his error, was just the sort of leader Germany needed him to be before bending in the brilliant winner. The mocking nature of the post-match celebrations that so angered the Swedes, while a world away from the antics of, say, the 1982 side, suggested that at least some of the old arrogance remains. The contrast with a South Korea who seem to have given up hope could hardly be more pronounced. Their coach Shin Tae-yong, who will be without the injured Park Joo-ho and Ki Sung-yueng, has come up with a variety of excuses to explain away his side’s poor performances all tournament. Sweden were too tall, while the defeat to Mexico was the result, apparently, of structural problems within the Korean league. Here, he seemed vaguely irritated that Germany had not qualified already and so will be playing a full‑strength side. “There is not enough time to fully prepare strategically for a match with Germany,” he said. “Even if we have improved the teamwork I don’t think it will be easy. We have a one per cent chance, a very slim hope.” Shin did, though, perk up when it was suggested he physically resembles Löw. “He is very fashionable,” he said. That was almost certainly a comment on his appearance, but his remark did seem inadvertently to hint at a pervasive sense that there is a superficiality to Löw, that his greatest gift as a coach is to have been in charge at just the right time to capitalise on a supreme generation of players. Now is the time for Löw to show he is a coach of substance and correct the structural flaw."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/08/women-hold-just-12-of-high-level-asx200-roles-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T02:39:10Z","webTitle":"Women hold just 12% of high-level ASX200 roles, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/08/women-hold-just-12-of-high-level-asx200-roles-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/08/women-hold-just-12-of-high-level-asx200-roles-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"Women hold just 12% of high-level ASX200 roles, report finds","bodyText":"Women in ASX200 companies hold just 12% of high-level management roles such as CEO, and only 30% of executive team functional roles such as senior positions in strategy, IT and legal. The findings were published on Friday by Chief Executive Women, the peak organisation representing Australian women leaders from the corporate, public service, academic and not-for-profit sectors. Data on executive leadership teams was collected in August during a census of ASX200 companies. It found that 41 ASX200 companies, or 20.5%, had no women in their executive leadership team; 126 (63%) had no women in line roles in their executive leadership team; and 60 (30%) had no women in functional roles in their executive leadership team. Line roles were defined as high-level management positions such as CEO that directly influence key commercial outcomes, with those roles usually involving profit and loss accountability. Functional roles described as roles that perform functions or duties for the company, such as IT, corporate affairs and legal positions. Women comprise 9% of Chief Financial Officers roles and 13% of group executive/ Chief Operating Officer roles, the report found. However, there has been improvement over the past nine years. The data was compared to a similar government analysis of ASX200 leadership conducted in 2008, when 46% of ASX200 companies had no women in their executive leadership teams compared to 20% in 2017. Only four women held CEO positions in 2008, compared to 11 women in 2017. Chief Executive Women president, Kathryn Fagg, acknowledged the gains had been small, but said progress should still be recognised. “We would have loved to have seen more progress, there’s no question, but there has been movement in the right direction,” she said. The analysis would be conducted at least annually from now on, Fagg said. “I think it is important to look at what top companies are doing as they’ll be making the changes at the forefront of what happens in out communities.” The report concluded that achieving gender balance would require leadership. “Research and our experience confirm that the Chairman, board, CEO and leadership team must all be committed to gender balance as a priority; otherwise, the company is unlikely to make progress,” the report said. “This leadership commitment must also translate into visible action and regular communication on why gender balance matters and how everyone benefits.” Eva Cox, a sociologist and former political adviser who runs a research and policy consultancy, said women were judged and paid differently at every level of the workforce. “You can’t say: ‘Okay, we will only fix this for people at the bottom, as the top is more influential.’ I’m not saying people in ASX200 companies will change the world, but they are just as entitled to opportunity and fair pay.” Cox said it was not enough to just increase the representation of women in senior executive positions. Rather, women had to be involved in changing the structure of organisations and company goals and strategy, she said. “A lot of the women’s movements have swallowed the neo-liberal cordial and assumed we could make it on men’s terms, but we should be trying to get women valued on their terms,” she said. “To do this we need to start making the social aspects of businesses and society more valuable than bloody economics. Women are often more present in human resources positions, which are lower paid than executive financial roles, because for some reason it’s considered much harder dealing with money than people. “We had a badge in the seventies that said ‘women who want equality with men lack ambition’. They knew we had to change the values and basis on which power was allocated, but we seem to have forgotten about that, and we are still trying to be nice to men and fit with their systems to make it to the top.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/08/dreamers-daca-jeff-sessions-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T12:20:53Z","webTitle":"Dreamers condemn 'extremely wrong' Jeff Sessions: 'We're not taking jobs from anybody'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/08/dreamers-daca-jeff-sessions-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/08/dreamers-daca-jeff-sessions-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Dreamers condemn 'extremely wrong' Jeff Sessions: 'We're not taking jobs from anybody'","bodyText":"Yadira Garcia, a 27-year-old math teacher in Phoenix, Arizona, gathered with fellow so-called Dreamers on Tuesday morning to watch US attorney general Jeff Sessions’ announcement about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. When Sessions said that the Trump administration was ending Daca – which granted temporary protection from deportation and work authorization to 800,000 young undocumented immigrants, including Garcia – she broke down crying, wrapped in her mother’s arms and holding her one-year-old son. On television, Sessions justified the decision to end Daca in part by claiming it would protect American workers. The program, he argued, “denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens”. Garcia’s reaction to Sessions’ remark was one of disbelief. “We’re not taking jobs away from anybody,” she said. “When it comes to professional positions like teaching or being a lawyer, a doctor – things like that – those are professions you can’t just randomly apply for. It takes years of preparation. We prepared for those jobs.” Garcia came to Arizona from Mexico with her parents when she was seven. After earning a private scholarship to Arizona State University, she became a teacher and last year started working at her alma mater, Carl Hayden community high school. The job she filled was vacant for a year. Yanet Rodriguez, a Daca recipient and nursing assistant at Chandler regional medical center in Arizona, also took issue with Session’s comments. “He’s extremely wrong,” Rodriguez said. “I have not taken anyone’s job. It was an open position that was there so that somebody who was qualified would apply for it, and that’s exactly what I did.” Mabel, a Daca recipient who was afraid to give her last name, said she was at work when Sessions announced the termination of Daca. She’s a biomedical engineer at a medical device company in Arizona. She said she had to go through nine interviews to get her dream job. “They wanted the best person that could provide the best results, and they chose me,” Mabel said. “Now that I finally have the job I always wanted, I’m afraid of what’s going to happen.” Chad Gestson, superintendent of the Phoenix Union high school district where Garcia teaches, said they currently employ between 50 and 100 Daca recipients who are helping fill a statewide shortage of teachers. A recent study found more than one-quarter of openings for teaching jobs in Arizona for the 2016-17 school year were vacant. “As a district, we spend a lot of time and resources on recruiting teachers, especially math, science and special education teachers,” Gestson said. “And so to lose any teacher, especially our Daca teachers, would be a huge loss to our district.” He said many of their Daca teachers come from the same neighborhoods as the students in their classrooms. Nearly 82% of the students within the Phoenix Union High School District are Latino and 77% are poor enough to qualify for free and reduced lunch. “They know our kids,” Gestson said of Daca teachers. “They know our community.” Roberto Gonzales, a professor of education at Harvard University, said he has been studying undocumented young people over the last decade and hasn’t come across any facts to back Session’s argument that Daca recipients are taking jobs away from Americans en masse. He referred to Sessions’ argument as “completely unfounded”. “I think statements like that are very divisive and are not grounded on any empirical realities,” Gonzales said. Gonzales said the Daca program, contrary to Sessions’ claims, actually boosted the economy. Research he conducted showed how, in its five years of existence, Daca has provided a tremendous boost to the 800,000 young immigrants, helping them increase their educational attainment, get higher-paying jobs, and contribute more money to the US economy. Mabel’s and Rodriguez’s two-year work permits both expire in July 2019. The Trump administration said it would honor all existing Daca work permits until they expired, while giving Congress six months to come up with a legislative solution. Mabel said she was “very optimistic” Congress will pass legislation to protect Dreamers like her, but Rodriguez isn’t too sure that will happen. She said: “I’m afraid I could lose everything I’ve worked so hard to achieve.” Meanwhile, Garcia said her work permit expires in December but last month sent in her renewal application. “Even though I’m going to get two more years, the only thing I keep thinking about is: what am I going to do when that time is up?” she said. “The optimist in me wants to say in six months something will happen, but you never know.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/08/friday-briefing-my-heart-breaks-desmond-tutus-plea-to-aung-san-suu-kyi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T05:37:59Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: 'My heart breaks' – Desmond Tutu's plea to Aung San Suu Kyi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/08/friday-briefing-my-heart-breaks-desmond-tutus-plea-to-aung-san-suu-kyi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/08/friday-briefing-my-heart-breaks-desmond-tutus-plea-to-aung-san-suu-kyi","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: 'My heart breaks' – Desmond Tutu's plea to Aung San Suu Kyi","bodyText":"Top story: ‘Your silence is too high a price’ Hello – it’s Warren Murray with the news on a Friday morning. Firstly, we have breaking news of a tsunami warning following a magnitude 8 earthquake off the coast of Mexico and Guatemala. Here’s our first take on that – we will have more details as the situation develops. Our main story this morning: the Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu has taken the extraordinary step of criticising his fellow peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi over the bloody ethnic warfare centred on the Rohingya minority in Myanmar. “If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep,” says Tutu, in an open letter to the former political prisoner who is now her country’s de facto leader. Tutu sums up the regard held for Aung San Suu Kyi by millions – “for years I had a photograph of you on my desk … you symbolised righteousness”. That high esteem, he says, has been tarnished by the acceleration of “what some have called ‘ethnic cleansing’ and others ‘a slow genocide’” in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. “It is incongruous for a symbol of righteousness to lead such a country,” says Tutu. “We pray for you to intervene in the escalating crisis and guide your people back towards the path of righteousness again.” Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have been displaced in a crackdown by the Burmese military, which says it is pursuing terrorists. Estimates of the death toll range from 400 to 1,000 and those fleeing have told of seeing family and friends massacred by the army. Aung San Suu Kyi has defended her muted response, saying the problems in Rakhine state are complicated and go back to pre-colonial times. In a partial bending to international criticism, she has conceded the government needs to “take care of everybody who is in our country, whether or not they are our citizens”. * * * BAME suspects face hostile justice – A landmark report on race and the criminal justice system concludes it discriminates against black, Asian and minority ethnic people. The Labour MP David Lammy also delivers concrete recommendations on how to fix this. Young black people are nine times more likely to be locked up in England and Wales than their white peers, writes Lammy in his report, which was commissioned under David Cameron. Because black defendants distrust the system, they tend to plead not guilty in court – disqualifying themselves from the reduced sentences that can come with an early guilty plea. Lammy calls for deferred prosecutions where suspects can have charges dropped by completing rehabilitation; basing criminal responsibility on a suspect’s maturity rather than age; and wiping the slate clean earlier for young offenders who rehabilitate, so they can get on with finding employment. Lammy, in a column for the Guardian today, calls for urgent action to implement his recommendations. * * * Hurricane’s destruction – Category 5 storm Irma has lost little of its intensity, still clocking wind speeds of 175mph as it continues to pound the Caribbean. Irma is already the longest storm of this ferocity since satellite monitoring began. The British territories of Turks and Caicos are the latest to have been hit. At least 13 people have been confirmed dead including an infant on Barbuda, one person in Anguilla, three people in Puerto Rico, four in the US Virgin Islands, and four in the French territory of St Martin. Thousands more remain in shelters, their homes damaged or destroyed, while loss of power and water supply is widespread. South Florida has been placed on watch, with more than 750,000 people ordered to evacuate barrier islands and coastal areas, and storm surges of up to three metres possible within 48 hours. The storm is expected to descend somewhere on the Florida coast on Friday night or early Saturday local time. East of the Caribbean, Hurricane Jose has grown to category 3 and threatens some of the small islands that have barely emerged from Irma’s winds. * * * Brexit challenge for PM – Theresa May is to face the first major test of her parliamentary authority on Brexit since the general election – and it is an important moment to be well read up on the internal Tory politics that are at play. The European Union withdrawal bill comes before the House of Commons on Monday, and there is alarm on both sides of the debate about the sweeping “Henry VIII” executive powers that the bill would grant ministers to bypass parliament during the Brexit process. Eurosceptic Tories who make up the powerful European Research Group (ERG), meanwhile, are to publish a letter this weekend urging the government not to “use a transition period as means of keeping the UK in the EU by stealth”. Moderate Tories say these hardcore leavers have lost their pre-election “swagger” and are paranoid that May is backing away from taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union. The letter’s signatories are being criticised for trying to lock May back into a hard Brexit. * * * Bell tolls – The disgraced UK public relations firm that took money to stir up racial tensions in South Africa is predicted to be days away from collapse. Bell Pottinger could go into administration next week, say observers, after it was disavowed by the rest of the British industry and lost a string of accounts including HSBC, Investec and Clydesdale. Even “big tobacco” client Imperial Brands is reviewing its relationship. The PR firm was paid £100,000 a month by South Africa’s wealthy Gupta family – who are accused of corrupt connections to the country’s president, Jacob Zuma – and peddled lines about “white monopoly capital” and “economic apartheid” via fake Twitter accounts to draw attention away from the Guptas. * * * Alcohol and cancer – The alcohol industry is mirroring the tactics of cigarette companies to play down its products’ links to cancer, especially breast and bowel cancers, researchers say. Studies have confirmed that drinkers have a higher risk, but alcohol industry-funded awareness bodies Drinkaware and the Portman Group deliberately over-emphasise other factors such as age, gender and family history in their published materials, according to a British-led international research team. The academics suggest the government should not be trusting the industry to inform the public about alcohol and cancer, but the Department of Health says it ensures the message is “clear on the links between excessive alcohol consumption and cancer”. Portman says it is presents the information “fairly, accurately and in context” so people can make their own choices, while DrinkAware argues its messages are screened by senior and independent medical experts. * * * Gift of life – Eight people including five children have had their lives saved or transformed by organs transplanted from one 13-year-old British girl. Jemima Layzell died of a brain aneurysm in 2012 and her parents made the decision to donate her organs, having had a family conversation about the donor register a few weeks before her death. Jemima’s family discovered her diaries after she died and have published them to raise money for the Jemima Layzell Trust, which helps children with brain injuries and promotes organ donation. You can read several of her touching entries in our report. The NHS hopes Jemima’s story will inspire more people to register as donors – last year 457 people died waiting for transplants and there are 6,414 on the waiting list, including 176 children.

The courier turned out to be from the National Crime Agency, and within hours the Suffolk home Lauri shared with his parents had been cleaned out of computer equipment. Love, who doesn’t deny being a hacker, is now facing up to 99 years in a US prison. His battle against extradition from the UK is reaching its final stages. American prosecutors accuse Love of involvement in Anonymous hacks of US government websites. His supporters say the US criminal sanctions against hackers are disproportionately harsh, and used by authorities to punish online whistleblowing and activism. Love, who has Asperger’s, says he would kill himself rather than be taken to the US. “To extradite would be horrendous,” says Karen Todner, Love’s UK lawyer. “It would make a mockery of the Human Rights Act.” Sport Ben Stokes has spoken of his pride at recording his career-best figures with the ball after believing he had been letting the England team down this summer. But, given a wicket-laden first day during which West Indies hit back late on with four strikes themselves, the third Test remains in the balance. Sloane Stephens will meet Madison Keys in the women’s final at the US Open after respective victories over Venus Williams and CoCo Vandeweghe at Flushing Meadows. In the men’s draw, Juan Martín del Potro is running on empty ahead of his semi-final against Rafael Nadal and will have to summon another superhuman effort after admitting he is “not in perfect condition”. And Arsène Wenger has lost faith in one of his guiding principles and called for financial fair play to be scrapped, in a major U-turn for the Arsenal manager. Business The big swing in the currency markets continued overnight after the European Central Bank meeting did little to support the struggling US dollar. The revitalised euro hovered near a 30-month high against the greenback, while the Chinese yuan – counter to expectations of devaluation this year – hit its highest level to the dollar in 21 months. The pound moved up to $1.313 thanks to the dollar’s woes, which are blamed on sluggish US inflation, Trump uncertainty and North Korea. On the continent, Sterling was worth €1.088. The FTSE 100 is expected to open down very slightly. The papers Two main themes on the fronts today: the hurricane devastating the Caribbean and Prince George’s first day at school. The Sun has both but opts for the rather parochial take on the storm: “Irma hell Brits: get us out of here.” It has the subhead “Islands flattened. Expats lost”. And a few locals as well? The Mirror has the same stories and the same angle: “Navy’s dash to save 185mph storm Brits”. The Mail leads with: “Don’t treat us with contempt” and has found a pro-Brexit MP to say that we should leave the EU because they are not treating us well. The Times splashes on a story that a government minister is “in the firing line” after encouraging MPs to sign a letter that is designed to lock the prime minister into a hard Brexit. The FT also goes with a Brexit lead: “May’s strategy hit by Juncker and hardline MPs”. The Telegraph has an exclusive involving the northern Ireland MP Ian Paisley Jr. The Guardian splashes on that landmark Lammy report on race and the criminal justice system.

Edward Santow has already seen some campaign material that had bothered him, but will not say if it had come from the yes or no camp. He welcomed the government’s plan to pass legislation setting the ground rules for the survey. “Clearly, the law has a role to play – especially prohibiting language that is so hateful it incites violence or other serious harm,” he told the ABC on Friday. “I was really heartened to hear that all of Australia’s major political parties support having a really respectful debate.” The high court ruled on Thursday that the Turnbull government’s same-sex marriage postal vote was lawful, clearing the way for the Australian Bureau of Statistics to send voting forms to 16 million Australians. The acting special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, said the government would “move swiftly” to enact a new law to set ground rules for the campaign, with negotiations taking place with Labor and the Greens over the weekend and the bill brought to parliament next week. Labor and the Greens said they would ask the Turnbull government to legislate the “strongest possible” protections against vilification in the same-sex marriage postal survey. But Cormann hosed down suggestions of more extensive “truth-in-advertising” type protections, saying the government would “seek to align the protections” with requirements for ordinary elections. He said authorisations of campaign materials were important, “so that everyone can clearly identify who is responsible for particular communication”. “There are, in the Electoral Act, provisions that deal with misleading and deceptive conduct, but that has been interpreted by the high court in the past relating to misleading and deceptive communication that would essentially get the voter to fill out the ballot paper in an erroneous way,” he said on Thursday. Santow said the government obviously had to work out the details, but holding people to account for what they said was really important. “I guess [what] the Human Rights Commission is most concerned about is speech that has very serious harmful effects and so I think that’s where the greatest attention should be applied,” he said. “Otherwise, I think we need to rely on our strong sense of liberal democracy to make sure the debate is respectful. The law has an important role to play here, but it can only go so far. We need to ensure that people take some personal responsibility for what they say. “If we’re relying on some kind of court case to play out, the courts just don’t move quickly enough to regulate every possible example of inaccurate speech, or speech that might be harmful but [does not] rise to the threshold of serious harm.” Santow said he did not believe same-sex marriage and religious freedom were mutually exclusive, and religious freedoms would not be impinged if same sex marriage became a reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2017/sep/08/6000km-only-20-minutes-with-the-pm-prime-minister-clinton-pryor-relives-epic-walk-across-australia-indigenous","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T20:00:48Z","webTitle":"'6,000km for 20 minutes with the PM' ...

Clinton Pryor relives his epic walk across Australia","bodyText":"By the time Clinton Pryor reached the great red rock of Uluru, they were calling him Spirit Walker. Spirit Walker in news headlines, “Go Spirit Walker!” yelled out by supporters along the way, #SpiritWalker in twitter feeds. It was roughly the halfway mark of his epic journey for justice, a 5,800km (3,600 miles) walk over 360 days from Perth in the far west of Australia to Canberra in the east. His walk was to highlight the plight of Indigenous Australians and it was here, more than anywhere else, that he felt his ancestral spirits by his side. For Pryor, Uluru is “the heartland, where all the songlines connect you”, and his arrival was a moment of enormous personal impact. “I had always wanted to go there as a child, but to walk there was the most beautiful, amazing thing I could experience,” he says when we meet, four days after the end of his walk. “Just to be there at Uluru where our culture began – I was crying with joy when I saw it. I could not believe I had walked there from Perth.” Pryor is as dog-tired as you would imagine - yawning often, rubbing his eyes, stretching a body that has walked between 30 and 60 kilometres a day for almost a year. At first, he says, his legs “were killing me”, and he battled knee pain throughout, but they’re “pretty good” now. He started the walk with a closely shaved head and looking “baby-faced”, but now has a long beard that lends gravitas to a man who says he’s much wiser than when he started out – if still frustrated by the reception he got from politicians following his arrival in Canberra last Sunday. Pryor arrived to cheers at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy on the lawns across from Old Parliament House – “I just cried with joy” – but meetings with politicians were, he says, dispiriting. He was disappointed that prime minister Malcolm Turnbull would not meet him on his terms at the tent embassy; according to a statement released by Pryor’s team headlined “Spirit Walker walks out of meeting with prime minister”, Turnbull and Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion talked over the top of Aboriginal Elders when they finally met. “How can I say it? I felt like it fell on deaf ears, I felt frustrated,” Pryor says. “I walked 6,000 kilometres to come here, and only got 20 minutes ... there’s so much more to discuss.” Living in poverty It’s been a journey of tragedy and dispossession for this 27-year-old Wajuk, Balardung, Kija and Yulparitja man, who was working as a college administrator when he joined the protest against the forced closure of isolated communities by the Western Australia state government – including Mulan, the community he had lived in as a child. It was during this protest – on Heirisson Island, in the middle of Perth’s Swan River – that he first had the idea to walk to Canberra to meet the prime minister and present him with a growing list of grievances about the state of Indigenous affairs in Australia. Pryor took a year off from his job, set up a crowdfunding page and started training in a gym while money came in from supporters: a total of $16,667 (£10,300) to pay for tents and sleeping bags, satellite phones, film equipment, lodging fees plus support vehicles – a car and a long-distance bicycle – for the two companions who travelled with him as he walked from town to town, 30, 40, 50km a day. Pryor set out to “find the truth of Indigenous Australia” – and the reality, he says, is far worse than he had imagined. “My people are living in poverty: third-world conditions, some with no water, food prices so high, jobs are not given to our people, suicide, lack of services, lack of education.” What he found corroborates the statistics: that Indigenous Australians, who make up 3% of the population, die earlier than other Australians and have far worse health, educational, economic and employment outcomes. Government attempts to redress the disparity by setting targets and monitoring the markers of disadvantage via the Closing the Gap reports have failed, with the the last report showing Australia was failing to meet the targets in six of the seven measures. Pryor’s first leg took him from Perth to Kalgoorlie, a 600km walk north-east through the Western Australia bush to attend the funeral of 14-year-old Elijah Doughty. Doughty, an Indigenous boy, was killed in August 2016 when hit by a ute while riding a motorcycle, a tragedy that led to racially charged riots, a manslaughter charge for the man driving the ute, and the handing down of a three-year sentence on the lesser charge of dangerous driving occasioning death. Pryor felt trepidation: “I knew I was walking into a town full of racism and hatred,” he wrote in his diary. From there he walked to Leonora, where he arrived to a community raw with the pain of suicide. “Leonora has the name of so many people committing suicide – when we got in there, two people had [recently] killed themselves. There’s nothing out there: there’s a lack of services, no counselling, no proper education. When you’re out in towns and you can’t get jobs and you’ve got no one to talk to, people feel depressed. People feel alone.” From Leonora, Pryor had to pass through the 155,000 square km of the Gibson Desert on his way to Uluru, 16 tough days of trekking in 40-50 degree heat that almost did him in. “I threw my stick away and wanted to give up. I said, ‘what am I doing out here?’ But then I sat down and thought about my ancestors who walked across country, and it gave me the understanding of how they did it.” He kept going to Uluru, simultaneously the most inspiring and most challenging destination. For there, Pryor went into the settlement he says most characterised the inequality of the lives of Indigenous Australians living in remote communities, Mutitjulu. “That was the one that hit me the most,” he says. “Near Uluru, seeing the traditional owners, the custodians, living in third-world conditions while there’s a resort on the other side, [only] five kilometres away. “There’s poverty, there’s no new housing, no income – and then you have this resort that is making so much income from tourism. I feel like the resort should be under the control of the custodians so they can make some money for the community, for the people, not use our people and the land to make wealth off it.” The long road to justice Pryor believes the starting point on the long road back to justice for his people would be treaties between the Australian government and the 500-plus Indigenous nations in the country – and he says Australia’s sovereign nation, the United Kingdom, must be part of these treaties too.. “I’m thinking about going to England to see the Queen; hopefully she will listen to us,” he says. “All we want is what should have been done from the very beginning when colonists arrived here on our shores – to talk about treaties, with our people and the Queen, but on our terms, as her system was built on our lands. “I’m hoping to take 40 Elders [Indigenous leaders] with me to discuss these things and gain international support. We want to fix the problem. Politicians put their heads in the sand and don’t want to know. I know she’s a very old lady and a very beautiful old lady, but before she steps down from the monarchy, maybe she can do something from her heart and give us what our people want.” From the heartland of Australia, Pryor continued to walk through countries and communities – talking to Elders, being welcomed into homes or fed around bushfires by farmers, and wearing through eight pairs of shoes as he walked. For all the disappointment at the end of the road, there were many moments of personal joy. Most days his diary entries began with “Good morning it’s another beautiful day for walking!” – and much of the country’s beauty was a revelation to the boy who had never previously travelled beyond Western Australia. Dingoes, kangaroos, emus, goannas running free. Inexplicably, a donkey in the main street of Docker River “with the sun shining on it and walking towards me, one of the best things I’ve ever seen”. When he reached the Western Australia border with the Northern Territory, he met the invisible line that marked the end of his home state with childlike joy: “What’s gonna happen when I cross?” He found love in Port Augusta, when his “missus” Kerry-Lee Coulthard joined him for the remainder of the journey. On Twitter he inspired multiple threads of other Indigenous Australians seeking to learn more about their own country, and in schools – “30 or 40 along the way” – he spoke to kids and urged them to follow their dreams. “My main message talking to the kids was, if you’ve got a dream, go after it, but you’ve got to believe in yourself. Nobody can tell you that you can’t do it. Look at what I am doing, I’m walking across an entire country chasing my dream, and you can do the same. This walk will always be up there in history – to inspire young generations to get up and make a difference to themselves.” If you have experiences relating to this article that you would like to share, please email inequality.project@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/07/emmanuel-macron-calls-for-solidarity-as-he-vows-to-lead-eu-rebuild","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T18:56:39Z","webTitle":"Emmanuel Macron calls for solidarity as he vows to lead EU rebuild","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/emmanuel-macron-calls-for-solidarity-as-he-vows-to-lead-eu-rebuild","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/07/emmanuel-macron-calls-for-solidarity-as-he-vows-to-lead-eu-rebuild","fields":{"headline":"Emmanuel Macron calls for solidarity as he vows to lead EU rebuild","bodyText":"The French president Emmanuel Macron has vowed to lead a “rebuilding” of the European Union, warning that “sovereignty, democracy and trust are in danger” and that its citizens no longer understand the project. In a speech in Athens, Macron called for greater European Union cooperation and solidarity, reiterating his longstanding calls for an integrated eurozone with its own financial minister, parliament and a standalone budget to head off future crises. “Our generation can choose to [do this] ... we must find the strength to rebuild Europe,” he said. The pro-business, centrist French leader whose popularity at home has slumped since he was elected in May, warned that Europeans “must not abandon the fight” of shared values or else the EU would ebb away or die, riven by internal conflicts. He warned the bloc must reinvent itself and become “more democratic,” more than “simply summit after summit” of officials shut away in crisis meetings. Macron promised a road map for the rebuilding of the EU in the coming months, arguing that nations sticking together inside the EU was the only way to protect citizens against problems including climate change and terrorism. However, Macron cannot detail any plans for eurozone or EU reform until after this month’s election in Germany, when it will become clearer to what extent a new government in Berlin would be open to backing his ideas. Macron has sought to position himself as the leader who can fix Europe’s crisis of confidence. He said the result of the UK Brexit referendum reflected a feeling that people did not “understand” the EU and felt they were being constantly asked “to make more efforts” while fearing their daily lives were deteriorating. Macron’s Athens speech was also intended to shore up the support of voters in France who are sceptical about his market-orientated programme to rewrite French labour laws, loosen rules for hiring and firing, and change the pension system. His first measures have been perceived by some as favouring the wealthy over the interests of poorer voters. Macron needs to ensure his policies are not seen by French voters as a dismantling of the country’s postwar welfare state, even though he is keen to stylise himself as a modernising influence for France and Europe. Macron prizes symbolic historic settings for his speeches: he was the first western leader in modern times to make a speech from Pnyx hill in Athens, the birthplace of democracy beneath the Acropolis. The choreographed setting was laden with symbolism for Greece, which has struggled to remain in the eurozone and has recently suffered its worst economic crisis in modern times. Macron praised Greece’s austerity reforms but said ordinary Greeks had paid a heavy price and repeated his call for an easing of the country’s debt burden. He reiterated that Athens should be granted debt relief and said he hoped the issue would be resolved in 2018 when Greece is due to exit its €86bn (£79bn) rescue programme. Macron applauded the often unpopular reforms of prime minister Alexis Tsipras, and insisted that after years of gruelling austerity and the “incredible efforts of the people,” Greece was finally overcoming its problems. “The Greek crisis is slowly ending. We can see that Greece is recovering,” he said, praising Tsipras for his decisive action in the completion of two compliance reviews with international lenders. Before Macron’s speech, a group of leftist militants who broke away from Tsipras’ Syriza party clashed with police as they attempted to protest against the sale of state assets around which much of the visit has focused. Authorities had banned demonstrations as part of a sweeping security operation in the Greek capital. The leftists vowed to defy the ban saying: “Greece is not for sale. Workers are not, and will not become slaves.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/07/how-one-young-dreamer-is-leading-the-fight-against-trumps-daca-rollback","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T18:29:36Z","webTitle":"How one young Dreamer is leading the fight against Trump's Daca rollback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/07/how-one-young-dreamer-is-leading-the-fight-against-trumps-daca-rollback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/07/how-one-young-dreamer-is-leading-the-fight-against-trumps-daca-rollback","fields":{"headline":"How one young Dreamer is leading the fight against Trump's Daca rollback","bodyText":"Karen Caudillo hasn’t eaten breakfast since the Trump administration announced the end of an Obama-era immigration program that shielded young immigrants like herself from deportation. For four days, Caudillo and a group of undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers” are fasting and camping outside the US Capitol in the hope of convincing lawmakers to pass legislation that would allow her to stay. “I’ve been fighting for so long to be able to sustain myself, to go to school, to be productive,” she said in an tearful interview at the Capitol on Wednesday. “And it just feels like everything is going to waste because I could go back to Mexico.” Video of Caudillo’s anguished interview with the Guardian and other reporters on Capitol Hill was widely shared on social media on Wednesday. Caudillo clutched a school portrait of herself taken in kindergarten, just over a year after she immigrated from Mexico with her family at the age of four. Now a junior at the University of Central Florida and the owner of an organic cleaning business in Naples, Caudillo is fearful she might be forced back into the shadows – or worse, deported to her native Mexico, a place she says she cannot even remember. “My earliest memory is from the first-grade, playing with a friend named Eddy,” she said. “I never really even knew what being undocumented was until my sophomore or junior year of high school.” Caudillo is one of nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who grew up in the US but were born in another country. In 2012, President Obama, frustrated by the failure of Congress to pass a law that would spare them from removal proceedings, created the the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program by executive order. Under the program, Caudillo can apply for renewable two-year work visas, obtain a driver’s license and live free of the threat of immediate deportation. The Daca program was always intended to be a placeholder until Congress passed permanent legislation – but the election of Donald Trump threw its fate into question. After months of waiting for Trump’s decision – allowing their hopes to rise each time the president spoke with affection about the group of people he too referred to as “Dreamers” – they finally received an answer. On Tuesday, Jeff Session announced that the administration would rescind the program, stating: “There is nothing compassionate about the failure to enforce immigration laws.” “I wasn’t shocked,” Caudillo said of hearing the news. Her voice again welled with emotion. “I was more ashamed of being so proud of being American.” Caudillo said she was grateful for the opportunities that the program conferred to her, butwas heartbroken over what the changes will mean for younger immigrants like her 15-year-old cousin, who was just accepted to the program. “She has her whole life ahead of her. She is so smart,” Caudillo said. “She won’t even be able to enjoy this opportunity. She’ll have Daca until she’s 17. She won’t even be able to apply for colleges.” Caudillo urged other Dreamers to come forward and share their stories. With the fate of 800,000 immigrant hanging in the balance, remaining on the sidelines of the fight is not an option she said. “If we stop fighting, no one is going to hear our dialogue. No one is going to care,” she said. Caudillo said she was angry with the administration for canceling the program that has helped bring her and hundreds of thousands of young people out of the shadows, but remains hopeful that lawmakers will use the next six months before the program expires to find a solution that allows her to stay in the country and pursue her dream of becoming an environmental lawyer. “I have no fear. I’m hopeful. I’m energized. I’m empowered,” she said. “I think that the right people will step in and support humanity.” The fast ends Friday, but Caudillo said the fight continues until lawmakers act."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/07/british-airways-naps-pension-retirement","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T18:31:34Z","webTitle":"British Airways risks strike action over plans to curb pension benefits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/07/british-airways-naps-pension-retirement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/07/british-airways-naps-pension-retirement","fields":{"headline":"British Airways risks strike action over plans to curb pension benefits","bodyText":"British Airways could face further industrial action, this time over plans to curb retirement benefits for 17,000 pension scheme members, a move unions say would have consequences for the carrier. The airline is proposing an overhaul that would limit retirement payouts from its defined benefit scheme (Naps). It blamed low interest rates and rising life expectancy for an increase in the scheme’s deficit to £3.5bn from £2.8bn in 2015. BA will close the scheme to future accruals, meaning that staff will not see their retirement payout increase in line with their salary and the length of their service. Instead the airline is understood to be considering opening a new scheme that will include the Naps members along with 20,000 members of its less-generous defined contribution scheme (Barp), under which payouts are tied to the performance of investments. Despite claiming this would yield “improved terms for the majority of UK colleagues”, BA faced a veiled threat from the Unite and GMB trade unions of fresh strikes, adding to 85 days of industrial action so far this year. “Unite and GMB within British Airways must express on behalf of our members and in the strongest possible terms, both our dismay and bitter disappointment,” the unions said a joint statement. “Thousands of loyal and long-serving staff, who have helped build British Airways into a world-class flag carrier for this country and one of the most recognisable global brands, now face uncertainty in their retirement. Both unions jointly demand urgent talks to discuss both the impact of this announcement, if a solution can be found and, if not, the consequences the airline may face.” Financial analysts employed by the unions are understood to have made proposals to whittle down the scheme’s deficit that would have seen members accept lower payouts in return for higher contributions from the airline. But BA said it had put £3.5bn into Naps since 2003, the year it was closed to new members, but had been unable to plug an expanding deficit. “In 2017 alone the airline will pay £750m in pension contributions and has already committed to provide between £300m and £450m a year till 2027 to address the Naps deficit,” it said. “If Naps remained open to future accrual, the cost to the company of providing future benefits to Naps members could rise to 45% of individuals’ pensionable pay in 2018 – more than four times the typical employer contribution of UK airlines.” BA has been hit by strikes this year in a separate dispute over pay with its mixed-fleet cabin crew, who are not part of the Naps scheme. Any further labour disputes will once again pit the unions against Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA’s parent company IAG, who has garnered a reputation for taking a tough stance against unions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/10/american-apparel-dov-charney-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T15:00:40Z","webTitle":"American Apparel founder Dov Charney: ‘Sleeping with people you work with is unavoidable’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/10/american-apparel-dov-charney-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/10/american-apparel-dov-charney-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"American Apparel founder Dov Charney: ‘Sleeping with people you work with is unavoidable’","bodyText":"Dov Charney, the man at least as famous for founding American Apparel as he is for being serially accused of sexual harassment, is showing me around his new factory in south central Los Angeles. As usual, he is talking at least as fast as he is walking. “See this shirt? That was influenced by a 1990s shirt one of our designers found. And over there is our photostudio. That guy in there, he’s like a Gatsby bon vivant,” he says in his loud, raspy voice, pointing to a tall young man who, like all the young people who work here, has a somewhat bewildering job title and looks like a model. Another one follows us around with a mobile on a selfie stick. This, I’m told, is “for content”. But there’s no time to ask questions because Charney, who was sacked from his old company in 2014 after years of rumoured sexual misconduct, is on the move again, while simultaneously texting on one phone and talking on another. The reason we are here today is because he is launching a new label, Los Angeles Apparel, and if you think that sounds like his old label you should see the clothes: cute pleated skirts and 1980s-style sportswear are modelled by mannequins in the factory, making the place look an awful lot like an American Apparel shopfloor. Hey, why fix something that only broke because of a few allegations of sexual impropriety? Charney himself is clad head-to-toe in white – white T-shirt, white tracksuit bottoms and white Reeboks. “I look like I’m in a loony bin!” he crows. But what he really looks like is someone’s Uncle Morty from Miami: hipster fashion, which Charney, 48, did so much to popularise, has a cruelly young cut-off age, after which all those tapered trousers and oversized sunglasses just make you look like someone’s aged relative. And then the man the New York Times described as “a barely restrained id” and feminist blog Jezebel called a sexist “troglodyte” turns to me with a grin: “Come!” he barks. I follow him through the door on to the factory floor. American Apparel started off selling basics wholesale, and was a fashion sensation when it launched into retail in 2003. Its slouchy hoodies, funky sunglasses and high-waisted jeans will be seen to be as much a part of the look of the early 2000s as punk was in the 1970s and grunge in the 1990s. It sold a lifestyle to the masses cheaply and let suburban kids pretend they were, as Charney puts it, “the creative class in urban areas” (hipsters, in other words). But the company itself presented a paradox: on the one hand it was manufactured in the US by workers who were paid well; on the other, its advertising featured young women in absurdly provocative poses. Charney himself appeared in some, lying next to seemingly naked young women. Unusually – uniquely, even – American Apparel was a high-street store that had a face to it and Charney – whose facial hair, tight T-shirts and vintage glasses suggested a 1970s pornographer – was that all-too-visible face. His reputation as a sexual creep became unshakeable when he masturbated – twice – in front of a young female magazine journalist during an interview in 2004 (“‘Can I?’ he says, adjusting himself in his chair …”), and he was whacked with a seemingly endless series of sexual harassment charges over the next few years. In 2011, five ex-employees filed lawsuits. This increasingly became a problem for consumers: in the early years “hipster” meant someone who wore vintage clothes and read Vice magazine, but as the decade progressed the term denoted someone who cared about ethical values, and Charney’s reputation was overshadowing the company’s record on workers’ rights. By the time Charney was finally sacked by the board of his own company, he’d had one of the most vertiginous rises and falls in the business world, and he went from having over $500m in stock options to bankruptcy. Charney is desperately counting on Los Angeles Apparel – which, like American Apparel, is starting off in wholesale – to restore his standing. To this end, he is currently living in the factory so he can keep an eye on things 24/7, sleeping on a mattress that everyone carefully walks around. This also saves time in the mornings: instead of commuting he can spend an extra hour dealing with the four lawsuits linked to American Apparel’s implosion that he is still involved in. No one seems to think it is a little ironic for a man who was brought down by accusations of sexual impropriety in the workplace to now keep a mattress in his office. I’d been warned that I might be a little shocked by the factory. “There might be some people, um, undressed,” Charney’s loyal assistant – and, it turns out, his cousin – Sam said to me on the phone. “What?” I replied. “But journalists don’t think it’s strange when athletes are getting undressed in locker rooms after a game, so it’s weird people get freaked out by it,” Sam says. And people do indeed get freaked out by it: one of the many allegations made about Charney at American Apparel was that he wandered through the offices in his underwear. But the factory does not look like the Roman orgy I’d expected. The 350 largely Hispanic workers on the factory floor are all cutting and sewing while Charney, who seems to know them all by name, and is fully clothed, talks to them intently about the tiniest details. In fact, most of them worked for him at American Apparel and such is their loyalty to a man who always paid them at least minimum wage, plus benefits, that they have bet the little they have on him being able to start up a new company. Charney is not the only one with a lot at stake here. “Wait,” he says to me, “I gotta show ya this skirt, it’s just like what you’re wearing. It’s so cute!” Watching him shuffle along in his grubby tracksuit, talking urgently to the workers about how the seam of a T-shirt must sit, babbling to bemused twentysomethings about how his family has always been in the schmatte (Yiddish for “clothing”) business, all I can think is, this is the guy who dictated youth taste for over a decade? This is the guy who was seen as so out there his adverts were banned in Britain? This was one of the most notorious predators in the fashion business? This guy? But then the two of us go into a small side office and things become a lot clearer very quickly. In order to understand Charney you have to understand that American Apparel was, from its clothes to its advertising to its ethos, fully an expression of him. His move into hipster fashion was the culmination of a lifelong obsession with American youth style that began when he was a precocious teenager in Montreal. He went to university in the US but dropped out to manufacture and sell T-shirts. He was widely criticised in later years for allegedly hiring employees based on their looks, but he says people misunderstood: a teetotal workaholic, he needs to have trendy young people around him to keep him plugged into the zeitgeist. “For example, there’s this girl, Jasmine, and she was just an intern but she’s got good taste so boom! She’s in!” he barks, smacking his hands together. Lots of his heroes stayed in touch with youth culture by hanging out with young people, he adds, citing Andy Warhol, Vivienne Westwood and “that crazy German guy, designer, lost lots of weight, has boyfriends” (Karl Lagerfeld). Also: Woody Allen. As it happens, Charney had legal issues with Allen in 2008 when American Apparel used his image without asking, but now Charney claims two are buddies. “He came out to see me in LA before I was fired. He toured the factory, we hung out, he’s a mensch,” Charney says. The image of these two men with a notorious penchant for young women together is certainly a memorable one. Did Woody reach out to him? “Yes, through a mutual friend. He’s a fine man,” he says. As he is telling me this story he is fiddling with something on the arm of the sofa he is sitting on. At first I think it’s a light but it turns out to be another selfie stick. He puts in his phone and carefully turns it so it is filming his face, which is where it stays for the next three hours. Does he film his interviews as a precaution, given what’s happened in the past? “I just think interviews are interesting. They’re fun to watch back and wonder what I was thinking. Shame you’re not in it!” he says. To Charney, his story is incredibly simple. Like his business hero, Steve Jobs, he is the free-thinking maverick who corporate forces set out to destroy. It’s easy to see why he inspires such loyalty from his employees: he is undeniably charismatic and talks with passion about how a business should be run, with an emphasis on workers’ rights, listening to young people and having no hierarchical divides. His supporters and critics talk about “the cult of Dov” but Charney sees it more simply: “I like young people. I get them. I’m like a young person. The thing about monogamy is it freezes you, so one way to stay young is to never graduate to that conventional situation,” he says. Does he have a girlfriend who shares his office mattress with him? “I wouldn’t say that, but I have bonds with people that are very intense and important.” So he doesn’t have any trouble dating now, despite his reputation? He makes a wolfish grin: “No, that is not a problem. The women like an enfant méchant. Also, I look like a warrior because I’m coming back.” Charney describes Los Angeles Apparel as “a continuum” of American Apparel: “The people aren’t different, the materials aren’t different, the environment isn’t different.” Does that mean he’s still going to walk around in his underwear? “That [claim] was untrue. Absolutely untrue! I mean, it is true that I was in my underwear in front of employees when I was doing underwear fittings. That happens in fashion companies.” He grabs hold of a pair of tiny black panties that happen to be on the side of the sofa. “So take Jasmine –” Jasmine the intern? “Yeah, she wore this underwear in front of me,” he says. “It’s not incendiary, it’s not inflammatory, it’s totally normal.” But it is sexy, presumably. “It is! I mean, have fun, try on the underwear. I’m not unfit, you know.” Charney insists he’s too busy at the moment to think about this kind of sexy stuff, although this would be a little more believable if two hours before our interview he hadn’t posted on his Instagram a video of a young female employee in the office bending over in a thong leotard, filmed in the photo studio we just visited. As the camera looms right up to her face she looks around and smiles sexily. “Look, I’m not going to be a victim of sex-shame tactics,” Charney says when I ask about the film. “This obsession that I should be punished for the advertising is fascistic and anti-woman. I will express myself as I always have done.” Is he dating the young woman in the interview? “No, no. But there’s always a connection between a filmmaker and subject.” The story of what actually happened to American Apparel depends on who you ask, Charney or the board members. The shortest answer is that the problems started when the company went public in 2007, and soon enough, all the qualities that Charney saw as his strengths – his unpredictability, his dizzying ambition, his notoriety – were liabilities in the context of Wall Street. American Apparel was also crushed with debt accrued from rapid over-expansion, despite raking in hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and Charney himself was costing the company money. All told, the litigations against him cost the brand $8.2m, although most was covered by insurance. In 2014, it was announced that Charney was fired, “citing an ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct”. But without Charney, acting as the head, face and groin of the brand, the company crashed and thousands of jobs were lost. It was chopped up, sold and re-sold, and is currently limping along online, using many of Charney’s images. That Charney slept with many young women who worked for him has never been up for debate. But it is also true that he was never actually found guilty of sexual harassment, despite the multiple allegations. Of the five suits filed in 2011, for example, three were cleared by a judge and two went to arbitration. “There had been stories about Dov for years and years, but they had been very hard to pin down because every time an employee made a complaint against him it went to arbitration,” Allan Mayer, former co-chairman of American Apparel’s board, tells me. “But when we were able to conduct a more forensic investigation with an outside investigator we found videos and emails from him on the company server that, well, to call them inappropriate would be an understatement.” Charney insists this is all bunkum and was just an excuse for the board to take the company from him and make money for themselves. Yes, there were sexual harassment allegations, but these were old by the time he was fired, and in none of the cases was anything found against him, and this is all true. He also insists the business was in great shape financially: “Why else would they want to take it off me?” But Mayer says that because of Charney’s notoriety no reputable business would lend them money, so they had to borrow “at credit card rates”. “I’ve known Dov since 2004 and I know he honestly doesn’t believe he sexually harassed anyone,” says Mayer. “But when a 45-year-old CEO is sleeping with 19-year-old sales clerks it doesn’t make it consensual. The imbalance is so vast.” Mayer admits American Apparel’s policy on workplace relationships “was not as hard and fast as it is at other companies” and Charney seizes on this: “If it was such a problem for them why didn’t they just ask me to sign a non-fraternisation policy?” Would he have signed it? He hesitates for a few seconds: “Temporarily, maybe. Sure.” Many people see an inherent contradiction between Charney’s indefatigable championing of workers’ rights and his equally energetic pursuit of his female employees. But for Charney, the through line is obvious: he is, essentially, a libertarian who thinks there should be no boundaries, national, professional, sexual. “Look, let’s say this first: I abhor all forms of sexual harassment, period. But it’s unrealistic for the government to interfere with people’s private lives, and that’s it,” he says. I ask if he’s still sleeping with employees. “That’s private!” he retorts. Charney talks about his firing with obsessive fury, raging about how his business was “stolen from” him. But does he regret the behaviour that led to his sacking? “Not at all! Sleeping with people you work with is UNAVOIDABLE!” But “employees” are not people you work with – that’s colleagues. An employee is someone who works for you, I say. “Yeah, but that’s – OK, I’ll say this, I never had a romantic relationship with a factory worker. Ever! It wouldn’t be possible! But a creative equal? Yeah! And if anything, I’ll tell you, I don’t know who was the predator – you know what I’m saying?” he laughs. “Take yourself,” he continues. “You’re well-spoken, well-educated, you decide to work here. And we develop a romantic interest in each other. We could say, ‘OK, we’re attracted to each other, but it’s better we just work together.’ OK, we could try that. And that may work. But if the attraction is so intense, eventually we’re gonna give up! We’ve tried to avoid it, but we’ve decided that we’re going to get involved.” But could he really not have changed his behaviour to stay in control of his own company? “Never! Out of the question. It wouldn’t be good for society! It wouldn’t advance the rights of workers.” But it would have kept your workers employed. “No, no!” He is exasperated that I’m still not getting the truth here. “You think, I was just supposed to stand up straighter, not allowed to wear [just] my underwear? No! [The board] wanted control! It was all a hoax.” But even if it was all a hoax, even if the board just wanted to seize the company, didn’t he leave himself vulnerable to it? “Maybe, a little bit, probably. But I think my real mistake was that I was too trusting. I should have removed some of the board members.” “I think Dov is irrepressible,” says Mayer. “He is who he is and he sincerely does not see that he did anything wrong, so it’s hard to see why he would change.” There is no doubt Charney is, when it comes to retail and workers’ rights, something of a visionary. But if you are not willing to keep it zipped to pursue your dreams, you will only run so far before tripping over your trousers. You can insist that this is just about society’s hypocrisies and limitations all you want, but if you’re not willing (or able) to compromise at least on this issue for the greater good, then people will wonder what your priorities actually are. But to Charney, his story exemplifies how hysteria about sex and gender can obscure the real issues. “Like with Trump, OK? It disgusted me when they made a big deal about the Billy Bush episode. The man’s a terror because he’s anti-worker, anti-immigrant, a nationalist, hostile to environmental ideology and knows nothing about how to bring manufacturing back. He has no ideas! That’s what matters! Liberals lost on ideology!” And of course, he’s kind of right, and just as I find myself nodding along he adds, “That stuff he said to Billy Bush [about grabbing women by the vagina] – who cares? If you recorded all the things I said about women in the past 10 days it would be no different.” Interview done, he gives me one last tour of the factory. He is a ball of energy; you’d never guess he’d been talking pretty much non-stop for three hours as he chatters away to suppliers, workers and employees, talking on this phone, texting on that one. I tell him I’m going to call a cab and wait out front. A few minutes later, he suddenly appears next to me. “So are you hanging round in LA for a while?” he asks, and he has a shy smile on his face. I say I am. “What are you up to?” he asks. I tell him I’m doing another interview, I might go check out some museums. “Uh-huh,” he says, still smiling. I mention I also want to pick up some American toys for my kids. “Right,” he says, smile disappearing. “OK, bye.” And just like that, he disappears, already on the move again. • This article was amended on 11 and 15 September 2017.

The trail of damage in areas first hit by the storm’s 185mph winds served as grim warning for those further west as they braced for its arrival hours or days later, with its intensity barely dimmed. Among the worst hit were a string of small islands where the storm first made landfall, including the Franco-Dutch island of Saint Martin and nearby Barbuda. Barely a single Barbudan building escaped undamaged, around a quarter of properties were utterly obliterated, and half the population was left homeless by the storm. Helicopter images showed stretches of flooded rubble that had been streets and homes crushed into piles of rubble or walls left without a roof. On the beach-front in the Dutch side of Saint Martin, boats were crushed up against each other like damaged toys, rows of parked cars were submerged in flood water up to their roofs and the airport battered beyond use. “What we experienced is like something you see in a horror movie, not something you expect to actually happen in reality,” Nedd told the local ABS television. Among the most traumatised survivors were those who tried to ride Irma out at home. “When the first part came, it was like the whole house was ripping apart,” said Jacqueline Bisa, who was in her home with seven relatives. They took shelter in a closet and the bathroom but the winds were so fierce they had to hang on to the door to keep it closed until they could be evacuated. “It was like it was sucking us up,” she said the next morning. Several older residents with long experience of the fierce winds churned up by the Atlantic in hurricane season described Irma as unprecedented. “Last night was the most devastating experience I have had in my life and I am almost 60,” said a man who gave his name as King Goldilocks. “Who hasn’t lost their roof, their house crumbled, like me? I am totally homeless.” Barbudans initially struggled to reach the government on nearby Antigua, which was spared the very worst of the storm, said Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. “I’m of the view that as it stands now Barbuda is barely habitable,” Browne told ABS TV. “The island is literally under water and that in itself is a serious threat. We never anticipated this level of damage.” The storm brought down telecoms towers and destroyed a back-up radio system so islanders could not report back on the extent of the damage. Rescue efforts on many islands are likely to be hampered by damage to airports as planes cannot currently land safely. The winds were so powerful that even some of the island’s storm shelters were overwhelmed, said Barbuda’s fire station chief who gave his name as Sergeant George. “The community centre, which was one of the designated shelters, did not stand up to the task, and the churches we used did not stand up to the task,” he said. “So we had to use St Thomas hospital but that stood up well.” In other areas in the storm’s path, residents were rushing to storm-proof buildings or strengthen shelters while praying that Irma would change course and spare them a direct hit, as it did Puerto Rico. “I have to start by thanking God, because although this was a strong event, it could have had a larger impact, and it is certain that the [prayers] of the Puerto Ricans and the people supporting them were heard,” the governor, Ricardo Rossello, said at a news conference after the worst of the storm had passed. The damage to the island was still considerable, with three reported dead, up to a million without power, extensive damage from fallen trees, lamp-posts and other debris and ongoing risk of flash floods. Schools will remain closed on Friday. On its current course, Hurricane Irma is predicted to pass by the northern shores of Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Thursday, directly over, or quite close to, the British territories of the Turk and Caicos Islands on Thursday night, followed by a brush with the southern islands of the Bahamas and Cuba’s northern coast. On Friday night, the hurricane is expected to land at or pass near the archipelago of the Florida Keys, where the governor, Rick Scott, has ordered an evacuation. It’s unclear exactly where the storm will strike along the coast. Scott warned that it could veer unexpectedly, and that its gigantic size meant that both Florida’s Gulf and Atlantic coasts are threatened by severe storm surges and category-four hurricane winds. Cuba’s central and eastern provinces were put on alert, warning of everything from risk of burglaries during the storm to epidemics in its wake. In some areas schools were closed for Friday and state ration stores dolled out extra rice, oil and sugar. “If you go to the shops, there’s hardly anything there – well that’s normal in Cuba, but there’s even less now,” laughed taxi driver Riccardo Hernández, 54. Trees close to houses, electricity cables and phone lines were being felled and factories shut down. There were no mass evacuations planned on the mainland but tourists and workers were expected to be ferried off island resorts to safety. In Havana, which is forecast to miss the worst of the hurricane, everyday life carried on mostly as normal but workers were clearing piles of broken concrete and rubbish that could be turned into dangerous projectiles, and unblocking drains. “I’ve bought bread and a lot of candles in case the gas goes out, and my wife’s been boiling water all day to store in our water tank,” says Victor Jimenez, 61, in one of the capital’s fews malls where other shoppers were stocking up on tinned food. Those who have already survived Irma now face worries about finding food and shelter amid the ruins of their homes and could also face fresh devastation. For the first time in seven years there are three active hurricanes in the Atlantic and one named Jose is tracing a tentative path that could take it though the areas worst hit by Irma. Barbuda residents say they are not prepared to withstand even a much weaker storm. “My main concern is how we are going to survive after this given that every house, every utility is completely damaged and gone,” said Cariana Baltimore, who fled to a shelter with six family members after Irma tore the roof off their home. Like many on the island she was terrified about the prospect of having to ride out Jose in the island’s shattered ruins, and begged for evacuation. “All of my family members we don’t even have a home no more, and the prospect of another hurricane heading in our direction is terrifying, I think we should evacuate.” Also badly hit were the British Virgin Islands, a string of small islands whose residents begged for aid on Facebook. “We have nothing here, we need help, only our lives were saved,” said Germaine Smith in a video he said was taken on Tortola. “Everything smashed up, every building smashed up, nothing saved.” The storm also badly damaged the home of entrepreneur Richard Branson, on the private island of Necker, although everyone present when Irma hit took shelter in a wine cellar and no one was hurt. “Glad to say that all humans on Necker are OK although a lot of buildings destroyed,” Branson’s son Sam said in an Instagram post.

But however you look at things, Bournemouth have not started the season well, nor are they set up to exploit Arsenal’s weaknesses. Arsenal will also be helped by the relative stability of knowing that Alexis Sánchez is theirs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is not, the project of improving him vain, in vain, and well beyond this iteration of Arsène Wenger. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s selection at Anfield apotheosised Wenger’s current muddle, given: a player keen to join Liverpool; his deployment at wing-back, a position which demands unstinting discipline and commitment; his natural unsuitability for that role; the presence on the bench of a specialist, signed in the summer in order to play that role; the need to move another specialist out of position to accommodate him; against a team renowned for its prowess in wide areas. In Wenger’s long and storied career, this is a decision less explicable than all bar his protracted perseverance with Manuel Almunia. Now, though, Wenger must settle on his best team and, in particular, trust his new players. The impetuous hardness of Sead Kolasinac will bring a bit of fun if nothing else, while Alexandre Lacazette has the pace and intelligence to help Mesut Özil thrive. And Özil needs help to thrive, a reality which may displease those already displeased by his languid style; they can console themselves with his class and finesse, qualities which do not exactly proliferate among his team-mates. Only an idiot would buy a cat and expect it to behave like a dog. • Wenger tells Arsenal legends: you weren’t perfect either 2) Shakespeare can undo Chelsea the Leicester way When Chelsea visited the King Power in January, they were already champions-elect, while Leicester were a mess; as such Claudio Ranieri decided to use a formation similar to that employed by Antonio Conte. Football being football, there are no rules to such things, but generally speaking, if an inferior team apes a superior one, class will prevail; the route to unexpected victory lies in exploiting differences, not creating similarities. So Leicester were handed a comprehensive kicking in which the brace scored by Marcos Alonso, Chelsea’s left wing-back, epitomised their expertise at playing a system that Leicester could not hope to imitate. This time things will be different. Craig Shakespeare’s players will be sent on to the pitch to do what they do best and take away what Chelsea do best – or, given the likely absence of Eden Hazard, second best. Rather than simply apply their skill, the champions will have to impose their will, engaged not in an exhibition but a fight – and in a fight, anything can happen. Of course, Chelsea may still win, but Leicester are more likely to prevent that by staying true to themselves than by performing a cheap impression of their opposition. • Leicester battling to sign Silva after missing deadline by 14 seconds 3) Might Goodison be a home from home for Spurs? Moving into a lavish new home …. that will secure their status for a generation … but at the worst possible time ... is the absolute height of Spurs. Though they have learned something from the errors of others, seemingly building a ground not a stadium, there is no escaping the disaster that was not staying put for one more season. But who was to know that after nearly 30 years without, the club would once again have a team to contest league titles, and for whom the elemental advantages of White Hart Lane – its familiarity, atmosphere and tight spaces – would be so crucial to their style of play. Now, though, it is impossible to conceive of them becoming champions while playing at Wembley, nor as they settle in somewhere new, and while their fans can wait – it has been a while already – their players cannot afford similar levity. Inevitably, some will leave, whether for medals or financial parity with the third best-paid board in England. Already this season, Spurs have dropped more points at home than in the entirety of last, and already this season, Spurs have done as they did in the previous two, undermining their title challenge with a slow start. Accordingly, they must get going on their travels, and though they could wish for a more welcoming trip than to Goodison, they will find a pitch almost as compact as that at White Hart Lane, may its memory be for a blessing, and more space in which to enjoy it than was afforded them by Chelsea and Burnley. With Spurs, there is, in a sense, never anything for which to look out: they play the same way in more or less every game, just far too well for most teams to cope. But on Saturday they will feel they have something to prove, and more than that, they simply cannot afford to lose. In particular, these circumstances should agitate and excite Dele Alli, whose intelligence, attitude and edge were so crucial to England in midweek. As such, watching him perform should be one of the highlights of the weekend – at least for those who prefer football to vacant moralising and self-hating narcissism. • Pochettino hopes Alli and Aurier furores are over 4) Stoke a barometer for Manchester United’s title credentials Rarely are titles decided by the big games; in 25 years of the Premier League, you’re looking at 95-96, 97-98, 02-03, 09-10 and 11-12. Which is to say that Manchester United, champions 13 times in that period, were successful mainly because they – or, more properly, their manager – ensured that they generally won when they were supposed to. On Saturday evening, United are away to Stoke, the archetypal, apocryphal Premier League fixture: the wind blows, the crowd bay, and Rory Delap tames Lionel Messi. Alex Ferguson’s teams were largely impervious to such effects; in five visits to the Potteries they won four and drew one, whereas since his retirement they have recorded two draws and two defeats. Accordingly, this weekend’s encounter will tell us something of United’s progress, their toughest test so far – all the more so given the momentum-checker that is international fortnight. United have been notable so far this season for how strong they have been in the final quarter of games, but that advantage may be lost to them on this occasion: the majority of Stoke players have had two weeks of rest and preparation, so should be primed for a strong start and finish. If United can emerge with three points, it will be a sign that they are ready to be good again. 5) Guardiola’s ad hoc selection faces stiff Liverpool test Manchester City and Liverpool have plenty in common: they are fast, attacking, aggressive teams, undermined by inexcusably dodgy defences. But there is one major difference between them: everyone knows exactly how Liverpool will play, whereas no one has any clue how Manchester City play – including the players, by the look of things. Partly, this is because Pep Guardiola is trying to hide the aforementioned dodgy defence, partly this is because he has more attackers than attacking positions, and partly this is because he is an obsessive perfectionist. So he is still trying to deduce whether he should use two wingers if that limits him to only one striker; whether David Silva, Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne can fit into the same team; and how to get 17 full-backs and 24 midfielders into 11 starting spots. Options are useful, but they can also confuse things. Whoever Guardiola picks on Saturday will not be granted the luxury of easing themselves into the game; they will be put under pressure from the start, particularly in the space between full-backs and centre-backs. Should City survive that opening period, they should have far too much midfield class for Liverpool, but there is no guarantee that another ad hoc selection will be cohesive enough from the off. • Woodburn set for long-term Liverpool deal after shining for Wales 6) Win or bust for De Boer at Palace No one could have expected anyone to turn a Sam Allardyce team into a Johan Cruyff team within two months, so Frank de Boer’s failure to achieve that is not why his job is at risk. What’s in question is whether he is even trying and why, in the process, his players must be so utterly befuddled. It’s common for beneficiaries of privilege to justify their good fortune on the basis that their status simply got their foot in the door, when really – especially in competitive industries – that is not just part of the thing but the whole thing. De Boer was given a job running Ajax’s youth team soon after retiring as a player, progressing to assistant manager of Netherlands before taking over Ajax’s first team. He enjoyed some success there, though none of it especially noteworthy beyond its basic fact, and eventually resigned after failing to win the league in consecutive seasons, trailing the champions by 17 points in the first of those. This was enough to earn him a job at Internazionale, who fired him after 85 miserable days; seven months later he arrived at Selhurst Park, bringing with him the assistant manager and head of performance who had been so effective in Milan. Essentially, had De Boer not been a decent player he would not have got his first job nor any subsequent job; the number of elite players who become elite managers is small; and failing at a bigger club is not a harbinger of success at a smaller club. There is little in De Boer’s CV which suggests he has what it takes to succeed a Premier League polymath like Allardyce – you laugh, but it’s true – it’s just that privilege really doesn’t care for such fripperies. In which context it is no great surprise that Palace are in a bad way, nor that they have allegedly given De Boer one game – this weekend’s trip to Burnley – to save his job. That might not seem like rational behaviour, but then neither was appointing him in the first place. 7) Huddersfield can make September bleak for Hammers Just this week, Bruno de Carvalho, the director of Sporting, described David Gold and David Sullivan as the “dildo brothers”. In normal circumstances, this could be easily laughed off – it is, after all, extremely amusing – but these are not, even by the standards of West Ham supporters, normal circumstances. It is, presumably, rather galling to be patronised by pornographers, likewise by their vice-chair whose personal website describes her as an “inspiration to women everywhere” – and this week they have added a new wrinkle to their skillset, unwittingly flaunting their transfer market incompetence for all to cringe. Which is to say that West Ham are, objectively speaking, an absolute joke. They have left their home and their heartland for no apparent gain, their manager isn’t up to it, and they are bottom of the league. Of course supporters will always have the elements over which the club has no control – friends, family, identity and routine – but the actual football part of things could scarcely look more hopeless. So on Monday night, things could be fractious. Full of confidence and points, Huddersfield will not freeze; they will turn up to win, and with a plan. West Ham, on the other hand, have looked clueless for sometime, but now have one potential saving grace: a goalscorer. Javier Hernández has scored for and against some of the best teams in the world, and his infectious enthusiasm might just get things going. If it cannot, and if they cannot beat a promoted team at home, September in Stratford will feel like winter in Winterfell. 8) Will Hughton be bold against Baggies? Though many promoted sides go straight back down again, many also register a surprise early win or two, fired with enthusiasm and fortified by a winning mentality. Brighton, on the other hand, have mustered no such thing, drawing once, losing twice, and scoring nil thrice in their three games so far; as such, they lie 17th in the table. And worse than that, among the sides above them are those with whom they came up, and among the sides below them are West Ham and Crystal Palace, both of whom will eventually improve. West Brom at home is precisely the kind of game a promoted side would look to win in every circumstance, except that this West Brom are fifth in the table after recording two wins and a draw. They may have scored only once in each game, but they have conceded only once in three games; they may not have faced a murderer’s row of opposition, but they will be confident and grooved; beating them will not be easy. All this gives Chris Hughton has a decision to make. So far this season he has picked a different attacking combination to start each game, making whatever he does on Saturday no more than an educated guess. But for a home fixture of this ilk, perhaps he might go with what works, playing Tomer Hemed and Glenn Murray together. Yes, there is a risk of being outnumbered and outplayed in midfield, but in the end, if you do not score, you cannot win. 9) Bayern’s loss is Swansea’s gain Players who can carry the ball through the middle of the pitch are not easy to find, which makes it surprising – and a little disconcerting – that Renato Sanches has pitched up at Swansea. That he made no impression at Bayern Munich is no shame – it is hard to carve a niche in a midfield already perming from Arturo Vidal, Thiago Alcântara, Thomas Müller, Xabi Alonso, Joshua Kimmich – and now, Corentin Tolisso, James Rodríguez and Sebastian Rudy. But the disinterest shown in him by any of Europe’s biggest clubs suggests that all is not as it should be which, counter-intuitively, represents a fantastic opportunity for Paul Clement and Swansea City. They have got themselves a player with great talent and zest, whose bold, bustling game is ideal for the Premier League. It will be fascinating and exciting to see how he fares. 10) Richarlison one to watch in battle to be best of rest It is not hard to predict the top seven finishers in this season’s Premier League; simply consult the top seven finishers in last season’s Premier League. But below that there are places are up for grabs, and both Watford and Southampton will fancy themselves to top that middle section. That said, we do not really know what to expect from either, as both have new managers while Watford have signed a raft of new players. And, keen though people are to rush to immediate judgment, we cannot know how well those players will play until, well, we see them play. In the meantime, though, we can invest in Richarlison, who was outstanding in his team’s win at Bournemouth. There’s something special about Brazilian attackers, especially in England where we don’t get many, let alone many who succeed, so we can spend at least the next couple of months looking out for the latest pretender in the hope that he’ll grow into the real deal. The early signs are good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/07/john-le-carre-on-trump-something-truly-seriously-bad-is-happening","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T22:28:16Z","webTitle":"John le Carré on Trump: ‘Something seriously bad is happening’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/07/john-le-carre-on-trump-something-truly-seriously-bad-is-happening","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/07/john-le-carre-on-trump-something-truly-seriously-bad-is-happening","fields":{"headline":"John le Carré on Trump: ‘Something seriously bad is happening’","bodyText":"John le Carré, one of Britain’s greatest living writers, has spoken of the “toxic” parallels between the rise of Donald Trump and the rise of 1930s fascism. In a rare public appearance, the 85-year-old novelist and former spy spoke of his disdain for Trump and his despair for the US and the wider world. “Something truly, seriously bad is happening and from my point of view we have to be awake to that,” he told an audience at the Royal Festival Hall in London. “These stages that Trump is going through in the United States and the stirring of racial hatred … a kind of burning of the books as he attacks, as he declares real news as fake news, the law becomes fake news, everything becomes fake news. “I think of all things that were happening across Europe in the 1930s, in Spain, in Japan, obviously in Germany. To me, these are absolutely comparable signs of the rise of fascism and it’s contagious, it’s infectious. Fascism is up and running in Poland and Hungary. There’s an encouragement about.” Even today, Le Carré said, Ang Sang Suu Kyi is speaking of “fake news” in Burma. “These are infectious forms of demagogic behaviour and they are toxic.” Le Carré was speaking at an event in aid of the charity Médecins Sans Frontières and which was also beamed to cinemas – to mark the publication of his latest book, A Legacy of Spies, which features the return of his fictional spymaster George Smiley. The audience, which included Tom Stoppard, Nigella Lawson, Frank Skinner, Jarvis Cocker, Richard Osman and Robert Winston, listened as Le Carré looked back on his life and work and answered tweeted questions from the public, chosen by moderator Jon Snow. Le Carré was employed by both MI5 and MI6 before becoming a writer, but he said the service then was a kind of “non-violent fairyland” hugely different to the security services of today. Asked whether he would recommend being a spy, he said: “It is is such a huge industry now, with so many different compartments, it is almost like saying: would you take up the law? These services have altered so vastly since my day.” If people are, though, “by instinct a befriender, a seducer and a liar, in the sense of a gentleman who lies for the good of his country” then MI6 is for you, “but think of the second half of your life because not many people have one”. Despite Le Carré’s new book being billed as the return of Smiley, his appearance is, according to one review, “the slimmest of cameos”. Nevertheless, it has been rapturously received. Reviewing for the Guardian, John Banville writes: “The ingenuity and skill with which the thing is brought off is breathtaking – really, not since The Spy [Who Came in from the Cold] has Le Carré exercised his gift as a storyteller so powerfully and to such thrilling effect.” The book tells the story of Smiley’s right-hand man Peter Guillam, summoned to MI6’s headquarters in Vauxhall to explain the events from The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, which resulted in the deaths at the Berlin wall of agent Alec Leamas and his lover Liz Gold. Le Carré said Guillam, “when I’m feeling confused but willing”, was the character he most related to, but there were parts of him in all his characters. “You can’t actually make character without putting something of yourself in to each one, even the most larcenous and wicked, the most lecherous, the most pure. Each of them has, in his or her own way, something that you can relate to.” Le Carré’s previous Smiley novels are set in the cold war, an almost unimaginably different era to which he said he did not hark back. He admitted being old-fashioned, writing every day with a pen. And although there will be no more Smiley he said he would continue writing and was working on his next novel. “I would go on writing even if I knew I was not going to be published, ever. I couldn’t help it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/08/david-lammy-review-bame-children-face-prejudice-flawed-criminal-justice-system","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"The racial bias in our justice system is creating a social timebomb | David Lammy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/david-lammy-review-bame-children-face-prejudice-flawed-criminal-justice-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/david-lammy-review-bame-children-face-prejudice-flawed-criminal-justice-system","fields":{"headline":"The racial bias in our justice system is creating a social timebomb","bodyText":"When David Cameron asked me to conduct a review into the over-representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals in the criminal justice system, I thought I was being set up to fail. So many of the causes of, and answers to, the problem lie outside the criminal justice system: poverty, lone-parent families, school exclusions, and growing up in the care system. And what more is there left to say about stop and search? But having looked at the evidence over the past 18 months, my judgment is that we have a significant problem in the criminal justice system itself, and that the treatment of BAME young people shows this problem is getting worse. Minority ethnic children make up a growing proportion of those offending for the first time, reoffending, and serving custodial sentences. Today 41% of under-18s in custody are from minority backgrounds, compared with 25% a decade ago. Young black people are now nine times more likely to be in youth custody than young white people. I expected to find the youth justice system laser-focused on this issue. Instead, I have seen large parts of the system indifferent to issues of race. The best schools can tell you immediately how children from different backgrounds are achieving – and who is falling behind. They use data to inform practice and track progress. This sense of urgency has been missing in youth justice. Unless something changes, this cohort will become the next generation of adult offenders. Black boys are more than 10 times as likely as white boys to be arrested for drug offences. But behind these young people are adults. Last year, nearly three-quarters of police forces arrested under-16s for selling crack, heroin or cocaine. These drugs come from somewhere. Vulnerable children are being preyed on. Parents feel powerless about their children being drawn into street crime under duress. We – police, prosecutors, policymakers and the press – need to focus more on the hardened criminals who are moving weapons around our country and sending youngsters out to push drugs. The government’s modern slavery legislation must be used to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable children. This is not about letting offenders off – precisely the opposite. More enforcement must be focused on powerful adults, further up criminal hierarchies A third of young people in custody have spent time in the care system, and a similar proportion have mental health issues. Nearly half arrive with substance misuse problems. But these problems are not being picked up as often for minority ethnic children as white children. BAME children in custody are less likely to be recorded as having substance misuse concerns, to be at risk of self-harm, to have learning difficulties, to have mental health concerns, to be disengaged from education, and to have problematic family relationships. The pattern is too consistent to ignore. It is hard not to conclude that minority youngsters face bias in our criminal justice system. When children leave custody they need family support more than anything else. But the youth justice system appears to have given up on parenting. Last year, 55,000 young offenders were found guilty in the courts. Just 189 parenting orders were issued to provide challenge and support for the parents of young offenders. Only 60 involved BAME young people. If parenting orders are not working then they need to be replaced by something that does. Most of all, young people need a different future to aspire to, but our criminal records regime is holding them back. Half of employers would not consider employing someone with a criminal record. But over the past five years 22,000 minority ethnic children have had their names added to the national police computer database. There should be more flexibility. As in parts of the US, there should be an opportunity for ex-offenders to come before a judge, or an organisation like the parole board, to apply to have records sealed in all but the most serious cases. The disproportionate number of BAME young people in the justice system is a social timebomb. It is beyond time to stop talking about this problem and to act.

Is a new era upon us?","bodyText":"Is this the beginning of a new Donald Trump? The president, who has governed like a rightwing Republican and terrified vulnerable people everywhere, struck a deal with Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday to lift the debt limit and finance the government until the middle of December. The debt ceiling increase was combined with a stopgap funding measure to provide aid for the areas devastated by Hurricane Harvey, and temporarily avoids a government shutdown. For once, a needless and brainless fight was avoided in Washington. Trump actually circumvented Republican leaders to get it done. Neither speaker Paul Ryan nor majority leader Mitch McConnell were willing to accept the terms, so Trump went behind their backs. These are strange times, indeed. Trump is impulsive and mercurial, typically devoid of ability to think in the long-term. He watches TV and gets ideas. Building the most conservative administration in recent memory, he has existed so far under its influence, empowering the kind of people who want to punish the poor and people of color. Nothing more should be expected out of Trump on this front. He is who he is. He wisely cut a deal with Democratic leaders because even he understood that holding up disaster relief was cruel and idiotic. He may have also been hungry for a positive headline from the mainstream media he allegedly reviles, but is actually obsessed with. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader of the Senate, is a natural collaborator, his ideology resting somewhere in the milquetoast center. He would love to do more deals with Trump. Trump likes the idea of deals. They are both from New York, after all. So maybe, just maybe, a new era is upon us. But Trump can change his mind tomorrow. He usually does. Congressional Republicans are furious. They are still waiting to build Milton Friedman’s Eden, here on Earth, and this reality show president who calls himself a Republican has been too incompetent, at least so far, to make it happen. They will yell at him and maybe he’ll listen. The last person in his ear usually has the advantage. What people should remember, always, is how obstructionist congressional Republicans were under Barack Obama and how they alone brought government to a standstill. Democratic lawmakers, for all their flaws, worked with Republicans when they were in power to at least keep the government functioning. Bipartisanship for its own sake is stupid – no one should be celebrated for helping to deregulate the economy or crushing the working class – but there are basic things (like raising the debt limit) that both parties can agree upon and usually did until the tea party rose to power. Trump shouldn’t be praised for cutting this deal. It’s an obvious deal, and we can’t set the bar so low just because this president was so unprepared to run the most powerful nation on Earth. Instead, understand that it is congressional Republicans who deserve your scorn. They are the people who see government as an unmitigated evil, who endorse austerity at all costs. Paul Ryan is not your friend, and never will be. Mitch McConnell has no serious legislative accomplishments. They are smarter men than Trump and ultimately, barring Trump starting a war, more dangerous. If they had a partner like Mike Pence in the White House, America would be transformed forever. Remember, it can always get worse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/07/arsene-wenger-calls-end-ffp-rules-u-turn-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T21:30:20Z","webTitle":"Disillusioned Arsène Wenger calls for end to FFP in major U-turn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/07/arsene-wenger-calls-end-ffp-rules-u-turn-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/07/arsene-wenger-calls-end-ffp-rules-u-turn-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Disillusioned Arsène Wenger calls for end to FFP in major U-turn","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger has lost faith in one of his guiding principles and called for financial fair play to be scrapped. The Arsenal manager says clubs have found a way to bluff around Uefa’s regulations and it has effectively rendered them unenforceable. He feels that if the Premier League is to “remain the best league in the world” the decision must be taken to revert to no financial limits. Wenger reflected on a wild summer transfer window in which he suggested that Liverpool had most likely tapped up Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain before taking him from Arsenal for an initial £35m on 31 August. Four days earlier, the midfielder had played for Arsenal in the club’s 4-0 defeat at Anfield. Wenger said he did not know whether Liverpool had spoken to Oxlade-Chamberlain in the hours leading up to kick-off. He hoped they had not. Wenger did not make his comments in an angry or accusatory fashion; they were underpinned by realism. In short, tapping up is a part of the modern game. Everybody does it. But Wenger was less willing to shrug off what he sees as the holes in FFP. He was asked whether he had a view on the complaint made to Uefa by the La Liga president, Javier Tebas, about the summer spending of Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City. PSG broke the world transfer record with their £198m purchase of Neymar from Barcelona while they took Kylian Mbappé from Monaco on a season‑long loan with an option to buy him for £166m. Uefa are investigating PSG but not City, who have threatened Tebas with legal action. Wenger did have a view and it was strident. “Financial fair play raises new questions,” Wenger said. “I always did plead for it. Today, I am not convinced that we can maintain it. Football is maybe only at the start of a huge financial investment. It has become the most powerful sport in the world. It means do we have to open the door completely to investments? It is a question we have to raise because, aAt the moment, it looks like we have created rules that cannot be respected. There is nothing worse than when you create rules that are not respected. “Maybe we are at the crossroads and we have to think, do we open it with complete freedom to investment for people like the Chinese and Americans, who want to invest here [in England]? If you want to remain the best league in the world, that is certainly the way we have to go. “Do I want to get rid of financial pair play? I think so because there are too many legal ways to get around it. The question, at least, has to be raised. At the moment, it looks like you can buy clubs in China and get the players there, and buy them in other clubs, then get them, after, here. You can get around [FFP]. Am I convinced that, at the moment, the rules are strong enough to make it respected? I’m not sure.” Wenger’s remarks on tapping-up came as he explained why he was in favour of the summer transfer window closing before the start of the Premier League season. “You sit there before the games and in players’ minds, they have no clarity,” Wenger said. “Are they in? Are they out? Are they half in? Are they half out? Are they tapped up in the afternoon of the game by people who want to get them out?” Wenger was asked whether any player in his dressing-room at Liverpool on the Sunday before last had been tapped up in advance of the game or on the day of it. It was clear that the question related to Oxlade-Chamberlain. “I don’t know,” Wenger replied. Was it his suspicion? “Have they been tapped up?” Wenger said. “Of course. But on the day of a game? I don’t think so. I hope not. But it’s inevitable. France played against Holland on the last day of the transfer window. Do you really think that not one French player or Dutch player had phone-calls in the afternoon about do they move or not? You’re not naive enough to believe that.” Wenger insisted that he did not regret starting with Oxlade-Chamberlain in the Liverpool game. “If I am a football player, I can perform even if Liverpool is in my head,” he said. “I don’t think that should stop you to perform. Did it? I think he was not worse than any other player on the football pitch.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/07/senate-hurricane-harvey-aid-trump-democrats","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T18:56:25Z","webTitle":"Senate approves initial aid to Harvey victims after Trump's deal with Democrats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/07/senate-hurricane-harvey-aid-trump-democrats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/07/senate-hurricane-harvey-aid-trump-democrats","fields":{"headline":"Senate approves initial aid to Harvey victims after Trump's deal with Democrats","bodyText":"The Senate has approved the first wave of disaster aid – a $15.3bn relief package – to the region devastated by Hurricane Harvey, as part of a surprise deal struck between Donald Trump and Democratic leaders. The bill to help the recovery in Texas – and particularly the area around Houston – would also temporarily raise the US federal borrowing limit and keep the government running for the next three months. The agreement, passed by 80 votes to 17, defuses the immediate threat of a government shutdown. But Congress now faces an 8 December deadline to strike another agreement and avoid a fiscal cliff. The aid package, nearly double Trump’s initial request, now goes to the House of Representatives, where a group of more than 150 conservative Republicans have announced their opposition to the plan. Before the Senate vote, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on the floor: “It will provide certainty and stability for first responder, state officials and the many others involved in preparing for and recovering from these storms with critically needed emergency funds that will not be interrupted by the prospect of a shutdown or default ... Let’s work together and act on this legislation very quickly.” On Wednesday, Trump met congressional leaders of both parties in the Oval Office. The Democrats left with Trump having agreed to a three-month extension on the debt ceiling and government funding, a move that infuriated the president’s own party, which had proposed a longer extension. After the meeting, McConnell stated bluntly that Trump “agreed with Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Pelosi” on a three-month funding extension. “The president can speak for himself, but his feeling was that we needed to come together to not create a picture of divisiveness at a time of genuine national crisis,” the Senate leader said on Wednesday. Later that night, McConnell added added $7.4bn in funding to rebuild after the storm, which comes in addition to Trump’s $7.9bn request to respond to the areas devastated by Harvey in Texas and parts of Louisiana. Some Republicans balked at the deal, arguing that it gave Democrats an advantage during the looming fiscal battle postponed to the end of the year. Speaking before the vote, Senator Ben Sasse, a conservative Republican from Nebraska who opposed the bill, said the agreement made Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer “the most powerful man in America for the month of December” when the debt ceiling will be renegotiated. “What we’re doing in this body today is not draining the swamp,” Sasse said in a speech on the Senate floor. “What we’re doing is running a whole bunch of hoses to the edge of the swamp, turning them on to the highest possible volume flow, and then turning our backs on the swamp and shouting: ‘There’s nothing to see here.’” Democrats, too, expressed exasperation that Congress has been unable to pass a long-term budget. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, declared after the vote: “Nobody should be happy with what Congress did today.” He said Congress had accomplished the “bare minimum” and simply “kicked the can down the road” for future fights over the US debt. Despite widespread concern among GOP lawmakers that Trump caved to Democrats, House speaker Paul Ryan said he understood the president’s motivations. “The president made it really clear and what he was aiming for in that meeting yesterday was a bipartisan moment while the country is facing two horrible hurricanes,” Ryan said on Thursday. “Personally I think the debt limit and the credit markets, the longer the better for the stability of the credit market. That’s my strong opinion.” In a morning press conference, Pelosi could barely mask her satisfaction at the unexpected turn of events. She pushed back on the assertion that postponing the debate by such a short window could imperil economic markets. “Wall Street is Wall Street,” Pelosi said. “Here, the currency of the realm is the vote.” Republicans need Democrats’ votes to pass the budget measures in the Senate. In the House, conservatives, who are typically the first to defend the president’s positions, find themselves at odds with him over pairing aid with debt and spending measures. On Thursday morning, the House Republican study committee condemned the agreement, saying that it “continues the status quo or even worsens the trajectory on spending”. The committee said it would not support the proposal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/10/birling-gap-sussex-toxic-cloud-investigations-continue-pollutionwatch","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T20:30:46Z","webTitle":"What was in the air at Birling Gap?

The incident on the East Sussex coast on 27 August was on much larger scale. Although media reports focused on the beach at Birling Gap, air pollution monitors tell us that the affected area was much bigger. An apparent sharp rise in ozone was detected on Eastbourne sea front at 4:45pm and then about 30 minutes later at Lullington Heath, 8km to the west and 5km inland from Birling Gap – an area of over 40 square km. Around 150 people received hospital treatment but the symptoms were inconsistent with the apparent concentration of ozone detected, suggesting that the gas was not actually ozone or that it was ozone plus something else. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear incident prompted the development of computer systems to track air pollutants. These models simulate releases of theoretical puffs of air and use weather models to trace where the wind takes it. They can also be run backwards to see where air came from. During the previous 24 hours the polluted air had travelled from the middle of the English Channel, came ashore east of Eastbourne then drifted west along the coast before heading out to sea again. The source was somewhere along this path. Traffic and shipping fumes are unlikely to be the cause since they are present all the time and such an incident has never occurred before. Other ideas include leaks from cargo on a ship, from a shipwreck or a from a defective ballast water disinfectant system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/07/juan-martin-del-potro-rafael-nadal-us-open-semi-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T18:14:42Z","webTitle":"Juan Martín del Potro running on empty for US Open semi against Rafael Nadal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/07/juan-martin-del-potro-rafael-nadal-us-open-semi-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/07/juan-martin-del-potro-rafael-nadal-us-open-semi-final","fields":{"headline":"Juan Martín del Potro running on empty for US Open semi against Rafael Nadal","bodyText":"When Juan Martín del Potro won his only major – here as a 20-year-old eight years ago – he had to beat Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer back to back, a feat so awesome the Argentinian was acclaimed as the next star of the sport. It did not quite work out like that. Wrist injuries, the rise of Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka and, lately, a slew of young contenders with long hair and Russian roots, have conspired to make life hell for the amiable giant from Tandil. But he is back: now, faced with beating Federer and Nadal on the spin again, he has completed half the task and one more heroic victory against the Spaniard in the US Open semi‑finals on Friday will haul him back to the place of his greatest triumph in the final on Sunday. Del Potro had “nothing to lose against Federer” in their tense confrontation on Wednesday night, as he said, and, with the freedom to play full tilt after taking medical advice, he played “my best game of the tournament”. Sentiment aside, he has a bigger challenge against Nadal than he faced against either Dominic Thiem – when he came from two sets down to prevail in obvious distress – or Federer, whose back problems might have kicked in during their quarter-final. However much the Swiss might have wondered about his injury, he played fluently enough but not well enough in the key moments. Del Potro, with his readjusted backhand on song again, had the experience and confidence to pounce in those moments. As he pointed out: “I made my best backhands of the tournament in the important moments of the match: set point of the third set and then to break his serve in the fourth.” Federer had earlier correctly identified Del Potro’s backhand as vulnerable and he set about trying to exploit that wing, as he expected the Argentinian to reply with less potent cut and spin, rather than unleashing his full, flat-struck power. Del Potro found enough big bullets to make Federer pay, however. That relative weak spot will be there in the semi-final and this time Del Potro has the added problem of dealing with Nadal’s left-handed forehand, which is lethal on clay and not bad on hard court. “He has the chance to find easily my backhand,” he said. “So I don’t know what’s going to be my strategy for that match. But I will try to make winners with my forehand – and don’t run too much, because my legs are tired. Hopefully I can be ready for Rafa. Physically I’m not in perfect condition but, when you play semi-finals of a grand slam, everything can happen.” Just about everything and anything has happened in this tournament, the most open Open, probably, since the start of the millennium. Rarely can bookmakers, fans, players and commentators have been more non-plussed. The field was already missing four of its top 11 entrants when Andy Murray withdrew at the last minute. The resulting seedings reshuffle, drawing on rarely used grand slam rules, left Federer and Nadal in the same half of the draw, despite the fact they were the two best players, and thus pitched them towards a first-ever match at these championships in the semi-finals. Del Potro ruined all that when he “killed Bambi” and, for all that Federer was gracious in defeat, he knew that in one evening he had wasted the effort that had gone before. History was there for the taking and making. Naturally he was aware that the public wanted him to play Nadal, although he said that prospect did not occupy his thoughts before or during his struggle with Del Potro. But Federer plainly was hurting when reminded of the lost opportunity. “It is a pity but Juan Martín deserves it more.” The hunger for a Federer-Nadal showdown was intense all through this tournament. The old champions had, after all, won all the 2017 slam titles, Federer prevailing over the Spaniard in Melbourne, skipping Roland Garros to rest his bones, then returning to triumph again at Wimbledon. Nadal, meanwhile, rolled on to la décima, his 10th French Open title capping a glorious clay swing. Nadal, however, has slipped a little since Paris. And the unknown component in the semi-final is how much energy he can bring to the match after another lights-out campaign here. The odds, such as they can be relied on any more, are that he will bring Del Potro’s rousing run to a halt, maybe in four sets. The tournament needs another finalist, of course, but the noise created on the more gilded side of the draw has drowned out the efforts of those who have been serially derided as third-rate contenders: Sam Querrey, Kevin Anderson, Pablo Carreño Busta and Diego Schwartzman. Those are names that might light up an ATP 500 tournament. But credit to Anderson and Carreño Busta, who have done all that has been asked of them and more. The Spaniard, seeded 12, has not dropped a set in five matches and allowed Schwartzman only 10 games in their quarter-final. Anderson, who put Murray out here in four sets in the fourth round last year, is invariably under-regarded in majors, dismissed as a serving behemoth, but he brought more than that to his four-set win over Querrey, crucially in the deciding tie-break. He showed a lot of control under pressure when it mattered. Carreño Busta will start favourite, as his game has a few more wrinkles, but the South African sounds up for it. “It’s a fantastic feeling,” he said of his win over Querrey, “but I’m going to have another opportunity to go one step further.” He said of his opponent [whom he beat in straight sets in Montreal]: “He’s had an amazing year, really consistent results. At the French, getting through to the quarters and now through to the semis here.” None of which will count a whit when he is lining up one of those huge forehand winners. At his 34th attempt Anderson is the first South African grand slam semi-finalist since Wayne Ferreira in Melbourne in 2003. Cliff Drysdale in 1965 was the last of his compatriots to reach a decider at these championships. That is a lot of history. This tournament has been dripping in it. There is surely more to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/sep/08/the-city-watchdog-must-backtrack-over-aramco","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T06:22:31Z","webTitle":"FCA must backtrack over Saudi oil giant Aramco | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/sep/08/the-city-watchdog-must-backtrack-over-aramco","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/sep/08/the-city-watchdog-must-backtrack-over-aramco","fields":{"headline":"FCA must backtrack over Saudi oil giant Aramco","bodyText":"Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, is usually good at reading the breezes. He is the safe-hands operator whom the former chancellor George Osborne switched from the Bank of England to inject some much-needed credibility into FCA after its various calamities. For most part, the FCA under Bailey has performed as intended. Muscular common sense and a sound grasp of markets, which are all that’s really required of a financial regulator, have returned. But if Bailey wants to keep this better image for the FCA he will have to find a way to abandon the proposal to rewrite the listing rules to make it easier for Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company, Aramco, to float in London. The investment community hates the idea and the heat on the FCA will intensify now that the chairs of the Treasury and business select committees are asking pointed questions about ministerial interference. Naturally, the FCA doesn’t describe its idea as a sop to the Saudis. In its view, its work is all about updating the rules and keeping London competitive. Aramco isn’t even mentioned in the paper. It’s just that almost nobody else sees this as a bland technical exercise. Furious fund managers sense a bad case of a regulator planning to lower standards to suit ministers’ short-term desire to persuade Aramco to float in London rather than New York. The investors’ objection is straightforward: why on earth would we want to create a “premium” listing category for state-owned companies while not enforcing normal investor protections? Under the FCA’s proposal, the likes of Aramco would be allowed to ignore some basic principles. They would not have to get approval from outside shareholders for transactions with the state. They would not have to give independent shareholders a vote on who should serve as independent directors. There clearly could be a place for such companies in London, but you would hardly award “premium” status, a label that is meant to indicate the highest governance protections. The regulatory regime would look like a pushover, which may succeed in drumming up some short-term business but could seriously damage London’s status as a good place to invest. Bailey and the FCA should read the mood. Resistance to the proposal is deep and wide, and rightly so. There is room to backtrack since only a consultation paper has been issued so far. The sooner the U-turn happens, the better. What goes up must come down … surely? When the government in February lowered the Ogden rate – a discount formula used to calculate compensation payments for victims of serious injuries – from 2.5% to minus 0.75%, the chief executive of one large insurance company called the decision the worst piece of policymaking he had seen in his career. He was not a disinterested observer since the rejig threatened to cost insurers (and also the NHS, which is exposed to claims for medical errors) a lot of money in the form of substantially higher payouts to victims who need lifetime support. But he had a point. A negative Ogden rate implied recipients could expect to receive negative returns on their lump sums. Even in a low-interest world, that defied common sense. The culprit, explained Liz Truss, the justice secretary at the time, was low long-term gilt yields. Her hands were tied by a long-established formula for setting Ogden. Her successor, David Lidington, thinks his hands are freer. He proposes “a new framework based on how claimants actually invest”. That seems reasonable, especially if, as the government suggests, the new calculation produces a suitably conservative figure between 0% and 1%. The insurance companies, when they’ve stopped celebrating, should tell us by how much car insurance premiums will fall. They screamed blue murder in February and used Ogden to justify rises in premiums, especially for young drivers. Cuts in premiums must now be seen to arrive. Two choices – one bad luck, one duff It is sweet and commendable of the fund manager Neil Woodford to apologise to his followers for his miserable investment performance of late. Most of his breed would sit in a bunker. Hiding would be tricky in Woodford’s case, of course. Not only is he the most famous (rightly so) retail fund manager in the land, but he has also been at the scene of too many stock market accidents recently, notably FTSE 100 firms AstraZeneca and Provident Financial. That does require an explanation. It’s just that Woodford’s is odd. While conceding that heavy falls at both companies – two of his largest exposures – “have not helped,” he delivered a sermon about how the stock market is currently obsessed by stocks with exposure to China. That’s an interesting theme (as is the statistic that just eight big stocks account for half the gains in the FTSE all share index this year) but his UK focus hardly explains the rotten run. Everybody knew AstraZeneca’s shares were bound to move 10% or more, up or down, depending on the result of the Mystic lung cancer trial. As for Provident Financial, surely nobody expects a quiet life from a doorstep lender making high-interest loans. Call it one piece of bad luck and one duff, or over-aggressive, stock pick. It happens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/07/vanity-fair-editor-graydon-carter-to-step-down-after-25-years","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T18:00:35Z","webTitle":"Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter to step down after 25 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/07/vanity-fair-editor-graydon-carter-to-step-down-after-25-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/07/vanity-fair-editor-graydon-carter-to-step-down-after-25-years","fields":{"headline":"Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter to step down after 25 years","bodyText":"Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter announced on Thursday that he will step down from the role after 25 years in which his magazine made Hollywood parties great again, alternately fascinated and alienated celebrities, politicians and business titans, and even got a few news scoops. At 68, Carter said it was “simply time” for him to move on and enjoy some time off before deciding on a “third act”. He had planned to leave a little earlier, he told Vanity Fair in an interview published online, but he wanted to witness the spectacle of Donald Trump’s presidency. Carter has for years had a gleefully hostile relationship with Trump, ever since he attacked the then swaggering New York property tycoon as a “short-fingered vulgarian” in Spy, a magazine Carter co-founded in 1986, prior to ascending to Vanity Fair in 1992 as successor to Tina Brown. In June this year, he excoriated Trump in a widely-read editorial. Perhaps Carter’s most obvious flourishes were the A-list parties he created and hosted each year in Los Angeles after the Oscars, and the magazine’s complementary annual Hollywood issue with a fold-out portfolio of stars lavishly photographed by Annie Leibovitz, whom Carter turned helped turn into a legend. But the magazine also honed its reputation with serious business and crime investigations, impeccably reported news analysis and a who’s who of upcoming business hotshots, moguls, and upstarts from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, which it called the New Establishment. Carter is regarded as a jewel of the American media establishment – despite being Canadian. He moved to New York in his late 20s, made a splash with Spy, then acquired serious gravitas at Condé Nast, the corporate owner of Vanity Fair, the New Yorker and other marquee titles. He enjoyed a reputation as something between dandy and colonial ambassador, attending to business in pale, double-breasted bespoke suits under a swooping hairstyle, and combined anglophile and francophile elegance with the exuberance needed to survive, let alone flourish, at the top of the media scene in Manhattan. Despite regular protestations that he preferred a quiet night in, he also came to own a restaurant in the city. Vanity Fair under Carter was feisty and influential, spotting trends such as Cool Britannia, which it enshrined with a famous 1997 cover featuring Patsy Kensit and Liam Gallagher. Other famous covers included a picture – shot this year by Leibovitz – of a naked and pregnant Serena Williams. Carter also pushed for scoops. In 2003, he set out strong views against the looming war in Iraq in an editorial highly critical of George W Bush, then published an explosive report revealing that wealthy Saudi Arabians, including members of the Bin Laden family, were whisked out of the US on private jets days after the 9/11 attacks. In 2005 the magazine revealed the identity of Deep Throat, the government insider who helped Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncover the Watergate scandal and precipitate the downfall of Richard Nixon. More recently, Vanity Fair persuaded Monica Lewinsky to talk about her affair with Bill Clinton and made a huge splash with a cover shoot revealing to the world Caitlyn Jenner, the transgender woman formerly known as Olympic gold medalist Bruce. Carter said on Thursday that he would take a six-month holiday in the south of France before returning to the US for his next move – about which he stayed tight-lipped."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/sep/15/authentic-tourist-app-instagram-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"Want a more 'authentic' tourist experience?

There's an app for that","bodyText":"No one wants to be a tourist – not even tourists. It has connotations of uncritical consumption, of high prices and low quality, of being mindlessly funnelled amid a mass of humanity towards the sorts of joints that real New Yorkers or Londoners or Parisians wouldn’t be caught dead in. The success of any experience of an unfamiliar city is measured by how much it overlaps with a local’s, and that’s never been truer than now. As cheap flights flood Europe with visitors, measures against tourists’ obstructive, destructive impact have been taken in Venice, Barcelona, Rome and most recently Amsterdam. There’s never been a more desirable time to pass for a resident. But how do you know where the locals go – especially when they may prefer not to tell you? By mining their publicly available data, of course. Computer scientists at ITMO University in St Petersburg say they have developed a way of using Instagram to “create a ‘locals’ guide’ ... that is as genuine as it gets”. They analyse residents’ posts on the photo-sharing app to identify the city’s hidden gems, then share them with tourists. They have developed an algorithm that aims to distinguish between photos publicly posted by locals and those posted by visitors, and using the geotagging information to locate them both on a map. The result reveals at a glance the different haunts favoured by each group, “thus helping the locals to indirectly advise tourists”. Alexander Visheratin, head of research at ITMO University’s eScience Institute, said tourist guidebooks typically recommended 10 to 15 attractions in any one city. “However, locals usually know more. By identifying their favourite places, we can significantly diversify such guidebooks.” While tourists will no doubt be delighted to bypass the holiday rite of passage that is buying just enough at Starbucks or McDonald’s to justify using the wifi to Google “best cafe St Petersburg”, the benefits of this advance for locals are less clear. Ksenia Mukhina, the lead author of the paper, told Guardian Cities the act of including location data on a public Instagram post intended to make a place “visible and recogniseable”. “This is one of the reasons why people actually share their pictures in social media.” To weed out the tourist photos, the researchers only analysed photographs posted last year in February and November – the months with the least tourist activity in St Petersburg – and omitted those posted within a probable holiday period or tagged at any of the 15 most popular tourist sites. The final dataset consisted of roughly 530,000 posts with geolocation tags in 17,921 places, and 23,596 users classified as St Petersburg locals. Their posts were then divvied up into five categories: theatres and museums, restaurants and bars, “interesting city locations” (such as bridges and streets), parks and “other”. What of the results? The Ice Palace, an ice hockey arena and concert venue, was found to be more popular with St Petersburg residents on Instagram than the historic Mariinsky Theatre, where some of Tchaikovsky’s masterpieces premiered. The algorithm also threw up the Alexander Column at the Palace Square, the Fontanka river embankment, Schastye bar and restaurant on Rubinstein St, and Mickey &amp; Monkeys cafe as residents’ favoured haunts. The researchers said their findings, presented at the International Conference on Computational Science and published in the peer-reviewed journal Procedia Computer Science, could have significant benefits for tourists: a “method for revealing new potential attraction points for tourists in a large city”. Mukhina argued that one could be an improvement in relations between tourists and visitors. Her research had shown that tourists typically gathered around one main street – drawing their attention to spots popular with locals could redistribute them more evenly, easing crowds in the city centre. “The increasing popularity of non-tourist districts will inspire the city administration to develop the urban infrastructure more actively and will spark business development in those areas – so redistribution of tourists will allow developing the city evenly, as opposed to focusing on two or three main streets in the city centre. “Besides, reducing the density of tourists will result in a more tolerant attitude towards this group from the locals, as the city visitors will have less impact on the traffic, for example.” Mukhina and her fellow researchers said the algorithm could be improved in future by taking into account engagement, such as favourites or comments, as an indication of interest in a photo. They eventually hoped to use it to inform a recommendation service that would update in real time. Whether this would have significant impact on locals’ experiences in St Petersburg, of course, would depend on how well its findings were publicised. After all, tourists’ activity is not just propelled by a quest for authenticity: marketing budgets play a role, too. But St Petersburg residents concerned about unknowingly sharing their quiet coffee corner with out-of-towners may like to consider making their Instagram profiles private – just in case.

Donald Trump Jr made the comment in an opening statement delivered on Thursday to staff of the Senate judiciary committee, who were interviewing him privately as part of investigations into links between Trump aides and Russia. Trump Jr and the committee negotiated the meeting. Senators were allowed to sit in but not ask questions. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, attended part of the interview and said it was “cordial”. He would not discuss details but said there were “a lot of areas that need to be pursued for more information”. Trump mostly spoke for himself, Blumenthal said, instead of his lawyers speaking for him. The statement focused on the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower involving Trump Jr, then Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, the lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others including other Russians. The meeting is also of interest to special counsel Robert Mueller. The appearance before the Senate staffers was the first known instance of Trump Jr giving his version of the meeting in a setting that could expose him to legal jeopardy. It is a crime to lie to Congress. Trump Jr said he only remembered seven people attending the meeting. Eight have been publicly reported. The seven Trump Jr identified were himself, British music publicist Rob Goldstone, Manafort, Kushner, Veselnitskaya, a translator and Irakli Kaveladze, who worked for the Agalarov family, which has done business with the Trump Organization. Trump Jr did not mention Russian American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet counterintelligence officer who has said he attended the meeting at Veselnitskaya’s invitation and who has testified about his recollection of it before a Washington grand jury used by Mueller. Trump Jr has faced scrutiny since the first report of the meeting, which happened in June 2016. An email exchange released by Trump Jr revealed his eagerness to receive the information. “I love it,” he wrote to Goldstone, who brokered the meeting. Goldstone told Trump Jr “the crown prosecutor of Russia” had offered “to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father”. Trump Jr later insisted that the meeting had turned out to be “a nothing”. In his statement on Thursday, he said he was skeptical but had thought he “should listen to what Rob and his colleagues had to say”. “To the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,” Trump Jr said. Seeking to explain his “I love it” remark, Trump Jr said it was “simply a colloquial way of saying that I appreciated Rob’s gesture”. Trump Jr said he knew Goldstone through the family of Aras Agalarov, the Trump Organization’s partner on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. Trump Jr said he did not attend the pageant, noting that he has not traveled to Russia since 2011. He met Goldstone, he said, when Agalarov’s pop singer son, Emin, performed at a March 2014 golf tournament at a Trump course in Doral, Florida. Trump Jr said that Goldstone would “intermittently” contact him to offer congratulations or support. When he received the email that led to the Russian meeting, Trump Jr said, he had not heard from Goldstone in “quite some time”. In addition to detailing the timing of phone calls and emails leading up to the meeting, Trump Jr provided explanations of why he said he could not be sure about parts of his recollection. He said Goldstone did not give him a list of who would attend. Trump Tower security also has no record, Trump Jr said, because Goldstone was able to bring the “entire group up” by only giving his name to a guard in the lobby. “There is no attendance log to refer back to and I did not take notes,” Trump Jr said. Trump Jr agreed to the interview after the judiciary committee chairman, Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa, threatened to subpoena him. Manafort and Kushner spoke to investigators on Capitol Hill in July. In a statement at the time, Kushner echoed Trump Jr’s denial, saying: “I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government.” Grassley said in July that Trump Jr and Manafort would be questioned by senators in a public hearing, though he declined to say in recent days whether that would still happen. Trump Jr is also expected to appear before the Senate intelligence committee. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on that panel, said the senators want to speak with others who attended the meeting before interviewing Trump Jr. “We want to do this in a thorough way that gets the most information possible,” Warner said. In a statement after the hearing, Trump Jr said he “answered every question posed by the committee ... until both sides had exhausted their lines of questioning. I trust this interview fully satisfied their inquiry”. The New York Times was first to report Trump Jr’s statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/07/canal-calm-has-to-be-better-than-road-rage","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T17:38:56Z","webTitle":"Canal calm has to be better than road rage | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/07/canal-calm-has-to-be-better-than-road-rage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/07/canal-calm-has-to-be-better-than-road-rage","fields":{"headline":"Canal calm has to be better than road rage","bodyText":"Hurricane Irma has devastated many Caribbean islands (Report, 6 September).

The day after he lost 42 seconds to Vincenzo Nibali, a devastating late break on the road to Santo Toribio de Liébana saw Froome extend his lead over the Italian to 1min 37sec while Sander Armée took the stage 18 victory. “We saw a lot of people expend a lot of energy today, there were attacks on the penultimate climbs from everyone, all the main GC guys,” Froome said. “It was only Fabio Aru who slipped away, he’s not a threat for us, he’s over five or six minutes away on general classification. “Once we got into the last climb our guys set a really high temp at the bottom and I was feeling a lot better today so it was great to gain a little bit of time that I lost. I think certainly some guys paid for their efforts on Wednesday and also for their attacks earlier on today. It’s good to bounce back again and morale is still good and the team still strong. We’re just looking forward to getting though these next couple of days.” Having admitted he had struggled to cope with gradients up to 25% in the difficult climb of Los Machucos the previous day, Froome broke clear of the depleted peloton 600m from the summit finish, with only Alberto Contador and Michael Woods able to stick with him.

The Labour grassroots campaign group, whose online campaigning drew huge audiences for pro-Labour videos and memes during the general election, said the video had been made on a budget of less than £30. Facebook’s advertiser analytics, which use the workplace listed by people on their profiles, showed the video had been viewed by 25,480 McDonald’s workers on Facebook so far. The social media network says it has 98,000 UK profiles where McDonald’s is listed on the profile, though some may be duplicate or parody accounts. McDonald’s official figure for their UK workforce is 97,000 across 1,200 outlets. The video features two McDonald’s workers talking about difficulties managing zero-hours contracts, rotating day and night shifts and irregular breaks, shortly after workers at the restaurant staged their first UK strike. One of the employees said of his zero-hours contract: “I have no choice but to do exactly as I’m told and never question it, otherwise I might lose the hours and then I’d be out on the streets.” The clip has so far been watched by more than 2 million people, appearing on the Facebook timelines and Twitter feeds of more than 5 million people, Momentum says. Analysis of the Facebook shares found half the video’s viewers were under 24. Many commenters described their own experience working in the restaurant, though several said they had not encountered the same problems. Emma Rees, Momentum’s national coordinator, said: “The incredible reach of the video among McDonald’s workers and the stories they have shared in the comments show how widespread unacceptable working conditions are at McDonald’s, but also how powerful social media can be when used to complement traditional workplace organising.” About 40 staff from McDonald’s restaurants in Cambridge and Crayford, south-east London, walked out this week over the multibillion-dollar company’s use of zero-hours contracts and lack of union recognition. The strikers were addressed by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, at a rally in Westminster. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, voiced support for the striking workers at prime ministers’ questions on Wednesday, asking Theresa May to “back the McDonald’s workers’ case for an end to zero-hours contracts and for decent pay”. McDonald’s said those taking action represented 0.01% of its workforce, adding that the dispute was related to its internal grievance procedures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/13/ryanair-lost-passport-removed-from-aircraft","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Held in secure immigration as Ryanair fails to reunite me with ‘lost’ passport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/13/ryanair-lost-passport-removed-from-aircraft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/13/ryanair-lost-passport-removed-from-aircraft","fields":{"headline":"Held in secure immigration as Ryanair fails to reunite me with ‘lost’ passport","bodyText":"The saga of the easyJet passenger who dropped her passport on board a flight was remarkably similar to my experience with Ryanair, only this airline’s handling of it was more troubling. On a flight from Dublin to Mallorca I left my passport on another seat while putting my luggage into an overhead locker. The passenger handed it to a crew member before take-off but, when I asked for it back, I was told it had been removed from the aircraft before take-off. When we landed I was assured the document could be put on the next flight out and I should wait in arrivals. However, Ryanair staff then told me a passport can’t be sent without its owner. I was kept in a secure immigration area for six hours until airport police allowed me to pass through immigration on the condition that I go directly to the UK consulate and obtain emergency documents. On my return to Dublin I found out that Ryanair did not have a passenger manifest on board, so the passport could not be checked against a list of passenger names. Because the doors had been sealed by the time it was discovered, the captain handed it out of his cockpit window to ground staff. I just receive the stock response from Ryanair that they do not take responsibility for lost property. TS, London Ryanair repeats the same stock response to me. “It is each individual passenger’s responsibility to ensure that they carry their belongings with them at all times, and all items found on board are handed to the lost property office at the airport,” it says. The trouble is, Ryanair did take responsibility for your lost property in that it removed it from the plane and put it in the care, apparently, of a random member of ground staff. If it hadn’t, you would have been reunited with it within minutes. And the document never reached lost property. Ryanair confirms that lists of passenger names are kept by ground staff and only a record of the numbers travelling are taken on board flights. EU rules state that documentation such as passenger manifests which may be required by the countries an aircraft is flying between should be carried on board, and the Civil Aviation Authority, which regulated flights to and from the UK, says it would expect full lists to accompany all flights. Airlines are free to follow their own procedures but, whereas easyJet – in the parallel case I featured – admitted that cabin crew should hand passports back to the relevant passenger when possible, and awarded them a free holiday as compensation, Ryanair remains intransigent. It’s worrying that, in this age of heightened security, airlines can be so cavalier with identity documents.

On hearing of the planet’s discovery from press reports, 11-year-old Venetia Burney from Oxford proposed the name of the Roman god of the underworld to her grandfather, a librarian at the city’s Bodleian library. He dutifully passed it on to US astronomers where it was approved by Clyde Tombaugh, who had spotted the rocky body. The Burney crater is one of 14 Plutonian features to receive an official name on Thursday from the International Astronomical Union, whose experts have worked for more than a year to approve titles put forward by scientists and members of the public. A distinctive heart-shaped feature revealed in the breathtaking images captured by Nasa’s New Horizons mission in 2015 becomes Tombaugh Regio, while a large plain is named Sputnik Planitia in honour of the first space satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Other features on Pluto, which the IAU has demoted to “dwarf planet” status, pay homage to underworld mythology. Tartarus Dorsa is a ridge named after Tartarus, the deepest, darkest pit of the underworld in Greek mythology; Sleipnir Fossa nods to the powerful eight-legged horse of Norse mythology that carried the god Odin into the underworld; and Virgil Fossae honours the Roman poet who depicted the underworld in his Aeneid and was later represented as Dante’s guide through hell and purgatory in the Divine Comedy. A deep dent in the surface is named Adlivun Cavus after Adlivun, the underworld in Inuit mythology, and Djanggawul Fossae is a network of depressions named after a trio of divine siblings from indigenous Australian mythology. The mountaineers Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay lend their names to the Tenzing Montes and Hillary Montes mountain ranges on Pluto, with another series of peaks, Al-Idrisi Montes, honouring Ash-Sharif al-Idrisi, an Arab mapmaker and geographer. Two large regions on Pluto’s surface are named Hayabusa Terra and Voyager Terra after Japanese and US spacecraft, while a second crater is named after James Elliott, a researcher at MIT who pioneered methods that allowed astronomers to study Pluto’s thin atmosphere and the rings of Uranus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/10/venice-film-festival-2017-murder-mayhem-lido-three-billboards-zama-mother-suburbicon-jim-and-andy","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:32:31Z","webTitle":"Venice film festival 2017: murder and mayhem on the Lido","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/10/venice-film-festival-2017-murder-mayhem-lido-three-billboards-zama-mother-suburbicon-jim-and-andy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/10/venice-film-festival-2017-murder-mayhem-lido-three-billboards-zama-mother-suburbicon-jim-and-andy","fields":{"headline":"Venice film festival 2017: murder and mayhem on the Lido","bodyText":"Every major film festival is an island when you’re caught up in it, the outside world only really manifesting itself as pictures on a screen. The Venice film festival, however, really is an island – it takes place on the Lido, across the water from the main city – and the proceedings feel more cosily enclosed than ever, now that the festival buildings are surrounded by an elegant compound of patios and park. You could sit here sipping your spritzer – or indeed, sheltering from torrential rain – and forgetting that exterior reality existed, because only a few films managed to remind you at all persuasively that it did. On paper, the 74th festival looked set to be the best in years, especially in the wake of a lukewarm Cannes, with many hotly awaited titles and a host of big names on both sides of the camera. In the end, little induced either fury or rapture, and many just elicited that Italian shrug accompanied by a noncommittal “boh…” I arrived too late to catch the film that got consensus raves: Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water, a monster movie-cum-romance starring Sally Hawkins. But for me, there were two standout fiction features. One was Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It’s a very dark comedy thriller set in the southern US, about a woman (Frances McDormand) on a mission to avenge her raped and murdered daughter. As the violence spirals, a film that looks set to expose the darkest side of humanity ends up suggesting that even seemingly irredeemable characters might stand a chance of a third-act reversal. McDormand is leather-tough and tersely funny, there’s superb support from Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, and McDonagh’s script crackles, not just with off-the-peg folksy profanity but with a genuine sense of surprise. The other standout was a film that I suspect won’t really make sense till a second, maybe a third viewing. It’s Zama, the first feature in seven years from Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel (The Headless Woman, La Ciénaga). Its protagonist is a hapless functionary in 18th-century Paraguay, and while not much happens (star Daniel Giménez Cacho largely wanders around, perplexed, under a three-cornered hat), when it finally does, it’s violently unsettling. This hallucinatory work vaguely suggests a stoned, swampy relative of 1970s Werner Herzog, but invents its own cinematic language. So arguably does Mother!, the festival’s one genuine controversy. The latest from Darren Aronofsky, it starts off as a sort of The Old Dark House home invasion movie, with Jennifer Lawrence as a woman married to a blocked writer (Javier Bardem) whose life is turned upside when a troublesome couple (Ed Harris, a super-sinister Michelle Pfeiffer) pay a visit. Then more people visit, and soon the film has become an apocalyptic free-for-all that’s possibly an allegory for… well, we’re invited to decide for ourselves. By the end, Mother! feels like a loud, drunken dinner-party argument between Buñuel, Polanski, Fellini and Eugène Ionesco. It also rather resembles Lars von Trier, except that Aronofsky doesn’t have one jot of Von Trier’s impish humour. I found it cosmically idiotic, although some critics hailed it; still, you won’t see a Hollywood film this outre in a hurry. Most other offerings were easier to pigeonhole. Racer and the Jailbird (directed by Michaël R Roskam) was a glossily enjoyable thriller romance about a racing driver (Adèle Exarchopoulos) and her robber fiance (Matthias Schoenaerts), fuelled by genre energies and the leads’ not inconsiderable chemistry. Stephen Frears offered a business-as-usual variant on the heritage pic in Victoria &amp; Abdul, with Judi Dench dusting off her Queen Victoria performance in the story of the queen and her beloved Indian Muslim attendant (a personable Ali Fazal). Scripted by Lee Hall, it tries for a satire of colonial attitudes but never escapes from the Fabergé chocolate box. A better, more down-to-earth British production was Andrew Haigh’s Lean on Pete, which follows a teenage boy in crisis as he finds hope in his attachment to the racehorse of the title. Steve Buscemi and Chloë Sevigny give characterful support, up-and-comer Charlie Plummer is an engagingly candid lead, and Haigh’s picture of back-road America feels involvingly authentic. But, fine though the film is, it could almost have been made by any of a handful of US indie auteurs, and it’s a shame that Haigh – whose Weekend and 45 Years so brilliantly cast new light on intimate corners of British life – should have taken such a well-beaten transatlantic track. Among the major disappointments was George Clooney’s Suburbicon, part-written by the Coen brothers. Set in a squeaky-clean 1950s community, it’s about a boy who realises that his family members (Matt Damon, Julianne Moore) aren’t the paragons they seem; meanwhile, their black neighbours face racist hostility. It’s as if Clooney had gussied up a standard Coens murder story with additional contemporary relevance, and the facetious result is offensively superficial. Meanwhile, one US film that gave you faith in some survival of American sanity was Ex Libris, veteran Frederick Wiseman’s exhaustive documentary about the New York Public Library. Characteristically, he stands back without comment and simply shows how the institution works, through glimpses of careers fairs, slam poetry recitals, Braille training sessions and talks from Patti Smith, Richard Dawkins and Elvis Costello. We also get several board meetings, reminding us that culture and literacy have to be perpetually fought for, and financed. Though perhaps not one of Wiseman’s very best, it’s nevertheless a revealing study. Also taking his time to expand on a theme, Abdellatif Kechiche – who made controversial Cannes winner Blue Is the Warmest Colour – returned with Mektoub, My Love: Canto Uno, a three–hour drama (with, presumably, more to come) about a shy young north African man spending the summer in the French Mediterranean town of Sète, which seems to be populated almost entirely by beautiful young women in cut-off shorts and the men who hit on them. The film is a hymn to sun, sex, hedonism, loud conversation and women’s bottoms; it’s ferociously energetic, but one-dimensional, and if you think Kechiche showed lecherous tendencies in Blue, he abandons all shame here. Also wildly self-indulgent was The Private Life of a Modern Woman, a would-be Dostoevskian chamber piece by US director James Toback, in which Sienna Miller kills her boyfriend, then receives visits from a variety of loquacious types, including Toback himself, dropping in to discuss the meaning of life; even old Fyodor would have told Toback to lighten up. And Woodshock, by fashion designers the Mulleavy sisters, was a druggy reverie starring Kirsten Dunst, so oblique that critics huddled outside afterwards to try and pin down the basic plot points. But no self-indulgence quite beat the excesses of Jim Carrey, as seen in Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond, about the star’s performance as comic Andy Kaufman in 1999 biopic Man on the Moon. Chris Smith’s fascinating documentary is based on footage of Carrey on set, permanently in character either as Kaufman or his monstrous creation, slobbish crooner Tony Clifton. Interviewed today, a wild-eyed, wildly earnest Carrey muses on Kaufman’s conceptual weirdness and his own career, and wonders whether the role might have caused him some psychic damage. As an essay partly on the perils of going beyond method, partly on the worst extremes of movie-star ego, Jim &amp; Andy is the most hair-raising horror movie of the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/07/systemic-problem-with-special-needs-provision","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T17:39:41Z","webTitle":"Systemic problem with special needs provision | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/07/systemic-problem-with-special-needs-provision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/07/systemic-problem-with-special-needs-provision","fields":{"headline":"Systemic problem with special needs provision","bodyText":"John Harris is absolutely right to state that the implementation of special needs reforms and the introduction of education health care plans, and the ensuing lack of proper support for children with SEN, is “a big story” (Education, 5 September). It is, sadly, a story that has managed, somehow, not to receive the coverage it deserves. My experience of local authorities in the EHCP process is that the child is left unsupported and parents worn down by a constant failure to listen to their very real fears and concerns for their children. My own daughter has complex medical needs that result in her often missing school; she was refused an assessment. I fought her case, took it to tribunal and won. The judge said the local authority’s opposition to my appeal was “incomprehensible”. My daughter was fortunate that before I became her full-time carer I was a barrister and therefore competent to fight for her. In the year and a half since her tribunal, I have supported other families and have seen them coping with huge levels of stress and their children denied assessments to which they were so clearly entitled. One child had been repeatedly denied support, excluded from school, her mental health needs so severe that she became suicidal and required an emergency admission to a psychiatric hospital. We have just, finally, managed to secure an EHCP for her, and an appropriate residential placement, but only after rejection piled upon rejection. Another child, a triplet with multiple medical needs, including the need to be fed by gastrostomy, was denied assessment because the LA would not accept that her medical needs had a significant impact on her ability to learn. This is a systemic problem; these are not isolated cases. There are many more cases, too, where parents do not have the confidence or tenacity to continue to push and push again when met only with refusal and resistance. LA decisions are clearly funding-driven and children are suffering.

And check out The Guardian for continuing coverage of the the last tennis Grand Slam tournament of the season. Second set: Keys 6-1, 6-2 Vandeweghe An all-American semi-final leads to an all-American final: Madison Keys vs. Sloane Stephens. Keys won tonight in dominating fashion, taking the match in just 66 minutes -- and that was including a seven-minute break for injury attention. Keys put an exclamation point on her win with an ace, and then threw her hands to the sky. It’s her third win over Vandeweghe in the last month. More impressive, it’s her first Grand Slam final of her career. Keys will definitely have a great shot if she plays like she did tonight in the final. But Stephens is a lot more mobile on the court than Vandeweghe, and will be able to get to some of the shots Keys’ opponent tonight could not. Second set: *Keys 6-1, 5-2 Vandeweghe (*denotes next server) Vandeweghe stays alive with maybe her best game of the night, mixing finesse shots and power to take the game in short order. Keys will now serve for the match. Second set: Keys 6-1, 5-1 Vandeweghe* (*denotes next server) Well, so much for the change in momentum. Keys is moving just fine with the hamstring wrap and is now just one game away from the US Open Final. Keys is back out on the court now. She has her right hamstring taped up. We’ll see if her choosing to take a break for seven minutes changes the momentum of a match in which she is up 6-1, 4-1. Despite playing perhaps the best tennis of her career, Madison Keys has head inside for a medical timeout. Second set: *Keys 6-1, 4-1 Vandeweghe (*denotes next server) It will be very hard for Vandeweghe to come back now. Keys breaks her again and is now just two games away from moving on in two sets. Keys wins the game with a laser inside the left sideline and then yells to the sky. She’s close to her first Grand Slam final. Second set: Keys 6-1, 3-1 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server) Vandeweghe put up her best fight in a return of serve on the night, twice getting the game to deuce. But Mays put it away with an ace. Vandeweghe looks increasingly upset, and yelled in the direction of her box between games. Second set: *Keys 6-1, 2-1 Vandeweghe (*denotes server) Vandeweghe has now had her serve broken three times in the match and held it only twice. Keys continues to overpower her with returns hitting 85 mph. There hasn’t been a lot of beautiful tennis so far tonight. Mostly quick points, but the last point of the game had a long rally that ended with Vandeweghe hitting the ball short into the net. Second set: Keys 6-1, 1-1 Vandeweghe* (*denotes server) Keys continues to dominate on serve, evening the second set on four quick points. Vandeweghe hasn’t been all that close to breaking her even once so far tonight. Second set: *Keys 6-1, 0-1 Vandeweghe (*denotes next server) Vandeweghe opened the start of the second set down 0-30 and looked in some serious trouble -- not just in the game, but in the whole match -- but battle back to take the game, aided by some errant returns by Keys. First set: Keys 6-1 Vandeweghe After dropping her first game of the night, Keys opened up this game 40-0. But then Vandeweghe pushed her to four set points before Keys prevailed. She has only dropped three points on her serve so far tonight through one set. The first set is in the books in just 23 minutes. First set: *Keys 5-1 Vandeweghe (*denotes next server) After a brief break, Vandeweghe came out an won the first point of the game and then lost the second on a lucky bounce for Mays off the net. The pair battled to deuce twice before Vandeweghe took her first game of the night on back-to-back errors by Keys. First set: Keys 5-0 Vandeweghe* (denotes next server) And another one. Vandeweghe did win a point in that game, but then Keys put it away by ripping an ace. We’re now at 5-0 13 minutes into the match/mismatch. First set: *Keys 4-0 Vandeweghe (*denotes next server) This set is all but over. Another dominating game by Keys. We’re not even getting much volleying. Just one or two shots and done. Eleven minutes in and she is up 4-0. First set: Keys 3-0 Vandeweghe* (*denotes next server) Another very quick game to Keys. Just ripping the ball and placing it wherever she wants. Keys has won 12 points so far tonight to just two for Vandeweghe. First set: *Keys 2-0 Vandeweghe (*denotes next server) Obviously not the start Vandeweghe wanted, losing two quick games to fall down 2-0. Facing a break at 40-30, Keys hit the ball into the net. The crowd is very quiet so far. First set: Keys 1-0 Vandeweghe* (*denotes next server) Keys makes quick work in the first game, going up 40-0 and then ripping a nice forehand down the left baseline on Vandeweghe’s return of serve to close out the game. Here we go. The second semifinal is underway with Keys serving at 9:59 p.m. ET. We’ll be providing game-by-game updates. Vandeweghe and Keys are making their way out to the court to begin warming up. Keys and Vandeweghe are meeting for the third time in the last month. Keys took down Vandeweghe 7-6, 6-4 in the Stanford in early August. And then, a few weeks later, beat Vandeweghe again in Cincinnati, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. But Vandeweghe obviously enters the match with a lot of confidence, having knocked off No. 1 seed Karolina Pliskova, 7-6, 6-3, in the Quarter-final. Hello and welcome to the liveblog for tonight’s second US Open women’s semi-final between Coco Vandeweghe and Madison Keys. The winner will face Sloane Stephens in the final. Stephens just fought off Venus Williams in three sets to reach her first US Open final. The winner of Vandeweghe-Keys will also be in a Grand Slam final for the first time. The post-match festivities with Stephens are finishing up. We’ll be underway with Vandeweghe and Keys soon. DJ will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how Roger Federer got on last night: Riding an implausible wave of retro romance, Roger Federer, 36 and in sight of his third slam title of the year, foundered on the sharp rocks of hubris on day 10 of the US Open when Juan Martín del Potro ripped up his invitation to a semi-final against Rafael Nadal. Instead, the big man from Tandil will be Nadal’s opponent on Friday. The world No1 leads him 8-5 over their careers, but only a brave bookmaker would make either of them a clear favourite. Earlier, Nadal, a two-time New York champion, was at his commanding best in dismissing the limp but fevered challenge of the Russian teenager, Andrey Rublev, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2. That, though, was not a reliable guide to what awaits the Spanish clay-court supremo on Friday.

Needless to say, I was unable to convince the Polish lady behind the counter that I was merely looking for a canine companion for my elderly aunt, and did not in fact regard labradoodle puppies as a “superfood”. But it was worse for Kim himself, who once ended up accidentally and uncomfortably appearing in my place on a December 2006 edition of Eight Out of 10 Cats alongside Sean Lock, Jason Manford, Liza Tarbuck and Nightcrawler from The X-Men. A comment Kim made about the production company, Endemol, was described during the recording by host Jimmy Carr as the single joke “least likely to make the final edit of the show in the programme’s history”. Needless to say, due to Kim’s poor performance I was not asked back. Fans of unusual celebrity-dictator friendships with long memories will recall the physical comedian Norman Wisdom’s odd 1950s relationship with the totalitarian Albanian leader Enver Hoxha. In between mass executions of dissidents and incarcerations of anti-communists, Hoxha even found time, in 1951, to accompany Wisdom and his family on a week’s holiday to the Isle of Wight amusement park Blackgang Chine. Beside the English Channel, the curious pair cavorted between the open legs of a giant fibreglass smuggler and frolicked in a fairy glade, all the while crying out “Mr Grimsdale! Mr Grimsdale!!” and “Have you, Albanian peasant brothers, ever sought the reason for the poverty, misery, hunger and gloom which have been your lot for centuries?“ In a modern echo of Hoxha-Wisdom, the American basketball player Dennis Rodman sees himself as the unofficial peacebroker between the US and North Korea. Having befriended Kim in 2013, and with whom he claims to go horse-riding, ski, sing karaoke and generally hang out, Rodman claims, “I just want to try to straighten things out for everyone to get along together.” Since Kim took power in North Korea in 2011, the stress of the top job has relieved his friendly round face of much of its puppy fat, whereas I have slid into a porcine middle-aged spread of repellent aspect, meaning Kim and I are now rarely confused with each other. That said, when one of my critically acclaimed standup specials from 2005 aired on Netflix in the US last year, I did notice a tweet from Dennis Rodman which read, “Yo! My bro Kim Jong-un on TV right now slaying the Scotch people at the Glasgow Stand! Tell it like it is! Braveheart was a fag!!” At the risk of sounding arrogant, I do feel the many occasions upon which I am still addressed as chairman of the workers’ party of Korea, chairman of the central military commission, chairman of the state affairs commission, supreme commander of the Korean people’s army, and presidium member of the politburo standing committee of the workers’ party of Korea by shocked North Korean expats have given me some insight into the dictator’s mindset. Needless to say, Trump’s approach to dealing with Kim Jong-un is entirely the wrong-un. I understand Kim, certainly more than Donald Trump, and perhaps even more than his hoop-bothering friend Dennis Rodman, who has all scribbles all on him. I am the most consistently critically acclaimed male British standup comedian of the century, while Kim is the most dictatorial dictator in the world today, and let me tell you, like little Kim, I know that it is lonely at the top. I wonder if, like Kim, many of my life’s achievements (winning six Chortle awards and an edition of Celebrity Mastermind in my case, developing a nuclear arsenal in his) are simply attempts to gain the attention of an absent father figure. Instead of rattling his atomic sabre, and sticking his flaccid orange penis into the heart of the wasp’s nest of south-east Asian geopolitics, Trump could choose to be that father. What Kim needs is love from a big daddy, and Trump could be that big daddy, bear-hugging and play-wrestling us out of the impending apocalypse. Donald Trump sees the world as a set of business deals. Business is not moral. It is about results. Trump is alleged to have done alleged financial or publicity deals with people allegedly worse than Kim – dodgy Russian oligarchs, Italian-American mafia families, and Michael Gove. All Kim wants is Trump’s attention, so why can’t Trump, in the interest of global security, simply invite Kim to the US for the holiday of a lifetime? Kim and Trump in Long Beach, Washington, marvelling at the world’s largest chopsticks, laughing as they act out the futile attempts of normal-sized men to use them; Kim and Trump in Topeka, Kansas, at the Evel Knievel museum, bonding as they hold hands in silent humble admiration; Kim and Trump in San Luis Obispo, California, comparing notes at the Madonna Inn’s famous waterfall urinal, laughing as their twin torrents cross streams, Ghostbusters-style, in the soft subterranean lighting. You cannot make nuclear threats against a man whom you have urinated alongside in the beautiful waterfall urinal of the Madonna Inn, San Luis Obispo, California. My friend the comedian and failed recluse Roger Mann recently befriended a goat near his Pyrenean hermitage in an experimental attempt to understand the nature of relationships. Were Trump to engage paternally with Kim, he himself may learn something, something that might cure the emptiness inside him that threatens to suck all human history into it like a black hole made of nameless need. For Trump, like Kim, is also lonely. You can own New York, but you can’t make it love you; you can execute hundreds of North Koreans, but you can’t make North Korea love you. To be feared is not the same as to be respected. A father whose children obey him only through fear is a failed father. When we think of fathers they paint Airfix with us, and wrestle in the summer meadow of memory. They do not threaten us with warheads. Kim Jong-un pleads to be disciplined. Donald Trump is desperate for love. If diplomatic channels could be opened to enable the gaping maws of these two desperate needs to meet, they would engulf each other with a flood of unrequited love, and we would all sleep easy again.

This month, we are taking a slightly different approach: we want to focus on an issue that we need to talk about, but which many people find difficult to discuss. We hope you’ll get involved. Lots of you have been in touch to lend your support to our expanded environmental coverage, and to tell us about the steps you have personally been making to reduce your carbon footprint and to help and encourage others to do the same. But if you have spent any time reading the comments below articles on theguardian.com about efforts to slow climate change, you might be familiar with a particular argument. That much as you might get on your bike, recycle, or reduce your meat intake, until we start talking sensibly about rising population and its effects, we are never going to effect real change. And that is what our next members’ podcast will focus on: the impact of population on climate change, whether we need to take action, and if so, what form that action should take. As usual, I’ll be bringing together a panel of Guardian journalists and experts to discuss the issue, but we will be relying on Guardian supporters to set the agenda for the discussion, and provide the questions for our panel to address. These might be difficult questions – but we welcome them nonetheless. When, this summer, the Guardian published an article headlined Want to fight climate change? Have fewer children, the response from readers was fascinating. Not least because of the assumption of some that, while overpopulation was an issue, the solution lay with developing countries (ie: not them). Other commenters, however, were quick to point out the much larger carbon footprints of those born in the US, Europe and Australia, for example (ie: the solution lies with all of us). I was particularly struck by the question one commenter asked another: “Why, if you live in a developed country, is it reasonable to have two children? Why should you have any?” I’d love to hear your thoughts and questions and personal experience around these issues. If you are a parent, was the potential impact on the environment something you considered before having children? If you are thinking of adding to your family now, has it featured in your thinking? Do you think it is reasonable or sensible to assume that people should factor the issue of climate change in to their decisions around children – or should we presume that we are too inherently selfish to ever really take it on board? If you had your family some time ago, do you think you would have made different choices now? I’d also be very pleased to hear from young people about their views on an ageing society and living in a changing world, and of course those with thoughts, questions and knowledge of what the world would look like if people did have fewer children. What would the impact be, beyond climate change? Please send your questions and contributions to us at weneedtotalkabout@theguardian.com by Friday 15 September, including your name and location or by filling in the form below. Crucially, please include a daytime telephone number as we will be recording questions for the panel over the phone, allowing us to include supporters from around the globe in the discussion. I look forward to an interesting debate!

My limited historical knowledge tells me that when the working population was decimated as the bubonic plague spread throughout Britain (and Europe), employers suddenly had to start treating the people working for them decently, even paying them enough to live on. Of course, the document fails to address the impact their proposals will have on every area of economic activity across the whole country: no more cheap crop harvesters, nurses, carers, shop assistants, road cleaners, office workers, taxi and bus drivers etc. Nor does it even think about the massive impact that having to pay people real wages will have on business finances across the whole economy. But that last comment shows it could bring an end to the real cause of the Brexit anger: the fact that wages have stagnated for the longest period in 150 years (UK economic model broken, says archbishop, 6 September). Many Tories will again rejoice that they have at last taken us back to the 60s – the 1860s that is. David Reed London • In respect of the rights of EU citizens post-Brexit, it’s often said that EU immigrants provide a major contribution to the economy and society. Is it not the case, then, that non-EU immigrants also provide a great contribution, usually under more financially adverse conditions? What is scandalous is the inequity of the present (pre-Brexit) immigration system. Pretty much all of the measures in the leaked document (including – yes – digital fingerprinting) have at some stage been part of my own immigration process, as a skilled non-EU migrant to the UK. Prior to my successful citizenship application, I paid UK taxes for seven years without the right to claim any form of benefit, while supporting a minor. Without exception, our passports have been checked on entry to the UK. None of this has been a problem: these are reasonable measures borne with a good humour by those of us who want to work in the great environment of the UK. If similar measures can be applied to all, that is only to be applauded. Dr Emma Gee Cupar, Fife • It is striking to note UK government proposals to end EU free movement rights as soon as the UK leaves the bloc in 2019. New rules would require EU nationals to seek permission before taking up a job, making employers recruit locally first. The impact of such a policy on Scotland will be devastating and it is no wonder that a plethora of major organisations have lined up to roundly condemn these proposals. There is clear evidence that Scotland’s future economic health, key services such as the NHS, the strength of our key institutions such as our universities and our future public finances depend on the maintenance of the ability of EU nationals to work and study freely in Scotland. While the number of pensioners in Scotland is expected to rise by 28% over the next 25 years, worker numbers are only increasing by 1%. We therefore face an ageing population, but only marginal growth in the working-age population. Scotland needs immigrants to balance this out and these reckless proposals will be absolutely devastating. In the run up to the EU referendum, senior figures in the leave campaign, such as Michael Gove, promised increased powers over immigration would come to Scotland should the UK vote to leave the EU. These pledges, like many others that were made in that campaign, have been predictably quickly forgotten. Scotland desperately need an immigration system that caters to the challenges we as a nation face, not one that shuts the door to much-needed talent. Alex Orr Edinburgh • If there is any political morality at all, it is lower-skilled foreign workers whom the UK ought to be offering home to. High-skilled workers, by contrast, are a precious resource in their own countries, and it is these people whom we should say no to. Our long-standing policy of stripping emerging economies of the people they most need has benefited the first world at the expense of the developing world. It has also sustained our failure over the long term to encourage, train and reward our own employees properly, and it is a policy we should stop at once. Dr Stephen Games London • I trust the migration advisory committee, in providing evidence to underpin a new immigration policy, will ask UK citizens living in the other 27 countries of the EU, and in particular their family members, whether they would welcome the same “plan” being applied to them post-Brexit by the EU27. Alex Morton London • Mass immigration is only a benefit to those in control of large businesses that benefit from it. The general public suffers competition and depressed wages. If a company cannot survive without a constant flow of immigrants, it shouldn’t be allowed to survive. If that means Londoners’ refined sensibilities are hurt then so be it!

Both outcomes are likely, and would have ramifications at the foot of Division One, too: Somerset would take their greatest step yet to a memorable escape, and render Warwickshire’s drawn-out relegation inevitable. The major movement took place at Taunton, where the estimable Jack Leach took five for 47 as Somerset skittled Lancashire for 133, and enforced the follow-on with a lead of 202. Lancashire’s openers, Alex Davies and Haseeb Hameed, negotiated 12 overs to reach stumps 174 behind. This took Leach to 103 Championship wickets in the last two seasons, and this was his third five-wicket haul of the summer, a mighty comeback from a painful winter that brought a remodelled action. His art, left-arm finger spin, is unfashionable, and so, it seems, is he. But he is mightily effective. After Craig Overton and Peter Trego got rid of the openers (Hameed was bounced out for four off 56 balls), Leach picked up the prized wickets of Liam Livingstone and Shiv Chanderpaul, then ran through the tail. He and the 20-year-old Dom Bess – who have 85 wickets in nine Championship matches in tandem – hold the key to Somerset’s snowballing survival hopes. Essex charged serenely on against Warwickshire, building a position in which they were able to declare nine down, 168 in front. Warwickshire’s openers survived two overs to stumps. Varun Chopra, back at Edgbaston, made 98, while Dan Lawrence scored a stylish 78 – full of legside flicks – and James Foster contributed a punchy 68 to take them from 271 for six to the declaration. Tom Westley was earlier dismissed for 28 as Chris Woakes got one to leave him; that pair’s England team-mate Alastair Cook will be available for the last matches against Hampshire and Yorkshire. He will hope it is a mere lap of honour. At The Oval, the pitch is bulging with runs and Surrey’s Kumar Sangakkara, a fortnight from the end of his first-class career, was not about to miss out. He scored his seventh Championship century of a golden farewell summer, a gorgeous 164 against Yorkshire, which leaves him with 1,250 Championship runs, 291 more than the nearest mortal in Division One, Mark Stoneman. Sangakkara has missed four matches, yet never misses out against Yorkshire: this season he has a ton against them with a red, white and pink ball. This was vintage Sangakkara. When Yorkshire posted two short covers barely five yards apart, the ball was threaded between them. He skipped down and stroked straight sixes, off seam and spin. We should all beg him to stay on but his fellow centurion Ben Foakes, with whom he shared 258, says his mind is made up: “He’s well and truly done,” said the wicketkeeper. “All day out in the field, he just tells you how tired he is.” When he fell, hooking Jack Brooks (who plugged away for five for 113), Foakes ploughed on for his first century of a stellar summer; he was stylish and patient, largely operating in Sangakkara’s slipstream, until Brooks got him too. Surrey were dismissed for 592, but Yorkshire found batting just as simple. This is the first time since May 2012 that neither Adam Lyth (absent for the birth of his first child) nor Alex Lees (at No3) has opened for them, but Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Shaun Marsh impressed. Kohler-Cadmore eventually became the debutant Freddie van den Bergh’s maiden Championship wicket, but not before making his first Championship fifty for Yorkshire, while Marsh – who is of interest to both these counties for next season – auditioned fluently with 77, as the visiting side reached stumps on 171 for one. Wow, what a day. A big mover, a big shaker. Will it all be decided tomorrow? If Essex win, and Lancashire don’t, Essex win the title. Both those outcomes are likely, and I’ll be at Edgbaston to see if it comes to pass. It would be an extraordinary title win should Essex do it. This is where we are: Division One: Warwickshire 201 &amp; 7-0 v Essex 369-9d Lancashire 133 &amp; 28-0 v Somerset 335 Yorkshire 171-1 v Surrey 592 Middlesex 76-3 v Hampshire Division Two: Derbyshire 338 &amp; 31-1 v Sussex 271 Kent 60-2 v Gloucestershire 385 Glamorgan 207 &amp; 63-1 v Northants 310 Worcestershire 270-4 v Leicestershire 404 Speak from Birmingham first thing: very much looking forward to it. As ever, report and roundup to follow. Drink it in... Stumps at Edgbaston! Warwickshire seven without loss, 161 behind... Right, Warwickshire are 162 behind and have two balls to survive tonight. Essex have declared! Two overs remain tonight, I believe. So Lancs’ openers have made it through those eight overs at Taunton. They are 28 without loss. At stumps, they are 178 behind. Foster is gone at Edgbaston, for 68, and Essex are 369 for nine, leading by 168. Well we have stumps an over early at the Oval, because the light’s poor. Yorkshire 171 for one, with Marsh on 77. Wicket! Oh my god a wicket! Van den Bergh has his first in the Championship, and how he’s loving it. TKC miscues to point, and Yorkshire are 162 for one! Lees, the nightwatchman (just kidding, guys), in ay No3. Five overs left. Sure is Stuie! Northants lead by 103 on first innings! Davies survives a maiden from Craig Overton. OMGGGG Woakes gets Harmer lbw, but Essex have four batting points! That means that an Essex win would mean they win, should Lancs lose...! Leach gets McLaren lbw and Somerset lead by 202 on first innings! Will they? Eight overs left tonight. Gloucestershire 385 all out! Bancroft carries his bat. Grim for Kent. Lancashire are nine down! Leach has four! They trail by 223... Cameron Bancroft has a double ton, and Kent’s promotion hopes are all but done. He has put on 108 for the last wicket and Gloucestershire are 382 for nine. Lancashire 111 for eight. Bess gets Bailey! Sussex all out for 271! Two in two balls for Viljoen, who finishes with seven. Wright left stranded on 70 not out. They trail Derbyshire by 67 on first innings. Lancs are seven down! Fifty for Tom Kohler-Cadmore! All very easy going at the moment. Well Surrey are just wheeling away with a bit of spin, but Yorkshire are 88 for none. A third batting point for Essex, who from 220 for two had stumbled slightly but thanks to James Foster (26*) now sit 303 for six and with a lead of 102. Keith Barker struck immediately after the tea interval with the second new ball to see Ravi Bopara on his way lbw for 20 - Hawkeye suggested it was going over - but Foster has found a bit of support from Simon Harmer (15) in a stand of 32. Chris Woakes has bowled some beauties in this spell for no reward. Warwickshire, having roared back into it, are no doubt reeling from the news that the Birmingham bin strike could spill into next year. Lancashire are six down ... Groenewald gets Vilas. They are looking like missing out on plenty of bonus points... Right, so covers coming off. Players five minutes from coming back. And now Lancs are five down as Overton gets Croft! 86 for five, needing every point they can muster, and still 249 behind. All sorts of concerns. Covers coming off at the Oval, 4.15 restart. Leach gets Chanderpaul and Lancs are in trouble at 82 for four! Still just mizzling away at the Oval, so the umpires have taken their business elsewhere. Essex six down, Barker gets Ravi. The lead is just 70. Luke Wright and the tail have hauled Sussex to 256 for eight, 82 behind Derbyshire. They need many more... Umpires having a look at the Oval, where the bowlers run-ups are currently covered. About to get going at Taunton, with 38 overs left in the day. During the tea break, some actual rain, and some actual covers. Tea at the Oval! Surrey brought on spin at both ends to shore things up, and it did a touch. But Yorkshire are 78 without loss after 20. Very tidy start. Big session in the match coming up. With big clouds forming, the covers are coming on during the break. Levi is gone, and Northants are 241 for four... Richard Levi has a 91-ball ton at Cardiff, and Northants are flying. 240 for three, lead by 33. More rain at Taunton, and at New Road. Great. Restart at 3.20 at Taunton. And another as Ryan Ten Doeschate chops Sidebottom onto his stumps for a duck ... Essex in danger of blowing full batting points here, maybe, possibly etc 256 for five, new ball due in just under five overs. At Cardiff, Northants have parity, three down... Just absolutely abysmal scheduling. Wicket at Edgbaston as Dan Lawrence, on 78, chops Ryan Sidebottom to Ian Bell gully and walks off in bereft fashion. Think he was just trying to guide it square. Had just been baten outside off by Sidebottom and then promptly gave it away next ball. Lovely innings nonetheless, full of wristy flicks through mid-wicket and some sweet drives. Essex 252 for four from 73.5 overs. And now the sun’s out again. Possibly just a little bit of rain in the air at the Oval. Still 9 overs til tea. 50 up for Yorkshire, off the first ball of the 11th over. Lead by stumps, I imagine. Inspection at Taunton at 3. Worcestershire have lost their first! Mitchell gone – surprisingly – for 58. Callum Parkinson the bowler. 119 for one. Tidy start from Yorkshire. 30 without loss; TKC, particularly, has played some very fine shots. Well Sussex have avoided the follow on against Derbyshire. 190 for seven. Play abandoned at Uxbridge. Rain stopped, but outfield wet. Oh dear. Middlesex 76 for three. How frustrating. Another half-century for Daryl Mitchell... Worcestershire 100 without loss. Now here’s an ATL jinx ... Varun Chopra has just been pinned lbw by the part-time right-arm medium of Matt Lamb on 98. Had just nudged a couple backward of square to get within two runs of a 21st first-class hundred ... and then Lamb just got one to nip in off the seam, Chopra played outside it and up went the finger from Martin Saggers. Essex 224 for three. Varun Chopra out for 98, lbw to Matt Lamb, at Edgbaston. Looked like he hit it. Ravi in. 224 for three. Kent have Gloucestershire nine down! Bancroft still there on 137, but 274 for nine is a good fightback from Kent, given Glos were 180 for one. Half-century up here for Dan Lawrence from 91 balls and has looked very organised in the process. Some nice work on the leg side, especially against Henry Brookes (there was one tangle when he dug out a yorker but otherwise everything speared into him has been whipped away). Essex now in credit too, leading by seven runs and just the two wickets down. Varun Chopra is on 95, eyeing what would be a second century in Division One this summer. So, as we ascertained yesterday, this is the first time since May 2012 that neither Lyth and Lees have opened the batting for Yorkshire. Kohler-Cadmore and Marsh doing the job, with Lees at No3. They need 443 to avoid the follow-on. Surrey all out for 592! Clarke goes to Patterson, caught at midwicket pulling. Surrey all out for 592. Represents a bit of a comeback for Yorkshire but it’s been a torrid four-and-a-bit sessions for them. Another tough one coming up. Meh. Successive sixes for Rikki Clarke off Bres. 569 for nine. Two wickets in two balls again here, on quintuple-nelson. Freddie vdB, then Meaker, both to Patterson. Batty in with Clarke now. Suspect a dart is incoming. The 18-year-old debutant Henry Brookes is getting a fast-tracked education here at Edgbaston, with his first over in the afternoon session taken for 11 runs. Wristy punch through mid-wicket for the first four by Dan Lawrence, before a sumptuous straight drive back past the bowler. Decent speeds from Brookes but line and length wavering a touch. Varun Chopra earned a life on 80 a couple of overs ago (half a life, maybe) when Sam Hain couldn’t cling on to a sharp chance at short-leg off the bowling of Jeetan Patel. Hain maybe didn’t stay down long enough and the ball clanged off his ankle on the full. Chopra onto 85 now. News Glorious sunshine at Edgbaston now, where play is about to resume. Chris Woakes has five balls of his over to complete and Dan Lawrence, 10 not out, is the man on strike. Varun Chopra is unbeaten on 79 and Essex are 146 for two... Covers on at Taunton. Pesky. That there is luncheon to conclude a very fine morning session, lit up by that man Mr Sangakkara. Scores are these: Division One: Essex 146-2 v Warwickshire 201 Surrey 543-7 v Yorkshire Lancashire 61-3 v Somerset 338 Middlesex 71-3 v Hampshire Division Two: Worcestershire 1-0 v Leicestershire 404 Northants 87-2 v Glamorgan 207 (playing on there, after a delayed start) Sussex 96-4 v Derbyshire 338 Gloucestershire 242-5 v Kent (no play there yet) Bit of a muddle there, but some games aren’t done yet. Enjoy your sarnies. Lunch at the Oval! Surrey 543 for seven. Be amazed if they declare now. As lunch approaches, some clouds are gathering to my right, which is where the weather comes in from. Lee, the groundsman, is hovering, as if he thinks it might rain. Ben Foakes is gone! He nibbled behind for 110 to become Brooks’s fifth wicket. Well done him. Yorkshire waited 85 minutes for a wicket this morning, and now he has four in half an hour. Looks like Freddie van den Bergh in on his Surrey debut now, with Surrey 540 for seven. Not the worst time to bat. Lunch in five, and I reckon Surrey will just remorselessly plough on until they are bowled out, because Gareth Batty is a hard bastard. So Worcestershire finally bowled Gloucestershire out for 404, I see. They are 1 for 0 and it’s lunch, because of a little shower. Leach’s 150th first-class wicket. Now Brooks has bowled Scurran for five. He was slogging. It doesn’t really matter. He has three wickets today though. Surrey are 531 for six, and Rikki Clarke is coming out to bat. Suspect they will continue slogging a bit after lunch too. Lancashire are in a bit of bother! Leach gets Livi and they are 39 for three... And at Uxbridge, as soon as Edwards gets Eskinazi, they are off for rain with Middlesex 62 for three. A ton for Ben Foakes! Somehow his first of the Champo summer. The third of the innings. 166 balls, and reached with his 19th four. Hits his 167th for four, too. Surrey 530 for five. Foakes to 99... Has... Hat-trick ball survived at the start of Brooks’s next over, by Sam Curran. 513 for five, Foakes on 96. Middlesex are 58 for two as Robson is caught at second slip off Ian Holland... Hameed gone at Taunton! Caught at, err, fine-leg off Trego for four off 56. Lancs 26 for two. They are off for rain at Edgbaston, it seems. Essex 146 for two. Sangakkara is out! The first chance he’s offered and he’s gone. He’s gone hooking, caught at fine-leg (Brooks the bowler), and gets a handshake from all the Yorkies and a standing ovation from the Oval faithful. Remarkable innings: 164 off 187, with 21 fours and three sixes. Surrey are 513 for four, as Pope comes in. Will that be Sanga’s final ton? It’s no 63 in first-class cricket, and seventh this season. And Pope’s gone first ball! Caught at slip. Brooks is on a hat-trick. Play at midday in Cardiff! 500 up... 150 for Sanga! His third of the season, by my count. 180 balls, reached with his 19th four, to go with three sixes. Think the third 50 has come in 53 balls. 498 for three, and Surrey have scored 100 runs in 75 minutes this morning. Middlesex 40 for one! Fidel bowls Compo! Two short covers, so Sanga drives Bressie between them. Six, four. Sangakkara right in the mood. He has 140. Hameed is doing his thing! He has three off 40. Lancs are 20 for one. Middlesex have made a steady start at Uxbridge, where I hear there’s no carry at all. 36 for none. In fact, replay shows it wasn’t so much squaring Tom Westley up as a nibble at a ball that nipped away a touch. Still, lovely bit of bowling from Chris Woakes. Change of ends for Chris Woakes works immediately as Tom Westley is squared up and feathers behind for 28 ... lovely bit of bowling. Varun Chopra appears a batsman with a point to prove at Edgbaston and is in pretty silken touch against his former county with some lovely cover drives and now a classy late dab to third man for four. All ended a a bit sourly for him here last year, such that he was allowed to move on mid-season. He’s moved to 71 with Tom Westley, who is himself growing in confidence by adding a lovely on drive off Brookes for four, on 27. Essex 128 for one. And the next over brings the second six of the match. Bressie hoicked into the Pavilion... As if to rub in the fact that Yorkshire are in the 110th over and have just one bowling point, Sanga skips down to Rafiq and hits the first six of the match. 465 for three. Could see Surrey batting very deep into the afternoon session here... 200 stand, then... Foakes is joining in again now. He’s on 81, and Surrey are 447 for three... As someone has pointed out on twitter: the bowler’s Holden, the batsman’s .... Morning Stuie! Sanga to 110 with a brutal swipe to leg off Patterson, who I think it’s fair to say he has fairly minimal respect for. 440 for three. Beauty... First appearance of the Tom Westley whip here, with Keith Barker slotted through midwicket off the back foot by the Essex man, who has moved to 13 with three boundaries - the first four of which was controlled through third man, the second less so when Chris Woakes squared him up. Now for a spot of Henry Brookes on his Championship debut, having replaced Woakes from the Birmingham End. Right-armer, England Under-19, has an easy action - slightly Jake Ball-ish, albeit goes slightly wider at the crease. Essex 97 for one in the 29th. Lancashire are one down... Al Davies gone to Coverton! Tres with the catch, and Lancs are 6 for 1. 50 for Varun Chopra at Edgbaston... This is a question I’ve been asking myself a lot lately. He wants to go out while he’s still at the top of his game. Which he most certainly is. This, by the way, is his third century of the season against Yorkshire: one against the pink, white and now red ball... Sanga has his seventh ton of the summer! Flicks through midwicket to move to 98, then runs hard to third man – where he’s spotted Sidebottom – and gets the two he needs! 127 balls, 15 fours. Surrey 414 for three. Sangakkara to 98... Derbyshire all out for 338 - Sussex’s replay has begun. Delayed start in Bristol too – only just noticed that. Early wicket at Edgbaston ... at least I think there is ... yes ... Nick Browne has been caught at first slip by Jeetan Patel off the bowling of Keith Barker in the third over of the day. Some question of whether it carried but replays looked clean to me. Now then, Essex 72 for one ... and Tom Westley is striding out to the middle Somerset all out for 335! Bailey gets Leach... And Surrey bring up their fifth batting point in the opening over of the day! Foakes moves to 65, Sanga to 87. They are 401 for three. Stream news. You can watch Warwickshire v Essex on Sky. But there are other options! Surrey v Yorkshire is here. That includes Kumar Sangakkara. Watch it. Somerset v Lancashire is here. There is also a stream for Glamorgan-Northants, but they are off for rain, which is no use. Delayed start at Cardiff. Shame. Players on their way out at the Oval. Sanga has 85, Foakes – who batted beautifully last night – has 64. Surrey need two for full batting points. About eight minutes to go until we start here, which is lovely. I’ve just noticed that Middlesex have left out RoJo. Stoneman didn’t have to play in this game, but wanted to. Bit different for a fast bowler, mind. A debut for Maxy Holden for Middlesex too! News from Uxbridge: no toss, Hampshire to bowl first against Middlesex. Teams: Middlesex: Robson, Compton, Eskinazi, Voges, Holden, Simpson+, Franklin*, Harris, Rayner, Helm, Finn Hampshire: Adams*, Weatherley, Alsop, Organ, Ervine, Holland, Dickinson +, Berg, Abbott, Crane, Edwards Organ’s playing for Hampshire: be still my beating heart! That’s a very green looking Hampshire batting lineup. Vince has a hamstring injury, so Adams is captain. Welcome to the Oval, where it’s beautifully sunny and, in about 30 minutes, Kumar Sangakkara will resume on 85. All, you’ll sense, is right with the world. I’m Will Macpherson and I’m going to guide you through the action from here and round the grounds, with a little help from my friend Ali Martin at Edgbaston. Tuesday at the Oval was a triumphant one for Surrey, with a ton for Stoneman and runs to all corners of this oval-shaped ground. Eh? There was no play at Uxbridge, but a toss is imminent there, so that’s good. The two most important games for the title and relegation are at Taunton and Edgbaston. Somerset looked to have the better of day one at Taunton, but Lancashire remain very much in it. At Edgbaston – don’t forget you can watch that on Sky – Essex are right in charge. Tom Westley will have a bat soon, which adds intrigue. There are also four games in Div Two, some of which were a wee bit rain-affected yesterday; Worcestershire need a good day against Leicestershire, I reckon. Division One: Essex 69-0 v Warwickshire 201 Surrey 398-3 v Yorkshire Somerset 330-9 v Lancashire No play on day one between Middlesex and Hampshire today Division Two: Leicestershire 325-7 v Worcestershire Northants 59-2 v Glamorgan 207 Derbyshire 338-9 v Sussex Gloucestershire 242-5 v Kent The report and roundup from yesterday is at the top of the liveblog. Please read it. I am contactable! Here’s how: Below The Line (play nicely) By email: will.macpherson.freelance@theguardian.com On twitter: @willis_macp I look forward to hearing from you!

Yair Netanyahu had already gained a controversial reputation for crudely trolling his parents’ enemies before his latest intervention, which has spawned days of hostile media coverage. On Saturday the 26-year-old posted a cartoon on his Facebook account depicting the American-Hungarian investor George Soros dangling the world in front of a reptilian creature, as well as a figure highly reminiscent of the antisemitic “happy merchant” image. The cartoon, which has been circulated by antisemitic websites, was posted a day after Israel’s attorney general announced that he was minded to prosecute Sara Netanyahu, Yair’s mother and the prime minister’s wife, for misappropriation of state funds. Benjamin Netanyahu is also under pressure as a result of several overlapping corruption investigations, which have gained pace in recent weeks. Also depicted in the cartoon were prominent critics of the Netanyahus, including the former prime minister Ehud Barak and Meni Naftali, who ran the Netanyahus’ official residency and successfully sued Sara Netanyahu for wrongful dismissal, alleging abusive and erratic behaviour. Four days of non-stop controversy have ensued, the flames fanned by the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, who shared the post, and the US neo-Nazi hate site the Daily Stormer, which endorsed it and Yair. For its part the Israeli press has published daily stories examining the source of the image and its meaning, as well as the role of the “alt-right” in the country. Commentators have questioned why Benjamin Netanyahu – usually quick to condemn any hint of antisemitism – has remained silent. Prominent political figures and NGOs have been forthright in their criticism of Yair. “The caricature posted by Yair Netanyahu includes explicit antisemitic elements,” the Israel office of the Anti-Defamation League wrote on Twitter. “One cannot belittle the danger inherent in an antisemitic discourse.” Avi Gabbay, the new leader of Israel’s Labour party, wrote: “It’s a particularly sad day for Israel when a caricature that’s endorsed by the head of the KKK emerges.” Barak asked: “Is this what the kid hears at home? Is it genetics, or a spontaneous mental illness? It doesn’t matter. In any case, we should fund his psychiatrist instead of security guards and a driver” – a reference to the fact that Yair has a driver and security detail funded by the state. Israel’s opposition leader Yitzhak Herzog was even stronger in his condemnation: “Every Jew must feel horror and shame that a Der-Stürmer-style cartoon [refering to the German Nazi-era propaganda sheet] came out of the Israeli prime minister’s residence and was embraced by one of the most extreme of antisemites. Erase, apologise, and condemn!” he wrote. Complicating matters politically for Israel’s prime minister is the prominence that he has afforded his son. Yair was introduced on camera to Donald Trump when the US president visited this year. He is also reported to have advised his father on social media strategy. Persistent reports suggest his parents have been grooming him for a career in politics. Even rightwing columnists usually sympathetic to Netanyahu have weighed in against Yair. “The neo-Nazis couldn’t have done a better job drawing that cartoon,” wrote Ben-Dror Yemini in Yedioth Ahronoth. “When an antisemitic cartoon gets posted there, that is no longer just the problem of the people who reside in the [PM’s] residence. It is the state of Israel’s problem.” Yair Netanyahu has form in drawing attention to himself for views that are often obnoxious. In recent weeks he has made an allegedly homophobic, dog-whistle reference to a former prime minister’s son, hinting at untrue claims of a gay relationship with a Palestinian man, and he attacked Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist activists in the US after the violence in Charlottesville. “To put things in perspective. I’m a Jew, I’m an Israeli, the neo-Nazis scum in Virginia hate me and my country,” he wrote on Facebook. “But they belong to the past. Their breed is dying out. However the thugs of Antifa and BLM who hate my country (and America too in my view) just as much are getting stronger and stronger and becoming super dominant in American universities and public life.” An editorial in the leftwing newspaper Haaretz said Yair was emblematic of the tactics used by the Israeli right to target its opponents under his father. “The antisemitic meme is not Yair Netanyahu’s first public outrage, but it is his worst,” the paper wrote. “This time silence in light of such an alarming message cannot be interpreted as anything but consent to the ongoing demonisation of anyone who doesn’t get in line with the Israeli right, which is becoming ever more extreme.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/sep/13/former-brexit-minister-suggests-ministers-not-being-honest-about-challenge-of-leaving-eu-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T17:08:56Z","webTitle":"General election cost taxpayers £141m, government reveals - politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/13/former-brexit-minister-suggests-ministers-not-being-honest-about-challenge-of-leaving-eu-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/13/former-brexit-minister-suggests-ministers-not-being-honest-about-challenge-of-leaving-eu-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"General election cost taxpayers £141m, government reveals - politics live","bodyText":"Theresa May’s decision to call a snap election cost the taxpayer £141m, the Cabinet Office has revealed. (See 4.42pm.) The Commons has passed a Labour motion saying that NHS workers should get a “fair pay rise” and that the public sector pay cap in the NHS should be lifted. With the DUP planning to support Labour, the Conservatives, who don’t have a majority without DUP, faced defeat if they opposed the motion and so they chose to abstain, meaning the motion was passed by acclamation, without any MPs objecting. The result is not binding, but it does amount to a symbolic victory for Jeremy Corbyn who called for the public sector pay cap to go at PMQs. Government sources have revealed that in future the Tories will sidestep the risk of defeat when the Commons is debating opposition day motions by treating them as irrelevant and allowing their MPs to stay away. (See 5.50pm.) The Police Federation has accused May of lying about police pay at PMQs. (See 3.43pm.) Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has told MPs the government is considering imposing a cap on the amount any landowner can receive in agricultural subsidies after Brexit. Currently subsidies are paid by the EU under the common agricultural policy. After Brexit the government plans to introduce its own version. When the Labour MP Paul Flynn put it to Gove at an environment select committee hearing that aristocrats and members of the royal family receive huge sums under the current system, Gove replied: One of the things we are would like to do as we reform the common agriculture policy is to see if there’s a way we can provide a cap on the level of support than any individual or institution can receive. Downing Street has released a video intended to show the government is making good progress towards Brexit. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP and former attorney general, has called for an urgent side-deal on EU citizens’ rights post-Brexit to secure their future in the event Britain crashes out of the bloc without an agreement with Brussels. Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party have joined forces in a bid to pressurise the US government into helping resolve the bitter aerospace trade dispute between Boeing and Bombardier. As the Press Association reports, the political rivals, who have been unable to reach agreement to restore Northern Ireland’s failed government, have issued a joint letter to US Vice President Mike Pence raising their concerns about the fallout which could financially devastate one of the region’s biggest employers. The letter was signed by DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Fein’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill. Theresa May has been given a discount card for high street retailer LK Bennett - the third fashion-related perk she has declared. As the Press Association reports, May recorded the gift from LK Bennett, valid from May 2017 until April 2018, on the Commons register of members’ interests. It follows previously declared donations to the fashion-loving PM from designer Amanda Wakely and shoe store Russell and Bromley. The discounts were declared because they have the “potential to be of registrable value” - indicating that they could be worth more than 300 depending on how much the prime minister spends. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Tory MPs will soon find that they can take quite a lot of Wednesday afternoons off. The government has to allocate a certain number of days per session, like today, for opposition day debates (they are usually on a Wednesday) and Labour normally uses these sessions to table a motion or motions criticising government policy. A government with a majority would just vote them down. But this government does not have a majority and, when it became obvious the DUP were going to vote with Labour, the whips decided to tell Tory MPs to abstain - so that technically the government has not been defeated, and Labour’s “victory” is relatively hollow. The Tories feel free to do this because the Commons was not voting on legislation; MPs were just voting on a declaratory motion. In an ideal world, the government would always take notice of the views of the House of Commons. But, in practice, the government can happily ignore a declaratory motion saying, ‘Ministers must do X’ and no one will really notice. How do we know? Because they have been doing it for six years anyway. After the Wright report (see 3.35pm) the Commons started holding regular debates on motions chosen by backbenchers. At first the coalition government started to worry about being “defeated” on various issues. But then the government decided to ignore these votes as a matter of course, telling their backbenchers they could vote as they liked because the outcome did not matter. According to a well-placed source, Theresa May’s government is now going to adopt the same approach to opposition day debates. Tory MPs will be told to abstain, or they will be given the freedom to do what they want. Either way, the chief whip is going to make it clear that they won’t have to be in the Commons to vote. Government ministers and backbenchers will still participate in opposition day debates, but the Tories will try to render them irrelevant by not making any effort to win the votes. It’s the equivalent of not turning up to the match because the other team has more players. The general election cost the taxpayer £141m, the Cabinet Office has revealed. In a Commons written statement, the Cabinet Office minister Chris Skidmore said free mail shots for candidates cost £43m and administering the election cost £98m. In the Commons the Labour motion on NHS pay (see 11.54am for the text) has been passed by MPs unopposed. Gove says a post-Brexit trade deal with the US would have to be ratified by the House of Commons. And the British people do not want to see animal welfare standards watered down, or labour standards watered down either. If we cannot reach agreement on the US on these points, the deal will have to be limited in scope. Q: So would the government actually hold up a US trade deal if it involved the UK having to accept chlorinated chicken? Yes, says Gove, very directly. (He said the same thing during the summer.) Gove is now talking about fishing after Brexit. He says he does not think anyone is saying no foreign boats should fish in British waters after Brexit. But Britain will be able to choose who can and cannot fish in these waters. Q: Will British fishermen get access to more fish after Brexit? Yes, says Gove. He says at the moment the French can access more fish in the English channel than the British. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is giving evidence to the Commons environment committee now. In response to a question from Labour’s Paul Flynn about the common agriculture policy, and subsidies paid to wealthy landowners, he said that as Britain its own subsidy regime after Brexit, the government is considering introducing a cap setting a maximum amount that can be paid to any individual or institution. Gove says government may cap amount any landowner can receive in farming subsidies after Brexit. Here is the full statement from Calum Macleod, the Police Federation vice chair, on what Theresa May said about police pay at PMQs. It shows they have lost touch with reality, if they ever had it, and are clueless as to the demands and dangers officers have to face on a daily basis to keep communities safe. Officers are struggling to keep their heads above water and all we are asking for is fair recognition. When comparing total pay in 2015/2016 to what it was in 2009/2010 it has increased in nominal terms by +2%, but decreased by -16% in real terms. This cannot be right. We expect police officers to run in to the face of danger every day to protect the public however the government refuses to give them the money they deserve. This has to be addressed and the government has to be held to account. How can they abide by their independent pay bodies which recommended an 11% pay rise for MPs but fail to abide by ours, which recommended a 2% consolidated). This smacks of double standards. The Police Federation has accused Theresa May of lying about police pay at PMQs. Calum Macleod, the vice chair of the Police Federation, told HuffPost UK: The government stating that police officers have had a 32% pay rise since 2010 is a joke – and is in fact a downright lie. It shows they have lost touch with reality, if they ever had it, and are clueless as to the demands and dangers officers have to face on a daily basis to keep communities safe. Officers are struggling to keep their heads above water and all we are asking for is fair recognition. May told MPs that, if you take into account progression pay, pay rises and the increase in the income tax threshold, someone who was a new police officer in 2010 will have seen their post-tax pay increase by £9,000, a real-terms rise of 32%. One of John Bercow’s innovations as speaker has been to allow PMQs every week to over-run, effectively turning a 30-minute session into a 45-minute session without the prime minister or anyone else having a say. He has also been much, much more willing than his predecessors to grant urgent questions and emergency debates, again carving out time from the parliamentary timetable for topics that he has chosen to see debated, not the government. Now he is proposing an even more significant shift. In an interesting article for Prospect, Bercow says a House business committee, not the government whips, should get to decide what gets debated and when. Bercow points out that this was one of the recommendations of the Wright committee (so called after its chair, the Labour MP Tony Wright) set up after the expenses scandal. The Wright committee called for the election of select committee chairs and the establishment of a backbench business committee, to determine which MPs can raise which topics on the day’s set aside for backbench debates. Both reforms are widely seen as successes, making select committee more independent and ensuring a wider range of topics gets debated on the floor of the Commons. But the proposal for a House business committee was shelved, for the fairly obvious reason that its creation would make it harder for the government to get its business through the Commons. Explaining how this would work, Bercow says: How would a House Business Committee work? First, the government is entitled to have a majority, but not a monopoly, on the committee. The party, or coalition, with the majority of seats in the Commons should not have its business scuppered by being denied parliamentary time, as that would be undemocratic. The House, however, should have the right to ask that certain measures receive more scrutiny than the norm because of the nature and implications of those measures. Second, it should be chaired by an independent individual, thus securing the confidence of the whole House: the Wright committee suggested the senior Deputy Speaker. Third, there should be a backbench component and representation from the so-called “minor parties.” Fourth, as it would be desirable to link the work of select committees to the Chamber, there is a strong case for a representative of the select committees to be included, possibly the chair of the liaison committee. Finally, there is a strong case for the backbench members of the committee being elected by the whole House, so they can speak with that mandate. Setting up a committee like this is “the right, democratic thing to do,” he goes on. “Inadequate scrutiny hardly makes for stellar legislation.” There is no particular reason to think that Bercow will have any more luck that Tony Wright in getting this idea off the ground. But the EU withdrawal bill has stirred up the whole debate about the balance of power between the legislature and the executive (a House business committee would have set aside more than eight days for the bill’s committee stage, and when that committee stage takes place, some of the amendments will be calling for the Commons, not ministers, to decide how the Henry VII powers in the bill get parliamentary scrutiny) and so perhaps Bercow has chosen the right time to try again. Theresa May ducked a question from Jeremy Corbyn on whether police or prison officers numbers could be cut in order to fund the pay rises announced for both groups of public sector workers this week. The Commons is set to approve a Labour motion saying that NHS staff should get a “fair pay rise” and that the public sector pay cap should be lifted in the NHS. MPs are debating the motion now, and will later debate another Labour motion saying the government’s latest rise in university tuition fees should be scrapped. The DUP is voting with Labour on both motions, which means even that if the Tories were to try voting them down, they would probably lose. Instead Tory MPs are going to abstain. The NHS pay motion will not be binding on the government when passed. Labour claim the tuition fee one will be binding, but the government disputes this. Wage rises in Britain have failed to keep pace with inflation, according to the latest official figures, despite a buoyant labour market that saw unemployment fall to its lowest level since 1975. George Osborne told colleagues at the Evening Standard that he will not rest until Theresa May is “chopped up in bags in my freezer”, according to a profile of the former chancellor. May has condemned the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey for saying he would back illegal strikes. Speaking at PMQs, she also joked about McCluskey citing Mahatma Gandhi to justify illegal protest. She told MPs: I was struck this week to see that Len McCluskey, or perhaps Mahatma as his friends call him, had said if they need to act outside the law, so be it. Well, I have to say I join you, on this side of the House we’re very clear - we condemn illegal strikes, we condemn action outside of the law. The people who suffer from those illegal strikes are the ordinary working families who can’t get their children to school, who can’t access the public services they need and who can’t get to work. Yesterday the shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said Labour was “a party that respects the law” when asked if he backed McCluskey. But Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, sidestepped the same question when he was asked about McCluskey’s comments in an interview yesterday, and this afternoon, on the World at One, the shadow education minister Tracy Brabin defended McCluskey. She said: He’s the champion for his members and workforce and he’s saying to the government you’ve got to take this seriously or further down the line we are going to have big trouble ... Given his position, he’s probably right [to threaten illegal strike action] because he needs the government to listen because they are not listening. May has announced that the government will spend a further £25m on the Hurricane Irma relief effort. Lord Bridges of Headley, a former Brexit minister, has accused the government of not being “honest” about the challenges created by the decision to leave the EU. (See 9.30am.) Mark Price, who quit as a government trade minister a fortnight ago, has warned that Brexit will not solve the day-to-day problems that led people to vote to leave the EU, but instead will make them worse. Britain needs to show “more clarity and less ambiguity” in Brexit negotiations, a French government minister has said, warning that the consequences of failure to reach a deal would be felt across Europe but “even worse in Britain”. Jean-Claude Juncker has declared that the “wind is back in Europe’s sails” in an at times deeply personal State of the Union speech in which he gave his vision for the future of the bloc when the UK makes its “tragic” departure in 2019. The UK would not have voted for Brexit had it not been for the banking crisis which began 10 years ago with the run on Northern Rock, according to the former chancellor Lord Darling. Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has urged the arms industry to increase exports after Brexit. Speaking at the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) arms fair in London’s docklands, he said: As we look to life post-Brexit and spread our wings further across the world it is high time that we do more to compete for a bigger share of this international export market. It is time now to build exportability into our thinking from the off, aligning that with requirements of our international partners, enabling a more open architecture to our platforms that can ‘plug and play’ with different bits of capability. The moment Nick Clegg and his wife had to tell their eldest son he had blood cancer was one of the “toughest things” for the family, Miriam González Durántez has said. Norman Lamb has warned it is unacceptable that the Commons science and technology committee, which he chairs, has no female members so far. May has revealed that the Conservative backbencher Michael Fabricant is going to appear on the Channel 4 programme Celebrity First Dates. In response to a question from him at PMQs, she said: I have noticed that he is shortly to appear on a Channel 4 programme called Celebrity First Dates. What I’m not sure about is whether he is the celebrity or the first date. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs. No one was hugely impressed, by Corbyn is definitely getting the better reviews. From the Mirror’s Jason Beattie From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From Sky’s Adam Boulton From the Guardian’s Peter Walker From the Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith From the Independent’s John Rentoul From 5 News’s Andy Bell From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman From Sky’s Faisal Islam The Independent’s Tom Peck has coined the term “director’s cut PMQs” to describe John Bercow’s new, longer version. HuffPost UK’s Paul Waugh has thought up what Jeremy Corbyn should have said in response to Theresa May’s ‘he’s let people down’ riff. (See 12.20pm.) At the post-PMQs briefing Theresa May’s spokesperson was asked about George Osborne’s reported desire to carve her up and pop her in his freezer. (See 11.30am.) This is from Business Insider’s Adam Bienkov. I missed the question from Ian Blackford, the SNP leader, because I was writing up the snap verdict. So this is what he asked. Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, asked about the economy and wage growth. May replied by saying the economy was doing worse in Scotland than in the UK generally. She went on: It is an SNP government that is failing the people of Scotland ... The people in Scotland now have a strong voice in this house through our 13 Conservative MPs. Blackford said May should not be attacking the Scottish government. He then criticised May for being able to find money for quantitative easing (QE), but not for other measures to boost the economy. He said: The government can find the money for QE but can’t find the money for fiscal measures to grow the economy. This is a government that does not understand how to use economic levers and it’s our people who are paying the price. In reply, May said: In all of that rather lengthy question never once did he record the increase in employment but he started off by standing up and complaining that I’d referenced the acts of the Scottish government. He believes in independence, so I think in this House we deserve to talk about what the Scottish government is doing for the people of Scotland. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. PMQs is now over. It is now routinely running for closer to an hour than half an hour, the time supposedly allocated for it. That is a choice made by John Bercow, the Speaker. Nigel Huddleston, a Conservative, asks what May thinks should be done to get more talented women into parliament. May says she wants women to see parliament as a place offering a future career. Her party will continue to support women coming into parliament, through role models. (A Commons committee came up with six ideas to promote female representation in parliament. The government has rejected them all.) The Lib Dem Norman Lamb asks May to make it a priority to ensure that there is proper support for people in the prison system with mental health issues. May says this is a longstanding issue. Some progress has been made. But the government will continue to look at this. Simon Hoare, a Conservative, says he his hosting an event for the Multiple Sclerosis Society. May says she knows from her family (her mother) what impact this disease can have. This is not just an issue for the department for health; it is also about helping people with MS back into the workplace. May says the UK wants to leave the EU with a trade deal that will be a “friction-free” and “tariff-free” as possible. Julian Lewis, a Conservative, says Ian Gow’s widow has expressed disgust that former soldiers are being investigated for shootings in Northern Ireland while the killers of her husband walk free. Will May introduce a statute of limitations to put an end to this “grotesque situation”. May says the overwhelming majority of soldiers in Northern Ireland acted honourably. She says the bodies looking at deaths in the Troubles will act in a fair and proportionate manner, she says. She says most of those killed in the Troubles were killed by terrorists. Victoria Atkins, a Conservative, says the shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon refused four times to condemn possible illegal strike action. Will she condemn this? May says she was struck this week to see that the Unite leader Len McCluskey, “or perhaps Mahatma as his friends call him”, defended illegal strikes. May says the Tories do condemn them. The SNP’s Kirsty Blackman says 3,000 Aberdonians were born in Nigeria. What is being done to promote peace in the country? May says the UK is helping Nigeria in a number of ways. Mike Wood, a Conservative, says today is world sepsis day. What more can be done to increase awareness of this? May says she is glad Wood recovered from sepsis. Some 10,000 deaths a year could be avoided by better and earlier diagnosis. A sepsis action plan is being published. Labour’s Daniel Zeichner says schools and pubs in Cambridge are losing staff because EU workers are going home. What will be done to tackle this shortage of labour? Mays says Zeichner implies there is no net EU migration to the UK. There is. But there is another point. The government needs to increase training, so people can take on these jobs. PMQs - Snap verdict: Corbyn easily had the best soundbite of those exchanges - the spoof, and very apposite, recasting of Harold Macmillan famous ‘Never had it so good’ - and his wide-ranging case against May was solid, but there was no point at which he caused her serious unease or embarrassment in a drab exchange that effectively amount to a draw. It was not that May was especially effective; she dodged the key question (about a below-inflation pay rise being a real-terms cut) and at one point she took refuge in an irrelevant and slightly tedious generalised anti-Labour rant. (If you are going to try to change the subject at PMQs by taking a detour into Corbyn-bashing, as Cameron did almost every week, at least make it incisive, or funny.) Her point about Labour introducing tuition fees seemed particularly otiose in the light of Corbyn’s own almost non-existent loyalty to the Blair regime. Her answers were never very good, but she did at least manage to parry all Corbyn’s questions and, apart from the moment when he pointed out that record employment is no good if wages are lousy, generally he did not follow up on his points. Not for the first time, it sounded like two figures throwing statistics at each other with too little actual engagement. Corbyn says the only problem is that more people in work are in poverty. That is the Conservative legacy. A woman called Aisha wrote to him, saying she had graduated with a hefty amount of debt. She said she was scared about the future. People who want to become a nurse no longer want to. Will May vote this afternoon against another hike in tuition fees. May says there are a few things Corbyn did not mention. He did not mention raising the tax allowance that amounted to a tax cut. Let’s talk about delivery, she says. Corbyn promised workers he would protect their rights; on Monday he let them down. He promised students he would deal with their debt; he has let them down. He promised to support Trident, but he has let voters down. And he promised to back Brexit, but has let people down. Corbyn says British students now have the highest debt in the world. We are in the middle of an economic slowdown. Growth is slowing, productivity is worsening, debt is rising, and homelesness is rising. By the end of this parliament 5m children will be in poverty. For many people, the economy is no longer at breaking point. It is already broken. May says it was Labour that introduced tuition fees. What do we see; record levels of investment in the economy, more people in work than ever before, and more women in work and education than before. Labour, with its high taxes, would destroy the economy. The only people who would pay the price for the economy are ordinary working families. Corbyn says with inflation at 2.9%, the police and prison service are effectively taking a pay cut. Can she assure MPs no staff will be cut? May says the recommendations came from independent bodies. And Corbyn forgot to mention the other pay rises people are getting, like progression pay. Corbyn says there are 20,000 fewer police officers, and 7,000 fewer prison officers than in 2010. Police budgets have been cut. But the chancellor is “on the money on this one, literally”. At the 1922 committee meeting last week, he told Conservative MPs, “Look at us, everyone with a pension, more money than ever in the current account.” A Conservative PM once said, “You’ve never had it so good”. Now a Conservative chancellor says, “We’ve never had it so good.” What has happened to the average salary. May says Corbyn has not mentioned the unemployment figures. More people are in work than ever. Jeremy Corbyn says the UK must respond as generously as possible to Hurricane Irma. He says the UN body on disabilities has described the situation facing the disabled in the UK as a disgrace. He challenges May over why. May says that while the government has been in power more disabled people have got into work, and spending on the disabled has gone up. So this picture is not a fair one. Corbyn says we have seen punitive sanctions, and the bedroom tax. Some 4.2m disabled people live in poverty. Turning to pay, Corbyn says the police and prison service face a real-terms cut. What is the policy today? May says the government spends about £50bn on the disabled. Spending on the disabled is the second highest in the G7 per head. She says the government said it would respond to the pay review bodies on the police and the prison service soon. It has done that. Looking ahead, “there is a need for great flexibility” on pay, she says. The remits for the pay review bodies will be published in due course. UPDATE: Disability campaigners do not accept the £50bn figure May cited, pointing to Institute for Fiscal Studies research saying spending on disability benefits is much lower. Philip Davies, a Conservative, asks for a Shipley bypass, and for more infrastructure in Yorkshire generally. May says the government is spending more money on transport in the north in this parliament than any government has spent before. (If that is a cash figure, then inflation may mean that it is a relatively empty boast.) The Lib Dem Layla Moran says the Oxford car industry could be badly affected if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union. Shouldn’t people get a referendum on the final deal? May says, if that is what Moran is telling her constituents, she is not telling them the facts. Theresa May starts by updating MPs on Hurricane Irma. Boris Johnson has travelled to the region, she says. She says Cobra has been meeting regularly to coordinate the UK’s response. And today she can announce an extra aid package worth £25m, in addition to the £32m already provided. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart’s take on what to expect from PMQs. Yesterday Downing Street announced a tentative start to the dismantling of the public sector pay cap. But the announcement was not quite the PR success that some in Number 10 may have been expecting. Jack Blanchard from Politico Europe and Paul Waugh from HuffPost UK have both explained why in their respective daily morning political briefings. Blanchard writes: Corbynomics: The Labour leader’s office was incredulous at May’s decision to announce the 1.7 percent hike for prison officers and 1 percent bonus for police on the very day higher inflation figures were published — showing the rises still constitute real-terms pay cuts. “So they concede the argument but don’t solve the problem,” a senior Corbyn aide told Playbook. “And they even timed it so Jeremy could respond in his speech at the TUC two hours later. Who thinks this stuff up?” Tory grumblings: Less jolly were members of May’s own cabinet, according to Newsnight’s Nick Watt. One cabinet minister in favor of lifting the cap said the policy “had not landed well.” Former paymaster general Francis Maude told the show: “I’m not happy that we are giving the impression we can suddenly spend money to alleviate a political pressure point.” Today’s Telegraph leader grumbles that “the government may come to rue the day it gave in.” Quick thought: If your new policy seems to please nobody but the leader of the opposition, you may have a problem. And Waugh writes: Still, No.10 was clearly stung yesterday by the backlash to its big reveal on the melting pay cap. Prison officers still threatened action despite their 1.7% rise, and the cops weren’t over the moon at getting a 1% lump sum top-up. Downing Street was surprised that the cabinet’s announcement hadn’t ‘landed’ better, but maybe that’s because the cabinet’s language was so opaque. On the 2018/19 settlements for other workers, the PM’s spokesman told us the cabinet recognised the need for “more flexibility”, but you can’t pay the bills with flexibility. What’s amazing that is that ministers were amazed a grateful nation didn’t leap up with joy. It is very likely that we will hear a lot more about this in a few minutes’ time at PMQs. Jeremy Corbyn has a particular incentive to lead on public sector pay because Labours’ first opposition day debate this afternoon (the first for ages - the Tory whips had been dragging their feet about giving Labour a debate) is on NHS pay. The motion says: That this House notes that in 2017-18 NHS pay rises have been capped at one per cent and that this represents another below-inflation pay settlement; further notes that applications for nursing degrees have fallen 23 per cent this year; notes that the number of nurses and midwives joining the Nursing and Midwifery Council register has been in decline since March 2016 and that in 2016-17 45 per cent more UK registrants left the register than joined it; and calls on the government to end the public sector pay cap in the NHS and give NHS workers a fair pay rise. If you’ve got a spare five to 10 minutes and you’re curious about George Osborne, do read Ed Caesar’s long and very good profile/interview for Esquire. Here are three of the highlights. Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor sacked by Theresa May who now edits the Evening Standard, has reportedly told colleagues that he will not rest until May “is chopped up in bags in my freezer”. (Speaking metaphorically - one assumes.) Caesar says: Osborne’s animus against May is complicated in origin — personal, political, ideological, tactical — but purely felt. When I met him at the Standard this past spring, he was polite enough about the prime minister. But according to one staffer at the newspaper, Osborne has told more than one person that he will not rest until she “is chopped up in bags in my freezer”. Osborne has rejected claims that austerity was a contributing factor in the Grenfell Tower fire. Pointing out that the Standard seemed reluctant to politicise the tragedy, Caesar writes: There was speculation that Osborne’s editorial line on Grenfell was born of a concern that the budget cuts he oversaw as chancellor might be linked to the deaths of mostly poor Londoners. (This was, in fact, precisely Labour’s line of attack.) But Osborne insists that wasn’t the case. “I was sceptical of the instant experts in other papers who rushed to blame the whole thing on Kensington and Chelsea Council saving costs,” he told me, noting that the cladding accused of accelerating the fire was in use across the UK long before austerity measures took effect. “It’s the kind of sloppy journalism I’m trying to get my paper, at least, away from. The failure was a massive failure of fire standards over many, many years, and that is a scandal we’ve talked about.” Osborne greeted the EU referendum result by saying: “Dave’s fucked, I’m fucked, the country’s fucked.” Caesar is not the first journalist to reveal this - it’s in Tim Shipman’s excellent book, All Out War - but I’m flagging it up anyway because it’s fun. And it is an excuse to point out that Osborne was clearly channelling Sir Richard Mottram, the former permanent secretary at the transport department, who set the template for Malcolm Tucker in the midst of some long-forgotten Blairite Whitehall PR disaster by saying: We’re all fucked. I’m fucked. You’re fucked. The whole department’s fucked. It’s been the biggest cock-up ever and we’re all completely fucked. Rank and file police officers in Northern Ireland are furious that they will not be included in the pay rise the government announced for their colleagues in England and Wales yesterday. But the Police Federation for Northern Ireland are more angry at local politicians than the cabinet in London over their exclusion from the marginal hike in police wages. The absence of devolved power sharing government in the regions means there are no local ministers in place to apply for and to approve any parallel pay deal, according to the federation. Mark Lindsay, its chairman who represents more than 6,000 rank and file Police Service of Northern Ireland officers, said there was “disgust and disappointment” that no such pay award was available to his members. The sole reason for this is the absence of a devolved administration, which requires consideration for any recommendations by both a justice minister and a finance minister. In addition, there is currently no legislative process in place in Northern Ireland to sign off any element of an award. Power sharing is in suspended animation after the devolved government led by the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein collapsed at the start of this year in a row over a costly renewable heating scheme the former party had championed in office. Downing Street revealed this morning that Theresa May spoke to Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, and Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland, last night in separate phone calls, and urged them to reach an agreement on the resumption of power-sharing. A Number 10 spokesperson said: The prime minister made clear the importance of restoring a power-sharing executive to Northern Ireland as soon as possible and she recognised their continued leadership towards reaching agreement. They discussed key outstanding issues that remain for both parties and the prime minister encouraged both leaders to come to an agreement soon in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland. Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, and his wife Miriam González Durántez have revealed that their 14-year-old son Antonio was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a form of cancer, around this time last year. He has had chemotherapy and is now in remission, and his parents have chosen to speak out to raise awareness for Bloodwise, a blood cancer research charity. They spoke in an interview on ITV’s Lorraine. González Durántez said they took their son to the doctor after discovering a “very, very small” lump on his neck. Antonio did not have any other symptoms. “We took him to the GP anyway which was a stroke of luck really because immediately he spotted it could be something more serious and it was lymphoma,” she said. She said that telling her son about his cancer was “one of the toughest things that we have every done”. Describing his reaction to the news, Clegg said: Well it’s like a sort of ‘word bomb’ isn’t it? Certainly if you are unfamiliar with it, as we were, and your initial reaction, I think, we found, was like any mum and dad, it’s irrational, but you just have this almost physical wish to try and take it off your kid and take it yourself. And then very quickly you get into the pretty gory details of the treatment. Clegg went on: The advances in science have been remarkable of course but it’s still a very brutal thing - you’re basically poisoning the body with very powerful chemicals and drugs to kill the cancerous cells and that has huge side effects; hair loss and vomiting and nausea. At one point his body was neutropenic which means his body had no defences against infection, so you very quickly move from the shock into just trying to support your child as they’re battling through this very heavy treatment ... You have got your work and you’ve got all sorts of other things going on in your life but when something like this happens it just becomes the sole principle, objective, just to make sure he is better. Clegg said his son was treated at a teenage cancer unit at UCLH in London. The staff there were “brilliant”, he said. Now his son was recovering, he said. His lymphoma was all over his chest and his neck and he gets tested every three months I think for a couple of years, so there is always a slight spike of anxiety with us every three months but basically he is on the road to recovery. Peter Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office and former national security adviser, has welcomed Lord Bridges’s speech. (See 9.30am.) But Roger Helmer, a Ukip spokesman and former MEP, disagrees with the Tory peer. Westminster Unionist, an official DUP Twitter account, has taken issue with Lord Bridges’ world war two analogy. (See 9.39am.) The unemployment figures are out. This is from my colleague Graeme Wearden. Breaking! Britain’s unemployment rate has fallen to a new 42-year low of 4.3%, in the three months to July. That’s down from 4.4% a month ago, and the lowest since 1975. But real wages are still falling. Average weekly earnings only rose by 2.1% per year in the quarter, weaker than expected, and the same as last month. That means that the cost of living squeeze is getting worse, as inflation has jumped from 2.6% to 2.9%. Graeme has more on the unemployment figures on his business live blog. Lord Bridges of Headley is not exactly a household name - he’s an Old Etonian former Conservative party official ennobled by David Cameron - but he was a Brexit minister until June when, after the general election, he resigned without saying why. Bridges voted remain, and according to one report (paywall) he left because he was “convinced Brexit couldn’t work”. But he did not say so himself. Now he has spoken out, in a speech in the House of Lords last night. It was his first speech in the chamber since his resignation and, although he was not overtly critical of the government’s stance, you don’t have to be a cryptologist to work out that he thinks Theresa May and her team are not handling Brexit well. Ministers are not being “honest” about the challenges Brexit poses, he suggested. He told peers: First, an observation: faced with any challenge, one must acknowledge the truth. If we are not honest with ourselves, our plans will be built on sand. Consequently, we will lose the trust of those who look to us for leadership, and those with whom we are negotiating. We must be honest about the task we face—its complexity and scale. We must be honest about the need to compromise and about the lack of time that we, and Europe, have to come to an agreement on our withdrawal. Bridges stressed the need for a transition, which he suggested should run until the end of 2020, and he said the UK should continue to pay into the EU budget during this period. We should make it clear that we are willing to continue to contribute to the EU budget as we cross the bridge—in other words, between March 2019 and the end of 2020. That would help us to address the EU’s concern that our withdrawal blows a hole in its budget. We would be honouring commitments we have made for the rest of the EU’s budgetary period; the EU would then need to justify why we must contribute more than that. And he was gently scathing about May’s expressed wish for her government to be defined by something more than Brexit. He said: The challenge of creating a new partnership touches on every aspect of our lives, as we have been discussing. It is a gargantuan task; so, let us be honest about this too. I hear the government talk of not wishing to be defined by Brexit. Brexit is the biggest change this nation has faced since 1945. To say we do not wish to be defined by Brexit is like Winston Churchill saying in 1940 that he did not want his government to be defined by the war. Such careless talk costs time, as it allows the machinery of government to be distracted from the task at hand. As usual, I expect there will be a lot more Brexit here before the day is over. Here is the agenda for the day. 8am: Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, gives his 2017 state of the union speech in Brussels. Politico Europe is covering it on a live blog. According to Sky’s Faisal Islam, Brexit does not seem to feature. 9am: Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, gives a speech to a rail summit. 9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 3.30pm: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives evidence to the Commons environment committee. Around 1pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion saying the government should end the pay cap in the NHS. They will vote at around 4pm. Later there will be a debate on a Labour motion saying the government’s latest rise in university tuition fees should be scrapped. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Forman realised this wasn’t a good idea. The two nuisances were Andy Kaufman, long dead, and Tony Clifton, who never existed. Carrey, who claimed to not be there himself, was portraying them both in the 1998 biopic of Kaufman. He was so committed to method acting that he would only work “as Andy” or “as Tony”, which is annoying enough, but when you factor in that Kaufman and his creation Clifton were intentional agents of chaos, you can see how it could be a recipe for trouble. Carrey had a documentary crew follow him around during the production, and their footage has been sitting on a shelf for nearly 20 years. Knitting this footage together along with a present-day interview with a bearded, philosophical Carrey, director Chris Smith (American Movie) has all the elements of an inquiry into the madness behind fame, art, performance and the issue of when a joke has gone “too far”. He doesn’t quite succeed. But the consolation prize is that (hold on for this title) Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond – The Story of Jim Carey &amp; Andy Kaufman With a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton is an extremely watchable movie. It isn’t nearly as deep as it thinks it is, but it is marvellously entertaining. For a start, we get Carrey, today, speaking to us via interrotron and looking a lot like late-period Jim Morrison. At first, his recollection of his early career is lucid, but when he starts giving rich, psychoanalytical readings of his 90s comedies, and discussing how an artist has to live “up here” at all times, it’s clear that he’s gone a little off the rails. Unless he just wants us to think that… The material of him on set is unbelievable. Watch him annoy the hair and makeup people with loud music, watch him crash cars on the lot and trespass into Steven Spielberg’s office. Gaze on with wonder as this pompous and very talented clown refuses to answer to the name Jim. Co-star Danny DeVito thinks it’s funny but Judd Hirsch is just not having it. When Kaufman’s foe, wrestler Jerry Lawler, comes to set playing himself, all hell breaks loose. Carrey refuses to break character, and it results in an injury. (Maybe – who knows if any of this is real?) Forman looks exasperated, but Carrey is the star and if this is what Carrey sees as his process, Forman will have to put up with it. Carrey looks back on all this as if he’s got some pan-dimensional connection to Kaufman, and his seriousness is incredible. By the end of this documentary Carrey is so in awe at his own acting he suggests he could become anyone and have people believe it – even Jesus Christ. Smith offers no pushback, nor does he interview anyone else who was witness to all this. As such, it’s a Jim Carrey vanity piece, even if the actor comes off as – to quote a studio boss who wanted Carrey to stop filming – “an asshole”. Whether you agree with that assessment will depend on how much you buy what Carrey is selling. Jim and Andy: The Great Beyond is screening at the Toronto film festival with a release date yet to be announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/14/marriage-equality-opponents-have-spent-five-times-more-on-tv-ads-analyst-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality opponents have spent five times more on TV ads, analyst says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/14/marriage-equality-opponents-have-spent-five-times-more-on-tv-ads-analyst-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/14/marriage-equality-opponents-have-spent-five-times-more-on-tv-ads-analyst-says","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality opponents have spent five times more on TV ads, analyst says","bodyText":"Opponents of marriage equality have so far outspent the yes campaign by about five-to-one in television ads in the Australian same-sex marriage postal survey campaign, according to research by an advertising analytics firm. Ebiquity found the no campaign’s $312,000 and yes campaign’s $64,000 of TV ad spending is dwarfed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which has spent $1.7m on the campaign so far. Both the Coalition for Marriage and Equality campaigns claim their opponent has more cash, but the new figures draw into question the claim that the no side faces a “David and Goliath battle”, as Australian Christian Lobby director, Lyle Shelton, put it at the National Press Club on Wednesday. Ebiquity analysed free-to-air television ads in the five major metro markets (Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide) from the start of the postal survey process on 8 August until Tuesday, 12 September, when the ABS mailed out postal survey forms. The first partisan ad in the campaign was the no campaign’s ad linking same-sex marriage to gender education, on 29 August. The Coalition for Marriage spent $312,000 on the You Can So No campaign which warned that gender-diversity education programs would become “widespread and compulsory”. The Equality Campaign spent $64,000 on the Let’s Get it Done ads, featuring Ian Thorpe and other Australians walking to a post box to cast their vote, a campaign that began on 9 September. The figures do not capture the yes campaign response ad featuring doctor and same-sex marriage advocate Kerryn Phelps rebutting no campaign claims, because it ran only on Foxtel. The majority of the ABS’s $1.7m spend was on ads in August encouraging electoral enrolment to take part in the survey ($1.4m). Ebiquity director of client service for advertising, Aaron Rigby, said it was understandable the yes campaign was behind because its ads had started more recently but on total spending so far “it’s still a victory for the no [side]”. “We haven’t seen anything yet: I think we will start to see a spike in activity, now the postal votes are arriving in people’s post boxes ... and then a continuous flatline of spending throughout the [survey] period, with a final spike towards the end to convince those who haven’t voted,” he said. Rigby said the total ad spend could run into the millions of dollars, like a federal election campaign, but the postal survey campaigns will have fewer types of ads because they each try to convey a few, simple messages. Rigby described the Thorpe ad as “the best ad to date” because it “was bringing voters back to what the survey is about – marriage”. By comparison, he said the Coalition for Marriage was “a bit full-on” for making unrelated claims about gender education in schools. On Wednesday, Shelton said the Coalition for Marriage has “not taken money from evangelical churches in the [United States]” but it did not intend to disclose its donations. He referred to the Australian Financial Review’s report that the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, will make a personal donation to the yes side of $1m. “This is a David and Goliath battle,” Shelton said, and appealed for donations. Despite Joyce’s personal donation and the support of 600 corporations, those corporations have so far not made major donations to the Equality Campaign. Asked which campaign had more cash at the National Press Club last Wednesday, Australian Marriage Equality co-chair Janine Middleton said: “I know that our opponents try to paint us as Goliath but it is a bit more loaves and fishes if you want to stick to Bible stories.” Middleton said she may not know how much the opponents of marriage equality had to spend, but as chief operating officer she knew “how much is in our kitty”. Asked why corporations had not donated, Middleton said that corporations had a limited pool of funds for diversity and inclusion measures, making it “difficult for them to write a cheque”. Middleton said corporate fundraising was happening among LGBTI support groups and their straight allies. “I think that’s where the money will come as well as obviously from individual donors.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/13/rebel-wilson-defamation-payout-is-a-game-changer-for-gossip-magazines","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T07:45:17Z","webTitle":"Rebel Wilson defamation payout is a game-changer for gossip magazines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/13/rebel-wilson-defamation-payout-is-a-game-changer-for-gossip-magazines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/13/rebel-wilson-defamation-payout-is-a-game-changer-for-gossip-magazines","fields":{"headline":"Rebel Wilson defamation payout is a game-changer for gossip magazines","bodyText":"Rebel Wilson’s eye-watering record defamation payout of $4,567,472 will not only damage Bauer Media’s bottom line but will have an immediate impact on how celebrity gossip magazines operate in Australia, experts predict. Expect less shock pregnancies, divorces and affairs to be gracing the cover of your local supermarket mag – unless the celebrity has confirmed their veracity first. The Australian-born Hollywood star is not the first celebrity to sue the notorious supermarket mags. Bec Hewitt, the wife of tennis player Lleyton Hewitt, won a supreme court battle against New Idea over the source of a false story, although she decided not to sue for defamation. But Wilson is probably the first one prepared to risk ridicule and career damage by revealing just how hurtful the stories had been. “She was willing to talk about her career being in the doldrums which feels like a high risk strategy,” says Tim Burrowes, publisher of media industry site Mumbrella. “You don’t necessarily want to be telling the public how badly your career is doing. A lot of people do take the view ‘never complain, never explain’.” Stung by the fact that her hometown magazines had targeted her and perhaps aware of Australia’s tough defamation laws, Wilson played to win, taking on 40 stories which variously accused her of lying about her age, real name and childhood. She said she had lost roles because of the portrayal of her as a serial liar. Bauer was so confident it couldn’t lose it chose not to pay a relatively small out-of-court settlement of $200,000. Now they must not only shell out millions – but reassess their entire publishing strategy for their already struggling magazines, Woman’s Day, Australian Women’s Weekly, New Weekly and OK! Bauer has to wait to find out the full bill, with interest and costs yet to be determined. Mark Pearson, professor of journalism and social media at Griffith University, believes the case will shake up an industry that trades on gossip. “As much as I’d prefer for free speech reasons that people didn’t sue media organisations, I think this sends a loud message to those trading in untrue gossip that there are legal avenues available to plaintiffs,” Pearson told Guardian Australia. “While international celebrities may seem easy targets of false gossip under American law, these same celebrities can sue in Australia under much tougher defamation laws. And all of these celebrities do have a reputation in Australia, and some might feel they wish to defend it. This is especially the case with those with an Australian connection, with families and colleagues and the place where they most cherish their reputation.” The global reach of the internet played its part too. In June a six-person jury found in favour of Wilson’s claim against the publisher of Woman’s Day and the Australian Women’s Weekly and in the supreme court in Melbourne on Wednesday, Justice John Dixon said Wilson’s suffering warranted a “substantial” payment. “The jury found each of the articles was defamatory, and rejected the defendants’ triviality defences,” the judge wrote in his judgment. “The sting was serious, likely to be injurious and understood as such by the defendants prior to publication. I do not accept that the articles were published for a local Australian audience. The internet cannot be so classified. ” Wilson promised to give her windfall to charity. Among the responses yesterday was a commonly-expressed comparison of her windfall compared with the compensation ordinary people receive when they are victims of corporate greed or institutional abuse. Pearson, an expert in media law, said Australia didn’t have the toughest defamation laws but they are closer to the British system than the American one and celebrities could take advantage of that. “The big difference is that for public figures like these, the American media can publish falsities about them as long as it can’t be proven that they acted with malice, that they went out to do a character assassination,” Pearson said. “But in Australia it’s the reverse, if you damage someone’s reputation in Australia you have to have a defence of either public interest or something related to truth, which you have to prove. “So salacious, false gossip is indefensible in Australia if you damage someone’s reputation. Despite any free speech values I might have I think it’s good that a message is sent against this trade that calls itself journalism but is far removed from fundamental journalism ethics.” Andrew Mercado, a writer for Mediaweek, said the magazines had been “stretching the truth more than they used to” since the advent of the internet. “They can’t get an exclusive anymore so they make something up,” Mercado said. “This will be a huge wake-up call to them all. Rebel knew those magazines and felt aggrieved that the local press was making up stuff about her. Those magazines are already starting to struggle, most people are waking up to the fact that they are full of fabrication. The writing is on the wall for them.” “Clearly it sends a signal that there are consequences for telling stories you can’t prove to be true and of course for a long time the supermarket end of the market magazines have been willing to tell the most entertaining story rather then the most truthful,” Burrowes said. Nene King, a former editor of Woman’s Day and the first female board member of Kerry Packer’s company Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, says the judgment is a game changer for the industry in 2017 and will make editors take stock. “I would be very nervous if I was an editor today because I’d be thinking ‘who is going to turn up next’?”, says King, who writes a column for Pacific Magazines’ New Idea. “I think it will make the editors really think about not putting Nicole Kidman on the cover one week pregnant, then the next week breaking up with Keith Urban and then pregnant again in the third week. “If I was still editing I would take a good hard look in which direction we would go with our news stories. It’s the news stories that are the killers. In my day the stories that we ran were true.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2017/sep/14/david-squires-on-the-w-leagues-new-pay-deal","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ... the W-League's new pay deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2017/sep/14/david-squires-on-the-w-leagues-new-pay-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2017/sep/14/david-squires-on-the-w-leagues-new-pay-deal","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on ... the W-League's new pay deal","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/13/australian-welfare-recipients-spend-proportionately-less-on-alcohol-abs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T06:46:40Z","webTitle":"Australian welfare recipients spend proportionately less on alcohol – ABS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/australian-welfare-recipients-spend-proportionately-less-on-alcohol-abs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/australian-welfare-recipients-spend-proportionately-less-on-alcohol-abs","fields":{"headline":"Australian welfare recipients spend proportionately less on alcohol – ABS","bodyText":"Welfare recipients spend proportionally less of their total spending on alcohol than all other Australians, new figures show. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released its six-yearly household expenditure statistics on Wednesday, providing an insight into the weekly spending habits of Australians. It showed more than half of expenditure on goods and services goes towards the basics, including food, energy, health, transport, and housing. The average Australian spent about $846 out of their total $1,425 expenditure on basics each week, up from 56% in 1984 to 59% in 2015-16. Housing is now the largest cost for Australian households, jumping from 13% in 1984 to 20% in 2015-16. Food accounted for 17% of household expenditure, while transport was 15%. The data provides an insight into the spending habits of households that list government pensions and allowances as their main source of income. It shows households relying on welfare spend just 1.8% of their total spending on alcohol, which is lower than other households by about 0.4 percentage points. Welfare recipients spend more of their weekly household income on housing costs (22.3%) and food and non-alcohol beverages (19.5%) than other groups, although they spend less on transport. In the past six years, the biggest spending increases across all Australian households were in education, energy, healthcare, and housing. Spending on footwear, alcohol, tobacco and clothing did not change noticeably, the ABS said. The data also showed the extent of financial stress had reduced slightly. It showed 15% of all Australian households were reporting four or more indicators of financial stress, down from 16% in 2009-10. Low-wealth households, or those in the lowest 20%, were spending a much higher proportion of their income on housing. Housing costs accounted for 30% of low-wealth households’ total spending, compared with 14% for high-wealth households. Only 5% of low-wealth households owned their own home, compared with 96% of high-wealth groups. ABS chief economist Bruce Hockman said the data showed households’ spending had changed considerably over the decade. “In 1984, the largest contributors to household spending were food (20%), then transport (16%) and housing (13%),” he said. “Jump forward to 2015-16, and housing is now the largest contributor (20%), followed by food (17%) and transport costs (15%).”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/13/steve-bannon-heaps-praise-on-xi-jinping-during-stalking-horse-hong-kong-trip","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T03:36:58Z","webTitle":"Steve Bannon heaps praise on Xi Jinping during 'stalking horse' Hong Kong trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/13/steve-bannon-heaps-praise-on-xi-jinping-during-stalking-horse-hong-kong-trip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/13/steve-bannon-heaps-praise-on-xi-jinping-during-stalking-horse-hong-kong-trip","fields":{"headline":"Steve Bannon heaps praise on Xi Jinping during 'stalking horse' Hong Kong trip","bodyText":"A “very aggressive” Donald Trump will jet into China in November seeking to thrash out a revolutionised relationship that could avert a trade war between the world’s top two economies, Steve Bannon has said. “I believe we can avoid a trade war, which is detrimental to both countries,” the US president’s controversial former chief strategist told Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post during a visit to the former British colony. “We have to somehow reach an agreement.” On the eve of his trip to the Asian financial hub, where he gave a keynote speech at an investors’ forum thrown by a Hong Kong brokerage with close ties to Beijing, Bannon painted a wretched picture of US-China relations. “A hundred years from now, this is what they’ll remember: what we did to confront China on its rise to world domination,” the 63-year-old Breitbart News chairman told the New York Times, comparing China to pre-Nazi Germany. “China right now is Germany in 1930,” he warned. “It’s on the cusp. It could go one way or the other.” But on Tuesday Bannon struck a softer note, declaring that he had “never been an anti-China guy”. “The conflict [between China and the US] is not preordained. It can be avoided if we work together,” he told the South China Morning Post. Bannon also heaped praise on China’s authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, who is about to celebrate five years in power at a major Communist party congress in Beijing. “I don’t think there’s a world leader that President Trump respects more than the president of China,” he told investors, according to Bloomberg, pointing to “a great affinity between our two countries”. “Xi is very impressive,” Bannon added in his interview with the South China Morning Post. “He really understands what’s in the best interests of his people … He is very smart, very tough but fair. He is direct and to the point – just like President Trump. That is why they like each other so much.” In a second interview, Bannon said he believed the two leaders would be able to strike a deal: “You have a very aggressive president [Trump]. But I think they’ll reach some sort of accommodation,” he told Daily Mail Online. Orville Schell, the head of the centre on US-China relations at New York’s Asia Society, said Bannon – though no longer the president’s chief strategist – appeared to be acting as “Trump’s stalking horse”, using the Hong Kong trip to send signals to China’s leaders ahead of Trump’s anticipated visit there in mid-November. Schell said that having failed to pass any significant legislation at home or secure a breakthrough on North Korea, Trump was now “rather urgently in need of a deal”. “Here is a man who has proclaimed himself to be the deal-maker of all deal-makers and he’s got no deals made … He’s got nothing, literally nothing to show. One supreme court judge.” Determined to change that, Schell predicted Trump would come to China seeking a “meeting of the minds” with Xi; “a monumental sort of arrangement” between the two powers was even on the cards that might see the Chinese make concessions on North Korea and the US give ground on issues such as the South China Sea and trade. “It’s not extremely likely but it is not unthinkable,” Schell said. Bannon certainly appeared to be teeing up such a deal in Hong Kong. According to the South China Morning Post, he suggested a stable trade relationship between Washington and Beijing could help the two sides manage their differences over “other potential conflict points such as North Korea and the South China Sea”. “This is different from the cold war. We are clearly competitors but we can work out the issues between us,” he said. Those comments, which one commentator called “a love letter to authoritarianism”, stood in stark contrast to Bannon’s previous declarations on China. “To me the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,” Bannon told the liberal American Prospect magazine last month on the eve of his removal from the White House. Last year Bannon said he had “no doubt” that within the next decade the US and China would go to war in the South China Sea. Schell said Bannon’s mixed messages on China – combative one day, conciliatory the next – were very much in line with Trump’s modus operandi. “In extremis, you play both sides of the equation which enables you to go either way. You can either turn Xi into Hitler or he is your next big best friend. “That is what Bannon is starting to cue up: a recognition that Trump is transactional. That he’d like to make a deal or he could be enemies.” The message to China’s president was unmissable: “Take your pick.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/13/republicans-hillary-clinton-vanish","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Republicans want Hillary Clinton to vanish.

We can't let that happen","bodyText":"The fight over Hillary Clinton’s continued presence in public life is about more than her “likeability” or the fissures in the Democratic party. Clinton attracts such vitriol because she stands at the place where two conflicting political ideologies clash. Republicans today control all branches of the federal government and are poised to put their ideology of radical individualism into reality. But at this very moment of their apparent triumph, Americans are rejecting the Republican vision and demanding instead an active government that promotes the general welfare. It is a major political realignment, and women are key to it. The extremism of the Trump administration has galvanized women to push back against the political system that has disadvantaged them for a generation. Clinton is the symbol of this political nexus. Hated, dismissed, and denigrated for a quarter of a century, she nevertheless remains smart, able, popular … and, crucially, will not be silenced. Clinton’s politics are a threat to the ideology of the modern Republican party, but so is her presence on the public stage. Clinton maintains that the government must expand its protections for children and families, and make it possible for men and women of all backgrounds to prosper. She sees the nation as an interdependent community – a village, one might say – overseen by a government that advances the interests of all. In essence, Clinton is calling for the expansion of the New Deal state. It is an inclusive vision; it assumes that government policies should treat all Americans equally. Since the 1930s, a majority of Americans has agreed. But the modern Republican party does not. It wants to destroy the New Deal state. Republican leaders loathe government regulation and the taxes required to fund the social welfare programs and infrastructure that people like Clinton support. Since the 1950s, extremist Republicans have warned that such government activism amounts to socialism. In its stead, they promise to slash government and restore rugged American individualism. But their vision of individualism is not Clinton’s inclusive one, and this is why her public presence makes her particularly irritating. Their vision privileges white heterosexual men as the only significant actors in American life. White men are the cowboys, the heroes, the silent majority, the middle Americans, the forgotten men, the Trump voters, who work hard and want nothing from government. In contrast to them, Republicans argue, are minorities, organized workers, and women, who demand government policies that can only be paid for with tax dollars sucked from white men. In this vision, the government must protect the true American individualist, the hardworking white heterosexual man who orders his affairs as he sees fit without interference from the government. In the individualist ideology, a man is responsible for his wife and children. This relegates women to domestic roles as wives and mothers protected by their menfolk, or silences them as special interest harpies demanding government benefits that will destroy individualist men. “Family values” advocates like Phyllis Schlafly insisted that women who wanted to work outside the home and who wanted federal social policy – women like Hillary Clinton – were undermining the individualist vision. In 1970, Time Magazine noted that “a surprisingly large number” of conservatives blamed the era’s crises on “the fact that so many mothers have gone to work.” Ronald Reagan rose to power with his image of the Welfare Queen who gamed the welfare system to live in luxury, and by 1984, when Walter Mondale tapped New York congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro to be his vice-president, 60% of voters thought he did so not because she was well qualified (she was) but because he was under pressure from women’s groups who wanted government benefits. As Schlafly put it when she vehemently opposed an exemption for poor families in the 1986 tax reform act, such an exemption was “anti-growth” and thus “anti-family” by definition. By 1987, Rush Limbaugh was electrifying radio audiences with his diatribes against “femi-nazis” who wanted to harness the government to their own deranged interests. In 1996, when Clinton advanced the argument that it takes a village to raise a child, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole retorted that it does not take a village, “it takes a family.” The government’s job, according to modern Republicans, is not the protection of equal opportunity for all Americans, but rather the protection of male breadwinners. This ideology has stripped away the identities of American women as independent actors in favor of their idealized roles as wives and mothers. Since 1980, women’s economic security has been erased, their control over their own reproductive health weakened and their public voices silenced as government policy has increasingly shored up the power of white men. Now, President Trump has laid bare exactly what it means to have the ultimate individualist in charge of government. He is openly destroying the government’s protections for most Americans and using it for his own benefit. And he boasts of dominating women. But women are fighting back. Hillary Clinton’s refusal to go quietly away is a potent reminder that her vision of American government, a vision that defends opportunity for all and accords woman an independent role in American society, is mounting a powerful challenge to the Republican vision. American women are rejecting both Trump and the Republican system he epitomizes. January’s Women’s March was the biggest protest in American history. Women so swamped town halls that Republicans refused to continue holding them: “Women are in my grill no matter where I go,” Virginia congressman Dave Brat complained in January. Women are calling their representatives. They are organizing, and they are running for office. And in their refusal to be silenced, Clinton herself has become a symbol. Women note that Clinton was the most qualified presidential candidate in American history, that she endured Trump’s debate stalking and taunts that she is a “nasty woman,” and that she is now being told to sit down and shut up while former losing presidential candidates were welcome to pontificate.

The trial involved drug testing 5,000 welfare recipients at three trial sites in south-western Sydney, Mandurah in Western Australia and Logan in Queensland. Those who fail will first be placed on income management. A second failed test would see the individual referred for treatment and forced to cover the costs of their tests. If they fail to engage in treatment, they risk financial punishment, including the loss of welfare. A broad range of experts and frontline drug workers have condemned the plan. They say taking a punitive approach to addiction – a health issue – has failed in the past. Experts have also warned it will drive vulnerable people away from the welfare system to avoid testing, increasing the risk of homelessness and crime. The head of the largest youth drug treatment program, Matt Noffs, said the approach takes Australia’s drug policy back decades, to the Reagan-era “just say no” approach to drugs. He said it would lead more people into drug dealing to support their addiction. “That’s why this is a stupid, stupid idea that is not based on evidence but is based on someone not looking at the literature and pretending they have the answers,” Noffs said last month. Palmer aired similar concerns. He said those who would be hurt the most were people with serious, rather than social, drug use problems. That was a group who had significant co-morbidities, including mental health issues, a history of abuse, or homelessness. He said it would damage people who were hanging on to life “by the skin of their teeth” already. “In almost every case, and I’ve eyeballed quite a lot of these people over the last 15 years, and had some pretty sad conversations with them... you listen to their experiences in life and you well understand why they finish up where they are,” Palmer said. “They are the people least able to change their behaviour patterns to suit a government regulation process, they’re not going to be able to. You can’t turn on and turn off the use of drugs, like a recreational or social user may be able to, to get around the requirement.” Other measures contained in the government’s welfare reforms include changes to the compliance regime for jobseekers, cuts to a bereavement allowance and the abolishment of wife pension payments for about 200 women living overseas. The bill also removes “intent to claim provisions”, which protect people who are entitled to welfare but are unable to lodge a full claim due to personal circumstances. The chances of the bill passing the Senate remain unclear. Labor and the Greens oppose it. The Nick Xenophon Team has expressed concerns about the welfare drug testing aspect but is negotiating “in good faith” with the government. The government has maintained the measure is a trial only and will be assessed for its effectiveness. The social services minister, Christian Porter, said nothing like the measure had been tried before. The human services minister, Alan Tudge, said the scheme would drive behavioural change, reduce drug use and increase prospects of employment. Palmer said he understood the good intentions of the policy. But he said it seemed “pretty stark” that it would only hurt already vulnerable people. “To use a punitive approach to a problem that is really a very deep social one, for which there are very many causes ... can’t do anything, in my view, other than aggravate an already serious problem,” he said. He said there was a real risk of driving people into crime to support their addictions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/14/mary-shelley-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T14:58:45Z","webTitle":"Mary Shelley review – sturdy literary biopic fails to resurrect spirit of author","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/14/mary-shelley-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/14/mary-shelley-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","fields":{"headline":"Mary Shelley review – sturdy literary biopic fails to resurrect spirit of author","bodyText":"The story of an 18-year-old woman writing one of the world’s most defining horror novels is a tantalizing proposition, and a quick scan of Mary Shelley’s exhaustive Wikipedia page clues one into an unconventional origins tale. But in this faithful new drama, named after the author, there’s a dogged, and perhaps lazy, belief that merely reciting the details will be enough, an added spark never quite arriving in tow. Mary (Elle Fanning) is a wayward teen spending more time reading scary literature than helping out with chores back at home. She clashes with stepmother Mary Jane (Joanne Froggatt) but shares a warm relationship with stepsister Claire (Bel Powley) and father William Godwin (Stephen Dillane), a renowned political philosopher and novelist. She also shares a strident streak with her late mother, the forward-thinking feminist Mary Wollstonecraft. When Mary encounters handsome and rebellious poet Percy Shelley (Douglas Booth), her life takes a dramatic turn that takes her across Europe, encountering love, betrayal, tragedy and, ultimately, inspiration. As the English language debut of Haifaa Al-Mansour, the first woman to ever shoot a Saudi Arabian feature film – the acclaimed comedy Wadjda – there’s something respectable and sturdy about Mary Shelley. Fanning is a convincing actor, no matter what the role, and she puts in a solid turn here, vulnerable yet feisty, romantic yet rational, and we can understand her internal processing of the events that led her to write Frankenstein. In familiar period territory, there’s also an interesting focus on a side of early 19th-century society we don’t often get to see: raucous, hard-drinking teenage debauchery. Throughout there’s a debate over the efficacy of an open relationship and there’s a loose, freewheeling attitude towards sexuality. But the film stops short when it could go much further. There’s an overwhelming politeness, an awareness that this will be aimed at an audience who still prefer their costume dramas to be family-friendly. It means then certain elements are sanitized, such as the character of Lord Byron whose bisexuality is hinted at but never explored, and the sex scenes, which are suggested rather than visible. As the other two members of the party, Booth and Powley acquit themselves well enough but as with Fanning, they’re hampered by a script that offers mere surface characterization and some clunky dialogue. While the intricacies of their swinging sexual relationships prove intriguing, they end up dominating so much of the film that the far more interesting story surrounding the creation and controversial ownership of Frankenstein feels like something of an afterthought. Shelley’s mistreatment by the literary elite because of her gender is a compelling, uniquely frustrating element and the film deprives us of the suitably grand exploration that it deserves. It’s a long film but at times, it feels like it could have benefited from the extended structure of a mini-series. Mary Shelley is a diverting enough biopic that features decent performances through an often vivid lens, but given the unusual facts of the author’s life, a far more offbeat and far less rigid film could have been made here. Shelley’s fascination with the macabre and her progressive feminist ideals feel at odds with such a conventionally told tale. Al-Mansour has all of the pieces but she doesn’t quite bring her film to life. Mary Shelley is screening at the Toronto film festival with a release date yet to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/12/barcelona-juventus-champions-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T22:13:02Z","webTitle":"Leo Messi’s two goals gives Barcelona perfect start against Juventus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/12/barcelona-juventus-champions-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/12/barcelona-juventus-champions-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leo Messi’s two goals gives Barcelona perfect start against Juventus","bodyText":"Pessimism was pushed aside on the night that Barcelona returned to the Champions League and took revenge on the team that dumped them out of the competition last year. It is five months since Juventus beat them 3-0 in Turin; four weeks since Gerard Piqué admitted that, for the first time, he felt inferior to Real Madrid; and two weeks since the transfer window closed, with Neymar in Paris and Philippe Coutinho still on Merseyside. The talk was of crisis and outside the stadium on Tuesday night they were collecting signatures to force a vote of no confidence in the president, Josep Maria Bartomeu. But it was a different story inside when two goals from Leo Messi and one from Ivan Rakitic gave Barcelona the perfect start. Since that 5-1 aggregate defeat against Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup, Barcelona have played four times. Their record now reads: four wins, 12 goals scored, none conceded. The Italians were without six of the men who defeated them last season it is true, but this was still three goals and still Juventus.More importantly, this is still Barcelona. Neymar has gone but Messi is still there and he has already eight goals this season. Neymar’s replacement, Ousmane Dembélé, helped create the opening goal and offered glimpses of his contribution to come. At right-back, José Semedo is not Dani Alves, but he impressed. And under Ernesto Valverde, Andrés Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Rakitic look like what they once were. It would be tempting to say that the centre of gravity is the midfield again, and there may be something in that, but the real centre of gravity remains Messi. So often at the start of the moves, he was at the end of them too. His was the opening goal, just before half-time, and his second was the last. In between them, he made the second. The first came when the ball was clipped towards Dembélé who, back to goal, controlled and turned away from his markers. The pitch opened up before him and Messi to his left. The Argentinian exchanged passes with Luis Suárez on the edge of the area and guided the ball into the far corner. One of the few men to have resisted him was defeated at last: in their forth meeting, this was the Argentinian’s first goal against Gigi Buffon. The goal arrived at the very end of the half and underlined one of the ways Barcelona’s new front three may operate. So far Ernesto Valverde has shown little desire to simply slot Dembélé into the left-sided position vacated by Neymar. Instead, he began slightly to the right with Suárez central and Messi dropping to start moves or coming from deeper – and that was how this had arrived. Dembélé had looked quick and occasionally excited, a shot high and wide after a mistake from Mattia De Sciglio’s mistake the half’s best opportunity. He drew appreciative applause a handful of times, beginning in the opening minutes, and was withdrawn to applause, yet he tended to run out of room. At that point Iniesta, all smooth movement and covering a lot of ground, was the man who stood out most and the ball was Barcelona’s. Juventus did not appear concerned at ceding possession, incisive when they broke, Marc-André ter Stegen making a handful of mostly routine saves. But the game soon escaped them. Paulo Dybala’s shot at the beginning of the second half flew over the bar and then, soon after, Messi smashed one off a post. Suárez then played him in on the right a few minutes later. Racing into the area, Messi pulled across the six-yard box and although Stefano Sturaro cleared from near the line Rakitic followed up to score. There was more. Iniesta found Messi on the right and he came inside superbly, past two men to score the third."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/12/papillon-review-prison-break-remake-plays-it-too-safe-for-redemption","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T22:48:33Z","webTitle":"Papillon review - prison break remake plays it too safe for redemption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/12/papillon-review-prison-break-remake-plays-it-too-safe-for-redemption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/12/papillon-review-prison-break-remake-plays-it-too-safe-for-redemption","fields":{"headline":"Papillon review - prison break remake plays it too safe for redemption","bodyText":"Why are there so many bad remakes of good movies? It’s a fair enough question. When dealing with a text that has already proven itself functional, it takes an active effort to make it worse. The path of least resistance would lead somewhere agreeable if not extraordinary, perhaps not matching the given source’s greatness but at least managing a respectable measure of success. Merely by achieving and then exceeding base competence, Michael Noer’s handsome new rendition of the 1973 film Papillon (itself an adaptation of one unusually determined French prisoner’s 1969 memoir) puts the innumerable lifeless resuscitations of memorable properties currently clogging multiplexes on notice. Noer makes not bungling excellent material look like a relatively simple task: hire some good actors, make it look appealing, stick to what worked with the original, and you should be good to go, right? While his final product may be an imitation of the Dalton Trumbo-scripted genuine article, it’s not an especially pale one. Noer’s turned out a fine film in its own right, and political developments in the decades since the last adaptation have even lent the script a newfound significance. The story may not have changed, but the world into which it’s getting released sure has. Multilingual readers have likely already identified the film’s title as the French word for “butterfly”, a symbol of freedom and hope to the Parisian jailbird who also claims the word as his nickname. Papi (Charlie Hunnam, all skin and muscle and bared teeth), as he’s known to his buddies, comes into the film hot off a big safe-cracking score, and one wrong move later, he’s framed for murder and shipped off to a remote penal colony in French Guiana. He doesn’t intend on sticking around for too long, however, and promptly allies himself with odd bird Louis Dega (a vaguely narcotized Rami Malek). An accomplished forger, the wealthy Dega has smuggled a wad of bills into the prison through what we’ll call intimate means, and Papi offers his protection for enough cash to bribe his way through a daring escape. The game is set. What follows is a solidly acted and attractively shot prison-break narrative, freighted with all the tragedy and triumph that the mini-genre can muster. Papi is stubborn, a virtue that energizes him on his long and weary path to salvation. The sadistic warden of the prison facility takes it upon himself to break Papi, and while his upper lip definitely un-stiffens after a few horrifying years spent in solitary confinement, he defiantly refuses to be cowed. He’s locked in a brutalizing game where freedom is constantly yanked away from him every time he begins to catch his breath. It’s frustrating, which is a good thing in this instance – the torturous closeness of liberation makes the audience share in Papi’s plight. Buoying his spirits is his flowering friendship with Dega, an eccentric thoroughly unfit for the exacting conditions of their environment. Their bond forms slowly, vulcanized by mutual self-sacrifice in high stakes moments. While Hunnam sure ain’t Steve McQueen, and Malek really, really ain’t Dustin Hoffman, the pair take care not to overplay their sentimental hand, allowing a camaraderie to take shape while both men keep one another at a distinctly macho distance. To a modern crowd, the film doubles as a valiant argument against privatization. The warden only gets away with the cruelest and most unusual abuses of fundamental dignity through a total lack of oversight due to their remote location. The slave labor that prisoners are forced to perform, the routine humiliations, and the recreational violence feel a bit more pointed in our era of heightened consciousness about the insidious prison-industrial complex. Any criticisms are far from searing, but it’s an engaging side concern nonetheless. The film’s merits (which, sadly, do not include originality) are self-evident. Hunnam and Malek both hold up their end of the deal. Noer, for his part, meets them halfway by conjuring golden-hued beauty for the jungle surroundings and a due griminess for the danker chambers of their holding compound. He doesn’t overcomplicate things for himself, keeping the clunky dialogue to a minimum and focusing on the guiding light of Papi’s indomitable willpower."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/13/brexit-wont-solve-issues-that-led-to-leave-vote-says-mark-price-ex-trade-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T07:24:27Z","webTitle":"Brexit won't solve issues that led to leave vote, says ex-trade minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/13/brexit-wont-solve-issues-that-led-to-leave-vote-says-mark-price-ex-trade-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/13/brexit-wont-solve-issues-that-led-to-leave-vote-says-mark-price-ex-trade-minister","fields":{"headline":"Brexit won't solve issues that led to leave vote, says ex-trade minister","bodyText":"Mark Price, who quit as a government trade minister a fortnight ago, has warned that Brexit will not solve the day-to-day problems that led people to vote to leave the EU, but instead will make them worse. Lord Price said he was deeply worried that the UK was set to be distracted by Brexit for years rather than addressing the deep underlying problems that led to the vote. It is the first time the trade minister appointed by David Cameron and reappointed by Theresa May has spoken since his resignation. Price, a former managing director of Waitrose, was due to pilot the government’s free trade bill through the House of Lords in the spring, but said he was not prepared to make the four-year commitment required to make a success of devising a new trade policy for the UK outside the EU. Speaking to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association conference, he said he regarded the Brexit vote “as a symptom of people’s concerns about their day-to-day problems. Brexit will not solve those problems.” Price said: “I think the country is going to be even more disrupted and even more subject to competitive pressures.” The causes of the public’s discontent were issues such as the digitalisation of clerical jobs, outsourcing of labour, wages being depressed and migrant labour: “All of these things don’t get better with Brexit; in fact, if anything, they get worse.” He said overall, the advent of a new digital age would turn the migration debate into a red herring. “In a digital age the debate is how do we take labour out, put technology in – all to reduce costs. “No outcome from Brexit is going to solve those fundamental problems. Brexit is Brexit, but what are we going to do as a country to make sure it is not distracted and solves fundamental problems so that in two years’ time we don’t say: ‘My business is doing no better, public spending is not any greater, I feel under more pressure in my job than I did before, there is more technology in my job than when I protested six months before’?” Price said he did not see any way back from the referendum vote, but said the only two viable solutions for the UK were to remain fully within the EU, including the single market, or to leave altogether and negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. He said on the basis of speaking to 16 trade ministers, “there is no compromise”. “I am now pretty committed to the fact that you cannot go back and therefore we have to think about how we make sure we have the most sustainable economy and society,” he said. The former minister added: “Brexit is the biggest task facing the country since the second world war. But I think Brexit is a symptom of something else. I think that people voted the way that they did because they wanted to see change. Whether it is Trump in America, Macron in France or Brexit, people are choosing to vote for someone who they think will solve their practical day-to-day issues. In my view Brexit will not solve them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/13/we-shouldnt-look-to-russia-for-how-to-treat-problematic-history-and-its-statues","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T06:33:08Z","webTitle":"We shouldn't look to Russia for how to treat problematic history and its statues | Jeff Sparrow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/13/we-shouldnt-look-to-russia-for-how-to-treat-problematic-history-and-its-statues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/13/we-shouldnt-look-to-russia-for-how-to-treat-problematic-history-and-its-statues","fields":{"headline":"We shouldn't look to Russia for how to treat problematic history and its statues","bodyText":"“This is what Stalin did.” As many people have pointed out, Malcolm Turnbull’s response to the campaign against Australia’s colonial statues could not have been more maladroit. You could not think of another leader as committed to public statuary as Stalin, a man who constructed monuments in every population centre under Soviet control specifically to promote a particular version of history. That’s why, in 1991, as the communist coup collapsed, the people of Moscow drew – like the activists protesting against Captain Cook – a direct connection between the commemoration of the past and the control of the present. A mob gathered in Lubyanka Square in the Meshchansky District, outside the notorious headquarters of the secret police. The crowd attacked the huge sculpture of “Iron” Felix Dzerzhinsky (the founder of the KGB’s precursor, the Cheka), pulling at it with such determination that the mayor eventually organised the fire service to remove the work without crushing anyone. Fire fighters carted the Dzerzhinsky statue away and dumped it by the river, where it joined a growing pile of discarded Soviet monuments from all over Moscow. That was the genesis of what became the “graveyard of fallen heroes” – originally an ad hoc display of socialist realist art that remained in the Muzeon park of arts simply because no-one knew what else to do with it. In the years since 1991, the original monuments have been supplemented with other work – some of it political, some of it not – in an outdoor sculpture park complementing the art in the nearby Tretyakov Gallery. I travelled to Moscow last year, researching a book on the American singer and actor Paul Robeson. Like so many other tourists, I went to the garden by the Moskva specifically to see the monuments through which the regime had once defined itself. It was winter and the falling snow softened even the most imperious of the statues, so that I couldn’t, at first, distinguish the Stalinist relics from the art added in later years. But then I found a giant, kitsch representation of the dictator himself, its pink stone smashed from the hammer blows that demonstrators had rained down on the man of steel’s mustachioed face. The huge Stalin now stood near an image of the dissident Andrei Sakharov and alongside a work entitled “Victims of Totalitarian Regimes”: a wire cage containing sculpted granite heads. On the pathway, a notice explained in Russian and English: “This work is historically and culturally significant, being the memorial construction of the Soviet era, on the theme of politics and ideology.” Similar signposts accompanied all of the representations of Lenin, of Kalinin, of Sverdlov and the other greater and lesser regime luminaries, with the iconography of the Soviet state deliberately juxtaposed with work by dissidents and non-party artists. The cumulative effect stripped the Stalinist art of its authority, presenting the statues as instances of a particular genre within the broader field of Russia sculpture. The traces of protest still visible on the stone accentuated that impression of monuments emanating from a political and aesthetic project that had failed, a discredited artistic moment whose historic time had passed. On the base of the Dzerzhinsky statue, for instance, I could make out a spray painted slogan, a reminder of the sentiment that had banished Iron Felix to the park all those years ago. In the ongoing debate about America’s confederate monuments, US commentators have pointed to Moscow as an example of how art commemorating a problematic history might be treated. “It isn’t difficult,” writes Radley Balko, “to imagine a similar park where a statute of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis or Nathan Bedford Forrest might stand in front of a monument to victims of lynching.” James Glazer agrees. Discussing the “graveyard of fallen heroes”, he writes: “The statues in their old lives were meant to honor and glorify the Soviet leaders and their regime. In their new life, they have been turned into art. As pieces of art, their meaning can be changed or supplemented by how the viewer interprets them.” As the park signs make clear, the sculptures retain both a cultural value (as pre-eminent examples of socialist realism) and a historic value (as once significant public monuments). On both counts, their preservation is worth celebrating. Nevertheless, the lessons from Moscow are complicated, perhaps more so than one might first think. Coming to terms with the symbols of the past might be necessary but the graveyard of fallen heroes shows that it’s by no means sufficient. On that same visit, I spoke with Alexandra Polivanova, a researcher with the group Memorial, which was dedicated to uncovering the crimes of the Stalin era. There remained, she told me, mass graves throughout the city. “Some of them are very easy to identify. We have documents. But it’s not simple in Moscow to start archaeological research. We can say that we know where they are, but we cannot prove it.” The problem was that the archives were still sealed. The Russian regime didn’t want an honest accounting of past atrocities because any such investigation would diminish the authority of the contemporary state. “They [ie the government] don’t have an ideological position at all,” she said. “They only have a pragmatic attitude to survive and conserve their power. When they need the church, they cultivate the church; when they need Stalin, they talk about Stalin as a great manager and general. Then, when they feel that that could be too much for an international audience, they say something about democratic values.” A comparison with Germany illustrates the problem. In Berlin, the authorities have transformed the former headquarters of the Gestapo into a museum known as “The Topography of Terror”. In Moscow, the Memorial museum uses that name for its project documenting the location of Stalinist prisons, torture chambers, execution grounds and the like. The sites in Memorial’s “Topography of Terror” map radiate out from the Lubyanka, the huge building where the Dzerzhinsky monument once stood. But unlike the Gestapo facility, the Lubyanka hasn’t become a museum. On the contrary, it’s still operated by Putin’s federal security service, the successor of the KGB. The removal of the Stalin statues wasn’t, in other words, accompanied by any deeper engagement with history. In his book, Warped Mourning, Alexander Etkind argues that Russia remains haunted by its brutal past, a ghostly and often unrecognised presence in the public sphere and the marketplace. He gives the example of the 500-ruble banknote printed from 1995 until 2011 with a depiction of the majestic Solovetsky monastery. The particular image chosen shows the cathedral topped by wooden pyramids – a detail that means the note actually depicts the building as it was in the 1920s and the 1930s, when it served as barracks for a giant prison camp. “Whether millions of Russians are aware of this or not,” Etkind writes, “it is the mournful image of the Soviet gulag that they carry in their wallets, touch, handle, glance at and exchange daily.” In that sense, the graveyard of fallen heroes obscures the lack of a real accountability. As Etkind says: “We do not have anything like a full list of victims; we do not have anything like a full list of executioners; and we do not have adequate memorials, museums and monuments which could stabilize the understanding of these events for generations to come.” Not surprisingly, there’s no longer any consensus about the Stalin-era statues and their meaning. A recent survey by the state-backed VTsIOM polling group suggested that 62% of Russians agreed that “plaques, busts, [and] paintings that talk about the success of Stalin should be put in public places” and 65% opposed “erecting signs talking about his failures and crimes.” A similar study by the Pew Research Centre in July this year found that 58% of adult Russians now see Stalin’s historical role in either a “very” or “mostly” positive light. Multiple attempts have even been made to return the Dzerzhinsky monument to its old position outside the Lubyanka, with one poll from 2013 suggesting that 45% of Russians wanted the sculpture restored – and only 25% strongly opposed. “Have we not fingered the foulest wounds and left them unhealed by our hands?” asks Anna Akhmatova, the great poet of the terror years. Akhmatova’s image of old cruelties infecting the present suggests the need for historical healing that goes beyond the removal of a few statues. But even that’s not enough. For, fairly obviously, the rehabilitation of Stalin also reflects the population’s disillusionment with the free market reforms introduced with such devastating effect in the nineties. As the euphoria of 1991 gradually evaporated, the way became clear for Vladimir Putin, a man who presents himself as a strong leader restoring Russian pride. When addressing Western audiences, Putin denounces the Great Terror, the gulags, the show trials and the other elements of the Soviet dictatorship. But his government also promotes a nationalist history in which Stalin features as the kind of firm ruler necessary to protect Russia against enemies at home and abroad. In other words, if the past shapes the present, the present also shapes the past. What does that mean for Australia? The writer Maria Tumarkin describes Russia as “one monstrous traumascape”, a nation built upon graves. Indigenous people might say the same about this country. The debates about the commemoration of Captain Cook and other figures of the colonial order offer, perhaps, a chance to face up to the trauma of white settlement and its consequences. Ultimately, though, we can only resolve the wrongs of history by creating some kind of justice in the here and now.

While this stagnant growth has also seen income inequality decrease marginally over the past two years, wealth inequality continues to grow as the booming housing market sees wealth grow on the back of households taking on more debt than ever before. Every two years the ABS conducts a survey of household income and wealth. The latest survey, covering 2015-16, reveals that average gross annual income of Australian households fell from $110,565 in 2013-14 to $109,668: But this doesn’t tell us a great deal about standards of living as that figure is just an average of all households and doesn’t take into account the different sizes of each household. A single person on $109,668 and a family of four living on the same amount might both be households on the average income, but clearly the single person has a much higher standard of living. That is why the ABS also calculates the equivalised household disposable income, which takes into account the size of households and taxes paid. In 2015-16, the average annual equivalised household disposable income was $52,468 – down on the $53,508 in 2013-14 and little changed from the $51,064 in 2007-08: In the two years from 2013-14 to 2015-16 only households in the lowest and the second-highest income quintiles saw their income grow – up 0.2% and 0.7% respectively. Households in the richest 20% saw their income fall by 4.4% – marking a continuation of the lean income growth for the richest since the GFC hit in 2007-08: It has meant that in the past two years, income inequality has generally fallen, although it still remains well above where it was prior to the mining boom years: In 2015-16, the richest 20% held 39.8% of the total household income – down from its 40.8% share in 2013-15 but above the 39.5% share in 2011-12: The middle-income 20% of households in Australia held around 17% of total income – a level relatively stable since 2007-08. But how much income you need to be in a middle-income Australian household depends on the size of your household. While the average equivalised disposable income in 2015-16 was $52,486, the median income is lower because higher incomes skew the average upwards. The median income marks the points at which 50% of households earn more and 50% earn less. For a single person the median disposable income is $44,356 – equivalent to earning around $52,900 before tax. But if you are a family of four you need to earn more money to have a similar standard of living as that single person – you have more mouths to feed, more people to clothe, keep warm, etc. For a family with two adults and two children under 15, the median household income is $93,475. Using the standard 70/30 income split that would mean one adult earns around $84,700 before tax while the other earns $29,800. Conversely, a family of four in the richest 10% has a disposable income of $186,186 – for a 70/30 split of one parent on $189,000 and the other earning $70,000: These also reveal that scares about growing welfare dependence really need to be consigned to the dustbin. For the first time in the survey’s history, more than half of all Australian households gained less than 1% of their income from government pensions and allowances. While there was an increase in the share of households that receive over 90% of their income from pensions (to be expected given the ageing population), anyone looking for signs of Australians becoming increasingly dependent upon welfare will struggle to find the facts matching their myths: The proportion of households whose main source of income is pensions and allowances has fallen steadily since the depth of the GFC in 2009-10 and the current level is the second lowest ever recorded: But while incomes have been stagnant, household wealth has not been. In 2015-16, the average net worth of all Australian households was $519,800, up from $467,100 in 2013-14: Unlike with income, wealth increased across all households – except the lowest quintile – due largely to increases in the value of property and driven by large increases in debt. In 2015-16, the median level of debt was greater than annual income for the first time. It also saw a record level of households with debt greater than three times their income – a key indicator of “over indebtedness”: It has led to a situation where more households than ever before hold a mortgage – 37%, up from 32% at the start of the century, but where the number of households who have paid off their mortgage has shrunk – from 38% in 2000-01 to now just 30%: But while home ownership on average has fallen, it hasn’t for the highest-income households. Seventy-eight per cent of households in the highest-income quintile either owned their home outright or were paying off a mortgage – the largest amount this century. By contrast, households in the median-income quintile are less likely to be home owners than any time since 2000: The level and growth of wealth highlights that while income growth and inequality might be flat, wealth inequality has skyrocketed in the past decade: The net worth of households in the 90th wealth percentile (ie wealthier than 89% of households) has risen 33% compared with 20% for median households. It leaves us with a situation where the richest 20% hold 40% of total household income, but 63% of household wealth. Conversely, while the poorest 20% have 8% of the nation’s income, they don’t hold even 1% of its wealth: The latest income and wealth survey does give some succour to the treasurer’s suggestion that inequality is improving – or at least not getting much worse. Mostly, however, inequality has improved because the incomes of richer households has fallen by more than median households, rather than the preferred case of all incomes rising, but with median low incomes rising faster. But on wealth side, the picture remains very much that of a divided nation. Wealth driven by high debt levels and rising house prices has been good for those already in the properly market but flat incomes combined with rising property prices has lowered the home ownership rates of median and low-income earners – thus further exacerbating the disparity of wealth across the nation.

The data, tabled in parliament this week, confirms what was already known about extent of problems with the so-called “robo debt” system. It shows 7,456 debts were reduced to zero and another 12,524 were partially reduced but not wiped entirely, between July last year and March. For the first time, the data gives a geographic understanding of where debts were issued. It shows high numbers of inaccurate debts in areas of western Sydney, Bundaberg, Mackay, Toowoomba, the New South Wales central coast and around Cranbourne in Melbourne’s south-eastern fringes. Outer suburbs of the Gold Coast, Hervey Bay and Ipswich in Queensland were also listed in the top 20, as were Ballarat and Werribee in Victoria. But lawyers have warned the statistics do not give a complete picture. The data only reflects debts where a review or appeal took place. Victoria Legal Aid’s executive director of civil justice, Dan Nicholson, said the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups were less likely to have appealed. “I think on the face of it, it’s a shocking number of wrong debts to be alleged but in fact the most concerning thing is the very large number of people who would not have challenged their debts, and would now be paying back debts that were wrongly or unlawfully raised against them,” Nicholson said. “We know those people are most likely to be the most disadvantaged in the community, and therefore the people that it may affect the most.” The human services minister, Alan Tudge, has insisted the system is capable of calculating debts fairly. He pointed to to the ombudsman’s report earlier this year, which made a string of criticisms of the system but found it was able to accurately raise a debt, so long as it was provided with the proper information. “Of course, if someone provides new accurate information, then a different debt figure is calculated. This has always been the case,” Tudge said. “The percentage of online compliance system debts subsequently reduced to zero after the welfare recipient has provided further information is almost identical to under the old manual system – about 3%.” Criticism of the system began just before Christmas last year. From July last year, the government introduced a new way of clawing back debts from welfare recipients. It removed a layer of human oversight from an automated data matching process, which compares an individual’s tax records with the earnings they have reported to Centrelink. Where previously compliance teams would manually check discrepancies in tax and Centrelink records, the new system immediately sent a letter to the welfare recipient. That shifted the onus to disproving the debt on to vulnerable Australians. It also allowed the government to significantly ramp up the scale of its debt recovery program. It shifted people to use a new online tool to prove their entitlement to welfare, often forcing people to find payslips that were up to six years old. Thousands of letters were sent to the wrong address. Others were either ignored or not understood. If no response was received, a debt was raised against the individual. A longer period of non-response would see the debt referred to an external debt collector. “The [online compliance intervention] project effectively shifted complex fact-finding and data entry functions from the department to the individual and its success relied on its usability,” the ombudsman’s report found earlier this year. The process also led to flaws in the calculation method. If no response was received, Centrelink would use an “income averaging” method to calculate the debt. The method takes an individual’s annual income and averages it over Centrelink’s 26 fortnightly reporting periods, thereby assuming an individual had worked for the entire year and was ineligible for welfare. “The obligation on Centrelink is not to raise a debt unless it is satisfied it exists in the relevant amount,” Nicholson said. “Its job is to use its powers fairly and accurately, not to go on a fishing expedition and expect people to do hours work to correct Centrelink’s basic mistakes. “We think there are real doubts about the lawfulness of the approach they have used.” In a joint statement, the shadow human services minister, Linda Burney, and the Labor MP Steven Georganas called on Tudge to apologise to the 20,000 individuals. “These are absolutely shocking results and reveal the extent to which Mr Tudge has fudged the management of the robo-debt debacle,” they said. “Minister Tudge made them feel frightened, anxious and like criminals, and he should apologise.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/sep/05/efta-would-benefit-from-having-uk-as-a-member-says-icelandic-foreign-minister-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T17:37:48Z","webTitle":"Davis says UK unlikely to agree payment to EU until very end of negotiation – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/05/efta-would-benefit-from-having-uk-as-a-member-says-icelandic-foreign-minister-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/05/efta-would-benefit-from-having-uk-as-a-member-says-icelandic-foreign-minister-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Davis says UK unlikely to agree payment to EU until very end of negotiation – as it happened","bodyText":"Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-leader, has denounced the government’s immigration plans - revealed in the Guardian leak - as “economically illiterate” and “plainly cruel” You can read the leaked document in full here. And here is a 10-point summary of what it says. That’s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. And this is from MLex’s Matthew Holehouse. This is from Newsnight’s Mark Urban. The Guardian has a huge scoop. My colleagues Nick Hopkins and Alan Travis have got a draft of the document setting out the government’s plans for immigration rules after Brexit. David Davis revealed surprisingly little that was new about the Brexit process in his statement and it is telling that the Press Association first take leads on Davis being laughed at by some MPs after he claimed that no one ever said the Brexit process would be easy. (See 5.37am.) Here are the other notable lines. Davis, the Brexit secretary, said he did not expect the UK to agree a financial payment to the EU for Brexit until the end of the entire negotiating process. He told MPs: My expectation is that the money argument will go on for the full duration of the negotiation. The famous European “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” will apply here absolutely, as anywhere else. Davis refused to commit to giving MPs a specific vote on the financial settlement. Asked if MPs would get a specific vote on this, he told the Labour MP Chris Leslie (see 5.25pm) that MPs would get a vote on the final settlement as a whole. Davis claimed that, if the UK were to leave the EU with no deal, some EU countries would suffer more than Britain would. Davis said the talks would get “very stormy” at some point. He said: As I have said from the beginning of this, this is going to be a turbulent process. There will be ripples, there will be times when it’s smooth, there will be times when it is very stormy, and we must be ready for that, because it is a negotiation which is going to be about big issues between major states. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, accused the government of making “too many promises” about Brexit “which can’t be kept”. He told MPs: We are obviously reaching the stage of negotiations where fantasy meets brutal reality. The truth is that too many promises have been made about Brexit which can’t be kept. The secretary of state has just said that nobody was pretending it would be easy. Mr Speaker, they were pretending it would be easy. The international trade secretary [Liam Fox] promoted that negotiating a deal with the EU would be, and I quote, “one of the easiest deals in human history” to negotiate. A year the secretary of state wrote “within two years, before the negotiation with the EU is likely to be complete” we would be able to “negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU”. Even this summer the government published position papers riddled with further fantasies. The track-and-trace customs idea was put forward on 15 August this year as an apparently serious proposition, only to be effectively removed on the 1 September by the secretary of state himself with the admission that it was merely “blue sky thinking”. Starmer singled out for particular criticism Theresa May’s claim that the European court of justice would have no further role in British life after Brexit as a particular problem. He said: It is a fantasy to think that you can have a deep and comprehensive trade deal without shared institutions. The sooner we face up to that, the better. Davis says the Brexit negotiations will get “very stormy” at some point. Here is the start of Press Association story about the statement. David Davis was heckled by Labour MPs after claiming no-one pretended it would be “simple or easy” to make progress in Brexit talks. The Brexit secretary faced jeers in the Commons as he said he always believed the negotiations would be “tough, complex and at times confrontational”. Davis added the UK must not lose sight of its overall aim to create a “deep and special new partnership” with its closest neighbours. His remarks came as he updated MPs following the latest talks in the Brexit process. Davis said the UK wants the talks to move on to the future relationship with the EU by October “if possible” - something the UK has previously expressed greater confidence over. He told the Commons: “Last week we turned our considerations to the next round of talks and in that my message to the commission was, let’s continue to work together constructively but put people above process. “To that end, my team will publish further papers in the coming weeks, continuing to set out our ambitions for the negotiations and a new deep and special partnership the UK wants to build with the EU. “Ultimately, businesses and citizens on both sides want us to move swiftly on to discussing the future partnership and we want that to happen after the European Council in October, if possible. “As colleagues know, at the start of these negotiations both sides agreed that the aim was to make progress on four key areas - citizens’ rights, financial settlement, Northern Ireland and Ireland, and broader separation issues. “We’ve been doing just that.” As Opposition MPs laughed at this comment, Davis added: “Nobody has ever pretended this would be simple or easy.” This prompted further heckling and jeers before he added: “I’ve always said the negotiations will be tough, complex and at times confrontational - so it has proved. “But we must not lose sight of our overarching aim - to build a deep and special new partnership with our closest neighbours and allies whilst also building a truly global Britain that can forge new relationships with the fastest growing economies around the world.” Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the “slow process of progress” was a “real cause for concern”. “The parties appear to be getting further apart, rather than closer together,” he told MPs. “Round three of five in phase one is gone, we would expect agreement to be emerging on the key issues. “The last round is in October and that should be for formal agreement. There’s now huge pressure on the negotiating round in September.” He said if phase two is pushed back, there would be “very serious consequences for Britain” and a no-deal option “could yet rise from the ashes”. In his update to MPs on the talks with the EU during July and August,Davis addressed issues around nuclear materials. He said: “We held discussions on the need to resolve issues around the ownership of special fissile material and the responsibility for radioactive waste and spent fuel held both here and there. “We reiterated, this is important, a strong mutual interest in ensuring the UK and Euratom community continue to work closely together in the future as part of a comprehensive new partnership.” Davis also claimed the discussions have shown the UK’s approach is “substantially more flexible and pragmatic” than the EU’s as it “avoids unnecessary disruption for British business and consumers”. Starmer said it was “increasingly clear” that the prime minister’s “flawed red lines” on issues such as the European court of justice and citizens rights were “at the heart of the problem”. He urged the government to be more flexible, warning: “I fear that these are not just examples which will crop up in phase one, these flawed red lines will bedevil the rest of the negotiations. “It is a fantasy to think that you can have a deep and comprehensive trade deal without shared institution and the sooner we face up to that the better.” Starmer said “too many promises” had been made about Brexit which “can’t be kept”. Responding to Starmer, Davis said the issue of citizens’ rights was not “vexing” the European commission at the moment. He said the commission was seeking to use time pressure on maintaining the first part of the negotiation as a “pressure point to put up against Britain in the future”. Davis says understanding of what a transition period might involve has changed a lot over the last six months. Originally the EU wanted to spend two years negotiating the withdrawal, he says. Then they wanted to spend an indefinite amount of time negotiating a future trade relationship. Labour’s Pat McFadden asks if Davis thinks the EU are “blackmailing” the UK over money. He is referring to the phrase Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, used. Davis says he uses his own words. But he says there are “pressure points” in the negotiation. Labour’s Chris Leslie asks if MPs will get the chance to vote on any “divorce bill” to the EU. On Monday MPs will vote for a money resolution to go with the EU (withdrawal) bill. MPs should not vote until they know what the final bill will be. Davis says MPs will get a vote on the final agreement. He says he does not think the money issue will be solved until the end of the progress. Davis refuses to commit to giving MPs a specific vote on the “Brexit bill” to be paid to the EU. He just said there would be a vote on the final deal. He says he does not expect the “Brexit bill” issue to be settled until the end of the process. The Labour MP Chris Bryant says the EU (withdrawal) bill will give ministers wide-ranging powers to amend bills, including the EU (withdrawal) bill itself. No government has done that before, he says. It is not a Henry VIII clause. It is an Alice in Wonderland clause. Davis says he will deal with this when MPs debate the bill on Thursday. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, asks if Davis still “agrees with himself” about the need for a second referendum on the Brexit outcome. He is referring to a speech Davis gave in 2005. Davis says Brake has misunderstood the speech. Sir Bill Cash, a Conservative, says Labour have now moved form being “remainers to reversers”. Davis says Labour voters, more than anyone else, want to leave the EU. (That’s not true. Leave voters were more likely to vote Conservative than Labour.) Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asks why Davis does not tell business that the government will remain in the current business arrangements until it knows what the final outcome will be (ie, stay in the single market during the transitional period). Davis says it should not be hard to find a new trading relationship. Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, tells Davis he should not take any advice from Labour, who were until recently opposed to remaining in the single market and the customs union. Davis says Duncan Smith has a point. He says he (Davis) only has to negotiate with Brussels. Starmer has to negotiate with the whole of this front bench, he says. Bloomberg has just posted this online. It says Michel Barnier’s deputy has told German MPs that she does not think the Brexit talks will be able to move on to phase two in October. This is how its story starts: The European Union’s deputy Brexit negotiator told German lawmakers that she’s skeptical talks with the U.K. will be able to move on to trade in October, according to two people present at the closed-door briefing. Sabine Weyand briefed a special session of the European Affairs committee of the lower house, or Bundestag, in Berlin on Monday, and told lawmakers that no movement had been made in the key areas under discussion, those who attended the hearing said. Davis is responding to Starmer. He asks if Labour would be willing to say now that they would pay up what Brussels wants. Would they pay £100bn? He says the EU are pushing for a financial commitment now as a negotiating tactic. The UK will not play along, he says. He says his comment about the proposed custom plan being “blue sky thinking” was not intended to be derogatory. He was making a point about how imaginative the plans were. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is responding now. He says he accept that some issues will have to be dealt with when they move on to discuss the future trade relationship; Northern Ireland is a good example, he says. But he says progress has been too slow. If the point at which the UK and the EU move on to phase two is pushed back, the prospect of having “no deal” could rise from the ashes, he says. He says it is “a fantasy” to think the UK can have a deep and comprehensive trade relationship with the EU without shared institutions. Starmer says too many promises have been made about Brexit that cannot be kept. Starmer says too many Brexit promises have been made that cannot be kept. Davis said just now that no one was saying it would be easy. But that is exactly what some people were saying, he says. He quotes examples. He says Davis himself published a technology option for customs that he now admits is blue sky thinking. Davis says it would not be in the interests of both sides to run aspects of the talks twice (ie, in phase one, and then phase two). Future discussion papers will be published, he says. He says the government still hopes to move the talks on to phase two, dealing with the future trade relationship, after October. No one ever said this would be easy, he says. MPs laugh at this. But, Davis goes on, the UK wants to be able to forge new relationships with the fastest growing economies in the world. Davis says the government has published other papers. He says the government may be willing to pay to participate in EU programmes after Brexit. On financial obligations, Davis says the UK has been clear that the UK will have financial obligations to the EU that will survive Brexit. But the government has an obligation to taxpayers. It is interrogating the EU’s stance line by line. The EU has not necessarily appreciated this, he suggests. He says the UK and the EU start from very different legal positions. He and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, have accepted that they will not make incremental progress on this issue in every round, he says. Turning to Ireland, Davis says there has been progress in this area. There is a high degree of convergence on issues like the common travel area, he says. He says the EU has shifted on this. Davis says the discussions this week have shown the the UK’s approach is “substantially more imaginative and pragmatic” than the EU’s. This generates some jeering. Davis turns to separation issues. These matters are very technical, he says. They are close to agreement on post-Brexit privileges. On nuclear materials, some agreement has been reached. He says both sides reiterated a strong interest in ensuring Euratom and the UK work together after Brexit, as part of a close partnership. Davis the EU are not offering to protect the voting rights of Britons living on the continent. But the UK is offering to protect the voting rights of EU nationals in the UK, he says. Davis says he will update MPs on what happened during the two rounds of substantial talks that have taken place so far. They have covered four issues, he says: the rights of EU nationals, financial obligations, Ireland, and other separation matters. He says, on the rights of EU nationals, progress has been made. He outlines some of the areas where they agree on the rights of EU nationals, and the rights of Britons living on the continent. They are set out in this document (pdf). David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is now making a Commons statement on Brexit. He will be updating MPs on the progress (or otherwise) made in the Brexit talks over the summer. In the Commons the Foreign Office minister Mark Field is still answering an urgent questions about Myanmar. He is getting fiercely criticised by MPs for not condemning the Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi for her unwillingness to intervene to protect the Rohingya people. Greenpeace UK has welcomed Nicola Sturgeon’s announcement about a deposit return scheme for bottles. (See 4.12pm.) This is from Willie Mackenzie, Greenpeace’s oceans expert. Governments are waking up to the frightening scale of ocean plastic pollution and it’s brilliant to see Scotland leading the way in helping to tackle it. On Greenpeace’s recent research expedition around remote Scottish coastlines, plastic bottles and packaging were simply everywhere. A staggering 16m plastic bottles end up in the environment every day in the UK and deposit return schemes are a great way to make sure more of them are collected and reused. Today’s announcement by the first minister is a massive step in stopping plastic pollution, and the result of tireless campaigning by many groups and individuals. With businesses and an overwhelming majority of the public in favour of deposit schemes, the Scottish government now has a mandate to implement as robust a system as possible to help reduce plastic pollution. Hopefully it won’t be too long before the rest of the UK follows suit. Alongside a deposit return scheme, major soft drinks companies like Coca-Cola – who backed deposit return schemes after being exposed by Greenpeace for lobbying against them – need to seriously rethink their business models. Creating over 100bn single-use plastic bottles a year is the root of the problem. Drastically reducing their plastic footprint is the only solution. Throwaway plastic causes ocean pollution, and the sooner companies face up to that, the quicker we’ll stem the plastic tide. Here is a list of some of the most significant measures in Nicola Sturgeon’s programme for government as set out in the Scottish government’s news release. support for key business sectors including low carbon, screen, manufacturing and financial technology extending free personal care to all those under 65 who need it, known as ‘Frank’s Law’ rolling out new social security powers as part of a package of measures to tackle inequality, child poverty, end rough sleeping, reduce drug deaths and provide free sanitary protection to students in school, college and university extending the presumption against short prison sentences to 12 months to break the cycle of offending and encourage the greater use of more effective community sentences record investment in the NHS and a pledge to lift the public sector pay cap for NHS and other public sector workers doubling the provision of free childcare Improving public health with action on air quality, increased investment in active travel and measures to restrict the advertising of fatty and sugary food and drink A discussion paper on the use of income tax in Scotland to support public services And here are some of the other measures in the package. Creating a new criminal offence of drug driving. Giving new powers and responsibilities to head teachers. Phasing out petrol and diesel cars from 2032 (eight years earlier than the target for England.) Giving an automatic pardon to those convicted of same-sex sexual offences that are now legal. Lifting the minimum age of criminal responsibility from eight to 12. The SNP government will not oppose an MSP’s bill to ban smacking in Scotland. Introducing a deposit return scheme for drinks containers. The BBC’s Scotland live blog has a good round-up of reaction to the speech in the Scottish parliament. Here is some comment on Nicola Sturgeon’s speech from political journalists and commentators. Most of them are not people who are seen as obvious SNP cheerleaders, but, overall, the verdict is very positive. From the Times’ Kenny Farquharson From David Torrance, author of a Sturgeon biography From the BBC’s Nick Eardley From Chris Deerin From Holyrood magazine’s Mandy Rhodes From the BBC’s Philip Sim From OpenDemocracy’s Adam Ramsay A senior unionist politician has branded Lord Hain’s proposals to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union as part of a Brexit side deal as “partition” of the UK. Ulster Unionist chairman Lord Empey accused the Labour peer of dangerous thinking which would damage the Northern Irish economy. He said: This idea amounts to the partition of the UK and is Sinn Fein’s policy. Why on earth would we agree to cut ourselves off from the mainland to protect 15% of our business and put 85% of it at risk? It is simply nonsensical. Hain will tell the House of Lords this afternoon that the only way to secure Northern Ireland’s future while at the same time preserving the invisible border with Ireland is for the region to stay in the customs union, even if the rest of the UK pulls out. Here is the full text of Nicola Sturgeon’s statement. This is what the legislative programme document says about considering the case for raising income tax in Scotland. This is from page 98 of the document (pdf). Ahead of publishing our draft budget for 2018-19, we will publish a discussion paper on income tax to open up the debate about the best use of our tax powers. It will: ■ set out the current distribution of income tax liabilities in Scotland ■ analyse the implications of different options around income tax, including the proposals of other parties represented in the Scottish parliament ■ set out the importance of the interaction of income tax policy with the fiscal framework ■ provide international comparisons of Scotland’s income tax policy ■ better inform the parliament and people in Scotland about the choices open to us to invest in our public services and support the economy in the context of austerity and Brexit As set out last year, the first minister has asked the council of economic advisors how, and to what extent, the revenue risk associated with an increase in the additional rate of income tax can be mitigated. Their advice will also inform our income tax policy development in advance of the 2018-19 draft budget. In entering into discussions about the future of income tax, this government recognises that taxation must be used responsibly and progressively and that taxpayers value certainty. These principles will underpin our decisions. Here is the Scottish government’s news release about its programme for government. And here is the 121-page programme (pdf) in full. Sturgeon wound up her speech with an announcement that the Scottish government will consider the case for more progressive tax policies. She said the review would look at the policies proposed by other parties - which means, among other ideas, Labour’s proposal to put up income tax by 1p in the pound for everyone earning above £21,500. Here are more announcements from Nicola Sturgeon. Nicola Sturgeon has just announced that the Scottish government will work with Scottish councils to investigate the feasibility of a basic citizens income. That may help to explain why yesterday the TUC put out a report on this topic. But the research, which was carried out on behalf of the TUC by the Labour thinktank, the Fabian Society, concluded that there were better ways of tackling poverty and incentivising people to work. Here is more from Nicola Sturgeon’s speech in the Scottish parliament. Caroline Lucas, who share the role of Green party leader with Jonathan Bartley, is going to give a speech at a meeting in the Commons this afternoon making the case for people to be allowed to job share the role of MP. She will say: Job-sharing MPs could keep their caring responsibilities, they could keep voluntary work, they could continue part-time in their profession. It would help more women into politics, more disabled people and more people for whom being an MP is currently unimaginable and inaccessible. And, explaining why the Greens have allowed their leaders to job share, she will say: The Green party is a party of action and this felt like a very direct way to stand up for the values and policies we champion. Job sharing complements our commitment to fairly sharing wealth, sharing resources and sharing power. And whilst breaking open and democratising the political system remains critical to the Green party’s goals, demonstrating part of what that might look like felt like an incredibly positive step to take. Lucas will be speaking at the launch of a Fawcett Society report, Open House?, making the case for parliamentary job sharing. The Greens and the Lib Dems both favour allowing MPs to job share. But that would require legislation because currently the law says only a single candidate can stand for election to parliament. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, is addressing the Scottish parliament now with a statement about her legislative programme. Denis MacShane, who served as Europe minister under Tony Blair, says the British prime minister has been “caught cold” by what he describes as “Labour’s dramatic new line. Writing in the leading Greek daily Kathimerini he argues: This dramatic new line from Labour has caught Theresa May cold. She is trapped in the classical political dilemma. Does she stay with her party militants or does she put the national interest first? The Greek media, reflecting increased interest (and perhaps dread) over Brexit, has been following the often fraught negotiations between the UK and Europe closely. Greece has around 22,000 permanent students in the UK - the highest in proportion to population of any EU member state - and by far the largest number of permanent academics installed in British universities. MacShane says “the ultra leftwing Jeremy Corbyn” now appears as a “moderate, pro-business politician trying to delay Brexit as long as possible.” The Labour party has confirmed that it will not vote for the EU (withdrawal) bill at the end of the second reading debate on Monday next week. In a statement a party spokesperson said: Labour fully respects the democratic decision to leave the European Union, voted to trigger article 50 and backs a jobs-first Brexit with full tariff-free access to the European single market. But as democrats we cannot vote for a bill that unamended would let government ministers grab powers from parliament to slash people’s rights at work and reduce protection for consumers and the environment. Parliament has already voted to leave the European Union. But the government’s EU withdrawal bill would allow Conservative ministers to set vital terms on a whim, including of Britain’s exit payment, without democratic scrutiny. Nobody voted in last year’s referendum to give this Conservative government sweeping powers to change laws by the back door. The slogan of the leave campaign was about people taking back control and restoring powers to parliament. This power-grab bill would do the opposite. It would allow the government to seize control from the parliament that the British people have just elected. Party sources have confirmed that Labour MPs will vote against the bill on Monday - even though the formal statement does not actually say that. The Labour peer Lord Adonis has claimed that the Labour party will end up backing a fresh referendum on Brexit. (See 10.42am.) Labour sources have dismissed his comments, saying the party “respects the results of the EU referendum” (see 11.33am), but the party has not formally ruled out holding another referendum. Iceland’s foreign minister Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson has said Efta (the European Free Trade Association) would benefit from having the UK as a member. (See 9.15am.) William Hague, the Conservative former foreign secretary, has said containment may be the only solution to a nuclear-armed North Korea. (See 10.08am.) Gerry Adams has said he is putting plans in place to stand down as leader of Sinn Féin, triggering speculation he may run for the Irish presidency. As Henry McDonald reports, the politician, who has been Sinn Féin’s president since the early 1980s, said on Tuesday he would give further details about his plans after the party’s annual conference, Ard Fheis, in November.At a two-day internal conference in the Irish Republic, Adams told party activists he wanted to implement a “planned process of generational change”. Unionists have warned Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams that his call for a referendum on a united Ireland is divisive and destabilising. As the Press Association reports, the republican leader told a party meeting in the Irish Republic that a vote on partition is winnable in the next five years. But with power-sharing in Northern Ireland deadlocked for months and talks on reviving Stormont in the balance, Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster said the prospect of a border poll is not sensible. Foster said: Northern Ireland needs stability. That means we need a functioning government to make vital decisions. We do not need a divisive and destabilising border poll. The rightwing backbencher and hardline anti-European Jacob Rees-Mogg has come top in a survey of Conservative party members asked about who should be the next party leader. He scored 23%. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, who was on 15%, came second amongst named candidates, although he was beaten by the 19% choosing “other”. Some 1,309 party members took part in the ConservativeHome survey which also saw Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, being very, very narrowly beaten by Dominic Raab, the justice minister, who was in third place on 8%. (See 9.46am.) There is an urgent question on Myanmar at 3.30pm, which means the David Davis statement on Brexit will not start until about 4pm. According to some Amnesty International research into online abuse, published on the New Statesman website, almost half of abusive tweets aimed at female MPs in the six weeks running up to the general election were directed at Labour’s Diane Abbott. Azmina Dhrodia, the Amnesty researcher who has written up the findings, says: The combination of racist and sexist abuse received by Diane Abbott is reflective of a wider trend of “intersectional discrimination”. That is, discrimination that targets an individual on the basis of their different identities ... Diane Abbott standing out in our analysis is an acute example of how intersectional discrimination works. The abuse that she faces is not just sexist and misogynistic; it’s also incredibly racist. On the Daily Politics Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee, said that “at the moment” Tory MPs were “solidly behind Theresa May”. Greg Hands, the international trade minister, has also hinted that the backing Tory MPs are giving to May now might not last until the next general election. In an interview with the Herald, when asked about the prospect of May leading the party into the 2022 general election, he replied: “A lot can happen in five years, and we’ll see what the situation is in 2022.” Hands said much the same thing on Sunday on Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics. The European commission has said today that it does not want to speed up the Brexit talks, the BBC’s Adam Fleming reports. The commission was responding to reports that the UK government is interested in intensifying the pace of the process, which currently involves face-to-face talks in Brussels only taking place every four weeks. The David Davis statement on Brexit in the Commons this afternoon will come before Boris Johnson’s statement on North Korea, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has revealed. Here is my colleague Lisa O’Carroll on Gerry Adams’ announcement earlier. (See 10.21pm.) She says the significant point is that he is pushing back the point at which his likely successor, Mary Lou McDonald, will take over. Downing Street has tweeted a picture of today’s cabinet meeting. The Labour party has not officially responded to Lord Adonis’s claim that it will end up offering voters a referendum on the final Brexit deal (see 10.42am), but a party source reminds me that Adonis “doesn’t speak for the party on this”. The source also points out that Labour backs “a jobs first Brexit” and that it “respects the result of the EU referendum”. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has refused an amended planning application to build homes on the site of the former New Scotland Yard building in Westminster on the grounds that only 3% of units would be affordable housing. The original application, approved by Khan’s Conservative predecessor, Boris Johnson, had just 4% affordable housing. Khan said that Johnson should not have approved that in the first place, but a revised application was submitted because the developers wanted to increase the number of homes being build on the site (but not the number of affordable homes). In a statement Khan said: A shortage of affordable homes is at the heart of the housing crisis in our city. The scheme put forward for this site is simply unacceptable: it fails to provide the maximum amount of affordable housing that could be delivered on this landmark site, and follows a previous application in which the affordable housing provision agreed by the previous mayor was already appallingly low. It beggars belief that the initial application was approved under the previous mayor with a paltry four per cent affordable housing, just days before the mayoral election. This is a site which has only recently been transferred from public ownership and sits within one of the most expensive areas of the country. Having carefully considered the evidence available to me, I have decided to refuse permission for this amended application. Andrew Adonis, the Labour peer and Blairite former transport secretary, has told the New Statesman in an interview that he expects Labour to commit to a second referendum on Brexit. And if Labour promises one, the government will follow and back one too, he said. [Adonis] predicts that Labour will back a second referendum, as it has embraced a meaningful Brexit transitional period. “Once Labour’s in favour it’s only a matter of time before the government has to concede … I would be very surprised if we’re not committed to a referendum on the exit terms within six months. The thing I only always learned from Tony [Blair] is ‘get the policy right and the politics will follow’. The right policy is a referendum on the exit terms, the politics will sort itself out.” But Adonis does not call it a second referendum. Like Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, who used the same formula on the Today programme this morning, Adonis said that a new referendum would “a first referendum on the exit terms”. During the general election Labour said clearly that a second referendum was not party policy. But the party has not firmly ruled out ever holding one. Adonis also said he did not think Jeremy Corbyn could win a future general election. I’m not hostile to Jeremy personally, I used to be a Labour member in his constituency [Islington North], I think he’s an absolutely brilliant constituency MP. But he is not a potential prime minister. The voters have already had a chance to make a judgement on him, they’re not going to change their view in a few years’ time ... If Jeremy goes into another election, he will lose it. The next Conservative leader, who I cannot conceive will be as electorally unattractive as Theresa May, will beat him. What the Labour party should now be doing is looking for a leader who can credibly become prime minister. We need an open contest because I can see five or six potential ones. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, is making a statement in Dublin. He says he will stand again for election as Sinn Fein president later this year but that, if elected, he will then begin the process of handing over to a new generation of leaders. This is from Sky’s David Blevins. And this is from the Belfast News Letter’s Sam McBride In his Telegraph column today (paywall) William Hague, the Conservative former foreign secretary, says that, unless the international community can establish that North Korea is getting help from abroad with its nuclear missile programme and cut off that support, the world will have to get used to containing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, not thwarting them. He says it is important to understand why Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is so desperate to have a viable nuclear bomb. As [Kim Jong-un] studies the history of our century to date, he will consider that both Saddam Hussein and Colonel Gaddafi would be alive and in power today if they had possessed the weapons he is now trying to perfect. Then he can face the world as he now faces what is left of his family and original party leadership – from a position of invulnerability. If this is correct, there are no sanctions that will deter him from this goal, necessary as they are to demonstrate international disapproval. Nor will threatening “fire and fury” or saying “talking is not the answer” as President Trump did, because Kim will calculate that the US will not start a war that could be so catastrophic all round and the stronger he gets the less likely they will be to do so. It might be too late already to prevent the North Koreans from combining a serious nuclear capability with missiles that can travel thousands of miles ... In the absence of [cutting off support for North Korea’s weapons programme from abroad], or some other initiative from Beijing to stop the progress of Kim’s plans, the world will need to move from preventing his nuclear aspirations to containing them. Hague says having a new cold war in the east would have lessons for everyone. For South Korea, that it needs full deployment of the Thaad missile defence system. For Japan, that Prime Minister Abe’s plans to change the constitution to enable a more muscular defence are sadly necessary. For China, that an earlier refusal to take decisive measures on this leads to an arms race among their neighbours. For the UK, that giving up our nuclear deterrent when proliferation happens so quickly would be utter madness. For the world, that the further uncontrolled spread of nuclear science is a massive danger. For the United States, that it is indeed correct to threaten massive retaliation as a deterrent. But in addition, that ruling out diplomacy would be a mistake when a paranoid young dictator is getting close to converting a yearning for his own security into a fact. In the summer Jacob Rees-Mogg brushed aside speculation about him becoming the next Conservative party leader as a product of the August “silly season”. But now we’re into September and support of a Rees-Mogg candidature continues to grow. The ConservativeHome website carries out a regular survey of party members to see who they want as next party leader and, for the first time, Rees-Mogg has come top. He was on 23%, beating David Davis, the Brexit secretary, who was in second place on 15%. ConservativeHome surveys are seen as reasonably accurate guides to party opinion, although on a topic like this views do shift quite considerably, and there does not seem any prospect of a leadership contest in the near future. In his commentary on the result, Paul Goodman, the ConservativeHome editor, says Rees-Mogg is essentially the beneficiary of a protest vote. In our view, Jacob Rees-Mogg is the beneficiary of party member disillusion with the present senior options for replacing her. This, in turn, shows the knock-on effects, first, of an EU referendum campaign that those members evidently found divisive (despite their strong support for Brexit); second, of a sense that the collective leadership of the party failed during the general election campaign and, third, of a Corbyn factor – that’s to say, of a yearning for clarity, authenticity and commitment, made all the more pressing by the Party now having been in government since 2010. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, was also on the Today programme this morning. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reports, he claimed that Labour was being “irresponsible” in refusing to back the EU (withdrawal) bill. Grayling also said the government wanted to increase pay for public sector workers but that a decision would have to wait until the budget. He told the programme: We have listened to the lessons from the general election campaign, we look carefully at the issues we face as a country, but when it comes to these big financial decisions they are things that have to wait for the budget. All of us want to see a situation where we can provide people with additional pay, additional job opportunities, but in order to do that we have to have a strong, growing economy. Here is more from the Today interview with the Icelandic foreign minister. Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson said Efta countries would like to have the UK as a member because it would give them more clout in trade negotiations. In comments that will be welcome by Brexiteers, he said that the UK was the fifth largest economy in the world and that “everyone” wanted a trade deal with it. (See 9.15am.) He said free trade was vital, and was what had made Iceland relatively wealthy. We were probably the poorest nation in Western Europe in the beginning of the last century. Now we are quite wealthy. And the reason, one of the reasons, is a fundamental thing, that we have access to other markets and our markets are open. He said that Efta membership allowed Iceland to trade freely with European countries without being subject to the “political integration” that came with EU membership. He said that Iceland had to accept about 30% of the “acquis” - the body of EU law. This was a cost, and some of the regulations were unwelcome, he said. But he said it was very important for Iceland to have access to the single market. He said that Iceland had to accept free movement, but that this was not a problem for the country. He said it would be bad for Europe as a whole if the UK left the EU without a deal. Trade restrictions would be harmful, he said. In the UK one of the many arguments about Brexit is about whether we should seek to remain in the single market after we leave through membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) or the European Free Trade Association (Efta). But what do Efta members think? On the Today programme this morning the Icelandic foreign minister, Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson, said Iceland would like Britain to join. That was because it would give Efta more clout in trade negotiations, he said. He told the programme: They [the UK] could definitely join Efta, and I think it would strengthen Efta at least to have a cooperation with Britain. It is quite clear that when Britain starts to negotiate their own free trade deal, then everyone wants to make a free trade deal with Britain. You are the fifth largest economy in the world. Everyone wants to sell you goods and services. It’s as simple as that. I will post more from his interview shortly. Brexit is likely to be the dominant story today (when isn’t it?) because David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is giving a statement to MPs this afternoon updating them on the progress in the Brexit talks over the summer. It could be quite revealing. And we’ve also got a statement from Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, on North Korea. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The cabinet meets. 10am: Andrew Jones, a Treasury minister, gives a speech in Aberdeen to the Society of Petroleum Engineers conference. 2pm: Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, launches a report on the future of further education. 2.20pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, makes a statement to the Scottish parliament on her government’s legislative programme. 3.30pm: Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is expected to give a Commons statement on North Korea. Around 4.30pm: David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is expected to give a Commons statement on Brexit. (Johnson and Davis are both definitely giving statements, but the order has not been confirmed yet. But given that Johnson outranks Davis, he is likely to go first.) Around 6pm: Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, gives a Commons statement on the Grenfell Tower fire. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time.

The Tottenham wage bill is the last stronghold, the Wall in the north of London, football’s last chance to save itself from an army of terrifying Mr 15% zombies lurching over the horizon. Keeping some of Europe’s finest players happy on as little as £50,000-a-week ain’t easy, but Levy somehow manages it. But after Danny Rose’s public outcry last month regarding a lack of coin, cracks have started to appear in the Wall, not helped by Toby Alderweireld’s agent going all Jerry Maguire by sending this missive to the Belgian press, demanding either “a contract or a transfer” from Levy. “If you only look at his figures, Toby is impressive and for his performances, he deserves either a better contract from Tottenham or a transfer,” wailed Stijn Francis. “Even after his injury he recovered. Tottenham’s statistics fell sharply during his absence. For a transfer, you know that he can only leave Tottenham for seven or eight teams and almost all the other top clubs are interested in Toby. There are not a lot of central defenders of his kind so they are sought after. But those clubs also know that they have to negotiate with [Tottenham chairman] Daniel Levy.” Alderweireld’s contract runs out in 2019, when Spurs have the option of a 12-month extension that would also trigger a £25m release clause. With Manchester City and Chelsea circling, Levy will be keen to resolve the situation before January, with Alderweireld hoping to match some of the club’s top earners: Harry Kane is on around £100,000-a-week. More contract fun in Liverpool, with Emre Can’s deal set to expire next summer. Despite Chelsea signing Danny Drinkwater and Ander Herrera doing the square root of nout on Manchester United’s bench, both clubs are keen on the 23-year-old, who will leave on a free transfer if he doesn’t agree a new deal. Perhaps more believable is the interest from Juventus, who know a thing or two about signing a German international midfielder on free transfer. Juve could also land Faouzi Ghoulam from Napoli on a free transfer next summer, but will have to fight off competition from Chelsea and Liverpool. Should the Old Lady get their man, it could open the door to flog Alex Sandro to the highest bidder. Which, let’s face it, will probably be Chelsea. Reports in Spain are suggesting that Philippe Coutinho could refuse to play for Liverpool in the Champions League this season in order to force through a move to Barcelona in January. Should Coutinho appear for the Reds before Christmas in Europe, he would then be a less attractive proposition for the Catalan club as he would be cup tied. Perhaps Coutinho’s back has stiffened up again on the way back from Brazil. Arda Turan’s declaration to the press about his future – “I am happy in Barça. I have three years of contract and I am going to stay” – has not stopped rumours of a loan deal to Galatasaray picking up pace. Manchester United, seemingly intent of ruining a good midfield, are also apparently keen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/05/labour-opposition-to-brexit-repeal-bill-risks-legal-vacuum-grayling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T07:41:12Z","webTitle":"Labour opposition to Brexit repeal bill risks legal vacuum - Grayling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/05/labour-opposition-to-brexit-repeal-bill-risks-legal-vacuum-grayling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/05/labour-opposition-to-brexit-repeal-bill-risks-legal-vacuum-grayling","fields":{"headline":"Labour opposition to Brexit repeal bill risks legal vacuum - Grayling","bodyText":"Chris Grayling has attacked Labour’s opposition to the controversial “great repeal bill”, ahead of a crucial meeting of the shadow cabinet at which the party is expected to agree to vote down the first Brexit legislation. The shadow cabinet will make a formal decision on Tuesday, the first day back in parliament for MPs after the summer break. It is expected to whip its MPs to vote against the bill at its second reading in the Commons. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has repeatedly said Labour will not support the bill without significant changes to its content, because of concerns that it would allow ministers to make sweeping changes to legislation without parliamentary scrutiny. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said the party’s actions were disappointing and disrupting the bill’s passage through parliament would lead to a “legal vacuum” when the UK left the EU in March 2019. “I’m very sorry to see Labour behaving in a way many will see as irresponsible,” he told BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday. “What this bill will actually do is ensure there is not a legal cliff-edge when we leave the EU. We have 40 years of European law on the statute books. You can’t have a situation where, when we leave, there is a complete legal vacuum, so we are taking the existing EU laws, putting them into UK law. This government and future governments will be free to modify as they see fit.” The bill, which will have its second reading on Thursday, is expected to pass through the hung parliament at the vote next Monday with the help of Democratic Unionist party MPs. However, some pro-Europe Conservative rebels are preparing a slew of amendments to the bill at committee stage. The bill transposes existing European law into UK law but will involve extensive use of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to change primary legislation using secondary legislation without parliamentary scrutiny. Starmer has also voiced concern over the bill’s failure to guarantee “crucial rights and protections” for citizens, and called for assurances that Britain will continue to participate in the single market, customs union and European court of justice during a transition period. The government’s refusal to bring the EU charter of fundamental rights into domestic law is also a point of contention. Ahead of her first cabinet meeting before the new parliamentary term, Theresa May is reported to have told aides she is determined her long-term legacy should not be defined only by Brexit. Damian Green, the first secretary of state and May’s de-facto deputy, told Politico the prime minister wanted to get back to the domestic agenda, given the message sent to the party at the general election. Green said housing would be central to her agenda, and No 10 has hinted that the public sector pay cap is to be lifted, although the Cabinet Office and the Treasury are understood to disagree over the details of proposals to relax restrictions on pay rises for doctors, teachers and other public sector employees. Cabinet discussions on Tuesday centred on education reform, the prime minister’s spokesman told reporters after the meeting. “We need an offer for everyone,” Green said. “That’s why the prime minister is very, very keen to ensure we continue to pursue the domestic agenda she set out on the steps of Downing Street when she first became prime minister. “We must not neglect the domestic agenda, precisely so we’ve got an offer, we can show we are making life better for many groups of people, among whom are young people.” Green, a close ally of the prime minister, said he fully expected her to fight the next election in 2022. “I think Theresa is doing what is a very difficult job extremely well and I would like to see her continue to do this for many years.”Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs, said May’s position was “subject to the support of colleagues” but said MPs currently backed her. Asked if MPs were behind May to lead them into another general election, he told the BBC’s Daily Politics: “If my colleagues are then I am...At the moment we are solidly behind Theresa May.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/05/online-gambling-888-reports-loss-record-fine-tax-bill-bites","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T14:34:54Z","webTitle":"888 slips into loss after record fine for failing vulnerable gamblers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/05/online-gambling-888-reports-loss-record-fine-tax-bill-bites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/05/online-gambling-888-reports-loss-record-fine-tax-bill-bites","fields":{"headline":"888 slips into loss after record fine for failing vulnerable gamblers","bodyText":"Online gambling firm 888 fell into the red in the first half of the year after $50.8m (£39.3m) of provisions relating to a record fine for failing to protect vulnerable customers and a potential tax bill in Germany. The company swung to a pre-tax loss of $17.3m in the six months to 30 June, from a pre-tax profit of $27.8m in the same period a year earlier, as a result of the charges. 888 was publicly shamed last week by the industry regulator, the Gambling Commission, which fined the company a record £7.8m for “outrageous” failings. The watchdog found that more than 7,000 people who had voluntarily banned themselves from gambling were still able to access their accounts. One customer was allowed to make 850,000 bets worth £1.3m in one year, using money stolen from their employer, highlighting what the Gambling Commission found to be “serious flaws” in 888’s efforts to protect consumers from harm. The company said it was making a first-half provision of $5.5m relating to the fine. The remainder of the first-half charge – $45.3m – relates to money set aside by 888 for a potential VAT bill in Germany for business in the country before 2015. The company said it was taking a cautious approach by setting aside the sum and is still in discussions with German tax authorities. The chief executive, Itai Frieberger, said revenue at the gambling firm increased by 3% in the first half of the year, to $270.1m, bolstered by growth in its core casino business, fast-growing demand for 888 Sport and a good performance in poker. He added: “While the industry will continue to face regulatory headwinds in the second half of the year, trading in the third quarter has started well and in line with the board’s expectations. Underpinned by this momentum as well as the proven strengths of the group’s business model the board remains confident that 888 will achieve further progress and deliver its expectations for the full year.” 888’s revenue from the UK fell to 39% of the total in the first half, from 46% a year ago, after growth in markets such as Spain and Italy. The firm said costs would increase because of increased regulation in the UK. “Further regulation, such as the expansion of gaming duty on casino, poker and bingo free bets in the UK taking effect in the second half of 2017, will increase the cost base for operators in the UK. At the same time, enhanced regulation in the UK around areas such as television advertising and bonuses will impact overall UK market growth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/11/inside-lifes-a-launchpad-for-crackdown-on-north-korean-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T01:00:06Z","webTitle":"Inside Life's hotel, a launchpad for crackdown on North Korean refugees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/11/inside-lifes-a-launchpad-for-crackdown-on-north-korean-refugees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/11/inside-lifes-a-launchpad-for-crackdown-on-north-korean-refugees","fields":{"headline":"Inside Life's hotel, a launchpad for crackdown on North Korean refugees","bodyText":"Life’s business hotel’s reception is perfumed with black vanilla fragrance sticks from Zara Home. Its rooms boast geranium-scented shower gel and stunning river views. “Really nice,” one satisfied guest wrote on Ctrip, China’s top travel website. “And also interesting to see all the business [people] from North Korea who are also staying there.” The glowing reviews may not tell the whole story. This 20-floor riverside retreat is reportedly one of at least two hotels in the pretty Chinese border town of Dandong used by North Korean “abduction teams” tasked with hunting down defectors fleeing one of the world’s most repressive regimes. “[The agents] appear to be staying … for business but are instead collecting information on the locations of North Korean defectors and are launching operations to arrest them,” a source told Daily NK, a Seoul-based website known for its intrigue-filled exposés on the affairs of Kim Jong-un’s reclusive state. Fleeing North Korea’s oppression and deprivation has always been a high-stakes gamble for which failure can mean a trip to the gulag – or worse. This year the odds of success have lengthened, and not only because of the spies who have supposedly checked in to Life’s. Activists say China has dramatically stepped up its campaign to catch North Korean fugitives. Since July, at least 41 have been detained on Chinese soil and returned to “a place of torture and persecution”, Human Rights Watch claimed last month. Some have been picked up in Changbai county, close to China’s 880-mile border with North Korea. For runaways who make it across the Tumen river, which meanders between the two countries, Changbai is often the starting point of a punishing six-week odyssey to freedom in South Korea. Others have been caught thousands of miles to the south-west, along China’s sparsely populated borders with Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Sokeel Park, whose group, Liberty in North Korea, helps escapees, said some were being captured just as they prepared to cross out of China into the relative safety of south-east Asia. “It feels almost vindictive when they catch people there and send them back … They’re nearly out and they are clearly refugees trying to get to South Korea. If you just let them cross into south-east Asia then it isn’t going to be your problem any more.” Human Rights Watch said this summer’s detentions included 11 children, four elderly women and a baby born in custody. In the most disturbing case, one North Korean family of five reportedly killed themselves after being caught. China, North Korea’s key ally and trading partner, dismissed what it called “groundless” claims about its crackdown. “North Koreans who enter China’s territory illegally cannot be called refugees. They came to China via illegal means, violated Chinese laws and border regulations,” said a foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, claiming China treated such people in accordance with domestic and international law and “humanitarian principles”. Ji Seong-ho, a Seoul-based defector who is campaigning against the detentions, said there was nothing humane or principled about China’s actions. “It pains me to see these people who are looking for freedom being stopped along the way … For these people it is liberty or death,” he said. While the rhetorical rumpus between the “dotard” US president and North Korea’s “rocket man” has dominated global headlines, Park said the world needed to refocus its attention on the human tragedy unfolding in the shadows. “North Korea is not just this crazy guy with missiles. There are 24 million people involved. There is a very urgent need for a bit of a reality check here.” More than 20,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea over the last decade, according to official statistics, most via what is called Asia’s “underground railroad”. This railroad – a hidden network of safehouses and smugglers, named after the system fugitives slaves used in 19th-century America – spirits defectors across China into south-east Asia and then, finally, on to Seoul where they can claim citizenship. Park said the number of annual arrivals had almost halved since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011, from up to 3,000 during the final five years of the reign of his father, Kim Jong-il, to less than 1,500. That number looks set to fall even further, with only 593 arrivals in the first six months of 2017. “It could be really low this year [and] I think the major factor is the security in China,” said Park. Ji, who was born and raised in Hoeryong, a city near North Korea’s border with China, knows well the hardships involved in a ride on the underground railroad. He fled across the Tumen in 2006 and began a 6,000-mile, three-month quest for freedom that took him through China, Myanmar and Laos and eventually on to Thailand, from where he flew to Seoul. “It’s a very cruel game of life or death,” said Ji, a double-amputee who used a crutch to heave himself on eight-hour treks through the jungle and remembers thinking: “This is how I’m going to die.” Ji has helped about 250 North Koreans make the same journey since becoming an activist and said the risks had increased dramatically since his escape, with China now trying to strangle smuggling networks. Do Hee-young, another Seoul-based activist, said Chinese police were carrying out raids thousands of miles from the North Korean border, targeting not just fugitives but also farmers and unskilled labourers who had lived in China for years. He claimed it was doing so at the behest of Kim Jong-un. “[Kim] feels defectors are a threat to the regime because they are a sign that people are giving up on the country,” he said. Park said he suspected Beijing – which has backed tightened UN sanctions against Kim’s regime – was cracking down to avoid further riling its longtime ally. “If China wasn’t arresting North Korean refugees and sending them back, I can see North Korea being even more upset … This is an extremely sensitive issue.” Daily NK claimed agents from North Korea’s state security ministry were using Life’s business hotel as a base to launch operations. Last year a defector was snatched from a Ming-dynasty stretch of China’s Great Wall, a short drive from Dandong’s picturesque riverfront. “The local atmosphere is very tense,” the source was quoted as saying. Staff at the three-star hotel rejected claims it counted North Korean spies among its guests as a fabrication. “We’re just a normal hotel,” said a sales manager who gave her name only as Ma. “We do take North Korean visitors, that’s true, but they do normal business … We’ve run the business for 10 years during which time there hasn’t been a single abduction,” she added. But the hotel would certainly provide good cover for Kim Jong-un’s agents. Each morning its 9th-floor breakfast hall – which has sweeping views over the China–North Korea Friendship Bridge and the North Korean city of Sinuiju – fills with North Korean guests. Many appear to be traders who chatter into smartphones and sport blue and red lapel pins featuring the portraits of North Korea’s “eternal president” Kim Il-sung, and his son, the “dear leader” Kim Jong-il. The hotel’s North Korean occupants are not ones for small talk. “I don’t understand. I don’t understand,” one man, wearing immaculately polished shoes, black, flared trousers and the trademark Kim Il-sung badge, told the Guardian in broken Chinese when it tried to strike up conversation over coffee and kimchi. Outside the hotel’s vanilla-scented lobby, a sign seemed to taunt the refugees who had been thwarted in their bid to outrun Kim’s agents. “New hotel. New life,” it said.

The known circumstances of the death raise the possibility that it was one of Australia’s youngest suicide cases. The boy was found behind his home, weeks after an uncle killed himself. Police investigators have deemed the death of the boy, in Emerald in the central highlands, was “non-suspicious” and are preparing a report for the coroner. But the Guardian has been told relatives of the boy believe his death was accidental. His family are receiving support from the National Indigenous Critical Response Service, which has been funded by the federal government since December. A police spokesman would not confirm the circumstances in which the boy was found or whether investigators were examining the possibility of suicide. The youngest confirmed cases of suicide have involved an Indigenous girl aged nine in remote South Australia in 2012, and an Indigenous boy of the same age in Broome in 1998. Earlier this year in remote central Australia, three Indigenous children – the youngest six years old – attempted suicide together, suicide researcher Gerry Georgatos told the Guardian. Georgatos said child suicides were rising “and they’re getting younger”. Indigenous children make up 30% of those below 17 and 80% of those below 12. “To lose children at 9, 10, 11 should be unimaginable but there is a crisis in this nation that is getting worse,” he said. “This horrific toll is an abomination – moral and political.” A coronial inquest into the suicides of 13 young Indigenous people – five of them aged 10 to 13 – in Western Australia’s north over less than four years heard in June that the problem had “reached disturbing proportions”. Georgatos said a common factor in Indigenous suicides across the country was that “nearly 100% of the suicides were of people living below the poverty line”. The suicide rate in Indigenous people living above the poverty line was less than that among non-Indigenous, he said. • Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14.

The CSIRO has been listed as an “associate member” of the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) since at least 2004 and new documents obtained by the Australian Institute, under freedom of information laws, show that in 2017 the “annual subscription” for membership was just under $10,000. The mining lobby plays a vocal role in Australian climate change policy debates and the positions it takes are on the extreme end of the spectrum and include pushing for more coal power stations to be built. The CSIRO continues to be a member of the MCA despite even Australia’s biggest climate polluter, AGL, publicly parting ways with the Minerals Council of Australia in 2016, saying it did so because of the positions the MCA took on climate change. “AGL’s positions on climate change and renewable energy differed from those held by the Minerals Council of Australia ... and AGL has elected not to renew its membership,” the company said in its 2016 sustainability report. CSIRO declined to answer specific questions about how long it had been a member, what the cost had been and what the CSIRO got in return for membership. A CSIRO spokesman instead gave a statement, published in full below. The executive director of the Australia Institute, Ben Oquist, said: “The Minerals Council has been on the fringe of the climate and energy debate in Australia, opposing policies that would tackle emissions effectively. “It defies commonsense that the CSIRO, an organisation that researches climate change and develops renewable technology, gives money to a lobby group that campaigns against effective climate policy and against policies that would increase renewable energy.” CSIRO has come under fire in recent years for a perception it has not been giving fearless advice to the public and to government on climate-related issues. At the same time, the organisation has cracked down on employees who themselves seek to speak publicly on policy issues. Internal CSIRO emails leaked earlier this year show significant internal unrest over CSIRO’s failure to make a submission to the government’s consultation on greenhouse gas emissions targets in 2009. In one email, a CSIRO executive said it didn’t provide a submission because the “questions posed in the discussion paper are very policy-focused”. She said CSIRO would engage government agencies behind closed doors. But Oquist said one of MCA’s main functions is to lobby to change government policy. “In its 2013 annual report the MCA boasts it ‘was at the forefront of the debates over the carbon and mining taxes; and their abolition (expected after July 2014) will be in no small part due to the council’s determined advocacy on both issues’,” Oquist said. “While the commonwealth’s key scientific research organisation effectively funds political advocacy for the coal industry, it works to prohibit its own staff from commenting on national science policy.” John Church, a world-leading climate scientist who was made redundant in the organisation’s 2016 job cuts and who was one of the disgruntled employees in the leaked emails, told the Guardian CSIRO’s membership of the MCA was in contradiction to its refusal to engage in policy debates. “I would definitely say there was a conflict,” Church said. “CSIRO is putting itself in a position where it is implicitly supporting particular policy positions by being a member of the Minerals Council. “They should not only be independent but be seen to be independent.” A senior climate scientist still at the CSIRO told the Guardian that currently it is almost impossible for climate scientists there to speak publicly about policy. David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne and a former member of the government’s Climate Change Authority, said: “It’s a small amount of money but it is odd in my view that they are spending this level of funding on an organisation that is arguing against the conclusions the CSIRO has made about the science of climate change.” When asked about AGL’s move to quit the MCA, Tim Nelson, AGL’s head of economics, policy and sustainability, told the Guardian: “We think there’s a strong opportunity for all corporates and industry associations to document a very scientific approach to how they see the consistency of their industry and their business with the 2C goal that Australia has signed up to.” The Minerals Council of Australia website says “full membership” is given to companies “directly involved in mining, prospecting or contracting activities relating to the obtaining, concentrating, smelting ore refining of minerals.” They say “associate membership”, such as that held by the CSIRO, “is open to companies which carry on as their principal business the supply of equipment, materials, services or capital to a company eligible for full membership.” Other public organisations with associate membership of MCA include ANSTO Minerals and the University of Western Australia. A CSIRO spokesman gave the following statement: CSIRO has a long history collaborating with professional societies and bodies including industry associations. Memberships are an important part of our dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders by allowing us to build networks, share research results, collaborate on research projects, and generally help ensure the relevance and uptake of our research. No organisation we are a member of has authority to speak or act on behalf of CSIRO. Further, as standard practice CSIRO officers must work within relevant policies to ensure our independence and impartially. For example, they cannot comment on policies of the government, opposition or any other political parties; or outside of their areas of expertise in their interactions with any industry body. An MCA spokesman said: “The MCA represents Australia’s mining industry as part of its contribution to sustainable development, economic growth and social and community affairs. “As outlined on our website, full membership of the MCA is available to businesses involved in mining, prospecting or contracting activities while associate membership is open to groups providing equipment, materials, services or capital to mining companies.” ANSTO Minerals, part of the government-owned Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is also an associate member of the Minerals Council and a spokesman said ANSTO was a member of the Uranium Forum of the MCA and also sits on the radiation protection working group. “These are forums through which we provide advice on all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle including safety, compliance, radiation management, efficiency, and international best practice,” the spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/06/is-peter-dutton-a-fit-and-proper-person-to-wield-such-awesome-new-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T18:00:09Z","webTitle":"Is Peter Dutton a fit and proper person to wield such awesome powers? | Richard Ackland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/06/is-peter-dutton-a-fit-and-proper-person-to-wield-such-awesome-new-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/06/is-peter-dutton-a-fit-and-proper-person-to-wield-such-awesome-new-powers","fields":{"headline":"Is Peter Dutton a fit and proper person to wield such awesome powers?","bodyText":"How un-Australian can you get? Lawyers providing pro bono services to refugees are hopelessly “un-Australian”, according to Peter Dutton, the minister for immigration and border protection. Yet, the minister’s crass joke about Pacific island nations being threatened by rising sea waters is not un-Australian, nor are comments about “illiterate ... innumerate” refugees taking Australian jobs; or describing a female reporter in the Canberra press gallery as a “mad fucking witch”; or refusing an abortion to a pregnant asylum seeker after she had been raped. They all meet Australian standards, according to Dutton’s skewed grasp of decency. This year he tried to reset the rule of law in a way more favourable to his doggedly inflexibility and boundless ambition. He declared that members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal were ideologically motived and for good measure Queensland magistrates were “hopeless leftwing softies”. This from a minister who is out of his depth when it comes to understanding how the AAT functions in immigration and refugee cases (among other things he believes the tribunal hands down “sentences”). It’s a lack of understanding not confined to his job as immigration minister but harks back to his time as health minister where a survey of doctors found Dutton to be the worst health minister in 35 years. Quite apart from questions about his ability there are issues of character that go to the way he exercises his overreaching authority. There is a real question whether someone so devoid of empathy is a fit and proper person to be handed wide, discretionary and unreviewable powers as the new minister for home affairs. Liberty Victoria described his current responsibilities as minister for immigration and border protection as “problematic ministerial powers” or the “God powers”. He has wide discretions over people’s lives with limited or no options for review or challenge. He can send people to indefinite offshore or onshore detention, he can turn boats back at sea, he can hold people on the high seas, he can grant visas, he can deny visas, and he can send people back to places they are fleeing. His current portfolio goes beyond immigration and refugee matters, extending to tariff classifications, imports, exports, customs, citizenship and security at airports and ports. The portfolio of immigration and border protection vests this minister with the greatest number of ministerial public interest or national interest powers: 47 in total, according to Liberty Victoria’s study. Dutton is responsible for the administration of 20 acts or parts of acts. The attorney general, on the other hand, is responsible for 152 acts, yet his public interest or national interest discretionary powers at 38 are fewer than Dutton’s. To get an idea of the comparable scale of authority, the defence portfolio is responsible for the administration of one more piece of legislation than the minister for immigration and border protection, and yet there are only two public interest or national interest powers that come within the authority of the defence minister and three for the prime minister. Thirteen years ago, a Senate select committee found “there was a pressing need for reform” of ministerial discretions under the Migration Act. The committee said: ... vesting a non-delegable, non-reviewable and non-compellable discretion with the immigration minister without an adequate accountability mechanism creates both the possibility and perception of corruption. Dutton is in a league of his own with the discretionary powers he can exercise as immigration minister – without accountability or transparency. As home affairs minister the range and reach of his discretions over people’s lives will expand alarmingly. The details of the ministerial arrangements have not yet been settled, but we do know that the new home affairs portfolio will retain immigration and border protection and will take from the attorney general’s and justice departments, the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation and the Australian federal police. Also to be transferred to home affairs from the attorney general’s department are the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, the Australian Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre, Emergency Management Australia including the Crisis Coordination Centre, the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Critical Infrastructure Centre. The Office of Transport Security will also be shifted to Dutton from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. It is not certain at this stage whether the terrorism provisions under the Criminal Code 1995 or under division 3A of the Crimes Act will also go to home affairs and Dutton. Canberra-based law researcher Peta Leigh has identified the powers under the Asio Act that the minister can exercise, including: Issuing warrants if he has reasonable grounds for believing that Asio’s access to premises will assist intelligence collection. This extends to personal frisk searches and the removal and retention of records and computer data – section 25(2). Issuing specific computer access warrants – section 25A. Issuing surveillance device warrants, which includes the tracking of a person and surveillances of places where the target is believed to be located – section 26. Authorising the inspection of postal articles – section 27. Warrants to service providers, including internet service providers, to deliver contents and articles – section 27AA. Identified person warrants, giving Asio access to records, computer data, use of surveillance devices, and access to postal articles – “for any time period”. Section 27C. Dutton will be able to issue warrants for questioning and detention in police custody. Then there is the Australian federal police where Dutton as the responsible minister will be able to give directions to the commissioner “with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of functions by the AFP”. It’s all together too awesome an array of powers in the hands of one person, made all the more dangerous by this minister’s lack of understanding and respect for the rule of law. The minister parades this insistence on the absoluteness of his authority in the name of “keeping Australians safe”. Safe from what? Certainly we’re not safe from his autocratic tendencies.

Populated areas of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have been marked “red” in the 2017 Southern Australia Seasonal Bushfire Outlook. Weather experts and commissioners from each state’s rural fire services gathered in Sydney on Tuesday, warning residents in all states to be prepared for what is set to be a bad bushfire season. The outlook said most of Australia had above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall over winter and this had contributed to an elevated fire risk for the bulk of eastern and south Australian coasts. Australia has had its ninth driest winter on record, said Bureau of Meteorology climatologist David Jones, which has left greater fuel loads across southern Australia. The outlook said the warmer and drier than average weather over recent months, combined with the forecasts for spring, suggest that the southern fire season was likely to commence earlier than usual and be more active than normal. “[The] dry conditions now mean that vegetation is already dry with very low greenness evident in satellite data,” the report said. “The dry state of vegetation means that warm, windy conditions are likely to see more elevated fire risk than is normal for the time of year.” While the bureau expects more average rainfall levels in spring, it may not happen until well into the season. The bureau has previously said Australia is set for a warm and dry spring with above-average temperatures expected for most parts of the country. After a string of balmy winter weeks, the chance of higher spring daytime temperatures is greater in the north and south-east of the country, it said.

It means the Turnbull government will have to dump its controversial package or make substantial changes, throwing its citizenship crackdown into disarray. The NXT’s decision follows weeks of public hearings about the government’s legislation, during which senators were warned repeatedly the legislation could deter people from applying for Australian citizenship. The NXT senator Stirling Griff said that after weeks of hearings it was clear the government’s reforms were an attempt “to fix problems that don’t exist”. “A number of the witnesses during the inquiry pretty much suggested the legislation was all about One Nation, about the Liberals cosying up to One Nation,” Griff told Guardian Australia on Tuesday. “There are components, yes, that I think with some revision we’d be prepared to support ... but [the bill] definitely needs to be split.” The Turnbull government had to secure the NXT’s three Senate votes to get its package through the Senate, because Labor and the Greens had vowed to oppose the bill, so it needed the support of 10 out of 12 crossbenchers. The shadow immigration minister, Tony Burke, welcomed the decision by NXT to reject the government’s bill. “Labor welcomes the news today that the Nick Xenophon Team will also oppose the government’s harmful and snobbish proposed changes to Australian citizenship legislation,” Burke said on Tuesday. “This legislation was never about national security, it was never about integration and the government should announce it will not be proceeding with it.” The Turnbull government’s proposed citizenship changes would increase the waiting times for permanent residents before they could apply for citizenship (from one year to four years) and force new applicants to complete a tougher English-language test (and achieve a pass mark of 75%) equivalent to level 6 of the international English language testing system (IELTS). It would also give Dutton the power to overrule decisions on citizenship applications by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) if he didn’t think the decisions were in the national interest, and give him power to decide whether or not the applicant had integrated into the Australian community. Griff had warned in June that he was “deeply worried” about the power the bill would give Dutton to overrule citizenship decisions by the AAT without judicial review. “That’s very much a first,” he said at the time. “We don’t feel comfortable at all with that … that’s something we certainly won’t be supporting in any form.” Griff said he was still concerned about that element of the legislation, because it would give far too much power to the executive. Asked which elements of the legislation the Nick Xenophon Team would support if they were revised, Griff listed the Australian values test, the English language test and the pathways for people to achieve citizenship. “Those components I think can be easily sorted,” he said. “But, as a complete package, in a package that gives the immigration minister and executive unfettered control [over AAT decisions], that’s where the whole thing’s frightening.” Fiona McLeod, the president of the Law Council of Australia, also welcomed NXT’s rejection of the bill. “I’m pleased that the evidence we gave to the parliamentary committee expressing our concerns has been picked up,” she said. “We had grave concerns about the extension of the minister’s personal powers to override the AAT. That override seemed to be without justification and erodes the principle of the separation of powers. “We had a further concern about the retrospective application of the amendments, which are contrary to sound principles about how you design good laws. “I think this points to the strength of the parliamentary committee process that there’s an opportunity for closer scrutiny of pieces of legislation, and it points to the need for government sometimes to consult broadly with interested bodies who can make suggestions about how to improve pieces of legislation.” NXT’s announcement came hours before a parliamentary committee, chaired by the Liberal Queensland senator Ian Macdonald, released a report recommending the government weaken elements of the legislation, including watering down its proposed English-language requirements for people seeking citizenship. Macdonald has urged the government to “clarify” the standard for its proposed English language test, saying the standard “should not be so high as to disqualify from citizenship many Australians who, in the past, and with a more basic competency in the English language, have proven to be valuable members of the Australian community”. He also urged the government to include some “transitional provisions” to ensure people who already in the process of getting citizenship were not caught out by the changes and to also reconsider the imposition of a two-year ban on applications for citizenship following three failed attempts of the citizenship test. Burke said citizenship “shouldn’t be about politics”. “Citizenship is about who we are as a nation and these proposed changes are a direct attack on Australia as a modern multicultural country,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/05/county-cricket-warwickshire-v-somerset-yorkshire-v-middlesex-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T17:15:31Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Duckett smashes 193, Somerset fight back against Warks - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/05/county-cricket-warwickshire-v-somerset-yorkshire-v-middlesex-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/05/county-cricket-warwickshire-v-somerset-yorkshire-v-middlesex-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Duckett smashes 193, Somerset fight back against Warks - as it happened","bodyText":"Right, rain ruled today. I’m off to Manchester this evening to watch the top two sides do battle tomorrow. Hopefully the weather is better, all over the place. Somerset fought back nicely against Warwickshire here, while Duckett was brilliant at Wantage Road by all accounts. Here’s where we are. Division One: Somerset 203-4 v Warwickshire Surrey 16-0 v Hampshire No play between Lancashire and Essex No play between Yorkshire and Middlesex Division Two: Notts 188-9 v Worcestershire Northants 329-5 v Sussex Durham 61-4 v Kent Leicestershire 90-4 v Gloucestershire No play between Derbyshire and Glamorgan Cross your fingers and your toes for more play tomorrow! Wicket with the last ball of the day at Wantage Road. One young-ish former England left-arm spinner, Briggs, gets another young-ish former England left-arm spinner, the loanee nightwatchman Kerrigan. Northants close on 329 for five thanks to Duckett’s brilliant 193. Stumps at the Riverside! Durham are 61 for four. Very useful 32 overs for Kent’s hopes of promotion. Now they need the rain to stay away... Durham now 53 for four... Milne gets Colly. Still going at the Riverside (Durham 51 for three) and Wantage Road (Northants 319 for four). Duckett gone for 193, just shy of his second double ton against Sussex in as many seasons. Caught and bowled by Briggs, and Northants are 317 for four. And we are going off, by the looks of things. Somerset had just brought up their first batting bonus point with a cover drive from Davies, and we are off for light. Probably right with, err, Wright bowling. 203 for four. Drop! Davies has driven Wright straight to Jeetan close in at point and he’s dropped it! Didn’t seem to pick it up. Am surprised Wright is allowed to bowl, to be honest. We can play til six, and the umpires are even letting a quickie bowl! Chris Wright to have a go from the Pavilion End. 199 for four. Approaching the end of the day at Edgbaston – supsect we will play til 6 but there is just one scheduled over left – and I’d say Somerset are in a tidy position at 198 for four. Abell has 38, Davies 34. Jennings out to Mitch Claydon at the Riverside! He battled for 90 minutes for his 17 and Kent have Durham 35 for two. Stumps at Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 188 for nine. Getting a wee bit dark at Edgbaston. Umpires having a chat. Would think light might come on, and we have spin from both ends again. Just fantastic. 50 stand up between Davies and Abell... Playing nicely. Duckett is on the move... Rain at Trent Bridge! 188 for nine, just had two wickets in two balls. And now Notts are nine down! Direct hit gets Hutton. Ball and Gurney the last men standing... 188 for nine. Serious good, this lad. Notts are eight down. Leach gets Taylor... 188 for eight. Shot! Abell sweeps Sunny Singh for six behind square. Poor Big Keef is off in the Hollies looking for it. 158 for four. An all-Kiwi wicket at Durham! Milne gets Latham. Durham 19 for one. It’s rather nice here in Birmingham, too! Still cloudy, but light and dry. That’s that at the Ageas. What a frustrating day down there! Five overs early doors, then nothing. Surrey 16 without loss and back they will come tomorrow. Stumps at Leicester. The hosts are 90 for four against the Glosters. Wicket! Oh dear. Hildreth has played the flakiest little innings there. Sunny Singh has tossed one up, it’s turning and he’s taken Hildreth’s edge! Troddy does the rest at slip. He made 33. Somerset 131 for four, and Steve Davies, lovely Steve Davies, joins Abell. Tongue gets Read caught and bowled! 171 for seven are Notts. Sense that won’t be Read’s last innings at Trent Bridge.... A century for Ben Duckett! That’s his third of the season. Class act, that boy. 128 balls, and arrives with his 13th four. Northants 180 for two. They are on their way back out here at Edgbaston. Somerset 117 for three. Raining again at the Ageas... Tea at Edgbaston! Somerset 117 for three with Hildreth and Abell together. 30 overs left in the day. Let’s hope it doesn’t rain again. Paul Coughlin’s side strain is going to keep him out for the season, I’m told. Wood playing for Durham, then. Good news. Wicket! Lord Byrom just reverse swept Sunny Singh for four. But he tried again, got a wee top edge and is caught at slip! Somerset are 114 for three. Durham: Latham, Jennings, Steel, Clark, Collingwood (c), Richardson (wk), Pringle, Wood, Weighell, Rushworth, Onions Kent: Bell-Drummond, Dickson, Denly, Northeast (c), Billings (wk), Crawley, Stevens, Haggett, Milne, Qayyum, Claydon Paul Coughlin’s side strain keeping him out, I presume. A theoretical 4.15pm restart at the Ageas, but every time they have looked like getting on again it’s rained. So my hopes are not up. Kent sack off the toss, and bowl first. Start in 20. The man who hit it over the Lord’s Pav! 4pm start at Durham! Toss soon. 100 up for Somerset in a hurry. Spin from both ends. Bell under the lid at leg slip. Rain at Leicester... Tea at Wantage Road, where Northants are 144 for two. Duckett has 84. The Woosters have Notts on the rack. They are 135 for six as Read strides out after Tongue gets Hales... Wessels gone for a duck! Notts 121 for five. Barnard has four. Good thing Taylor is coming in at No7... So George Bartlett, batting No3 on first-class debut, got off the mark with a reverse-swept four off Jeetan. You’ll do, son... But now he’s gone! The Other Ryan Sidebottom straight through him with a quicker ball! 72 for two... Barnard has Samit and Notts are 117 for four... Hales 24 off 22, joined by his mate Wessels. Duckett has raced to 75. When he’s hot he’s really hot... The Other Ryan Sidebottom coming on here. My first look at him. Here come cricketers! Rain has stopped. Covers coming up. Play starting in a couple of minutes and, I believe, 46 overs left in the day. Really light rain and the covers are going back on. Mop up continues. Destroys! Steady on, lads. Two in an over at Trent Bridge! Barnard gets Pujara now! 82 for three. Hales in. Samit’s in at Trent Bridge. Ed Barnard - the Worcester Woakes - gets Jake Libby for 34. Notts 82 for two. A wicket at Wantage Road, as Wiese gets Newton. IVA Wakely in and Northants are 51 for one. Play at the Ageas at 2.45! Play at Edgbaston at 2.50! 50 for Ben Duckett! He loves playing Sussex. 282 not out against them at Wantage Road last year. Took 70 balls, with six fours. Northants 86 without loss. Play abandoned for the day at Headingley! If that’s a draw, a result here would suddenly be massive... Covers coming off! Inspection completed. More as I get it... Off for rain at Trent Bridge with Somerset 70 for one. Clear up already underway here! Looks like the rain has stopped, thankfully... Here he comes... 2.15 inspection at the Ageas. Here at Edgbaston, it’s already much brighter but the rain is still falling. Half an hour of this and we might be done for the day. All of a sudden it’s absolutely belting it down here at Edgbaston. Full covers on. This wasn’t forecast. Dave Fulton is one of the great men. Rain stops play. Bit too much of the wet stuff about, and we are off after 45 mins of play. Somerset 51 for one. Hopefully just a passing shower. George Bartlett in for the first time in the Championship. Turn for Jeetan... This is effectively a second day pitch after there were 120 overs on it on Saturday. Play abandoned at Derby between Derbyshire and Glamorgan. Too much rain. Wicket! Patel strikes! Tres looks to cut and edges through to Ambrose. Bit close, bit full for it. Gone for 28, and Somerset are 51 for one in the 10th. Bit of rain in the air, as Tres gets his second boundary of the Barker over to bring up Somerset’s 50... Eighth over of the match, and Jeetan Patel is on... Somerset 38 for none. Good news! Now Norwell gets Carberry! Leics 20 for two. Lord Byrom is a lovely straight driver. His second, both just on the offside, takes him to 13. Somerset 30 for none, with Tres on 17 and looking good. They are off for rain already at Trent Bridge, where Notts are 24 for one. Norwell got Dearden early at Grace Road. Leics 11 for one. Worcestershire immediately among the wickets. Mullaney gone to Leach - 10 for one. Here come cricketers at Edgbaston! Same pitch as finals day. Tres and Lord Byrom opening for Somerset, Big Keef Barker with the ball. Cricket underway at both Trent Bridge and Wantage Road, and we are nearly there here too... Inspection at 2pm at Edinglee. Stumps at Old Trafford! Everyone loves an early call-off. I will go there tomorrow to see what happens, I think. Teams from Wantage Road. Northants: Duckett, Newton, Wakely*, Levi, Cobb, Proctor, Murphy+, Kleinveldt, Kerrigan, Gleeson, Azharullah Sussex: Robson, Wells, van Zyl, Nash, Wright, Brown*+, Jordan, Wiese, Robinson, Archer, Briggs The sun is out in Birmingham! Here’s the Worcestershire XI, with the most important name last. Mitchell, D’Oliveira, Fell, Clarke, Rhodes, Ashwin, Cox, Barnard, Leach, Tongue, Shantry. Here’s the Notts team they are playing. Read’s last game at Trent Bridge. *weeps*. Samit one of just four bowlers! That’s a lot of batting. Mullaney, Libby, Pujara, Patel, Hales, Wessels, Taylor, Read, Hutton, Ball, Gurney Play at Leicestershire at 1.10pm. Confirmation that Somerset won the toss and are batting first. George Bartlett debuts for them. 24 overs lost. Warwickshire: Umeed, Sibley, Trott (c), Bell, Lamb, Ambrose (wk), Barker, Patel, Wright, Sidebottom, Singh. Somerset: Trescothick, Byrom, Bartlett, Hildreth, Abell (c), Davies (wk), Coverton, Bess, Leach, Groenewald, van Meekeren. So, two spinners each, and a bowler at No7. ALL HAIL KING SHANTRY Sounds like they tried to start again at the Ageas... and then it rained again. Play starting at 1pm at Trent Bridge and Wantage Road. Both have had no toss. Sussex opted to field first against Northants, and Worcestershire opted to do the same against Notts. We’ve just had a toss here so reckon we could even start at 1pm. Think Warwickshire are having a bowl. Play due to start at 1.10pm at Edgbaston! Toss at 12.40, then... Just one game, and five overs possible. Sad face. Surrey 16-0 v Hampshire Lunch now being taken at the Ageas. So we have had a grand total of five overs bowled all morning! Anyone? Good news from all over the place! Suspect a similar situation here. Ah, lovely! A 1pm start at Northampton... It’s the Spin! From the Ageas. Well, the sun is almost out. And the covers are being taken off! I don’t think it is. But I would want to keep up the five-match winning streak! Inspection at noon at Grace Road... Steven Finn signed a new deal with Middlesex, by the way. Lanky fans, stand down! And now the covers are going back on at the Ageas... Tease. Restart at 11.20 at the Ageas! Look at this! No play before lunch here. Will be taken at 12, and I reckon should the rain stay away we have a decent chance of getting on 12.40 or 1pm. Second teams getting rained off too. Oh for pete’s sake. We now officially have no action anywhere. Jon Short emails with a question! It’s a good one. By foregoing the right to bowl first Surrey has clearly indicated their choice is to bat. If Hampshire is electing to field the toss is a foregone conclusion so why bother with it? Should the toss only take place when both teams intend to bat first? I suppose there’s space for a touch of totally pointless bluffery. When Surrey choose to toss it’s just going through the motions. Sounds like a day when both batting – good deck, being the Ageas – and bowling – overcast – have their merit. Might as well still chuck the coin up. Surrey are 13 without loss. No play before lunch at Headingley. Mop up well underway at Edgbaston, and Trotty is ambling out to have a look. So Surrey are 3 without loss against Hampshire in the one game that is happening. Worse ways to spend a rain delay. Looks like the rain has stopped in Birmingham and there’s a wee bit of a mop-up operation taking place. Puddles on the outfield but as, cricinfo’s George Dobell (the uncrowned king of Edgbaston) will tell you, the drainage here really is spectacular. Teams at the Ageas! Hampshire: Adams, Weatherley, Alsop+, Vince, Bailey*, Ervine, Dawson, Holland, Berg, Abbott, Edwards Surrey: Burns, Patel, Borthwick, Roy, Foakes+, Pope, CurranT, Clarke, Batty*, Meaker, Dernbach. They’ve given Scurran a well-earned rest, then. Think that toss at the Ageas is the only one we’ve had! Rain everywhere else. Looking like an early lunch here at Edgbaston. The Glosters are in action Stuie! They are in Leicester, but it’s raining. Well, there’s been a toss at the Ageas. Hampshire won it and will field. No toss here. Well I came to Edgbaston to get away from the rain and ... it’s raining here too. Puddles on the outfield, but the rain not heavy. Hopefully get some cricket. Somerset, Warwickshire’s opponents, have confirmed that Jim Allenby, Ryan Davies and Michael Leask are leaving the club. Warwickshire have lost Will Porterfield and Cash in the Ateeq Javid too. Javid is going to Leicestershire. Good morning and welcome to another week of county cricket – live! With Finals Day done (that was fun, wasn’t it?), there are just 16 more days of Championship this summer. Cherish each and every one of them, even when the weather is pants. I think the weather is pants today, sadly. I’m Will Macpherson and I’ve faithfully chugged my way back to Edgbaston. Why Edgbaston, I hear you say? Well, that pants weather I mentioned, is hovering low over Manchester, where I was supposed to be. The forecast for Birmingham is not perfect, but it’s a damned sight better than Manchester today. The nascent plan is to pop up to Manchester tonight and stay there for the rest of the week. But I’ll have my eye on the forecast and the state of this game, don’t you worry. It’s September now, so don’t forget we have earlier starts! Toss at 10, tee off at 10.30. This is an odd and special week in the Champo, because the top 10 ranked teams are playing each other, in order. In Division One it’s Lancashire (2nd) v Essex (1st), Hampshire (3rd) v Surrey (4th), Yorkshire (6th) v Middlesex (5th), and Warwickshire (8th) v Somerset (7th). The top two Division Two sides face off at Trent Bridge, too: Nottinghamshire v Worcestershire. There are at least two other tasty games in that Division. Northants (5th) host Sussex (3rd), while Kent (4th) travel to Durham, who would be sixth, were it not for you-know-what. Leicestershire, having pied off Pierre de Bruyn, host Gloucestershire, and Glamorgan are at Derby. What fun! Team and toss news ASAP. Some reading for you! Don McRae meets Chris Lewis. Unsurprisingly excellent. You can contact me! Here are the three ways you can do that. Below The Line (play nicely) in my inbox at will.macpherson.freelance@theguardian.com on the twitters @willis_macp I greatly look forward to hearing from you! Do not hold back.

The protests have already started. As a Bahraini living in exile in Britain, I’ve previously joined them. I’m far from happy that Bahraini officials can pop over to London to do their weapons shopping when security forces are shooting peaceful protesters back in Bahrain. Yet, as things stand I’m not sure how safe it will be for me or my family if I go to Docklands and hold up a protest placard. That’s because I’m one of a number of Bahrainis in the UK who are suffering reprisals whenever we put our heads above the parapet. When the Bahraini king Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa visited the UK last October, I took part in a small street protest as his motorcade cruised into Downing Street. For this I was briefly arrested and released without charge. The next day, on 27 October, I got a 5am telephone call from my mother-in-law in Bahrain. She was sobbing down the line. “They’ve taken Duaa. They arrested her, and they took Yousif away too.” This was my wife and my 18-month-old son. About to board a plane back to Britain after a family visit, they’d been pulled aside at the departure lounge in Bahrain International airport. Security proceeded to intimidate my wife in a seven-hour interrogation. I was referred to as an “animal”, my wife was assaulted and it was made clear to her that she wouldn’t be leaving the country and might face criminal charges. This seemed to me a clear reprisal after my protest on British soil just hours earlier. On this occasion, the Bahraini authorities backed down. My son is an American citizen and US diplomatic pressure combined with media coverage led to the authorities letting them out of the country a few days later. But my family is still far from safe. In March, my wife’s mother, brother and cousin were all arrested. Again, the interrogation revolved around my activities in the UK. They were tortured into “confessing” their involvement in “planting fake bombs”. It’s a complete fabrication – I’m the real target. Unable to arrest me, they’ve targeted my extended family. I have relatives still in prison. One would think this kind of behaviour would ring alarm bells in Britain. Shouldn’t the government be asking serious questions about all this? Isn’t intimidating a resident of Britain an outrage that flies in the face of British values of free speech and democracy? Apparently not if it means ruffling feathers in the Gulf. A few weeks after my wife’s arrest, Theresa May’s visit to Bahrain focused solely on security and trade. Human rights were ignored. Similarly, the Foreign Office’s recent human rights report referred to a “mixed picture” in Bahrain, enormously downplayed the seriousness of the human rights crackdown still prevailing in the country, and generally did its utmost to accentuate supposed positives. My family and I are not alone in feeling betrayed by the UK’s silences and doubletalk. When Nabeel Rajab, president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, was sentenced to two years in prison for giving media interviews, we watched as international condemnation of the silencing of a brave critic came in. The USA, Germany, Norway, the EU, the UN – all deplored the sentence and called for his release. But the UK stayed quiet. Weeks later, in response to a parliamentary question, a British minister merely said the UK had “noted” Rajab’s sentence. Giving Bahrain a free pass on abuses has consequences. The country’s National Security Agency was granted law enforcement powers in January. Activist Ebtisam Al-Sayegh was arrested and charged under anti-terrorism laws for reporting the rape and torture of another activist by its agents. Meanwhile, military courts have been empowered to prosecute civilians, torture victims have been executed, and five protesters were killed in a single day in May. The last major opposition party has also been dissolved and Bahrain’s only independent newspaper was forced to close in June. Amnesty International has recorded “disastrous decline” in human rights in the country over the past year. But no matter – the UK is invested in a story of a “reformist” Bahrain. Since 2012, the UK has spent more than £5m on public order training for Bahrain’s security forces and on advice over supposed accountability institutions. The results are tragically perverse: Bahrain’s abusers have been emboldened while the government-to-government contact has been presented by Manama’s well-oiled PR machine as evidence of “reform”. The UK’s unethical position on Bahrain is part and parcel of a wider, post-Brexit UK policy on the wealthy Gulf dictatorships. Why else would it also cosy up to rich but repressive Saudi Arabia, selling billions’ worth of arms despite the carnage this is creating in Yemen? Five years ago, I fled Bahrain after being arrested, tortured and prosecuted for speaking to journalists during the Arab spring. My campaigning work on human rights and democracy are anathema to the Bahraini authorities and I’ve been stripped of my citizenship and rendered stateless. I expected smears and reprisals against myself, but not my family. I’m still thinking of joining fellow protesters outside the DSEI arms fair. After all, the UK is a democracy and this right to peacefully protest is one of the things I most cherish about my new home. But isn’t it time the UK government stopped looking the other way when so-called friends in the Gulf target people for peacefully protesting in the heart of our own capital city? • Sayed Alwadaei is the director of advocacy at Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy in London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/05/tory-momentum-clone-activate-at-war-as-hackers-back-jacob-rees-mogg-for-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T11:43:51Z","webTitle":"Tory Momentum clone Activate at war as 'hackers' back Jacob Rees-Mogg for PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/05/tory-momentum-clone-activate-at-war-as-hackers-back-jacob-rees-mogg-for-pm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/05/tory-momentum-clone-activate-at-war-as-hackers-back-jacob-rees-mogg-for-pm","fields":{"headline":"Tory Momentum clone Activate at war as 'hackers' back Jacob Rees-Mogg for PM","bodyText":"It’s the grassroots political movement whose launch nobody could envy. Now, social media channels for Activate, the centre-right attempt to emulate Momentum’s youth appeal, appear to be at war with each other over backing for Jacob Rees-Mogg to be Britain’s next prime minister. On Twitter, the @ActivateBritain account has tweeted a string of anti-Theresa May images and issued an “official statement” endorsing the MP for North East Somerset as the next Conservative leader. They’ve even compared Rees-Mogg to Superman. Not that the replies on social media have always seen Rees-Mogg as a Clark Kent figure. However, all is not as it appears. Prior to these tweets appearing, Activate had tweeted that it had been subjected to a hacking attempt. The group’s Facebook page posted to say that the Twitter account was no longer under its control, and that the posts backing Rees-Mogg were not published by the campaign. Asked about the tweets, a spokesperson for the group stated: “Activate backs no individual politician, all claims to such are as a result of a hack on our Twitter account. We first lost access to the account on Thursday but were able to block out the hacker up until yesterday [Monday], when it seems he or she was able to circumvent our measures. We are in contact with both Twitter and the police and are hoping to regain access imminently.” Back on Twitter, meanwhile, the alleged hackers claimed that they do truly represent Activate and that, in fact, it was a pro-May faction who had hacked and seized the Facebook account. And so they’ve set up their own new Facebook page. Activate’s social media channels are not the only areas where there have been problems since last week’s launch. On its website visitors are able to donate to the group, which claims to be wholly independent of the Conservatives and that it intends to “reclaim the voice of young people in politics, bringing together individuals and groups in our education system, workplaces and communities”. Initially the website featured a league table of donations, which allowed people to place a name, or message, alongside their donation – including the names of Harold Shipman and Jimmy Savile. On its website, Activate claims that, it has not yet launched. Visitors to activate.uk.net are greeted with a pop-up saying: “The recent media attention we have received was not courted by us, but was in fact a response to the orchestrated attack on Activate and the individuals who helped form the movement that Activate was born out of.” The attack referred to was a leak to the Guido Fawkes website of screenshots from a WhatsApp group, where young activists were making jokes about “gassing chavs”. Activate has disassociated itself from the comments, stating: “None of the people included in those messages currently have any seniority with the organisation. We are working on ensuring that the people in question are removed from the group as a whole, if still members.” The group’s initial foray into social media was widely derided for crudely including hashtags such as #retweet and #meme within their messages, something being mocked by the people in control of the account. Activate initially tweeted as @Activate_uk_net, then changed its username to @ActivateBritain. This immediately allowed a parody account to squat on the old name, which was still being linked to by the group’s official website. Other imitators popped up on social media with deliberately badly executed campaign images. The entire launch appears to have been so badly managed that it’s still possible to believe that the whole thing has simply been an elaborate prank. Or perhaps a logic test."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/08/save-bondi-pavilion-the-battle-brewing-in-malcolm-turnbulls-backyard","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T18:00:16Z","webTitle":"Save Bondi Pavilion: the battle brewing in Malcolm Turnbull's backyard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/save-bondi-pavilion-the-battle-brewing-in-malcolm-turnbulls-backyard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/save-bondi-pavilion-the-battle-brewing-in-malcolm-turnbulls-backyard","fields":{"headline":"Save Bondi Pavilion: the battle brewing in Malcolm Turnbull's backyard","bodyText":"It’s election time in Malcolm Turnbull’s backyard, but all anyone can talk about is the pavilion. In the Waverley council chambers, the issue caused councillor Joy Clayton, a Liberal member since 1983, to cross the floor and vote against her own party. A furious local action group has drafted Michael Caton, Jack Thompson and Dave Faulkner from the Hoodoo Gurus, and is hitting the pavement on polling day. The Greens and Labor have printed 15,000 leaflets each, with the pavilion on the front, and a how-to-vote on the back. In the lead-up to Saturday’s council election, the opponents of current Liberal mayor, Sally Betts, are hungry for an upset in what should be Liberal heartland. The council sits within Malcolm Turnbull’s electorate of Wentworth, where he earned 62% of the primary vote in 2016. But campaigners think a proposal to sell the pavilion’s top floor could change things. Kilty O’Brien, a convenor of Save Bondi Pavilion group, says the famous beachfront building is about to be privatised, as the Liberal council is exploring ways to sell the top floor to developers. “We fear the community will be displaced,” she says. “There’s a plan to remove the community and the cultural activities that go on there at the moment. Bondi has a tonne of nice restaurants, we don’t need another nice restaurant. We need a strong and vibrant community centre.” Faulkner, a long-term Bondi resident, fears the “Westfield-isation” of a public asset. “The pavilion has always been the centre of community life. I’ve been living here since 1984. It’s been a hub of cultural activity. It’s basically our town hall. “You’re going to have basically half a community building suddenly become private business. What’s next, Prada downstairs?” Betts, the mayor, says the campaign against privatisation is scaremongering, based on a proposal that was never approved. “Nobody has ever moved a motion or suggested a motion about privatising the pavilion,” she says. “There just hasn’t ever been a decision. Some time, about a year ago, there was one report amongst many that looked at different options. It was only a report, nobody accepted or rejected it.” But the messaging around the future of the pavilion continues. In many ways, after council amalgamations were pulled, this year’s campaign has crystallised around the Bondi issue. Save Bondi Pavilion has asked every candidate to sign a pledge to never privatise the pavilion, and have promised to actively support any candidate who signs on. They have mobilised, printed flyers and drafted volunteers with the explicit aim of turning this election. “We have more likes on our Facebook page than Waverley council,” O’Brien says. “We intend to be working at all the booths, with a how-to-vote that says ‘vote Liberals last’.” On Saturday they plan to have 30 to 40 volunteers across all 15 booths from 8am to 6pm with 20,000 how-to-votes. They have staffed all this week’s pre-polling and have delivered 25,000 leaflets to local mailboxes. “We know it sounds very political,” O’Brien says. “But the election is a tool we need to win our campaign”. She says she’d do the same to torpedo Labor and the Greens if they ever took the same line as the Liberals. The Liberals have not signed the pledge but both Labor and the Greens have. The candidates are cagey about predictions, but Betts’s challengers are hoping the emergence of this new group will tip the scales their way. “I believe the Liberals in Waverley have lost the support of a large proportion of the residents,” says Labor councillor and former Waverley mayor John Wakefield. “Given the profile of the pavilion issue we expect a large number of people to give it consideration in deciding who to vote for. For Waverley Labor, the launch of our campaign was on our policies on the pavilion. We’ve produced 15,000 flyers.” Neither Wakefield, O’Brien nor any Greens campaign managers could point to any polling that showed a decline in the Liberal vote, citing only anecdotal evidence from voters and residents. Local council elections are notoriously hard to predict. But the pavilion has already endangered Betts’s majority in the council chamber. For more than a year, Joy Clayton’s stance has forced a tie on council, requiring Betts to use her casting vote to avoid an upset. And in a fractious meeting in May last year, the motions from which were later rescinded, the mayor lost every vote on the pavilion that was put forward. With Clayton and independent councillor Miriam Guttman-Jones joining them, and with Liberal councillor Andrew Cusack absent, Labor and the Greens passed motion 8.12, which called for a detailed breakdown of costs of the partial-privatisation plan; motion 8.6, which required the councils of neighbouring Woollahra and Randwick to approve any changes to the building; and motion 8.13, which asked to establish an independent trust to manage the pavilion. Clayton is not standing in Saturday’s election. Her place on the ticket has been taken by councillor Leon Goltsman. But campaigners point to Clayton’s votes as evidence that the plans are deeply unpopular in Bondi. In order to lose the mayoralty, the Liberals would need to lose two seats on council. Each ward elects three councillors, and Labor and the Greens are targeting Lawson and Waverley, which last election elected two Liberal councillors each, on a primary vote of 53%. They’re hoping that if the Liberal vote drops below 50%, they could seize the second seat in both wards. As an indicator, in Bondi ward the three parties have one councillor each on a vote split of 45% Liberal, 28% Greens and 25% Labor. For Lawson or Waverley to dip to that 45%, the Liberals would only need to lose 600 votes. If that happened in at least one ward, the council would sit at a tie and the mayor would be drawn out of a hat. Clayton is refusing to predict the outcome. She says she will continue to be a member of the Liberal party and will be handing out flyers for the party’s candidates in neighbouring Woollahra. She denies her crossing the floor was a “split” in any momentous sense. “I’ve crossed the floor a number of times in regards to my colleagues voting [but] I used my own judgment,” she said. Betts, similarly, is confident any ructions will die down. “I do not think the party will be in trouble,” she says. “I think we have done an amazing job, and if anyone looks at our record they will just vote us in again. “But it will be very sad if people are hoodwinked by Labor’s lies about the pavilion. The Labor party are conning them. If they succeed, they will take control of council.” In the event of a close tie where she holds the balance of power, Guttman-Jones would not be drawn on whether she would back Betts again. Labor and the Greens are hoping the pavilion issue will drive her to vote against the Liberals when it comes to picking the mayor. Either way, Guttman-Jones says she cannot predict what will happen. “Other times I’ve been able to call it, but not this time. I really can’t pick it.” But Wakefield has hope for Labor. “For us to regain the mayoralty and save the pavilion, we must take seats of the Liberals. I’ve been around a long time and am feeling confident but you can never know until the night.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/05/more-than-120000-rohingya-flee-myanmar-violence-un-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T17:50:52Z","webTitle":"UN chief urges Myanmar to end violence as 120,000 Rohingya flee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/05/more-than-120000-rohingya-flee-myanmar-violence-un-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/05/more-than-120000-rohingya-flee-myanmar-violence-un-says","fields":{"headline":"UN chief urges Myanmar to end violence as 120,000 Rohingya flee","bodyText":"The United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres, has appealed to Myanmar to end the violence that has led more than 120,000 Rohingya people to flee in the last two weeks, which he warned was “creating a situation that can destabilise the region”. The unrest has raised fears of a humanitarian crisis in overstretched border camps, with another 400,000 of the Muslim ethnic minority estimated to be trapped in conflict zones in western Myanmar since more “clearance operations” by security forces in Rakhine state began last month. Guterres told reporters he had written to the security council to express his concern. When asked about ethnic cleansing, Guterres said: “We are facing a risk, I hope we don’t get there.” UN aid agencies continue to be blocked from delivering food, water and medicine to the Rohingya, while humanitarian workers on the ground say warehouses stocking vital emergency supplies are being looted. As the international outcry over the crisis grew, an aid group that has been rescuing tens of thousands of refugees from the Mediterranean Sea announced it was redirecting its ship to south-east Asia. Migrant Offshore Aid Station said it was suspending its operations off the Libyan coast and sending the vessel to the Bay of Bengal. The Malta-based organisation, which has rescued about 40,000 refugees attempting to reach Europe in the last three years, said it would focus on providing aid on the Myanmar-Bangladesh border “where a deadly exodus is unfolding”. It cited Pope Francis’s appeals for an international response to the plight of the Rohingya people. The number of refugees fleeing Libya has dropped significantly since the country increased naval patrols and militia groups agreed to crack down on smuggling. The UN announced on Tuesday that the number of Rohingya to have reached Bangladesh in recent days was estimated to be 123,600. Up to 15,000 Rohingya refugees are expected to cross the Naf river into Bangladesh each day this week, joining the tens of thousands already taking shelter in overcrowded camps and makeshift settlements. Aid groups say supplies are rapidly falling while medical clinics are overwhelmed by a 40-50% increase in patients, some with serious injuries. Another estimated 20,000 people are stranded in the “no man’s land” between the two countries, having been denied entry by Bangladesh border guards, although thousands continue to cross through unguarded areas. The latest wave of refugees, the second significant surge in the past year, was sparked on 25 August after Rohingya militants attacked government forces, who responded with a counter-offensive that has killed hundreds. Refugees who have made it to Bangladesh have told of massacres and arson they say are being committed by armed forces. Human Rights Watch has cited satellite evidence of widespread burning in at least 10 parts of Rakhine state in the days after the armed crackdown began. The government has said rebels are burning their own villages and accused them of killing Buddhists and Hindus, a claim repeated by some residents. The Myanmar military said 400 people had been killed, the vast majority of them “terrorists”. UN officials have estimated the death toll at “around a thousand”. Media and independent observers are denied access to Rakhine and the figures cited by the government and Rohingya activists are impossible to verify. The Rohingya have been persecuted for decades in Myanmar but the recent violence is seen as a major escalation because of the scale of the destruction and the involvement of a new Rohingya militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. The UN estimated in May this year that since 2012 about 168,000 Rohingya had fled Myanmar, where the group is denied citizenship and access to basic government services. International pressure is growing on Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de-facto leader and a Nobel peace laureate, to intervene decisively and curb the military operations. More than 300,000 people have signed an online petition asking the Nobel committee to rescind the prize awarded in 1991 for her democratic activism during the years the country was run by a military junta. In recent years the military has relaxed its grip on the country but it remains an influential force and holds 25% of parliamentary seats. The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, said on Monday the situation in Rakhine state was “really grave” and it was time for Aung San Suu Kyi to step in. Lee said Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party won the country’s first free elections in a generation in 2015, was “caught between a rock and a hard spot. I think it is time for her to come out of that spot now.” A Burmese human rights group said on Tuesday that the persecution of Muslims in the Buddhist-majority state had grown in the last five years and extended beyond Rohingya people to include the creation of “Muslim-free zones” across the country. “The transition to democracy has allowed popular prejudices to influence how the new government rules, and has amplified a dangerous narrative that casts Muslims as an alien presence in Buddhist-majority Burma,” the London-based Burma Human Rights Network said in the report. Images and reports of the renewed plight of the Rohingya people have drawn condemnation across the world, including from Aung San Suu Kyi’s fellow Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has described the violence as a genocide and said Turkey would compensate Bangladesh for taking in the refugees. On Monday, demonstrations were held in the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, compared the treatment of the Rohingya to the Holocaust."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/05/doctors-condemn-coalition-for-likening-welfare-drug-tests-to-vaccinations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T04:44:53Z","webTitle":"Doctors condemn Coalition for likening welfare drug tests to vaccinations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/05/doctors-condemn-coalition-for-likening-welfare-drug-tests-to-vaccinations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/05/doctors-condemn-coalition-for-likening-welfare-drug-tests-to-vaccinations","fields":{"headline":"Doctors condemn Coalition for likening welfare drug tests to vaccinations","bodyText":"Physicians have criticised the social services minister, Christian Porter, for linking the debate on drug testing welfare recipients to child immunisation policies. The conflict between the medical community and the government over the proposal escalated on Tuesday, a day before a Senate inquiry is due to deliver its report on the controversial measure. The inquiry’s draft report has been circulated, but its recommendations were kept tightly under wraps on Tuesday. The report is expected to recommend against proceeding with the drug testing trial, given Labor and the Greens remain strongly opposed. The legislation’s passage through the Senate remains uncertain. The Nick Xenophon Team was yet to determine its position on the drug testing on Tuesday. His party’s votes will be crucial in implementing the drug-testing trial but Xenophon said he was still in negotiations with the government. The inquiry into the legislation heard almost universal condemnation of the plan, which mandates 5,000 welfare recipients be drug tested at three locations across the country. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the Australian Medical Association have been among the most vocal critics. Porter criticised the position of the “establishment” medical groups on Monday. He told Fairfax Media that the medical community had previously been critical of the government’s no jab no pay policy, which has since demonstrated significant success in improving child immunisation. “Of course, trying new approaches is not always met positively by the establishment used to the established approach,” Porter told Fairfax Media. “The Royal College of Physicians, for example, said that using the welfare system to compel people to vaccinate their kids would not work.” The college rebuked the minister on Tuesday. Adrian Reynolds, an addiction specialist with the college, released a statement condemning the linking of the two policies. “Conflating issues as different as childhood vaccination and addiction confuses two very distinct and very important public health issues,” he said. “Addressing a problem such as addiction which is complex and deeply connected to many other issues including mental health, trauma and poverty, is very different to mechanisms to encourage people to undertake a single intervention such as an immunisation.” He said the college had not opposed no jab no pay, but had expressed concern that “there needed to be more support for people who face practical, economic, social and geographic hurdles to getting their children vaccinated”. The Senate inquiry’s report will also make recommendations about the new demerit-points compliance regime the government has proposed for jobseekers on Newstart and other activity-tested payments. Key stakeholders, including the Australian Council of Social Service, have expressed concern about the new compliance regime. Guardian Australia has learned that, despite legislation being introduced two months ago, the government has recently commissioned research on the potential impact of changing the compliance regime on welfare recipients. The Department of Employment has paid $164,010 to a consultant, Whereto Research, to conduct a seven-week study of the overhaul of its jobseeker compliance regime. Whereto Research has begun contacting key stakeholders to gauge their views. It is also conducting “fieldwork, analysis, and reporting” looking at welfare recipients, employment service providers, employment services peak bodies, and community support organisations in regional and metropolitan areas. The Department of Employment says the research is not designed to inform the policy, but rather to inform its implementation. It said the research was designed to better understand the awareness of welfare recipients of their mutual obligation requirements. “The Whereto Research is aimed at gaining a better understanding of this group’s current level of awareness of their mutual obligation requirements and potential consequences of not meeting them,” a spokeswoman said. “The research also explores the potential barriers and vulnerabilities that may be impacting on job seekers’ ability to comply with their mutual obligation requirements. These insights will allow the department to be more effective in its communication with job seekers, to make them aware of and help them meet their requirements under the current as well as a future framework.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
