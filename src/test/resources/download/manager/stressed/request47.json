Salah was cautioned after going to ground at Gary Cahill’s first‑half challenge with the Egyptian, up against his former club, well marshalled by Antonio Rüdiger and enduring a third scoreless game in succession. “Yes I think it was a dive, was it?” Klopp said. “Or he waited for the contact, I am not sure, so that is not what I want to see, that is not what he wants to do. But obviously it happened. “With all the other situations, he couldn’t get any foul any more. That is not right as well. It was always like this and you have to deal with that.” The forward, who has scored 41 goals this season, was up against a former team-mate at Roma in Rüdiger, with Klopp confident he will rediscover his scoring touch in time for the European Cup final against Real Madrid on 26 May. “He has played twice in a row against former team-mates, and it was the same today as it was against Roma,” the Liverpool manager said. “Before the game they are very friendly, all ‘Hello Mo, how are you?’, and hugs here and there. But then during the game [smacks his hand on the desk]. The same with Rüdiger today. “He has to be much better, he can do much better and he will score again, there is no doubt about that. There was no space for anything out there. He can play with no space actually, but not today. That is it, all good.” Chelsea’s victory hoisted Antonio Conte’s side to within three points of their third-placed opponents before the midweek visit of Huddersfield. If that game is won – and even if the fourth‑placed Tottenham prosper in their own fixture against Newcastle on Wednesday – the race for the top four will go to the final afternoon when Liverpool host Brighton and the London club travel to Tyneside. “And Newcastle is not a holiday trip, or at least it doesn’t sound like a holiday trip to me,” said Klopp, who declined to comment on suggestions in France that Liverpool are in talks with Lyon over their attacking midfielder Nabil Fekir. Conte said: “We must be pleased with our will to fight and desire to keep hope alive to take a place in the Champions League. I don’t know if this will be enough at the end of the season to get a place in the Champions League, but we have to try. “It’s important to approach this situation with great pride and a great will to fight, to show we are still alive. As you know very well, one month ago it was impossible to imagine we’d arrive at the end to fight for a place in the Champions League. Now there is hope.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/07/morning-mail-tax-warning-facebook-data-revelation-bight-oil-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T20:48:42Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: tax warning to treasurer on budget eve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/morning-mail-tax-warning-facebook-data-revelation-bight-oil-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/morning-mail-tax-warning-facebook-data-revelation-bight-oil-fears","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: tax warning to treasurer on budget eve","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 7 May. Top stories Scott Morrison’s “speed limit” on taxes has been described as an “arbitrary” rule that will push the government to make austerity cuts to fund new programs. On Sunday the treasurer said that exceeding the Coalition’s 23.9% tax-to-GDP limit would put “jobs and the economy and essential services at risk”. But while a dramatic improvement in revenues has given the Coalition room to ditch the planned $8bn Medicare levy increase and offer income tax cuts, the Australia Institute has warned in a briefing note that the combination of a limit on tax and a surplus target would necessitate spending cuts in future. The paper echoes concerns from the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, about eroding the revenue base, as Labor prepares to match “targeted tax relief” and promise larger surpluses by raising revenue in other areas. The Australia Institute argues that the 23.9% limit is “just the latest of equally arbitrary ceilings to which governments have committed from time to time”. It says: “When they are taken seriously, arbitrary tax-to-GDP ratios can severely limit choices available to the electorate.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Facebook’s failure to compel Cambridge Analytica to delete all traces of data from its servers enabled the company to retain predictive models derived from millions of social media profiles throughout the US presidential election, the Guardian can reveal. Leaked emails show that when CA told Facebook almost a year before the election that it had deleted data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users, it stopped short of agreeing to also erase derivatives of the data. The correspondence raises questions about the accuracy of the testimony that Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, gave to the US Congress last month. The Coalition’s $2.2bn cut to universities made in December is a “false economy” that will actually leave the budget worse off in the long term due to decreased income tax receipts, Universities Australia has argued. Modelling from Cadence Economics commissioned by Universities Australia finds that over a 20-year period the cuts will cost the budget between $2.2bn and $3.9bn. In the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook the government cut $2.2bn from universities predominantly through a two-year freeze in commonwealth grants funding for teaching and learning. Universities Australia has now called for the $7bn increase to go towards reversing the cuts. Aboriginal elders have called for the NSW government to commit to expanding the youth Koori court program after an evaluation found it halved the amount of time young people spent in detention. The court began as a pilot project at Parramatta children’s court in February 2015 but has not received ongoing funding. A University of Western Sydney evaluation has found it cut the average number of days spent in youth detention, as well as helping address underlying issues such as unstable accommodation, lack of engagement in education and employment, and disconnection from Aboriginal culture. Elders said it reached children who had little family support and were isolated from the community. Environmental activists in the Thai city of Chiang Mai claimed victory yesterday after the country’s military government agreed not to continue the development of luxury property on forest land. More than 1,000 people protested against the construction of a housing complex earmarked to house judges in the foothills of the Doi Suthep mountains. The demonstration was one of the largest since Thailand’s junta took power in 2014. It was also one of a growing number of anti-government protests, including in Bangkok, that are putting pressure on the government before an election planned for 2019. Sport The Dragons and Storm lined up in what many were billing as a grand final preview at Kogarah Oval on Sunday. The game played out like a grand final: not the best game, but scrappy and won on defence. It’s only May, but if the premiership is Mount Everest, the Dragons are ascending. The Storm – and everyone else – are limping into base camp. Sir Alex Ferguson still in a serious condition in intensive care after a brain haemorrhage. Former Manchester United players David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo are among those sending messages of support to the 76-year-old former Manchester United manager, who underwent emergency surgery on Saturday. Thinking time The cold and violent waters of the Great Australian Bight are home to one of the country’s most biodiverse and important marine ecosystems – and potentially its newest oil field. In July last year Statoil, Norway’s state-owned oil company, became operator and 100% equity owner of two of the four permit zones, and is planning to commence drilling next year. The company says by that time it will have spent more than two years planning the project, and convincing itself it can operate safely and compliantly. But the Greenpeace senior campaigner Nathaniel Pelle says Statoil’s experience comes from taking risks in places where other companies won’t go. “There’s no such thing as safe drilling,” Pelle argues. “Everyone likes a good royal commission – watching normally unaccountable people give an account of themselves,” writes Gordon Menzies, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney. “With all the anger about inequality now, it is especially appealing to see the spectacularly paid elite getting their comeuppance. But if academic research into the impact money has on ethics is accurate, maybe these financial professionals really couldn’t help themselves. Does working with money actually make us worse people?” Has the time come for Australian wool to make its red-carpet debut? The environmental fashion campaigner Livia Firth, the wife of Colin Firth, uses her time on the red carpet to wear only ethical, sustainable and repurposed fashion, and she’s often photographed wearing the same gowns as part of her #30wears pledge. She travelled to Tasmania to meet some of Australia’s top merino wool growers and learn about the production of wool, and how to reduce its environment impact. “It’s not realistic to think we are going to be in the world without leather or wool or a world without cotton, so what is the blueprint for doing it [better and] beautifully?” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has said he is open to the idea of being interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller as past of the Russia investigation – but his new lawyer Rudy Giuliani may advise his client to plead the fifth. Giuliani says he doesn’t want Trump to face “prosecution for perjury like Martha Stewart”. Media roundup The Australian Financial Review splashes with the government’s announcement that high-income earners will receive a tax cut – but they will take a backseat to lower and middle income earners, who will get one first. The family of a man who died as the passenger of a reckless driver are calling for an overhaul of the NT justice system, and say the department needs to work collaboratively with Indigenous people, the NT News reports. The ABC has a long read previewing tonight’s Four Corners, in which it interviews Saxon Mullins, the 18-year-old who accused Luke Lazarus of raping her in an alley behind a Kings Cross night club. This is her first interview. Coming up The judge-only defamation trial between the Wagner family and Alan Jones, his employer Harbour Radio and the journalist Nicholas Cater will continue. The Wagners say Jones accused them of being responsible for 12 deaths at Grantham during the 2011 floods, when one of the walls of the Lockyer Valley quarry they owned collapsed.

The 76-year-old former Manchester United manager underwent emergency surgery after he was rushed by ambulance from his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire on Saturday. He was taken first to Macclesfield district hospital and then to Salford hospital under a police escort. His family, including his wife Cathy and his son Darren, also a football manager, were understood to be at his bedside. Neither the club nor the hospital provided an update on his condition on Sunday which United had previously said would require intensive care. The team issued a statement in a tweet with a picture of Ferguson that read: The statement contained messages of support from 17 current and former players including Wayne Rooney and Eric Cantona. The club Ferguson managed for almost 27 years until retiring in 2013 said on Saturday: “Sir Alex Ferguson has undergone emergency surgery today for a brain haemorrhage. The procedure has gone very well but he needs a period of intensive care to optimise his recovery. His family request privacy in this matter.” It added: “We will keep Sir Alex and his loved ones in our thoughts during this time, and we are united in our wish to see him make a comfortable, speedy recovery.” His former star players, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo, were among those to voice support. Beckham wrote on Instagram: Ronaldo, now at Real Madrid, said: “My thoughts and prayers are with you, my dear friend. Be strong, Boss!” Ferguson had appeared fit and well when he presented his old sparring partner Arsène Wenger with a memento at Old Trafford last Sunday ahead of the Frenchman’s departure from Arsenal. Two weeks ago he dined with Pep Guardiola, the manager of United’s local rivals, Manchester City, after the latter won the Premier League title. Guardiola said he sent Ferguson “a big hug”. “Our thoughts are with Cathy and the Manchester United family,” he said. “I was glad to have dinner with him two weeks ago, and hopefully he can recover as quickly as possible.” Outside Old Trafford, where Ferguson won 38 trophies and became the most successful football manager in the history of the game in Britain, fans expressed shock. “I just couldn’t stop crying when I heard,” said Norma Smith, 73, a season ticket-holder for almost 60 years. “We’ve got our own chapel here at Old Trafford and I’ve been to church this morning to pray for him. Devastated, devastated.” A stand at the ground was named in Ferguson’s honour in 2011 and a statue of the Glasgow-raised manager was erected of him in 2012. It gazes out towards Salford Royal hospital. “I’ve been all over the world watching United and he’s brought me so much joy,” said Peter Bolton, 61. “He’s been retired a few years but he’s still the top man. Our life has been improved more than we could ever imagine. The bottom line is 38 trophies in English football, not Scottish football, or Spain or Germany – Fergie just knew what to do, how to do it and not only that, he did it.” A brain haemorrage is a type of stroke that can be fatal and occurs when there is bleeding on the surface of the brain, just below the arachnoid membrane. It is most commonly caused by an aneurysm, which is a small, balloon-like swelling on an artery. The haemorrhage happens when the aneurysm wall bursts and blood escapes into the surrounding tissue, killing brain cells. Contributing factors include smoking, high blood pressure and excessive alcohol consumption, but aneurysms can occur in people without these known risk factors. After a scan and medication to reduce the risk of secondary brain damage caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, surgery under general anaesthetic is often needed. One method involves a neurosurgeon cutting a bone flap in the skull and sealing the aneurysm shut with a tiny metal clip that stays permanently clamped in place. Another involves passing tiny platinum coils through the vascular system from an incision in the groin, to seal off the aneurysm from the main artery. There is a danger that the aneurysm can burst again or that brain damage has occurred. For survivors, memory and concentration are commonly affected and depression and anxiety can occur, while epilepsy develops in about one in 20 people. Headaches, tiredness and loss of sensation in other parts of the body during recovery are also common."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/06/devon-light-aircraft-makes-emergency-landing-after-engine-failure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T01:10:20Z","webTitle":"Devon: light aircraft makes emergency landing after engine failure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/06/devon-light-aircraft-makes-emergency-landing-after-engine-failure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/06/devon-light-aircraft-makes-emergency-landing-after-engine-failure","fields":{"headline":"Light aircraft lands on Devon beach after engine failure","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A pilot was forced to make an emergency landing in a light aircraft on a beach in Sidmouth after the engine failed. Neither the pilot or passenger were hurt in the incident on the Devon coast on Saturday. The first world war-era plane narrowly missed people on the stony beach. A helicopter for the national police air service spotted the plane while returning from an incident in east Somerset and were able to confirm the plane had made a safe landing and that all the occupants were safe. The pilot, Zac Rocky, told the Sidmouth Herald his only option was to attempt to land on the beach when the engine began to lose power. He said: “We were flying along the coast taking in the beautiful scenery of the Jurassic coast. The engine had some issues. It began to lose power, it faded. I cycled a few options in the cockpit to no avail and at that point you have to choose somewhere to come down. “The land option inland was unavailable. I could have made it but it looked unpleasant. The scenery around here is not a nice place to land something like that and also you need to be around somebody – you need to be near somebody who can help you once you’re down if there’s an issue.” The beach was still risky, he said. “Who knows what could have happened when it landed – it could have flipped on the stones.” Trudi Spiller, who was the plane’s only passenger, told Devon Live that she tried to wave her arms to warn people on the beach to move out of the way and was left with “jelly legs” after the crash landing. She said: “I was slightly frightened. It wasn’t like my life flashed before me or anything but I was thinking, ‘here we go’. But I also had absolute faith Zac would land it. He is an amazing, fantastic pilot and I had every confidence in him.” Sidmouth coastguards reportedly helped tow the plane away from the shoreline, but on Sunday it had to be dismantled so it could be removed from the beach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/06/sabina-miller-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T17:05:53Z","webTitle":"Sabina Miller obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/06/sabina-miller-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/06/sabina-miller-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Sabina Miller obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My grandmother Sabina Miller, who has died aged 95, was an educator and Holocaust survivor. She worked closely with the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust (HMDT) and was awarded a British Empire Medal in 2017 for services to education. Sabina shared her life story to warn about the dangers of hatred. She liked to stress the importance of tolerance and kindness, inspiring respect in everyone who met her. She was born in Warsaw to Sarah (nee Trylerer) and Abraham Najfeld. Abraham owned a shop, a grocer and chemist’s, while Sarah looked after the family. Sabina survived the Warsaw ghetto and spent most of the second world war on the run from the Nazis. As a teenager in the ghetto she caught typhus and blacked out for a long period. When she came to, her mother and father were gone. Her elder brother helped smuggle her out of the ghetto and she ended up working on a farm run by a Lithuanian man. But she ran away when she heard that lorries were coming for Jewish people. She spent the winter of 1942-43 living in a freezing hole dug by partisans in the forests of northern Poland, and then survived slave labour and interrogations by the Gestapo by denying her Jewish identity. She ended up hiding out in Germany under false names. Sabina was the only member of her family to survive Immediately after the war, in a displaced persons camp in Papenburg, Germany, she met Arthur Miller, a Polish soldier who had been attached to the British army. They married in 1947 and came to Britain, where Arthur had the right to resettle. They built up a successful fashion business, and Sabina was always grateful for the sense of acceptance she felt in Britain. Sabina and Arthur divorced after 30 years of marriage. In her later years, Sabina regularly volunteered her time with HMDT, speaking to hundreds of people every year, and reaching many more through her work with the media. Her aim, she would say, was to raise awareness of not just the Holocaust, but other genocides as well, to help people learn the lessons of these injustices. She was interviewed by the Guardian in 2010 and 2015. In 2015, Sabina played a key role in the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in HMDT’s Memory Makers art project, for which she was recognised with a Freedom of the City of London award. Her son, Stuart, died in a motorcycle accident in 2011. Sabina is survived by her daughter, Sandra, six granddaughters and seven great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/06/future-of-air-france-in-doubt-after-boss-quits-amid-strike-action","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T16:28:39Z","webTitle":"Future of Air France 'in doubt' after boss quits  amid strike action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/06/future-of-air-france-in-doubt-after-boss-quits-amid-strike-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/06/future-of-air-france-in-doubt-after-boss-quits-amid-strike-action","fields":{"headline":"Future of Air France 'in doubt' after boss quits  amid strike action","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The future of strike-hit Air France hangs in the balance following the departure of its chief executive over a continuing strike over pay, the French economy minister warned on Sunday. The airline’s trade union members are planning to walk out for a 14th day on Monday as they press for a 5.1% pay increase this year from their loss-making employer. Jean-Marc Janaillac, chief executive of parent company Air France-KLM, announced his resignation on Friday after workers rejected a pay deal worth 7% over four years. “I call on everyone to be responsible: crew, ground staff, and pilots who are asking for unjustified pay hikes,” France’s economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, told BFM television. “Be responsible. The survival of Air France is in the balance.” The crisis at Air France has coincided with other strike action in the country as rail workers also press on with walk-outs to protest against President Emmanuel Macron’s planned overhaul of the state-run train operator SNCF. French travellers have faced transport chaos since early April, and Le Maire said the strikes had wiped 0.1 percentage points off economic growth with areas such as tourism and the transport of raw materials badly hit. Strikes have already cost Air France €300m (£265m) with walk-outs by pilots, ground staff and other workers due to resume on Monday and Tuesday. He warned that the state, which owns 14.3%, could not be relied upon to rescue the airline. “Air France will disappear if it does not make the necessary efforts to be competitive. “We’re minority shareholders ... those that think that whatever happens the state will come to Air France’s rescue and soak up Air France’s losses are mistaken.” Despite the strike, the company says it will be able to maintain 99% of long-haul flights on Monday, 80% of medium-haul and 87% of short-haul. “Air France deplores the decision to go ahead with the strikes as we enter a period that will not enable negotiations to continue in order to put an end to it,” the carrier said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/07/calling-dietary-guidelines-wrong-ignores-the-science","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T03:23:19Z","webTitle":"Calling dietary guidelines ‘wrong’ ignores the science | Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/07/calling-dietary-guidelines-wrong-ignores-the-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/07/calling-dietary-guidelines-wrong-ignores-the-science","fields":{"headline":"Calling dietary guidelines ‘wrong’ ignores the science","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If you’ve been alive for the last few years, you’ve almost certainly heard the message. It has been whispered in talk shows, printed in glossy magazines and hardcovers across the country, yelled out by opinion leaders all around the globe. You see, the experts are wrong. Instead of eating according to the dietary guidelines, we should be going paleo (but not actually eating like paleolithic man, who, among other things, was a cheerful cannibal. It’s more like a modern approximation of what paleolithic man might have eaten if he’d happened to be at a New York deli or a gourmet salad bar and had to choose between quinoa and couscous and could get past the sudden terror of being dragged from his safe cave long enough to actually make a decision), trying keto, or eating fermented cabbage that’s been steeped in a heady concoction of vinegar and privilege because, really, that’s the way you stay healthy. This is, of course, nonsense. Dietary guidelines – at least in Australia – are complicated, lengthy prescriptions about eating as well as overall health. They can be hard to understand, difficult to implement, and in certain cases are not very helpful. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday But they are based on very solid reviews of strong scientific evidence. They may not always be right, but they definitely aren’t wrong. What are dietary guidelines? The main dietary guideline document can be found here, and if you’ve got an entire day to kill it’s definitely something I’d recommend reading. The guidelines are essentially a public health tool developed by the government to a) help clinicians – doctors and dietitians mostly – to give dietary advice to their patients and b) provide a platform for the average person like you or I to build a healthy diet from. If that sounds simple to you, just wait. Diet is never simple. The most important thing to remember here is that the dietary guidelines are not a single prescription for a healthy diet. There are, obviously, ways to eat healthily without conforming to every recommendation in the guidelines. For example, the recommendation to eat a lot of carbs is ignored by some people on what’s know as ketogenic diets, and they are rarely in danger because of it. But that’s not the point: the guidelines are there to provide a diet for every person in Australia, from rural and remote communities to city dwellers like myself. And that means talking about foods that are available everywhere. What this means is that the dietary guidelines tread a fine line of being incredibly complex and overly simplistic – they have to speak to the average person on the street and yet still provide meaningful ways in which to change your diet to be healthier. It is not easy. The science For all of the criticisms of dietary guidelines, there’s little engagement with the actual science that sits behind them. For the current swathe of dietary recommendations, the National Health and Medical Research Council commissioned an enormous review into the scientific evidence behind diet in Australia, which was published alongside the guidelines in 2013. It’s a little out-of-date now – the guidelines are updated every five years, so we’re due for an update soon – but still represents a mammoth effort to look at every health claim made about food and come up with useful recommendations about what we should eat. And it really does include a staggering amount of evidence: most of the guidelines are based on several systematic reviews, which are themselves based on dozens of studies. Overall, the guidelines are based on literally hundreds of individual pieces of scientific research, representing the perspectives of millions of people. Saying that they’re “wrong” is a bit like arguing that vaccinations are a waste of time – you can have an issue with an individual recommendation, or even some specific studies that went into them, but the guidelines represent a huge chunk of evidence. Calling them “wrong” is either a vast oversimplification or a display of unrepentant ignorance about what they actually are. Most people who do it have simply cherry-picked their favourite study and completely ignore the research that disagrees with them. There’s very little scientific disagreement that, if you eat according to the guidelines, you’ll be healthy. But is that the end of the story? Socioeconomic woes Aside from self-educated celebrity chefs, the biggest criticism about dietary guidelines is that they don’t fulfil their purpose. “We’ve had guidelines for decades now,” the argument goes “Why are we still getting less healthy?”. This is a more difficult question to answer. The first thing to do is actually read the guidelines. If you have a look, right up there in the first section and at the start of every part thereafter is a large paragraph. It talks about something called “socioeconomic factors” which basically means “stuff that makes it harder to be healthy that is outside individual control”. This includes things like urban design, level of education, having parents in prison, and most importantly access to fresh fruit and vegetables. What the guidelines say, front and centre, is that telling people to eat right is useless if we don’t also make it easier for them to do so. And this, sadly, is something that we still haven’t done. If we truly want to fix our issues with eating – in particular obesity – it’s not enough to just put out recommendations about foods that are healthier. We have to change our environment to make it easier for everyone to eat healthy foods and harder to access less healthy things such as sugar-sweetened drinks and chocolate. Which is, of course, what the guidelines recommend. Dietary guidelines aren’t a panacea for our health problems. They aren’t going to fix society overnight. But they are good advice that the vast majority of people can understand providing a framework for a healthy diet. It’s up to us, as a society, to make it possible for them to do so. • Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz is an epidemiologist working in chronic disease"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/07/britain-set-for-hottest-ever-early-may-bank-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T01:07:53Z","webTitle":"Britain set for hottest ever early May bank holiday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/07/britain-set-for-hottest-ever-early-may-bank-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/07/britain-set-for-hottest-ever-early-may-bank-holiday","fields":{"headline":"Britain set for hottest ever early May bank holiday","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Parts of Britain could enjoy the hottest early May bank holiday ever recorded on Monday with temperatures set to reach 28C.

The south-east of England, East Anglia and the Midlands will again have the warmest weather on Monday. But the heat also brought the familiar bank holiday transport problems. Southern Rail, which operates the mainline from London to Brighton, advised people not to travel on Sunday because engineering work meant the line was closed south of Gatwick airport. A replacement bus service was operating but there were reports of overcrowding as people tried to reach the coast. The closure continues on Monday so the main route from the capital is likely to be severely disrupted again. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: “Passengers will rightly be frustrated to find they can’t travel on the bank holiday weekend. These works and the weather were no surprise – so why has Southern failed to provide enough rail replacement buses? “We’ll be working with the operator to find out what went wrong and to ensure that passengers aren’t left high and dry next time they plan a trip to the seaside on a weekend.” The early May bank holiday was introduced in 1978 and the temperature has never topped the 28C mark. It was 23.6C on the bank holiday Monday in 1999, while the hottest bank holiday weekend ever was in 1995 when temperatures peaked on the Saturday at 28.6C. Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said the highs of 28C were not going to be widespread on Monday. “That’s going to be the exception rather than the rule. I think for most places, if you take the bulk of England and Wales for example, we’re looking at somewhere around the low to mid 20s mark,” he said. Crowds flocked to beaches and parks all over the country on Sunday with only parts of northern Scotland seeing wet weather. The sunniest place in Britain was Boulmer on the coast of Northumberland, the Met Office said. The weather is set to become mixed as the month progresses. Looking at the long range forecast, which is not as accurate as the shorter range forecast, Powell said: “It looks like we should be prepared for some pretty changeable weather throughout the second half of May. “We’re still going to see some dry days, but there’s still going to be some wet days mixed in as well. So it doesn’t look like it’s going to carry on in a similar kind of vein to high pressure in charge, sunshine, light winds, high temperatures, that we have now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/07/monday-briefing-johnson-tries-tv-diplomacy-to-save-iran-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T05:27:51Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Johnson tries TV diplomacy to save Iran deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/monday-briefing-johnson-tries-tv-diplomacy-to-save-iran-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/07/monday-briefing-johnson-tries-tv-diplomacy-to-save-iran-deal","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Johnson tries TV diplomacy to save Iran deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: Rouhani warns US not to scrap deal Happy bank holiday briefers. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Boris Johnson is due to have a series of meetings in Washington today as he tries to persuade the Trump administration not to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. The foreign secretary will not meet the president himself, having to make do with the vice-president, Mike Pence, and the national security adviser, John Bolton. However, he is later today scheduled to appear on Trump’s favourite TV news show, Fox and Friends, in the hope that the president is watching. Trump is an avowed opponent of the deal and has until this Saturday to decide if he will again waive sanctions against Iran in exchange for limitations on its nuclear ambitions. Last time he signed off on the waivers he said it was Iran’s “last chance” to be more transparent about its nuclear programs. Johnson’s entreaties come as Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, warned on Sunday that the US was risking “historic regret” if it pulled out. * * * Hot stuff – In case you hadn’t heard, parts of Britain are set to enjoy record-breaking temperatures today as the mercury heads above 28C. South-east England, East Anglia and the Midlands will have the best of it but it’s likely to be better than usual in most other areas as well following fine weather on Sunday. Scotland and Northern Ireland had their hottest days of the year yesterday and the sunniest place in Britain was Boulmer in Northumberland. It’ll be no surprise either that the sunsine brought that great British tradition, bank holiday transport chaos. The main problem was engineering works on the main line between London and Brighton, causing severe overcrowding and disruption. Southern Rail advised people not to travel, helpfully, but it didn’t seem to do much good. The line closure continues today so see this briefing as an early warning in case you’re thinking of a trip to the seaside in that part of the world. Another great British bank holiday tradition is to ask whether we should have them at all. Julian Baggini thinks we should abolish them and institute public holidays that actually mean something to people. He suggests they could even be regionalised, so you have a Manchester Day or a Kent Day, for example. * * * ‘Callous’ immigration system – More woes for the Home Office as MPs and experts have warned that more than 1,000 highly skilled migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain in the UK are wrongly facing deportation under immigration laws designed in part to tackle terrorists. Advocates say the workers, who include teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers and IT professionals – are accused of lying in their applications to remain, for changing their tax records, or having discrepancies in declared income. Alison Thewliss, SNP member for Glasgow Central, said the cases laid bare the “callous incompetence” of the Home Office. * * * Prayers for Sir Alex – Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson remains in a serious condition today following a brain haemorrhage. The world of football has rallied to his support since the news emerged on Saturday with former proteges such as David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo adding their best wishes to a deluge of messages urging a swift recovery. * * * Active ingredient – If exercise could be made into a pill, it would prescribed to every cancer patient in the world, according to researchers in Australia. The advice comes in a statement from the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia, which has launched a push to promote the benefits of patients keeping active. The lead author, Prof Prue Cormie from the Australian Catholic University, said the advice was based on “indisputable” evidence. “We know now that people who exercise regularly experience fewer and less severe treatment side-effects; cancer-related fatigue, mental distress, quality of life.” Lunchtime read: Mexico’s would-be president is a real Corbynista You could call Andrés Manuel López Obrador the Mexican Jeremy Corbyn. You could even say he is a real Corbynista. Obrador, or Amlo to call him by his very handy acronym, is a veteran leftwinger who is riding a wave of popular dissatisfaction with corrupt elites and threatening to spring a major surprise in the presidential elections on 1 July. But the 64-year-old, who is a longstanding friend of Corbyn’s, will be hoping to do slightly better than Labour did in the local elections last week. “López Obrador is the only option,” Margarita García Rodriguez, a homemaker from Mexico City said at an Amlo rally. “If he can’t help us out, then there’s nobody else that can. The whole system will collapse.” Sport The Class of 92 snooker revival has not disappointed as John Higgins and Mark Williams head into the second day of the World Championship final at the Crucible with just three frames between them. Arsenal provided the perfect farewell for Arsène Wenger with a 5-0 hammering of Burnley at the Emirates Stadium as the curtain fell in a classy send-off. Jürgen Klopp made clear his disapproval of the dive from Mohamed Salah that led to the footballer of the year being booked as Liverpool succumbed to Chelsea, a result that offered last season’s Premier League champions hope of infiltrating the top four. And a Gareth Bale goal denied 10-man Barcelona victory over Real Madrid in El Clásico. Business The future of strike-hit Air France is in the balance following the departure of its chief executive, the French economy minister has warned. The airline’s workers are planning to walk out for a 14th day today as they press for a 5.1% pay increase from their loss-making employer. The markets are closed in London but they won’t be missing much judging by a subdued session so far in Asia. The pound is up very slightly at $1.355 and €1.132. The papers Today’s front pages are a varied bunch, aside from a common theme of photographs showing people enjoying the bank holiday sun. The Telegraph leads on a new law that could give grandparents the right to see their grandchildren. The Mail splashes on the “River of plastic that shames Britain”. The Guardian has the latest deportation scandal to hit the Home Office. The Times goes with a story from Brussels saying that a “fear of Corbyn” is prompting the EU’s tough line on Brexit. The FT also has a political splash: “May to risk Tory rebels’ wrath by pressing ahead with customs plan”. The Express is concerned with the spate of violent crime across the country that has left three dead and one injured. The Mirror is the lone paper to put Sir Alex Ferguson’s health on its front, rather than back, page, with Eammon Holmes urging the nation to “Pray for my mate Fergie”. The Sun has a story about Freddie Flintoff being arrested on holiday.

There is a pretty significant difference between finishing sixth and seventh in this season’s Premier League and, had Arsenal slumped here, it would have opened up the possibility that Burnley might pinch sixth spot from them. It would have meant Arsenal beginning next season under their new manager in the second qualifying round of the Europa League on 26 July while Burnley went straight into the group stage of Europe’s second-tier competition. Arsenal are scheduled to face Atlético Madrid on that date in a pre-season friendly in Singapore. They would have had to have cancelled their tour. Arsenal’s final two matches of the season are at Leicester City and Huddersfield Town and, given their dismal away form in 2018 – they have yet to pick up a point – there could be no guarantee of any rewards. Yet they spared themselves the potentially awkward situation with a comprehensive dismantling of Burnley, who played nothing more than a ceremonial role here. It says plenty about how far Arsenal have fallen under Wenger this season that the merits of coming in ahead of Burnley in sixth were even up for discussion. But this, at least, was a day in which everything went right, when the supporters could cheer Wenger to the rafters as he entered through a guard of honour and departed with a clutch of mementos, and the team clicked in fine style. There was even a 13-minute substitute’s cameo for Per Mertesacker, who will retire at the end of the season to take over as the head of the club’s academy, and it threatened to bring the house down. Petr Cech ran from his goal to embrace Mertesacker and the big German’s every touch was cheered. Stan Kroenke, the majority shareholder, was in attendance and he listened to songs in praise of Wenger throughout. For one sunny afternoon the angst of so much of the season could be forgotten. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice to take his tally for the club to eight in 12 appearances while Alexandre Lacazette, Sead Kolasinac and Alex Iwobi got the others. Arsenal took charge early on and the breakthrough goal owed everything to Lacazette’s vision and incision. He played a give-and-go with Iwobi, which allowed him to slice into the area, and his driven cross was made to measure for Aubameyang who poked home. It is clear that Aubameyang’s relationship with Lacazette and Henrikh Mkhitaryan will be key to the club in the post-Wenger era. The fourth member of the LMAO strike-force was absent and it had to be said that Mesut Özil’s back injury was the least surprising feature of the day. The World Cup is looming for the Germany maestro. It is unclear whether he will play against Leicester or Huddersfield. Lacazette was lively from the first whistle and he got his reward in first-half stoppage time. Iwobi played the pass before the assist and Héctor Bellerín did well to cut back his cross. Lacazette steered a volley inside Nick Pope’s near post. Arsenal had other flickers through the dangerous Mkhitaryan while they shouted loudly but in vain for a penalty when Kolasinac’s cross hit Matthew Lowton’s hand. Burnley lost Ashley Barnes to a shoulder injury on 20 minutes. The first half passed them by; the second period even more so. Wenger omitted Shkodran Mustafi, Nacho Monreal and Aaron Ramsey from his starting line-up and there was another opportunity for the 20-year-old Greek centre-half, Konstantinos Mavropanos, who took no prisoners. Twice he cleaned out Barnes’s replacement, Sam Vokes, to the delight of the home crowd, who have missed a bit of Martin Keown-style violence in their team. After Mavropanos’s first challenge on Vokes the fans around the press box chanted Keown’s name. Keown, who was on punditry duty, smiled. Burnley are going on a European tour, as the travelling fans chanted, but they were AWOL here. Arsenal turned the screw after the interval. Jack Wilshere had lifted a good chance high when he rinsed Jack Cork to tee up Kolasinac while Iwobi smashed the fourth into the roof of the net after a one-two with Aubameyang and statuesque Burnley defending. Bellerín crossed for Aubameyang to score the fifth and Danny Welbeck almost added a sixth only to see a thunderous long-range shot rattle the crossbar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/06/inclusion-is-best-for-people-with-autism","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T17:21:10Z","webTitle":"Inclusion is best for people with autism | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/06/inclusion-is-best-for-people-with-autism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/06/inclusion-is-best-for-people-with-autism","fields":{"headline":"Inclusion is best for people with autism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett’s article on access for autistic individuals recognised that “autism friendly” sessions are not necessarily a solution, and carry their own dangers (Guess what – people with autism like the cinema too, 2 May). Many conferences on autism now have modifications such as quiet withdrawal spaces, reduced lighting and “deaf clapping” (silent waving). It is reasonable to meet the needs of known autistic individuals attending an event but not to assume all “autistic” needs are common. A withdrawal space may be useful for all (although perhaps then not so quiet). Some autistic individuals find it difficult to cope with fluorescent lighting and/or high glare or contrast, but others are disturbed and disoriented by low levels of lighting, especially if this results in more shadows. Many autistic individuals have learned to cope with clapping if they know when it will happen and it does not go on for too long. Some are excited by “flapping” and feel compelled to join in when exposed to it, often becoming disoriented and upset. The danger is that these changes give the impression of dealing with the problem of access, whereas the effect is greater segregation. Will not special autism sessions increase intolerance at other times? Most of the things autistic individuals find intolerable (“lift” music everywhere, crowded aisles in supermarkets with unwanted intrusive advertisements, sudden, badly articulated announcements, etc) are also disliked by the rest of us. Getting things right for most autistic people without assuming they are all the same would benefit us all, and we would not need segregated special events or sessions.

Sometimes, apparently, it takes an extraordinary Irishman to tell the story of an extraordinary Irishman. Patrick O’Connell, a footballer with what might be classed as scoundrel tendencies as well as qualities that enabled him to become a heroic manager, had lain in an unmarked London grave for 57 years until Dowd heard about his singular life and decided to rally, with almost Geldofian zeal, the football world into action. The story of how he and a trio of other not-so-average football fans did that, and of O’Connell’s exploits during some of the bloodiest episodes of 20th century Europe, are the subject of Don Patricio, a documentary by the Danish director Michael Andersen that will be shown for the first time next Monday in Dublin before being screened around Britain and Spain (also available here). The Guardian covered O’Connell four years ago as part of our Forgotten Stories series and mentioned that Dowd was raising funds for a headstone for the former manager’s grave in St Mary’s Catholic cemetery in north-west London. That was news to Andersen, whose previous films have dealt with conflicts in the former Soviet Union. “I’m a lifelong football fan and very interested in history and when I read about O’Connell I thought ‘this can’t be true, I’ve never heard of this guy’,” Andersen says. “So I got in touch with Fergus to check it out. I had no idea he would talk me into investing years of my life and all my children’s inheritance in making a film about O’Connell and the campaign to get him remembered.” Some people just make things happen. Dowd was first moved to raise awareness of O’Connell when trying to raise funds for Scott Bell, a Blyth Spartans striker who developed motor neurone disease (which eventually took his life in 2013). “I used to enjoy going to England to watch matches and when the Premier League got too expensive I started going to lower league games,” Dowd says. “From watching Spartans I got to know Scott – you can chat with players at the bar after these games – and when I heard about his illness, I wanted to help fund his treatment. I remembered my dad telling me about a Dubliner who had captained Manchester United, managed Barcelona and made Real Betis champions. So I tracked down his grandson, Mike O’Connell, and asked him to give a talk at Blyth. Nine hundred people came to the Spartans clubhouse and you could have heard a pin drop. The more details I heard, the more I realised how remarkable Patrick was. Given his achievements I thought it was shameful he lay in an unmarked grave and his story practically buried with him.” Dowd and three friends – Alan McLean from Dumbarton, Simon Needham from Leeds and Maureen O’Sullivan from Dublin – resolved to get a headstone for O’Connell. They contacted illustrious footballers to ask for signed jerseys to auction. Johan Cruyff, Paolo Maldini and many more donated. “I’d explain that Patrick was a legend who deserved similar status to them and when they heard about him they agreed,” says Dowd. Martin O’Neill was especially captivated. “I thought I might only get a couple of minutes to say my piece but he was fascinated and asked to photocopy my notes,” Dowd says. Roy Keane was similarly gripped and kept in touch throughout the film-making, during which new details of O’Connell’s life were uncovered. “When I told [Keane] we think O’Connell was gun-running for Irish rebels while captain of Manchester United he almost keeled over,” Dowd says. “And when I talked about when O’Connell was Barcelona manager and had to travel incognito on night trains to avoid Franco’s troops I remember him saying ‘And I thought Saipan was bad!’” O’Connell’s tale has driven Dowd and his comrades around the world, including to Mexico, where O’Connell took Barcelona in 1937 to raise the money that prevented the club from going out of existence. “It’s been surreal,” Dowd says. “One day I was heading to work in Dublin and got a text saying: ‘Keep going, you’re doing a great job’. It was from Luís Figo. I don’t think he was talking about my IT skills.” And then there was the bust parade in Seville. With money left over after buying the headstone Dowd commissioned the sculptor Joe Moran to make a bust of O’Connell and present it to Real Betis, whom O’Connell led to their only Spanish title in 1935. The club arranged for the bust to be delivered in front of 30,000 people before a match – and suggested carrying it around the streets of Seville first. “So there we were walking around with this big bronze bust and people rushing over to kiss it,” Dowd says. He has since presented Barcelona’s president with a portrait of O’Connell by Tony Denton, a Mancunian who had taken up painting only six months previously after being advised it might help curb depression. The painting hangs in Barcelona’s boardroom. From September the Irish Football Association will tell O’Connell’s story in schools in Northern Ireland in the hope pupils will be inspired by his achievements and the role of fans in recalling them. “I’ve interviewed political activists who’ve been tortured and I’ve always come away wondering ‘how do they keep going?’” Andersen says. “In a funny way, and on a different scale, Fergus reminds me of them. He has stood to gain nothing from this campaign – in fact, he’s spent years of his own time and thousands of pounds – but he has achieved so much.” Dowd is especially pleased by one achievement. “Given the incredible support we have had and the fact I’ve made lifelong friends from all over the world from this campaign, it’s shown football still has soul.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/06/tories-peak-corbyn-local-election-results","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T17:08:03Z","webTitle":"The Tories may be tempted, but this is no time to declare peak Corbyn | Matthew d’Ancona","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/06/tories-peak-corbyn-local-election-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/06/tories-peak-corbyn-local-election-results","fields":{"headline":"The Tories may be tempted, but this is no time to declare peak Corbyn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The only certainty in contemporary politics is volatility. That is the fundamental lesson of the past six years – from the open, compassionate and pluralist spirit of the 2012 London Olympics, via the Tories’ surprise victory in 2015 and the nativist vote for Brexit in 2016, to Jeremy Corbyn’s unexpected surge in last year’s general election. The oscillation is bewildering, the runes unreadable. Which is why smarter Tories do not buy for a second the notion that we have reached “peak Corbyn” – a silly attempt to graft branding jargon on to nuanced psephological reality. Yes, Labour failed to take Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster in last week’s local contests, and should be concerned about its failure to make much progress outside London. But the party denied the Tories control of Trafford, took Plymouth, and – according to the BBC – would be the largest party in the House of Commons if the results were replicated in a general election. What has been scotched (or should have been) is the no less silly myth of impregnable destiny that has gripped some parts of the Labour left since the Tories lost their majority. There is no direction to history, no teleology in a complex democracy. To say that Labour has a lot more to do to win – as Alastair Campbell and others did on Saturday – is not to reassert Blairite values, defend neoliberalism, or declare the Iraq war a roaring success. Least of all is it a “smear”. This is all about the hard grind of gaining power, the door-to-door trials that face any opposition if it is to become a government. William Hague has observed that the Tory party has two default positions: complacency and panic. It is fair to say that Conservatives are panicking a little less than they were a week ago. They have been reminded that Corbyn is a man rather than a shaman, that his path to No 10 is not mystically ordained. But, in private at least, they are uncertain what to do with this information, how to turn it into useful political action. Let us say that Theresa May does not fight the next general election as Tory leader, but aspires to remain in office until at least 29 March 2019, when Britain leaves the European Union. The most important question facing the party after her departure – more important than the identity of her successor – is the trajectory it chooses to follow when she is gone. It is undeniable that the Conservatives did extremely well on Thursday in areas that voted leave, and profited from the collapse of the Ukip vote. Boris Johnson’s claim on Twitter that the government’s “vision for leaving the single market and customs union [was] a key part of Tory electoral success” strikes me as a stretch. But this analysis is already hardening into orthodoxy among Conservative leavers: the country, they say, has made clear that it wants a hard Brexit, and the party cannot afford to alienate the Ukip bloc that it has won back. You would need a heart of stone not to laugh at the decline of the movement formerly known as Nigel Farage’s fan club. It is glorious that Ukip should now be self-identifying as the Black Death: the words of its general secretary. But the Tory party must at all costs avoid becoming the willing host to its contagion. The defining characteristic of the Ukip voter – past or present – is implacability. No Brexit will be hard enough, no immigration reform tough enough, no recoil from progress fierce enough to please them. It follows that a strategy designed to appease this tranche of the electorate is not only (in my view) terrible for the country but also (as a matter of fact) entirely pointless. If the post-May party becomes hostage to the spirit of Farage – and some say it already is – then it will lose the next general election, and deserve to do so. Ours is a deeply diverse society, economically dependent upon immigration and culturally enriched by it. The Tory party has been wrestling with this fairly straightforward reality for more than 20 years now. What was once called “modernisation” is now in fairly obvious retreat: ask those affected by or – a much more numerous group – appalled at the Windrush scandal and the government’s handling of it. To win a majority again, the party has to persuade (for a start) young, urban, socially liberal and ethnic minority voters that it does not hate them. This is, to put it mildly, no easy task. Last week’s elections were a minor tremor alerting the political class to the tectonic uncertainty that still lies beneath. The Tories have been awakened from their fatalistic stupor and reminded they have a choice. What matters more, of course, is that the rest of us do too. • Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/06/local-election-verdicts-too-much-negative-spin","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T17:21:35Z","webTitle":"Local election verdicts: too much negative spin? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/06/local-election-verdicts-too-much-negative-spin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/06/local-election-verdicts-too-much-negative-spin","fields":{"headline":"Local election verdicts: too much negative spin?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is not accurate to write of “the Tories’ narrow retention of fortress London boroughs like Westminster” (Editorial, 5 May). In 2014, there was a 44-16 Tory-Labour split on Westminster council. It is now 41-19. Labour had a golden chance to make bigger inroads in Westminster, which voted by 53,928 to 24,268 against leaving Europe. Labour sent all its chiefs, from Jeremy Corbyn and Jon Lansman to most of the shadow cabinet, and celebrities like Owen Jones, to campaign in Westminster. They were welcomed but they refused to talk about Brexit, attack Mrs May’s disastrous handling of the dossier, or highlight the serious economic damage that will be done to London by leaving the single market and bringing in a new immigration control bureaucracy of Home Office jobsworths to make life miserable for anyone who wants to employ EU citizens. So, on the biggest constitutional, economic, social, cultural and geopolitical issue of the day, Labour had nothing to say to voters in a council area greatly affected by leaving Europe. That may explain why Labour won only three more seats and have left the Tories firmly, not narrowly, in control of Westminster. Denis MacShane London • As an activist who knocked on doors in Barnet for the Labour party, I must take issue with Adam Langleben’s assertion that “every Jewish Labour household we visited, people said, ‘Not this time’” (Labour antisemitism scandal is blamed for Tory victory in ‘easyCouncil’ Barnet, 5 May). I came from neighbouring Brent but, recognising Barnet’s significance, and being Jewish myself, I canvassed several times, often accompanied by other Jewish activists. On Thursday I helped get out the vote in Adam’s ward, arriving at 10.30am, and knocking on my last door at 9.45pm. At least once I was in a team with Adam. I don’t dispute that Adam had negative reactions from Jewish voters, or that the perception of Labour party antisemitism played a crucial role in this result. But Adam cannot know about every Jewish household. I met Jewish voters who were still prepared to vote Labour. Rabbi Danny Rich, the chief executive of Liberal Judaism, was elected a councillor, certainly with Jewish support. In Childs Hill ward, Labour had its first win in 40 years. I cannot believe that no Jewish voters had a part in that. The perception of antisemitism in the Labour party should not be minimised. Where that perception is accurate, antisemites should be expelled. But we should also be careful not to give credence to the myth that antisemitism is endemic or rife in the party. The tragedy of the situation in Barnet is at least partly explained by the willingness of some to spread this myth in order to do harm to Labour. Dr Ian Saville London • As a defeated Labour candidate in Thursday’s council elections, I don’t think your report (Victories in remain areas boost Cable, 5 May) does justice to the stunning victory of Lib Dems taking control of South Cambridgeshire. They secured 30 out of 45 seats, 13 with female councillors, under a female leader, Bridget Smith, reducing the Tories to 11, despite a good turnout. This is a prosperous constituency, long considered a safe Tory seat, formerly Andrew Lansley’s, currently occupied by Heidi Allen MP. Yes, South Cambridgeshire voted heavily remain, but on the doorstep big issues of the county and district failures in terms of potholes, housing, rural services, deeply flawed infrastructure planning and bitterly opposed busways were writ large. Clearly, considerable tactical voting was deployed to defeat the Tories, together with reorganised wards and boundaries leading people to rethink who deserved their vote. That seems more significant for the Tory party than any boost to Vince Cable (however otherwise deserved). Roger Tomlinson Coton, Cambridgeshire • Much commentary has centred on Labour’s win in Plymouth, forgetting to mention that Plymouth voted heavily to leave, and that over the years the council has swung between Labour, Conservative and no overall control. If I still had a vote in my home town I would be weary of hearing about the northern powerhouse, so beloved of the Tories while the south-west is ignored, and sick to death at having, as a taxpayer, to subsidise their HS2 vanity project while transport links beyond Exeter are pitiful. And of course there is defence and fears that the Devonport naval base will be further reduced; since 2010 the Tories have not put the money where their mouth is. This is most recently exemplified by concern about the future of HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, over whose fate Conservative MP Johnny Mercer and Labour MP Luke Pollard have joined forces. Though why anyone concerned about this country’s defence and security and with their head screwed on would vote for Corbyn mystifies me. Elizabeth Balsom London • Very disappointed by the pessimistic analysis from the Guardian of the local election results in England for Labour. In reality, Labour now has around 900 more seats than the Tories, has control of about twice as many councils, has gained its best result in London since 1971, and has managed to gain more seats in Westminster and Wandsworth than at any time since 1986. Could they have done better? Of course. Is this a bad result for Labour? By no means. The negative spin in the media against Labour is not justified when seen against actual results. If this were a general election, Labour would be the largest party in the House of Commons. Joshua Reynolds Tredegar, Gwent • The real victors in the local elections in England were Labour with their 2,350 seats over the Conservatives’ 1,332 seats. Also, Labour won control of 74 councils, compared to the Conservatives’ 46. Further, the Conservatives only won seven out of 32 London borough councils and now control only one out of 36 metropolitan district councils in England. Leslie Mutch Dingwall, Ross &amp; Cromarty • Ukip’s Black Death metaphor may be more prescient than any complacency about the party’s abysmal local election results (Ukip: Like the Black Death, we’ll be back, says official, 5 May). Corbyn isn’t reaching former Labour supporters in the Midlands and the North. With the most incompetent government in my lifetime negotiating our future, a Brexit likely to appeal to anybody looks out of the question. If the boils of poverty, inequality and racism that Ukip has exploited cannot be lanced, the plague will return. Next time it may be something much more deadly.

But she also had the strength to change direction when her beliefs in peace and justice were no longer being upheld. When she was 24 she joined the Communist party, and campaigned for them at the 1945 general election. She became secretary to the deputy head of the party, but in 1956, when the Soviet Union invaded Hungary, she resigned from her job and the party. In 1957 she signed up with CND, going on the first Aldermaston march the following year. She also joined the Committee of 100 and was one of 4,000 people who sat down in Whitehall outside the Ministry of Defence. She was arrested and spent a night in prison. Twenty years later she began regular visits to Greenham Common women’s camp, protesting against the cruise missiles. Doris was half-Jewish, and her interest in politics had begun in her early teens via a staunchly Zionist uncle, Sam Sarna. But much later, in 1962, an Iraqi student rented a room in her family home. There began a debate with regard to Israel, and from then on she supported the Palestinian cause. Though she still believed in the state of Israel, relations with her uncle were severed. From 1963 Doris travelled regularly to Syria, Iraq and Jordan. She even made some radio broadcasts in Jordan, in an attempt to defuse tensions between Jews and Arabs. She joined the Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding in 1967, and for a short time worked as a secretary at their headquarters in Trafalgar Square. She set up an East Anglian branch five years later. Doris was born in Islington, north London, to Emily (nee Kingett), a teacher, and Maurice Sarna, a manufacturing furrier. She attended Pitman’s College in Clerkenwell, leaving at 16, and then worked as a secretary in the Air Ministry. She lived initially in south London, then St Albans, and finally, in 1963, Thetford in Norfolk, taking various secretarial posts in between raising her children and travelling. In 1972 Doris joined the VSO and spent 15 months in Kumasi, Ghana, teaching English and keyboard skills. She made many lifelong friends there. In 1980, through Christian Aid and the Anglican church in the Middle East, she achieved her wish to be a volunteer in Gaza. From there she wrote letters home about the atrocities she witnessed. She also wrote of the kindness she was shown by the Palestinian people. While in Gaza, following discussions with a fellow volunteer, Doris became a Quaker. In 2003, aged 83, she joined a silent vigil in the main square of the town to protest against the invasion of Iraq. Doris is survived by her husband, John Clay, whom she married in 1959, by her two daughters, Julia and me, from previous marriages, by four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/06/losing-the-plot-with-the-taviani-brothers","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T17:18:55Z","webTitle":"Losing the plot with the Taviani brothers | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/06/losing-the-plot-with-the-taviani-brothers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/06/losing-the-plot-with-the-taviani-brothers","fields":{"headline":"Losing the plot with the Taviani brothers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1977 while viewing the Taviani brothers’ film Padre Padrone (Vittorio Taviani obituary, 3 May) at the Aaben independent cinema in Hulme, Manchester, the film’s narrative became increasingly confusing and difficult to follow.

The payment, described as a “citizen’s inheritance”, is intended to redistribute wealth at a time when young people need it most to find housing, return to education or start a business. It is also intended to reduce resentment towards baby boomers (born 1946-65) who have typically done better out of the housing market and pensions than any subsequent generation. The idea has emerged from the Resolution Foundation’s intergenerational commission, which has been working on the issue for two years and has now published its final report. The panel was chaired by David Willetts, the former Conservative universities minister, and included the TUC secretary general, Frances O’Grady, and the CBI director general, Carolyn Fairbairn. Fairbairn, who represents British business, said the tacit deal in which the young look after the old and the old help the young have a better life than the generation before had broken down. “Younger generations are bearing more risks and holding fewer assets than their predecessors,” the report states. “We need to redress that imbalance if we are to maintain the promise of an asset-owning democracy.” The findings will be seized on by millennials (born 1981-2000) who believe they have been miscast as spendthrift hedonists who would rather splash out on artisan coffee and slices of avocado on toast than save for a house deposit. Research found that in 2001 people aged 25-34 consumed the same as 55-64 year olds, and today they consume 15% less. The £10,000 lump sum would be funded by a change to inheritance tax, the authors said. Inheritance is taxed at 40% above a threshold of £1m for many. It is proposed that this would be replaced with a new 20% tax on all gifts or inheritances throughout one’s life up to £500,000, and then at 30% above that. Some millennials said the handout would barely affect their finances, given the extent of student debt and the cost of housing. Others said it could be money down the drain if it was not used wisely. However, the commission said it could only be used for housing, education, starting a business or towards a pension. The idea is underpinned by analysis that shows inherited wealth will have an ever greater effect on standards of living, with inheritances and gifts from parents set to grow in size much faster than incomes. “This poses challenges,” the authors write. “Many will not inherit, and those that do are likely to receive this support shortly before retirement rather than in the expensive family-raising years.” That not only creates a widening gap between the asset wealth of the generations but will also sow division among millennials. “Inequalities of income within generations are higher for younger people today than for their predecessors,” the report says. “There is a risk that the growing importance of inheritances means intergenerational gaps combine with intragenerational inequalities to hold back social mobility.” Painting a largely grim picture for millennials, the commission found that the disposable income of 30-year olds today was no higher than that of the generation before them, despite the economy growing 14% in the last 15 years. Millennials are half as likely as baby boomers to own their own home by the age of 30 and four times more likely to rent in the private sector. The number of families bringing up children in rented homes has trebled since 2003, to 1.8 million. Millennials in their 20s are more likely to be in insecure work than their Generation X predecessors (born 1966-80). Introducing indeterminate tenancies and limiting rent increases to inflation for three-year periods are among the proposals to help. However, millennials benefit from higher overall employment rates, higher employment rates for women and a falling gender pay gap. “Britain’s contract between generations lies at the heart of society,” said Willetts. “As families we provide for our children and parents at different times. We expect the state to support these natural instincts, but too often it is tilted in the opposite direction. Many people no longer believe that Britain is delivering on its obligations to young and old.” The report tackles the rising cost of health and social care. It proposes an extra £2.3bn per year for the NHS to help address an estimated unmet care need felt by 1.2 million people aged over 65. This would be funded partly by a new property tax to replace council tax, of up to 0.85% on properties worth more than the cheapest 10% and a 1.7% marginal rate above £600,000. Working people over 65 would also have to pay a new NHS levy. Millennials on the ‘citizen’s inheritance’ plan “I would have a big smile on my face. With no restrictions it would be gone in a month, but with the restrictions, how would it help me? £10,000 is not even enough for a deposit and I don’t want to deal with my pension until I am in my late 30s. I won’t think that far ahead. But if there were no restrictions I would be straight down to Selfridges.” Nikeh Gray, 29, London “Having that amount of money at 25 would change your ability to afford a house. Maybe you could put it into a bond while you get the rest of the money together. What the older generation don’t understand is that while the minimum wage helped people afford things for a while, that’s not the case now. I gave up on buying a house a few years ago because I realised I would never afford it.” Matilda Morgan, 23, Petersfield “I would put it towards furthering my music education, but it won’t make much of a difference; it would cover me for about two terms. There are lots of other problems with this millennial cohort. A lot of them feel the world owes them something because they were promised they can do anything they want when they were kids. My fear is some people might get the £10,000, decide to be an entrepreneur and waste it. I am kind of embarrassed to be part of that millennial group.” Rory Childs, 21, London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/07/free-speech-warriors-mistake-student-protest-censorship","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"Free-speech warriors mistake student protest for censorship | Adam Tickell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/07/free-speech-warriors-mistake-student-protest-censorship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/07/free-speech-warriors-mistake-student-protest-censorship","fields":{"headline":"Free-speech warriors mistake student protest for censorship","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Free speech on campus has once again become a point of contention. The universities minister, Sam Gyimah, has called for tough new guidelines to protect freedom of expression. His remarks come amid claims that books are being removed from libraries, and speakers banned from campuses – all because “generation snowflake” is too timid to hear discordant opinions. The reality is, of course, quite different. Universities continue to be places where free speech thrives. Arguments about who should, and shouldn’t, be given a platform are hardly new. I studied at the University of Manchester during the 1980s miners’ strike. The then home secretary, Leon Brittan, was invited to speak at the students’ union – prompting a major demonstration. Brittan came in through the front entrance and spoke to a small group inside the hall. While by no means sympathetic to the speaker, I shared the view of the students’ union executive, which supported his right to speak. On the front steps outside the building, things turned nasty. Policing was tough. Students and members of the public were arrested, and people were injured. I can’t remember anything the home secretary said, most of which was drowned out by hecklers. However, I can still visualise an event that symbolised tensions between free speech and the freedom to challenge and protest, freedom to listen or not, freedom to decide for myself. It was complex, messy and utterly exhilarating. This was a vivid and formative experience for my 20-year-old self, a precious gift that only a university could offer me. Today a new generation is testing the same boundaries, agonising in the same way we did over difficult moral decisions, rebelling against the ingrained deference of their teenage years, just like us. Now, as then, this is labelled dangerous censorship. The perception is that we are witnessing a widespread “chilling” of free speech on university campuses. Look closer and you will see that the evidence for this is vanishingly small. Not a single book has been removed from a major university library on the grounds of censorship, though some antisemitic ones have been moved to restricted shelves. Hundreds of events have taken place at my own university, Sussex, in the past year – not a single one was prevented. It is true that a small handful have needed to take into account our legal duties to preserve public order, or to avoid putting students at risk of radicalisation, or in harm’s way. But in each case measures such as requiring an independent chair, a balancing speaker or additional security were the solutions. If these changes cause a speaker to walk away from their own event, that is not censorship. Far from chilling free speech, such measures allow more, not fewer, points of view to be heard. Sussex isn’t unusual here: our approach is similar to those at universities up and down the country. The notion that protest against speech is censorship, or that it is a new phenomenon, is entirely specious. Protest is free speech, and it always has been. It is true that sometimes people get it wrong. My generation did; so did our predecessors; and current students do too. But as a vice-chancellor, and as a former student, I know that the process of nurturing global citizens is not simple. Debates about free speech, as much as controversial speakers, are part and parcel of the process of students’ political formation. Indeed, the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, told me that her politicisation occurred at Sussex as a reaction against what she saw as a leftwing intolerance. Gyimah is only the latest universities minister to address this issue. Any simplification of the rules will be welcomed by students’ unions, which sometimes feel hamstrung by the Charity Commission’s guidance. This must not, however, lead to an anything-goes approach. We wouldn’t allow speakers who incite racial hatred or terrorism. Universities and unions need to assess whether events can go ahead safely and within the law. This latter point is often lost: while rules can be simplified and bent, laws cannot. There are three legal duties that come into play here: free speech, public order and the Prevent duty to counter radicalisation. It is these duties – and not so-called snowflake students – that drive intervention. Astonishingly, this obedience to the law not only seems to land students in hot water: it can also send universities tumbling down rankings. The online magazine Spiked has over the years given Sussex its lowest free-speech rating, when our so-called crimes have been not allowing transphobic material in our teaching and having (legally required) policies against bullying and harassment. What this all adds up to is a creeping anti-youth narrative, a souring of attitudes towards the next generation. And I’m afraid that it is my generation leading the charge. In my student days, we all thought that our debates and ideas were the most original, forward-thinking and colourful in history. It’s too easy to forget that, while young people today live in an entirely different world, the causes they are fighting are every bit as important to them as ours were to us. The politics may be different but the process is the same. Something happens to many of us as we hit middle age. Our beliefs, solidified at the point of political formation, become much harder to shift. To deny an entire generation the same fluidity we enjoyed is hugely unfair. It is their right to draw different conclusions on matters we may view as settled. The intergenerational unkindness that has been allowed to permeate society must be brought to an end. We owe it to our younger selves to afford this generation the same freedom to discover, to challenge and to fail that we afforded ourselves. • Adam Tickell is vice-chancellor of the University of Sussex • This article was corrected on 7 May 2018.

This is Warnock’s eighth promotion – a record that sees him eclipse the achievements of Jim Smith, Dave Bassett and the late Graham Taylor – and completes an astonishing turnaround since he took over as manager only 19 months ago, when Cardiff were second from bottom. The goal the home supporters craved failed to materialise but in the end it did not matter, courtesy of Fulham’s defeat at Birmingham, which meant Cardiff were promoted irrespective of the scoreline here. Those goals at St Andrew’s were greeted with huge cheers, no more so than when Birmingham scored a third in the 89th minute to put to bed any lingering fears Fulham could somehow spoil the Cardiff party. A premature pitch invasion followed before the real thing, which ended up with every blade of grass covered by thousands and thousands of Cardiff supporters, who spilled over the hoardings to salute their heroes. Amid a sea of blue shirts, bathed in glorious sunshine, Warnock’s name reverberated loud and clear as the Cardiff fans paid tribute to the man who has galvanised their club and put together a team who are far greater than the sum of their parts. This is the fourth occasion he has won promotion to the top flight, following the success he enjoyed as a manager with Notts County, Sheffield United and Queens Park Rangers across three decades, and Warnock described it as “the biggest achievement in my 38-year career by an absolute mile”. Vincent Tan, Cardiff’s owner, was there to see everything unfold and to join in raucous celebrations that continued long after the final whistle. Appointing Warnock is arguably the best decision Tan has made at Cardiff and it promises to be a colourful experience with the two of them working in tandem in the Premier League. With Cardiff’s direct and uncompromising style, Warnock talked about how he has “built a team capable of ruffling a few feathers” in the Championship and made it clear he plans to do exactly the same next season. “That’s all we can do. It’s not rocket science when you take the top six out of it in the Premier League. We’ll be odds-on favourites to get relegated. But we were 33‑1 this year to get in the play-offs, let alone win promotion. So we’re going to enjoy it. At my age you can’t help but do that.” Warnock turns 70 in December and one school of thought would be that now would be a good time to call it a day and go out in style, yet he was totally dismissive when the word retirement was mentioned. “Oh no, not at all. I think I’ve got to stay here for the club. I saw a story this morning that Vincent might be selling. You just don’t know. “But as quickly as the club has developed, it could go the other way, make no mistake. And I’m not going to let it go the other way after what I’ve done. So whatever happens, I’m determined to see it through.” The Premier League has not been particularly kind to Warnock. He was relegated with Sheffield United on the final day in 2007 and sacked midway through the season with Crystal Palace and QPR, yet he sounded totally relaxed about what the future holds for him with Cardiff next season and, in what felt like an important message, vowed to sign only players prepared to buy into his way of working. “I don’t like losing four or five games on the trot and then all the experts will come out next year and tell me where I’m going wrong. But if it goes pear-shaped, I’ll just leave. So there’s nothing to worry about really,” Warnock said. “But I’m really looking forward to it. I don’t think we should worry about it too much. We’ve got the basis. We’ll have to buy five or six players to supplement the squad but it’s good to have different styles. “You get what you see with us and that is 100%. And we’ve got a bit of ability. We’ll need more but we won’t be going silly and into markets that we don’t want to get in. I’m not going to destroy what we’ve already built up now.” Although the game itself was largely forgettable – Reading were never really at risk of losing their Championship status – Cardiff’s journey back to the top flight after a four-year absence will live long in the memory of their supporters and the manager who has written his name into the record books. “I know we’re going to get one or two things thrown at us next season,” Warnock said. “But, hey ho, it’s better than playing in the Championship, isn’t it?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/07/eddie-and-the-slumber-sisters-review-corn-exchange-haddington","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T10:34:55Z","webTitle":"Eddie and the Slumber Sisters review – It's 2.17?

The late playwright, who wrote about mental illness in 4.48 Psychosis, would surely have recognised the anguish that haunts this immersive production by Catherine Wheels and the National Theatre of Scotland. Indeed, the play, conceived by director Gill Robertson and writer Anita Vettesse, could justifiably have been called 2.17 Psychosis. That’s the time when nine-year-old Eddie has the same nightmare. Played winningly by Chiara Sparkes, the dreaming girl is forever on the way to her grandmother’s house, but just can’t get past the front door. The nightmare is symbolic. Her grandmother has died and, in the outpouring of adult grief, Eddie has been excluded. Her bewilderment has taken a psychological toll. The job of sorting things out falls to the Slumber Sisters, a trio of close-harmony singers in US wartime uniform, whose mission is to turn every nightmare into a dream. The missing link between Charlie’s Angels and the Andrews Sisters, they treat the words of Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive as a rallying cry. If they can’t brighten a dream with candyfloss, they’ll try balloons. Except this trauma is too deep: only with direct intervention can they give Eddie a peaceful night’s sleep. All of this is conceptually entertaining, but takes a lot of explaining. The early part of the show is dense with detail, and only once the rescue mission is in full flight do things take off. By the end, however, it has built to an honest portrayal of grief, neither evasive nor po-faced, but a touching – and melodic – exploration of the need to say goodbye. At Dunoon Burgh Hall, 9 May.

The fighters, in traditional Cossack fur hats, joined forces with police and the National Guard security force to crack down on Saturday’s protest ahead of Vladimir Putin’s inauguration for a fourth presidential term on Monday. More than 700 people, including the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, were detained. Navalny was released early on Sunday, but faces up to 30 days in jail on charges of organising an illegal rally. He has been ordered to appear in court on 11 May. Protesters also gathered in scores of cities and towns across Russia in the biggest anti-Putin demonstrations for almost a year. “We’ll do over anyone who makes trouble against Putin,” an unnamed Cossack was reported as saying by the Meduza news website. Cossacks also used sticks to lash out at protesters who had gathered at Moscow’s Pushkin Square. Some of the assailants were identified as members of the Central Cossack Troops (CCT), an organisation that has close ties to Russia’s security forces. Moscow’s administration has paid the organisation almost £190,000 to train Cossacks in how to “ensure public safety” at events in the city, according to documents published by the mayor’s office. The Cossack organisation’s members recently met with National Guard officials to discuss security operations for the World Cup, which kicks off on 14 June. Russian media identified the CCT’s ataman, or leader, as Ivan Mironov, a former FSB state security service officer. More than 300 Cossacks are also due to work alongside police in Rostov-on-Don, the southern Russian city that will host four World Cup group matches and a round-of-16 game. Maxim Shevchenko, a member of the Kremlin’s human rights council, called for an urgent session of the council to discuss the authorities’ use of “fascist” Cossack fighters to break up Saturday’s protest in Moscow. Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s deputy director for eastern Europe and central Asia, accused Russian police of failing to act while “people in Cossack uniforms” beat protesters. The Kremlin has in recent years encouraged a revival of the Cossacks, the descendants of the fiery Tsarist-era horsemen who once guarded Russia’s southern borders. Cossacks have acted as an auxiliary police force in some cities, undertaking street patrols on the lookout for illegal immigrants. They have also taken part in raids on art galleries and theatres deemed to have displayed “blasphemous” material. Cossack paramilitary groups have fought alongside Russian-led separatists in eastern Ukraine. They have also targeted Kremlin critics. In 2016, a group of Cossacks attacked Navalny and his supporters in Anapa, a city in southern Russia. Members of Pussy Riot, the anti-Kremlin performance art group, were set on by Cossacks ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. No charges were brought against the assailants in either case. Hundreds of members of the Kremlin-backed Molodaya Gvardiya youth movement also helped police make arrests at Saturday’s rally in Moscow, while activists from the pro-Putin National Liberation Movement were involved in scuffles with protesters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/07/stephen-hawking-god-multiverse-cosmology","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T10:30:47Z","webTitle":"Did the dying Stephen Hawking really mean to strengthen the case for God? | Philip Goff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/07/stephen-hawking-god-multiverse-cosmology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/07/stephen-hawking-god-multiverse-cosmology","fields":{"headline":"Did the dying Stephen Hawking really mean to strengthen the case for God?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Scientists have discovered a surprising fact about our universe in the past 40 years: against incredible odds, the numbers in basic physics are exactly as they need to be to accommodate the possibility of life. If gravity had been slightly weaker, stars would not have exploded into supernovae, a crucial source of many of the heavier elements involved in life. Conversely, if gravity had been slightly stronger, stars would have lived for thousands rather than billions of years, not leaving enough time for biological evolution to take place. This is just one example – there are many others – of the “fine-tuning” of the laws of physics for life. Some philosophers think the fine-tuning is powerful evidence for the existence of God. However, in his 2010 book The Grand Design (co-authored with Leonard Mlodinow), Stephen Hawking defended a naturalistic explanation of fine-tuning in terms of the multiverse hypothesis. According to the multiverse hypothesis, the universe we live in is just one of an enormous, perhaps infinite, number of universes. If there are enough universes then it becomes not so improbable that at least one will chance upon the right laws for life. In Hawking’s older version of the multiverse hypothesis, there is great variety among the laws in different universes. In some gravity is stronger, in some weaker, and so on. However, physicists have come to see problems with such a heterogenous multiverse, especially if the number of universes is infinite. We work out the predictions of a given multiverse hypothesis by asking how probable our universe is according to that hypothesis. But if there is an infinite number of universes, that question becomes meaningless. And hence in his final paper, A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation?, Hawking and his co-writer, Thomas Hertog, formulate strict limits to the kind of universes that populate the multiverse. The problem is that the less variety there is among the universes, the less capable the multiverse hypothesis is of explaining fine-tuning. If there is a huge amount of variation in the laws across the multiverse, it is not so surprising that one of the universes would happen to have fine-tuned laws. But if all of the universes have exactly the same laws – as in Hawking and Hertog’s proposal – the problem returns, as we now need an explanation of why the single set of laws that govern the entire multiverse is fine-tuned. Hertog seems not to agree, arguing that the paper does make progress on fine-tuning: “This paper takes one step towards explaining that mysterious fine-tuning ... It reduces the multiverse down to a more manageable set of universes which all look alike.” However, this merely puts off the explanation of fine-tuning, for the result is that the laws underlying the generation of the multiverse are fine-tuned. We now need to explain not only why our universe is fine-tuned but why every universe is fine-tuned! In terms of explaining the fine-tuning, this is not a step forward but a step back. All is not lost. Hawking was exploring models of the multiverse based on inflationary cosmology, and his paper casts doubt on the potential of this kind of multiverse to explain fine-tuning. But there is another source of scientific support for a multiverse theory: the “many worlds” interpretation of quantum mechanics. While physicists have been exploring inflationary explanations of fine-tuning, philosophers of physics have been exploring quantum mechanical explanations of fine-tuning. If, in the earliest period of our universe, our laws were shaped by the right kind of probabilistic process, the many worlds theory could furnish us with enough variety of laws across the many worlds so as to make it likely that one would be fine-tuned. We don’t yet have evidence that our laws were shaped by such a process. But if the alternative is the postulation of a supernatural creator, then this seems like the more plausible proposal. There is still hope for a scientific account of fine-tuning. However, by ruling out one of the two scientifically credible options for doing this, Hawking and Hertog have slightly strengthened the alternative explanation in terms of God. It is ironic that the atheist Hawking should, in his final contribution to the science, make God’s existence less improbable. • Philip Goff is the author of Consciousness and Fundamental Reality"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/may/06/john-lewis-denies-waitrose-takeover-approach-by-amazon","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T13:28:15Z","webTitle":"John Lewis denies Waitrose takeover approach by Amazon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/06/john-lewis-denies-waitrose-takeover-approach-by-amazon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/06/john-lewis-denies-waitrose-takeover-approach-by-amazon","fields":{"headline":"John Lewis denies Waitrose takeover approach by Amazon","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"John Lewis Partnership (JLP) has rejected reports that it was approached by Amazon last year to take over the Waitrose supermarket chain. According to a Sunday Times report, a senior executive from Amazon pushed for a formal meeting, but was blocked by JLP’s board. Amazon’s move into the UK grocery sector two years ago, with the launch of the online delivery service Amazon Fresh, has long prompted speculation among City analysts that it could be interested in buying a more established UK supermarket chain. Its $13.7bn (£10.12bn) purchase of the organic food chain Whole Foods Markets last summer was seen as a statement of its ambitions, earning it about 460 stores, including nine in the UK, where Whole Foods has operated since 2004. The proposed £15bn Asda–Sainsbury’s merger to create a new grocery superpower has been seen as attempt to fight off the increasing threat from Amazon. According to the Sunday Times, the attempt to open talks with Waitrose was made by Ajay Kavan, vice-president of special projects at Amazon. Kavan reportedly had several “enormously informal” conversations last November with an unnamed director of JLP about a possible deal . However, Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of JLP, denied there had been an approach. He said: “These times are ripe for speculation but there has been no approach to the Partnership by Amazon regarding Waitrose and nor would I expect there to be.” Amazon said it did not comment on rumour and speculation. Waitrose became part of the John Lewis Partnership in 1937 when it had 10 stores. There are now more that 350 Waitrose stores, as well as shops at Welcome Break service stations.

Osborne made a rare entry for a public official into a bitterly contested partisan debate when asked at a press conference on Monday whether he shared Peter Dutton’s oft-repeated view that Labor’s policies would restart asylum boats. Osborne said the most “appropriate” way for him to express his views in relation to the question was to note that Operation Sovereign Borders “has been very successful now, it is almost four years without a venture”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “It is built on a very particular structure and, if we make any changes to that structure, I would have some concerns, and we will leave it at that,” Osborne said. The home affairs minister, appearing alongside Osborne, then shut down further questions about the Air Vice-Marshal’s views. Dutton has been intensifying his political rhetoric about border protection in the lead-up to a debate at Labor’s looming national conference. Such debates are a national conference standard, with left faction and activist groups pushing for more humane treatment of asylum seekers. Holding a copy of Labor’s policy platform, which is now in circulation, Dutton declared on Monday the opposition “would water down the successful elements of Operation Sovereign Borders”. “Bill Shorten is speaking out of both sides of his mouth when it comes to border protection policy,” Dutton said. “He says one thing to the press and that is that he has got a tough stand on border protection matters, and yet when he is in the Labor party conference, he is telling people there will be a softly, softly approach to border protection policy if the Labor party is to win government.” Shorten has acknowledged there will be a debate when the party meets in July but says he has no interest in adjusting the government’s policy to turn boats back when it is safe to do so. “We recognise that the boat turnback policy has been effective, and I have no interest in changing that policy,” Shorten said in late March. But he said mandatory detention should not result in indefinite detention. “I make one thing very clear: we don’t support the way the government has treated people in detention,” Shorten said. Labor’s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, has been contacted for a response to Osborne’s intervention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/planet-oz/2018/may/08/its-all-about-vested-interests-untangling-conspiracy-conservatism-and-climate-scepticism","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T15:00:52Z","webTitle":"'It's all about vested interests': untangling conspiracy, conservatism and climate scepticism | Graham Readfearn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/may/08/its-all-about-vested-interests-untangling-conspiracy-conservatism-and-climate-scepticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/may/08/its-all-about-vested-interests-untangling-conspiracy-conservatism-and-climate-scepticism","fields":{"headline":"'It's all about vested interests': untangling conspiracy, conservatism and climate scepticism","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If you reckon the 11 September terrorist attacks might have been an “inside job” or there is a nefarious new world order doing whatever it is the illuminati do, what are you likely to think about the causes of climate change? Academics have suggested that people who tend to accept conspiracy theories also underplay or reject the science showing humans are causing rapid and dangerous climate change. But a new study that tested this idea across 24 different countries found the link between so-called “conspiratorial ideation” and “climate scepticism” only really holds in the US. University of Queensland psychology professor Matthew Hornsey and colleagues surveyed 5,300 people to test the link between climate “scepticism” and acceptance of four internationally propagated conspiracy theories around the assassination of President Kennedy, the 11 September terrorist attacks, the death of Princess Diana and the existence of a new world order. • Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Only in the US did the correlation fall outside the margin of error. This is perhaps not surprising, given the booming online conspiracy culture in the Trumpocene, with even would-be presidential science advisers hanging around with conspiracy theorists. Conservatism and climate The study also tried to tease out the links between the rejection of human-caused climate change and the ideologies that people hold. It’s here that the study offers the greatest cause for hope, Hornsey says. He has developed a form of “jiujitsu” persuasion technique that he thinks might work. There’s been a general acceptance that people who have broadly conservative or rightwing ideologies tend to rail against climate science because it rubs their worldview up the wrong way. That is, that tackling climate change will require broad interventions from governments. But Hornsey’s study finds that “there is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science”. Instead, it suggests vested interests have managed to reshape the conservative identity with “ignorance-building strategies” in two countries – the US and Australia. Hornsey agreed to expand on the study by answering further questions by email. You found that in the US people’s climate “scepticism” was more aligned to a conservative worldview than any other country surveyed. Why do you think the US is in this position? I think it’s a result of two things. First, a lot of the big business interests that are threatened by climate change are situated in the US. My overall argument is that there’s nothing inherent to political conservatism that makes people want to reject climate science. Rather, the link between conservatism and climate scepticism only emerges in countries that are economically threatened by the notion of responding to climate change. When the vested interests are high (in terms of the fossil fuel industry, for example) then there is more of a motivation for big business to engage in an organised campaign of misinformation around climate change. These campaigns often develop as a collaboration between the fossil fuel industry and conservative thinktanks, media and politicians, and are designed to “coach” conservatives to believe that the climate science is not yet settled. From this perspective, conservatives don’t spontaneously feel the need to reject climate science; they only do so when they are taking their cues from conservative elites, and these cues only emerge when the economic stakes are high. Second, America has an unusually intense brand of conservatism, one that has a particularly strong opposition to government interference in the free market. Climate science is a nightmare for these people, because in some ways it does imply a big-government response designed to regulate industry. What role do the views of high-profile politicians have in influencing voters to think about the issue in a certain way? I think it plays a massive role. In many countries, climate scepticism is not part of the language of the conservative parties. But in Australia and America it is. So in those countries being a climate sceptic starts becoming part of the package of attitudes that you’re supposed to have if you’re a good conservative. The obvious example of this is in the US. Of the 17 candidates who campaigned to be the Republican nominee for the 2016 presidential campaign, the majority were climate change sceptics. So people’s sense of what it means to be a Republican in America has expanded to incorporate something that shouldn’t really be political, like climate science. There, people advertise their climate scepticism like they’re advertising their political gang colours. It’s not quite as bad here, but threatened to become like that during the [Tony] Abbott era. Why do you think this has happened? I think it’s all about vested interests. When the vested interests are high, the fossil fuel industry and conservative thinktanks, media and politicians collaborate in an organised campaign of misinformation. In my data, the link between conservatism and scepticism is really only obvious in countries with high per capita carbon emissions. If you think of per capita carbon emissions as a measure of how fossil fuel reliant a country is, then this makes sense. In countries with low fossil fuel reliance – where the vested interests are low – then there’s no need to kick off a campaign of misinformation, and no motivation to believe one either. In the paper, you say “there is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science”. Can you clarify this? Doesn’t endorsement of small governments and low regulation actually predispose conservatives to engage in motivated reasoning to reject the science of climate change? Yes, but most conservatives aren’t paying that much attention. I really think conservatives have to be trained and coached to pay attention, and to see the issue through the lens of their worldviews. In the 1980s you didn’t see conservatives get upset about governments shutting down CFCs to protect the ozone layer. Technically the issue was the same – government regulations curbing the freedom of industry – but because the vested interests were low there was no need for conservative elites to fight back. What do you think it would take for the US and Australia to break the apparent link between conservative ideology and climate “scepticism”? As the negative consequences of climate change become more severe and more immediate, I think the ideological element will fade away (although by then it’s likely to be too late, sadly). The other option is to use what I call “jiujitsu” persuasion techniques; to talk about climate mitigation in a way that aligns with people’s underlying ideologies rather than competing with them. There’s already evidence that if you frame climate change mitigation as something that’s sympathetic to free markets, or as a patriotic act designed to maintain energy security, or as a chance to generate green jobs, then conservatives are less likely to resist the science. • You can read Matthew Hornsey’s paper in Nature Climate Change"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/08/extreme-esports-the-very-male-billion-dollar-gaming-industry-at-a-stadium-near-you","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T18:00:04Z","webTitle":"Extreme eSports: the very male, billion-dollar gaming industry at a stadium near you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/08/extreme-esports-the-very-male-billion-dollar-gaming-industry-at-a-stadium-near-you","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/08/extreme-esports-the-very-male-billion-dollar-gaming-industry-at-a-stadium-near-you","fields":{"headline":"Extreme eSports: the very male, billion-dollar gaming industry at a stadium near you","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Whenever an artist scheduled to play Qudos Bank Arena at Sydney Olympic Park doesn’t sell enough tickets, the venue tactfully drapes black cloth over the empty seats in the theatre’s uppermost section. Filling more than 18,000 seats is quite an ask, which is why only top-flight acts like Pink, Katy Perry, Shania Twain and Kendrick Lamar are attempting it in coming months. The black cloth is not needed today. Sydney gaming enthusiasts have filled the venue almost to capacity for the Intel Extreme Masters (IEM), a three-day professional video game tournament that rivals anything Qudos has hosted in terms of scale and spectacle. Two groups of five men are onstage, seated at computer monitors. Headphones on, hunched forward, they sit almost completely immobile save for their flickering hands and darting eyes. Their coaches pace grimly behind them, watching the screens and muttering directives into their microphones. Behind them, two enormous television monitors broadcast their onscreen actions. On the dusty streets of a Moroccan village, a band of balaclava-clad separatists is shot to pieces by a matching squad of Special Forces soldiers. Thirty seconds later, the soldiers are the ones cut down, caught in the crosshairs of a sniper as they stumble through a veil of smoke. A bomb planted on a cache of chemical weapons ignites, presumably killing thousands. From the VIP seats to the nosebleed section, the enraptured crowd watches on, occasionally roaring its collective approval or disappointment. It is overwhelmingly male, although not noticeably more so than your average rugby league match. The main difference to any other sporting audience is that of age: the vast majority of attendees are in their 20s and 30s. During lulls in play, they amuse themselves in the time-honoured way of bored Australian sports fans everywhere: by batting around a few beach balls and taunting security’s efforts to stop them. Chants of “Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!” are just as regular and inane as they are at the cricket. When events onscreen reach a climax, the immense amphitheatre thunders with the crowd’s euphoria. If this scene sounds made-up, you have officially missed the boat on the eSports phenomenon. Competitive gaming is a billion-dollar industry, and Sydney has become the field’s domestic epicentre. IEM is dedicated to Counterstrike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), a multiplayer first-person shoot-’em-up where teams of five compete against each other in simple, objective-based rounds. Teams either assume the role of “terrorists” trying to plant a bomb, or Special Forces-style “counter-terrorists” trying to stop them, with much carnage resulting. Sixteen professional CS:GO teams from as far afield as the European Union, Brazil, the United States and China are competing at IEM for a share in the $310,000 prize pool. Individual games take less than two minutes, with tournament rounds decided via a best-of-30 format. Whichever team wins 16 games takes the round, like a set in a game of tennis, and the team that wins two of three rounds wins the contest and advances to the next stage. For competitors, this is not an amateur pursuit – it is a livelihood, and a possible ticket to sponsorship and stardom. While large-scale eSports events like IEM are relatively new in Australia, tournaments overseas routinely attract tens of thousands of attendees and millions of livestream views. As the scene has become increasingly professionalised, competitive eSports has begun to resemble traditional sport far more than the old cliche of nerdy kids playing in a basement. Like any other sport, it has its own doping scandals, injuries and pay and contract disputes. Teams are increasingly joining the World eSports Association, a peak body designed to standardise pay, conditions, rights and regulations across the industry. The major brands – Fnatic, Cloud9, Legacy – attract the same loyalty and fanaticism of elite sports teams. Their uniforms are adorned with the logos of hefty sponsors like Audi, Dr Pepper and Vodafone, and they scout lower pool-stage tournaments for talented players to sign. Australian Oliver Tierney, known by the handle DickStacy, turned 21 three weeks ago and has been playing professionally for a year. Tierney has already played at international CS:GO tournaments in London, Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia and New Zealand, and is headed to Dallas in two weeks with Australian team Grayhound Gaming. His celebrity with the IEM crowd is evident by the reception he receives when he tries to use one of the venue’s bathrooms. “I love the competitiveness of it, I love the group aspect,” Tierney says. “I never thought I’d be here in a million years.” While Tierney has established himself overseas, he’s also keen to grow eSports domestically. “The industry’s just going to keep growing and growing,” he says. “We’re completely behind in Australia at the moment; our internet’s too patchy, no one takes games seriously, the culture’s not there yet. But every kid these days knows what eSports is. The new generation coming through is where it’s going to happen.” As the 16 male teams battle it out, the CS:GO Women’s Sydney Open, a domestic tournament, plays in a side room. Around 100 people sit in the audience, making it the only space at IEM with more than a handful of women at any given time. It’s a sober reminder of the gender disparity that permeates both sports and gaming culture. Like almost any other sport, women eSports tournaments are woefully underpaid compared to the main international tournament, which is dominated by men. The two women’s teams in the grand final – Sydney Saints and Control ESports – are only competing for the lion’s share of $10,000 in prize money. The main tournament is not formally gender segregated, but while women are eligible to compete, there were no female players in the 16 teams over the weekend. It’s a circumstance that points more points more to the sexism present in the wider gaming scene than any disparity in ability. The 2014 Gamergate scandal, which saw female gaming journalists and critics of gaming culture’s more boorish aspects targeted by waves of online abuse, was the first rumbling of what would become the weaponised misogyny of the Trump campaign and the violent “incel” movement. Female eSports players have often spoken out about cyberbullying, verbal abuse and online harassment, which turn an ostensible meritocracy into one dominated by male players as women vacate the scene. Nicole Constantine is the Sydney Saints’ manager, handling their schedules and day-to-day logistics. She thinks that while gender equality in eSports is a way off, the “step-by-step” work of women like the Saints is wearing down the barriers. “If you give girls the opportunity, they will perform”, Constantine says. “Constantly criticising and comparing them to the boys’ leagues is useless, because they stand on their own.” By Sunday, the 16 male teams have been whittled down to two: FaZe Clan, the home crowd favourites, and Astralis, hyped by MC Oliver D’Anastasi as “possibly the best team in the world”. Despite FaZe Clan eventually blitzing the best-of-five rounds contest, the final takes nearly five hours. When they finally complete the whitewash, the arena erupts. As Sydney goes about its Sunday, unaware of the growing phenomenon unfolding in its midst, 18,000 gaming devotees stand to cheer their new champions. • This article was edited on 9 May 2018 to correct the assertion that the main Intel Extreme Masters tournament did not allow female players, and to include additional supporting information for the subsequent analysis of the gender dynamic observed by the reporter at the event"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/08/new-socceroos-faces-identify-bert-van-marwijks-anxieties","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"New Socceroos faces identify Bert Van Marwijk’s anxieties | Richard Parkin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/08/new-socceroos-faces-identify-bert-van-marwijks-anxieties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/08/new-socceroos-faces-identify-bert-van-marwijks-anxieties","fields":{"headline":"New Socceroos faces identify Bert Van Marwijk’s anxieties","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When a squad is named ahead of a World Cup attention rightly rushes to the new faces, in this case Daniel Arzani and Fran Karačić. But what is most telling about these inclusions are the concerns or anxieties they betray in Bert van Marwijk, most pointedly in the case of Karačić and the Socceroos’ ongoing weakness at right-back. With classic Dutch brusqueness van Marwijk justified to the gathered football media on Monday his inclusion of the uncapped Croatian-born defender. “The problem is we don’t have a lot of choices for the right back position,” he said. “What I’ve seen until now is we don’t have a lot of right-back defenders.” It’s hardly a glowing endorsement of the existing options, with a key feature of Van Marwijk’s first game in charge against Norway being his experimentation with Milos Degenek and Bailey Wright – both who play for their clubs as centre-backs – in the troubled position. The order with which Van Marwijk announced his squad was also telling, with the coach naming 12 defenders, six or seven midfielders and nine or 10 attackers. With the middle of the park more or less settled, huge selection dilemmas still loom at the back and up front. By Van Marwijk’s ordering, grouped by position, Josh Brillante is framed as another potential right-back consideration, with Mark Milligan being considered as a central defensive option rather than in midfield. The issue at right-back is by no means a new headache; it continues a pattern of concern dating back years, with the Socceroos struggling to find a long-term heir to 2006 and 2010 World Cup stalwart Luke Wilkshire following his unceremonious dumping by then new coach, Ange Postecoglou. So dissatisfied with the dearth of specialist full-backs on both sides, Postecoglou even experimented with shifting to three-at-the-back, to considerable hostility within the football media and supporters. Rather than being a squad rebuilt however, the Socceroos defensive backline – all the way across – suddenly looks again one in transition. Of the defensive unit named by Van Marwijk, only Wright survives from the squad that flew to the 2014 World Cup, with none of the starters in Brazil – Jason Davidson, Matthew Spiranovic, Alex Wilkinson, Ivan Franjic or Ryan McGowan – even in this extended group. With Wright seeing no game time in Brazil, there’s little wonder Van Marwijk lists Milligan as a centre-back option, with the Al Ahli utility just one of six named with previous World Cup experience throughout the entire squad. In this context, Karačić’s inclusion could be enormous. Tall, strong, already experienced in a top-flight league and more than that – a specialist full-back – the 21-year-old who captains his hometown club Lokomotiva Zagreb could become a vital component in a Socceroos backline lacking world-class ability. In including Karačić, a player Van Marwijk revealed during Monday’s press conference that he’d never seen play in person, the Dutchman also gave a tremendous vote of confidence to his support staff, and assistant Ante Miličić who had been tracking the player. In contrast with the arrogance of previous European Socceroos managers this willingness to listen and heed the advice of colleagues cannot be overstated. In retaining all 26 players from his original squad – no scapegoats, no warning shots – Van Marwijk has also showed trust in his playing group, a quality that could prove invaluable when coming up against vaunted opposition such as France at the World Cup. “I am not a person who changes all the time and we thought for a long time about the first squad that we selected,” he said. “I had a good experience with the 26 players in the 10 days that I worked with them, so I had no reason not to nominate them again.” In selecting Arzani, Van Marwijk has also alluded at another anxiety point, keeping his attacking options very open with as many as 10 players selected in competition for just three starting spots. Almost certainly Tim Cahill will travel to Russia, the Dutchman as good as confirmed this at the press conference, as once again the golden forehead will carry the hopes of a nation, even if only this time in 15-20 minute cameos. But for strikers, who trade on sharpness and the most miniscule of margins between success and failure, a squad full of options that keeps not just opponents guessing but also the players themselves is a canny move. Arzani may or may not yet be World Cup ready – but if he doesn’t play a single minute in Russia his selection has already fired a warning shot to more established Socceroos like Robbie Kruse or Mathew Leckie. In eschewing a farewell home fixture in exchange for an extended training camp in Turkey, Van Marwijk has also already won a huge victory over the purse string holders at 1 Oxford Street. Away from the Australian football media and public, the players can focus on earning their places. Van Marwijk took efforts to explain how important this was for him. Time in camp, time together. Time building combinations, time honing strengths and removing weaknesses. Compared to the “golden generation” of the 2006 World Cup there are few world-class stars among the Socceroos of this squad – any aspirations to get out of a difficult Group C will rely on the collective being much more than the sum of its parts. But with potential wildcards like Karačić and Arzani in the mix and with so many starting places still waiting for somebody to make their own, this Socceroos group could yet produce some surprises."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/08/peter-duttons-power-grabs-may-yet-be-his-undoing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T20:34:29Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton’s power grabs may yet be his undoing | Richard Ackland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/peter-duttons-power-grabs-may-yet-be-his-undoing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/peter-duttons-power-grabs-may-yet-be-his-undoing","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton’s power grabs may yet be his undoing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Britain’s home secretary, Amber Rudd, resigned last week over an immigration scandal the unpleasantness of which would have made our Peter Dutton proud. Ms Rudd was supposed to be implementing a harsh policy of deportations, sending back immigrants to the Caribbean who had arrived in Britain over a period of 20 years from 1948. Known as the Windrush generation, after the ship that brought them from Jamaica, the immigrants arrived under a program designed to fill labour shortages at cheap rates. Many stayed on in Britain while a large proportion had a tenuous legal status because their documentation was incomplete. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday While Rudd was telling her prime minister, Theresa May, that she was aiming at “increased forced removals by more than 10% over the next few years” she was simultaneously telling a Commons committee, “We do not have targets for removals”. As Rudd shows, saying misleading things can be more catastrophic to a political career than running a deliberately inhumane policy. On home turf, home affairs minister Dutton, also has responsibly for immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, yet he can revel with impunity in the inhumanity of his dead-end scheme of permanent detention. He can seek to undermine the rule of law with rabble-rousing attacks on judges, magistrates and members of tribunals handling refugee and immigration cases. He has floated a “quasi election” proposal whereby the public would be invited to approve lawyers for judicial positions. He claims that lawyers who act for asylum seekers are “unAustralian”. His department can delay or refuse the transfer of critically ill refugees from Manus Island or Nauru to hospitals in Australia. He sends people back to the places of torture from which they have fled. He thinks he should have unchallengeable powers to ban entire nationalities or any “specified class of persons” from either travelling to or staying in Australia on their current visas. He has said that he would prefer to accept refugees who were from persecuted minorities in Syria, most of who happen to be Christians. He persists in linking terrorism to asylum seekers and dishonestly calls boat arrivals “illegals”. He described the “Armani refugees” on Manus as taking advantage of Australia’s generosity. After the removal of references to the Refugee Convention from the Migration Act Dutton now wants Australia to “rethink” its commitment to the convention while simultaneously abandoning his duty of guardianship towards children held on Nauru. He has denied claims of a plan to expand the role of the Australian Signals Directorate into domestic spying, nonetheless he thinks it’s a good idea. Naturally, with this range of qualifications Dutton wants to be prime minister. Unlike Amber Rudd, Dutton’s regressive values are the foundation of his startling promotion within the ranks of the government. The last minister who gently chided his overreach was the outgoing attorney general George Brandis, who belatedly was critical of ministerial attacks on legal institutions and those who practise in them. This was met by a snarling response from Dutton on one of his soft soap sessions with the broadcaster Ray Hadley. Not only is the home affairs minister in charge of immigration, customs and borders but also a massive and repressive security apparatus, described by Professor George Williams, dean of law at the University of New South Wales, as being on a scale unprecedented in the western world. In Britain, the width and breadth of functional responsibilities has proved to be beyond the grasp of a succession of home secretaries. The Bagehot columnist in The Economist recently said that the Home Office “is a nightmare to run”: ... being on top of your brief is almost impossible in a department with so many sprawling responsibilities ... The department is also littered with land mines: one former home secretary says that at any one time there are 30 people in the Home Office who can destroy the home secretary’s career. Here are a few lessons that Peter Dutton might bear in mind: In 2004 Beverley Hughes, a junior home secretary, resigned because she said she was unaware of a visa fraud, when she had known about it for at least a year. In 2006, home secretary John Reid admitted his immigration systems were not “fit for purpose” after it was revealed that applications were not being checked. In 2006, it emerged there was a backlog of 502,000 claims for asylum that the department hadn’t processed. In 2011, the head of the UK Border Force resigned after claims that he had relaxed visa processing rules without telling Home Secretary Theresa May. In 2013 the Home Office was accused of having lost track of 174,000 people who remained in Britain on expired visas. In 2016, it also emerged that the whereabouts in the country was unknown of a further 71,000 international students who had finished their studies. Quite apart from that, in 2004 home secretary David Blunkett resigned after being accused of fast-tracking a visa application for his ex-lover’s nanny, and this was at a time when he had been tightening the visa process. Under the prime ministerships of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown there were six home secretaries over a 13-year period. For the committed band of citizens who disapprove of Dutton and his methods, this potted history shows there is hope yet. Underneath the home affairs minister is a vast machinery of functionaries exercising delegated powers on the basis of “reasonable suspicion”. Here’s an example of how reasonable suspicion works: Livinus Okwume, a Nigerian national arrived at Brisbane airport in July 2005 on a business (short-stay) visa, hoping to attend a nursing conference. He was apprehended in the baggage area on an “intuitive basis”, maybe because of his skin colour. He was interviewed by officers of the commonwealth, including Kay O’Connell and Benjamin Kriss. O’Connell thought all his paperwork was in order and that he was a genuine nurse, however Kriss formed a “reasonable suspicion” that Okwume’s passport was bogus. At some point of the interviews he said he wanted to apply for asylum in Australia, whereupon his visa was cancelled, he was taken under guard to a motel for the night, and then removed to the Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre near Port Augusta, South Australia, where he spent the next eight months as an unlawful non-citizen. In Okwume v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Justice Natalie Charlesworth of the federal court found that Kriss and two other officers had not formed their reasonable suspicions reasonably, so the first 18 hours of detention had been unlawful. Okwume was awarded a total of $1,600 in damages and $400 in lieu of interest. The judge went on to find that the remaining eight months in detention were lawful. Okwume’s file had come into the hands of another officer, Michelle Grau in Brisbane. She received a report from a forensic document examiner in Canberra, Trevor Alt, who said he could see nothing untoward with the passport. Nonetheless, Grau had ongoing concerns about Okwume’s identity and asked for legal advice from Miriam Moore, the director of legal opinions within the department. Her advice was: Given the visa remains cancelled the detention would remain valid. I also note you are correct in pointing out that the visa would have ceased by now anyway, so unless he holds some other kind of visa he would not be lawful and would need to be detained. It doesn’t get more Kafkaesque than that. The forensic people say his passport is valid despite the reasonable suspicion people thinking it is bogus. But because while in detention his visa has lapsed it is lawful to continue to detain him. Both Okwume and the commonwealth appealed and a decision arrived on Friday 4 May, nearly 13 years after he was detained at Brisbane airport. The full federal court dismissed both appeals. Justice Richard White was the only judge who found for Okwume and against the commonwealth. The outcome means that Justice Charlesworth must have been right. The commonwealth successfully applied for a nondisclosure order in relation to reports on the incident prepared by Kriss, whose original “reasonable suspicion” started this cavalcade of misfortune. Okwume applied for refugee status while he was held at Baxter, and after an appeal was successful. He got a protection visa and was able to get out of detention – otherwise he might still be there. Grau has been elevated to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (migration and refugee division) while Okwume is now an Australian citizen. Australians used to understand that if someone is to be locked up for an extended period a judge should be the one doing the locking up. Yet, here there was not so much as a sniff of a judge anywhere near the process that incarcerated Livinus Okwume. All that it took was one of the minister’s functionaries to have a suspicion – reasonable or otherwise.

Three AMP directors are up for re-election at Thursday’s meeting and need the endorsement of investors angry at the wealth manager’s performance and the string of scandals exposed in the royal commission. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon AMP’s new chairman, David Murray, on Monday urged investors to keep a cool head, saying the company needed a period of stability following the revelations of the royal commission. “Serious investors have to consider whether anger is in itself a good enough frame of mind to make decisions,” Murray told the ABC. “I’m not defending anybody on the AMP board but they have to decide whether they want anger to prevail, or they’re confident that I can make the appropriate changes over time.” The Australian Shareholders’ Association said a period of instability was regrettable but necessary. ASA representative Ian Graves confirmed his organisation would use its sway to try to boot out three of AMP’s existing board members, including one who was only appointed last year. The three directors are Holly Kramer, Vanessa Wallace and Andrew Harmos. “It could be destabilising,” Graves told Guardian Australia. “But as far as our view is concerned … the board renewal should start as quickly as possible because a) it gives a message to shareholders and b) it gives a message to staff, that their jobs are at risk if they ever repeat [this conduct].” AMP has already begun a partial shake-up since the royal commission revelations and has slashed directors’ fees by 25%. Its former chairwoman Catherine Brenner resigned, as did its general counsel, Brian Salter, and the chief executive, Craig Meller. Brenner and Salter left AMP after evidence in the royal commission showing the company had repeatedly interfered with a supposedly independent investigation of its practise of charging clients without providing any service. The royal commission heard AMP had interfered in a report prepared by the law firm Clayton Utz to minimise the involvement of senior executives. That report was later presented to the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The company sought to lay blame for the interference at Salter’s feet last week, saying in a statement that the board and Brenner “were unaware of and disappointed about the number of drafts and the extent of the group general counsel’s interaction with Clayton Utz”. The royal commission has previously heard evidence that suggested Brenner was involved in viewing and suggesting amendments to the Clayton Utz report. The royal commission heard last month that Clayton Utz partner Nicholas Mavrakis emailed Brenner a copy of the draft report on the fee-for-no-service scandal, before the pair had a phone call. A later email from Salter to Mavrakis also suggested Brenner’s involvement. “I spoke to Catherine earlier today,” Salter wrote on 4 October. “She said that she relayed a number of comments to you over the phone last week and confirmed that she has no more. “Can you please let us have the next draft with the amendments marked up today?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/08/how-white-women-use-strategic-tears-to-avoid-accountability","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T18:00:04Z","webTitle":"How white women use strategic tears to silence women of colour | Ruby Hamad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/how-white-women-use-strategic-tears-to-avoid-accountability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/how-white-women-use-strategic-tears-to-avoid-accountability","fields":{"headline":"How white women use strategic tears to silence women of colour","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That the voices of “women of colour” are getting louder and more influential is a testament less to the accommodations made by the dominant white culture and more to their own grit in a society that implicitly – and sometimes explicitly – wants them to fail. At the Sydney writers’ festival on Sunday, editor of Djed Press, Hella Ibrahim, relayed the final minutes of a panel on diversity featuring writers from the western Sydney Sweatshop collective. One of the panellists, Winnie Dunn, in answering a question about the harm caused by good intentions, had used the words “white people” and “shit” in the same sentence. This raised the ire of a self-identified white woman in the audience who interrogated the panellists as to “what they think they have to gain” by insulting people who “want to read their stories.” In other words, the woman saw a personal attack where there wasn’t one and decided to remind the panellists that as a member of the white majority she ultimately has their fate in her hands. “I walked out of that panel frustrated,” Ibrahim wrote. “Because yet again, a good convo was derailed, white people centred themselves, and a POC panel was told to police it’s [sic] tone to make their message palatable to a white audience.” Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Trauma assails brown and black women from all directions. There is the initial pain of being subjected to gendered racism and discrimination, there is the additional distress of not being believed or supported, and of having your words and your bravery seemingly credited to others. And then there is a type of trauma inflicted on women of colour that many of us find among the hardest to disclose, the one that few seem willing to admit really happens because it is so thoroughly normalised most people refuse to see it. It is what that writers’ festival audience member was demonstrating, and what blogger and author Luvvie Ajayi called the “weary weaponising of white women’s tears”. To put it less poetically, it is the trauma caused by the tactic many white women employ to muster sympathy and avoid accountability, by turning the tables and accusing their accuser. Almost every BW (black woman) I know has a story about a time in a professional setting in which she attempted to have a talk with a WW about her behavior &amp; it has ended with the WW (white woman) crying,” one black woman wrote on Twitter. “The WW wasn’t crying because she felt sorry and was deeply remorseful. The WW was crying because she felt “bullied” and/or that the BW was being too harsh with her.” When I shared these tweets on my Facebook page asking brown and black women if this had ever happened to them, I was taken by how deeply this resonated, prompting one Arab woman to share this story: A WW kept touching my hair. Pulling my curls to watch them bounce back. Rubbing the top. Smelling it. So when I told her to stop and complained to HR and my supervisor, she complained that I wasn’t a people person or team member and I had to leave that position for being ‘threatening’ to a coworker.” For the doubters, here is a mild version of this sleight-of-hand in action: Notice it is the white woman – Jeanne Beker – who first interrupts the black woman – Jully Black – who takes the interruption in her stride. Black continues to speak passionately and confidently, which Beker interprets as a personal attack on her even though Black is clearly talking in general terms (just as Winnie Dunn was). Beker then attempts to shut Black down by essentially branding her a bully. Had Jully Black not stopped and repeated Jeanne Beker’s words back at her – “Why are you attacking me?” – they would have passed largely unnoticed, just another woman of colour smeared as an aggressor for daring to continue speaking when a white woman wanted her to stop. It doesn’t usually end this way. “White women tears are especially potent … because they are attached to the symbol of femininity,” Ajayi explains. “These tears are pouring out from the eyes of the one chosen to be the prototype of womanhood; the woman who has been painted as helpless against the whims of the world. The one who gets the most protection in a world that does a shitty job overall of cherishing women.” As I look back over my adult life a pattern emerges. Often, when I have attempted to speak to or confront a white woman about something she has said or done that has impacted me adversely, I am met with tearful denials and indignant accusations that I am hurting her. My confidence diminished and second-guessing myself, I either flare up in frustration at not being heard (which only seems to prove her point) or I back down immediately, apologising and consoling the very person causing me harm. It is not weakness or guilt that compels me to capitulate. Rather, as I recently wrote, it is the manufactured reputation Arabs have for being threatening and aggressive that follows us everywhere. In a society that routinely places imaginary “wide-eyed, angry and Middle Eastern” people at the scenes of violent crimes they did not commit, having a legitimate grievance is no match for the strategic tears of a white damsel in distress whose innocence is taken for granted. “We talk about toxic masculinity,” Ajayi warns, “but there is (also) toxicity in wielding femininity in this way.” Brown and black women know we are, as musician Miss Blanks writes, “imperfect victims”. That doesn’t mean we are always in the right but it does mean we know that against a white woman’s accusations, our perspectives will almost always go unheard either way. Whether angry or calm, shouting or pleading, we are still perceived as the aggressors. Likewise, white women are equally aware their race privileges them as surely as ours condemns us. In this context, their tearful displays are a form of emotional and psychological violence that reinforce the very system of white dominance that many white women claim to oppose. • Ruby Hamad is a journalist and PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales The headline of this article was amended on 11 May 2018 to better reflect the content of the piece"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/07/womens-economic-security-in-budget-spotlight-kelly-odwyer-confirms","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T01:16:59Z","webTitle":"Women's economic security in budget spotlight, Kelly O'Dwyer confirms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/womens-economic-security-in-budget-spotlight-kelly-odwyer-confirms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/womens-economic-security-in-budget-spotlight-kelly-odwyer-confirms","fields":{"headline":"Women's economic security in budget spotlight, Kelly O'Dwyer confirms","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kelly O’Dwyer has confirmed that Tuesday’s budget will set aside funding for a women’s economic security statement to be delivered in September. On Monday the minister for revenue and women said there would be “a lot in the budget for millions of Australian women” but the Coalition would further address issues including workforce participation, pay equity and superannuation with a separate package. The Australian Financial Review reported that “significant” funding of more than $100m would be set aside in the contingency reserves of Tuesday’s budget for the economic security statement. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon O’Dwyer told ABC’s AM the government wanted to ensure that women were safe “in their homes, online and in their workplaces”. She said the statement would “make sure that women have the economic capability, the economic resilience to make choices about their lives”. “It’s particularly important when you consider that women retire, on average, with a lot less in their superannuation balances than men,” she said. “The median superannuation balance is around 42% less for women. “All the things that we can do to actually help women to be able to save for their retirement – because women, happily, live a lot longer than men – all that we can do to help them prepare for their retirement will be a good thing.” O’Dwyer cited previously announced measures including catch-up contributions and the low-income superannuation tax offset which means 1.9 million won’t pay more tax on their super than the marginal tax rate for income. “We’re building the next steps around women’s economic security and there will be a significant statement in spring,” she said. Asked about Labor’s promise to axe the goods and services tax on women’s sanitary products, O’Dwyer agreed that tampons were a “necessity” but said it was up to states and territories to agree to remove the tax. O’Dwyer noted that the former treasurer Joe Hockey had proposed taking the GST off tampons but the Federal Council of Financial Relations had rejected it. “[The states] need to unanimously agree to a change … If they can get unanimous agreement, that would be great,” she said. In 2015 the government pledged $100m to tackle violence against women, and in 2017 it made a commitment to reduce the gender workforce participation gap by 25% by 2025. Labor has promised to restore the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ time use survey to measure unpaid and domestic work, which is disproportionately done by women, and to put gender at the heart of government decision making."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/07/leinster-racing-92-champions-cup-final-dan-carter-johnny-sexton-bilbao","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T10:59:47Z","webTitle":"Leinster’s ruthless edge can complete greenwash in Champions Cup final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/07/leinster-racing-92-champions-cup-final-dan-carter-johnny-sexton-bilbao","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/07/leinster-racing-92-champions-cup-final-dan-carter-johnny-sexton-bilbao","fields":{"headline":"Leinster’s ruthless edge can complete greenwash in Champions Cup final","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The Champions Cup final has yet to be played but Leinster can already claim to be Europe’s best, having answered every question thrown at them by the pick of the domestic leagues. The Irish region’s route to Saturday’s showpiece in Bilbao took in a home-and-away double over the Premiership champions, Exeter, and the club that have finished as leaders of the Top 14, Montpellier, before the delivery of knockout blows to the holders, Saracens, and the winners of last season’s Pro12, the Scarlets. Their other victims, home and away, were Glasgow who, like Leinster, finished the regular season top of their Pro14 conference. They have become the second team after Saracens to reach the final with a 100% record, despite being in a pool that contained four teams who were to look down on the rest in their respective leagues at the end of the season and they travel to northern Spain looking to emulate Toulouse’s feat of winning the competition for the fourth time. Standing in their way are Racing 92, beaten finalists in 2016, who qualified for the quarter-finals after finishing second in their group having lost to Munster and Castres. It will be the final appearance in Europe for Dan Carter before the former New Zealand fly-half plays out his career in Japan, but the knee injury to Maxime Machenaud, the archetypal French scrum-half schemer as well as goal-kicker, will lower their heartbeat. Leinster are the favourites but a cup final is a one-off occasion in which form has on many an occasion proved an unreliable barometer. They are almost an international side: 18 of their players were involved in Ireland’s grand slam-winning Six Nations campaign this year and Leinster are supplemented by shrewd overseas signings in Isa Nacewa, in his final month before retiring, and Scott Fardy. Nearly half Racing’s squad is not French, with Carter, Leone Nakarawa, Juan Imhoff, Patrick Lambie and Donnacha Ryan highlighting their global reach, but they are less dependent on foreign aid than their rivals: Teddy Thomas, Virimi Vakatawa, Henry Chavancy, Eddy Ben Arous, Camille Chat, Cedate Gomes Sa, Bernard Le Roux and Wenceslas Lauret have all played for France in the last year, along with Machenaud, who ruptured knee ligaments 10 minutes after coming on as a replacement in Bordeaux last Sunday. Racing run on emotion more than Leinster, who have so refined the art of keeping possession that they starved the counterattacking Scarlets in last month’s one-sided semi-final. A team that had created 154 rucks at Exeter and recycled the ball every time lost one out of 126 against the Welsh region and enjoyed 59% possession, showing the kind of ruthlessness that had taken Saracens to Europe’s summit in the previous two years. Racing will pose a different threat, not least in the set pieces, where their scrum is anchored by the 23st prop Ben Tameifuna. If the Scarlets lacked ball carriers, looking to attack quickly from turnovers, the 2016 French champions have more than a few and it was their ability to get behind the lines that took them to victory at Clermont Auvergne in the quarter-finals, supplemented by the continuity Carter brought from the bench. They scored early and often against Munster in the semi-final, just holding on to what they had banked, but if fitness is the determining factor, Leinster will prevail. As Carter enters his final few weeks with Racing, he reflects on a reason he feels New Zealand are at the top of the world rankings while France are among the also-rans. “What jumps out at me is that players here are big and strong but they need to spend more time passing the ball. Kids in New Zealand grow up passing the ball, which is why we have natural talent. And it does not stop there: Test players will work on their skills at the end of training sessions. That does not happen so much in France, where players spend more time in the gym.” Leinster are more like a New Zealand side, comfortable with handling and passing, and led by Johnny Sexton, who will enjoy one final duel with Carter, and Garry Ringrose. They are difficult to knock out of their stride: Saracens managed it for a period in the quarter-final in Dublin before succumbing and they were relentless against the Scarlets. “At the business end of the season it can become hard to stay your course,” says Gordon D’Arcy, the former Leinster centre. “Leinster don’t need to try to do something different and they know it.” The final is breaking new ground by being played in Spain, preceded by the Challenge Cup final between Cardiff Blues and Gloucester on Friday evening. Bilbao has not proved a popular choice with supporters, who have baulked at packages costing more than £600, but it may be appropriate for Leinster in their season of inquisitions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/05/jumpsuits-zipcams-vegan-cake-latest-trends-weddings","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T12:17:45Z","webTitle":"Jumpsuits, zip cams, vegan cake: the latest trends in weddings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/jumpsuits-zipcams-vegan-cake-latest-trends-weddings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/jumpsuits-zipcams-vegan-cake-latest-trends-weddings","fields":{"headline":"Jumpsuits, zip cams, vegan cake: the latest trends in weddings","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It’s unlikely Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will rig cameras on zipwires across the lawns of Windsor Castle for their big day this month. But if they do, they’ll be joining a growing number of couples turning to new tech to capture the moment like never before. Zipwire cameras might sound like props on a sci-fi film but they are one of the quirky new trends for weddings this summer as brides ditch flowing gowns in favour of jumpsuits, and vegan cakes replace the traditional multi-tiered extravaganza. With most marriage ceremonies now involving millennials who are comfortable with adapting traditions to suit their own agenda, weddings are now being planned to take account of social media and concern for the environment, according to the big names in nuptials, from fashion designers to videographers. “The whole make-up of weddings is changing,” said bridalwear designer Charlie Brear, who has dressed model and fashion designer Alexa Chung and actress Sienna Miller. “There’s a lot less formality, and it’s all Pinterest, Instagram and social media-led. Brides want to step out of the norm, and make a statement they can share.” So out go the sweeping, fishtail trains, she said, and in come the all-in-one jumpsuits – talk of the fashion world since bridalwear designer Misha Nonoo, a close friend of Markle, released a spring jumpsuit collection. “They’ll be all the rage this year. The jumpsuit offers something more rock’n’roll, a bit cooler and easier to wear, but still elegant,” Brear said. The bonus is that the jumpsuit is easier to repurpose than a wedding dress, so it can be reworn once the confetti has blown away. And with the average white gown costing more than most people earn in a month (Brear’s range from £1,500 to £5,000), jumpsuits are a lot cheaper too. “If you accessorise it with a black belt, a black high heel and a black jacket you can wear it on any night of the week,” she said. If you’re going to walk the aisle in a jumpsuit, chances are you’ll want something different to eat and drink too. “When I got married, the centrepiece of the reception was a rich fruit cake,” said Rosalind Miller, a cake-maker whose show-stoppers are sold at Harrods. “But nobody wants fruit cake any more. Vegan cakes are now the big new trend.” Miller puts it down to what she calls a “generational thing” – the march of the millennials to ever more conscious decision-making. But cakes free of even the tiniest trace of animal products are tricky to make. “You have to find substitutes for everything – butter, eggs, milk, chocolate ganache,” says Miller. “Even the sugar flower petals have egg whites, so we have to use fresh flowers instead.” There’s also a trend for simpler cakes – what Miller calls “the naked cake” – with none of the traditional sugar paste icing. “More and more couples want their weddings to be natural and stripped back,” she said. There is nothing “natural” about squadrons of tiny cameras zooming across the matrimonial dance floor, though. Yet zipwire cameras are a game-changer in wedding videos, said Andrew Gemmell, a film-maker who has chronicled the weddings and private shindigs of celebrities including Elton John, Poppy Delevingne and David Beckham. “Zipwire cameras are great for shooting the dancing or the speeches. Almost like on a ski lift, they grab on to the wire then propel themselves along, panning side to side above the guests. It gives you angles you’d never dreamt of,” he said. Gemmell says that drones, GoPros and zipwire cameras are now essential gizmos for any videographer worth their salt. “It’s great – you control multiple cameras from your mobile phone, you meld into the wedding like a guest.” But there’s another technologically advanced way to blend in. Gemmell predicts the next big thing will be the “virtual guest” – a sort of Segway-iPad hybrid that will allow people who cannot get to a wedding to live and experience the occasion remotely. “With this thing, you can walk down the aisle, move around the reception, join in conversations – all at head height,” he said. The other attractive feature of the virtual guest, he said, is that if he or she is being annoying “the hosts can just turn the wifi off and shut them down”.

If we do politics by calculator, then the local elections were pretty much a dead heat. Both Labour and the Tories enjoyed gains they could trumpet; both suffered losses they’d prefer not to talk about. Like First World War armies, they have fired their shot and shell, only to end up in a trench warfare stalemate. Labour can pray in aid the projections that this result, translated into a general election, would make the party the largest in a hung parliament. Tories can retort that that’s worse than Ed Miliband managed when these council seats were contested in 2014. The projection then had him in Downing Street with a majority. So much for projections. If you want to know how the parties really feel about how they performed, forget the swings, the shares and the misleading extrapolations. Get out of the psephologists’ playground and use your ears to measure the frequency and quality of the excuses coming out of the spinners and spokespeople. In that regard, Labour has been on the back foot since the polls closed; it is Jeremy Corbyn’s team that talks like the deflated party. In the early hours of Friday morning, at a time when all but political nerds have put themselves to bed, I watched Dawn Butler, a member of the shadow cabinet, trying to put a brave face on disappointment by saying: “We always knew it was going to be a difficult election.” This is normally the alibi you hear rolled out by a government minister explaining why midterm elections nearly always go badly for whoever is in power at Westminster. You do not anticipate hearing the defensive “always knew it was going to be a difficult election” excuse from a senior spokesperson for the principal party of opposition. Still less do you expect to hear it from the main challenger to the government, when the incumbents have fouled up so atrociously in the run-up to polling day and have been in office for a long and torrid stretch. The Conservatives are entering their ninth year in power. Economic growth is anaemic and many people are still not seeing real increases in their wages. Public services, especially many local services, have been pinched by the protracted grip of austerity. Mrs May has just lost another cabinet minister, the fourth forced departure from her top table in six months. From the national picture to the local one, from the shameful Windrush scandal to the record number of potholes breaking wheels and bones on the roads, the Tories went into these elections facing strong headwinds. They thought that they’d be the ones having to scrabble around for the excuses on election night. The Tories were on the ropes and flinching before an expected thumping by Labour that didn’t materialise. Some say that Labour has got the rough end of the stick in the post-election assessments because the party was poor at playing “the expectations game”. Anticipation of what could be achieved became overblown, with the consequence that a reasonable result would then be interpreted as failure. There may be some truth to this when we examine what happened in London. Labour had a result there that confirms its dominance in the capital, but it was not quite powerful enough to knock the Tories out of control in Kensington &amp; Chelsea, Wandsworth or Westminster. You can say that Labour lost the expectations game or you can be a bit less polite and observe that the party’s leadership and its admirers have been guilty of hubris. They went on about seizing the “Tory crown jewels” in the capital because they really thought there was a chance this was going to happen. They have so taken it for granted that Britain is inexorably embracing Corbynism that it has come as a bit of a shock to find that many voters still have the gravest reservations about giving their support to Labour even when the main alternative is Mrs May’s party. In some places, Labour was punished for specifics. The failure to deal with antisemitism in the party’s ranks clearly hurt the party and badly in Barnet, where it failed to win a part of north London it should have taken. Jeremy Corbyn’s broader problem is the same one he had at the election last year. Under him, the party does extremely well in large urban conurbations. One of Labour’s advances was to deprive the Tories of control in Trafford in Greater Manchester. Labour also has increased support by historic standards among more affluent professionals. It is one of life’s ironies that Mr Corbyn has made Labour a more middle-class party than Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson managed to do. We also know that Labour is popular among younger generations. It may be that Labour’s performance at the locals was somewhat suppressed compared with a general election because younger voters are less likely to turn out for council elections. Where Labour made insufficient progress at the general election, and continues to struggle, is beyond the big cities and university towns. The party is doing particularly badly among older and less affluent voters in provincial England. It underperformed in areas such as Basildon, Bolton, Derby, Dudley, Nuneaton, Swindon and Walsall. These are places with key parliamentary constituencies where the opposition has to be winning well at this stage of the electoral cycle to look credible as a government-in-waiting. One Labour alibi for this is to blame the implosion of Ukip, which has become the “Black Death” party in the estimation of its own general secretary. For every three former Ukip voters, two went to the Conservatives and just one to Labour. It seems to me that Labour has been a bit too ready to accept this as inevitable, rather than to ask itself why it can’t appeal to more of these voters. That boosted the Conservatives as they enjoyed the bigger helping from the carrion of Ukip. But this feast contains a poison pill. Because a large chunk of Tory support was provided by Leave voters, the hard Brexiters have been emboldened to clamour for more concessions to their demands. The price of catering to that constituency is that it will further alienate the Tories from the younger and more liberal voters that they will need to attract if they are ever to assemble a decent parliamentary majority. Forward-thinking Tories will also be worried that the Lib Dems are flickering back to life. The gains made by Vince Cable’s party will lift morale and encourage them to think they can rebuild the traditional base in local government that was devastated during the coalition years. As importantly, the evisceration of Ukip re-establishes the Lib Dems as the third party in England, which ought to give a boost to their presence in the media. They will be helped by voters being reminded of their existence more regularly. Experience suggests that a Lib-Dem revival will hurt the Conservatives in parliamentary contests more than it damages Labour. That is for the future. Theresa May, a prime minister who measures success by whether she gets to the end of the week, is simply glad that she avoided a Tory meltdown. For her, survival is a kind of triumph. Local elections are a highly imperfect guide to general election success or failure, the more so when the next national contest could be as much as four years away. That said, we should not make the opposite mistake of pronouncing that they are entirely meaningless. The voters are always telling us something about the present and a bit about the future when they cast a ballot. On these results, there is no clear path to a parliamentary majority for either of the big parties. The Labour MP Jess Phillips got it right when she drolly observed: “I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.” Failure is always relative in politics. Stalemate is a result that a government at midterm can live with. Tories have been left feeling more cheerful than they deserve to be and more optimistic about their prospects than they have been for a while. A draw is not good enough for the main opposition party. “We should have romped home,” remarks one senior Labour MP. More of them would be saying that publicly if they did not feel intimidated into silence. Against a shambolic and divided government presiding over a weak economy, Labour has not put in the level of performance necessary to make it look like an opposition party striding confidently towards national victory. Deep down, at least some of Labour’s leadership know this. Just listen to the excuses. • Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/05/kentucky-derby-2018-mendelssohn-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T23:53:57Z","webTitle":"Justify wins muddy Kentucky Derby as Mendelssohn falls short – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/05/kentucky-derby-2018-mendelssohn-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/05/kentucky-derby-2018-mendelssohn-live","fields":{"headline":"Justify wins muddy Kentucky Derby as Mendelssohn falls short – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So, disappointment for Mendelssohn but a huge new star of American racing in Justify, a horse with a huge future and a very live tilt at the Triple Crown in front of him. As a son of Scat Daddy, he is also now worth a staggering amount of money as a stallion prospect, whatever else he does. Quite a day for a crowd of 157,813 to look back on as they head out into the gathering gloom and look forward to a change of clothes. Thanks for sharing it with me, this is Greg Wood at Churchill Downs, signing off. Here’s Mike Smith: My job was just to get him out of there. Once we jumped well, I basically stepped out of the way and kept a leg on each side and my mind out of the way. Bob Baffert is (finally) here: He broke clean, and I knew that he wasn’t going to lay down. It’s like having LeBron James on your team, you’d better win a championship with him. The main players will be in the interview room shortly, quotes will follow. Mendelssohn was last across the line, Ryan Moore accepted the inevitable before they had reached the far turn but it was really lost at the start. He looked as though he took a bump too as Moore tried his best to find some sort of a position, but to no avail. A race that was run in awful conditions but Justify fully lived up to his billing from Bob Baffert as the possible successor to his Triple Crown winner, American Pharoah. He looked the winner from the moment he hit the front and will now be a very short price for the Preakness Stakes, the next leg of the Triple Crown. It is certainly difficult to see any of today’s rivals overturning the form at Pimlico. Good Magic was second, Audible third, Instilled Regard fourth and My Boy Jack fifth. A long way to come for a muddy disappointment, but Justify was a ready winner, he took it up a long way out and has finally beaten the Curse of Apollo. Mendelssohn never threatened sadly. Photo for second, Audible and Good Magic. Justify wins! Justify leads around the home turn, from Bolt Dorof Really fast second quarter too Justify moving up Only a fair break by Mendelssohn, a very fast pace led by Promise Fulfilled Off and running “Let’s go Mendelssohn” is the cry from just behind me. The first few are in. Now they approach the starting gate .... Apologies to At The Races viewers, who must have thought there was a hell of a delay on their coverage. Correction, they are not quite starting to load, though post time was a minute ago. They are starting to load for the 144th Kentucky Derby. Come on Ryan. He’s from Brighton too, y’know. And now some Fat Boy Slim. They must know I’m from Brighton. I will have my binoculars focused on stall 14 as they open and do all I can to describe the Greatest Two Minutes In Sport as it’s happening. The Final Countdown blares out across Churchill Downs, in less than 10 minutes, one of these 20 horses will be in the history books. Going down to the gates. Mendelssohn got a huge cheer too, a lot of people here would love to see a first winner for Europe The horses are parading in front of the stand and being introduced to the crowd. A huge cheer for My Boy Jack. The roar that ripped through Churchill as the bugler sounded Reveille was blood-curdling, while my new friend Crow is currently dabbed away the tears thanks to a wonderful rendition of My Old Kentucky Home. Bit teary myself, never though I’d be here to hear it. Laila Ali, the daughter of Louisville-born Muhammed Ali, has just announced “Rider’s Up”. And they are! There is an argument at least that Moore may try to ride Mendelssohn a bit closer to the pace that might otherwise be the case, but plenty of other riders are likely to be thinking the same thing as they try to avoid getting buried in a slop-storm on the inside. The last five favourites have won here, but these conditions must make an outsider winning more likely. Mendelssohn very steady in the betting at 6-1, but there’s little doubt Justify is going to start favourite from seven. How will Ryan Moore have plotted this out? He would probably have had quite a few ideas in his head, but has he had to junk the lot as a result of the rain? Mendelssohn is on the big screen being led into his saddling barn, and the jockeys are leaving the jockeys’ room. Still the rain comes down. That stat about it never having rained during the Kentucky Derby itself is looking very down in the mouth. The runners in the Kentucky Derby are making their way across from the barns. Just been down to the parade ring for a quick chat with Aidan O’Brien, who is, understandably, still buzzing after his son Donnacha’s win on Saxon Warrior in the 2,000 Guineas earlier. He’s as much in the dark as anyone about Mendelssohn’s ability to handle the slop. You just wouldn’t know. We took him to Dubai to prepare him for the dirt, and now it’s completely different. [But] he’s an unusual horse with a big personality, and when you put the blinkers on him, his focus changes completely Nice line: The serious buildup to the 144th Kentucky Derby starts here. The rain is a big unknown for Mendelssohn as it is for most of the runners in the race, but it has to be a particular concern for his supporters as he floated over the fast dirt at Meydan in March. The track TV has just shown the “Puppy Predictor” for this year’s Kentucky Derby, which runs on a late-night talk show. About 15 puppies race over what looks around 10 feet to reach a tray of dog biscuits, and apparently, the puppy representing subsequent Triple Crown winner American Pharoah was the winner in 2015. This year’s winner according to puppy lore? It’s Mendelssohn. Yoshida has just won the Turf Classic for Bill Mott and Jose Ortiz, and the rain is still coming down. The runners are out on the track for the Turf Classic, the last race before the Kentucky Derby itself, although there are all sorts of traditions to run through before the big race itself at 23.46 British time (18.46 here). I met an extremely pleasant chap called Crow Hollister while having breakfast in a local cafe this morning. He’s a Louisville native and made it plain how much this race means to the city and the state. The whole place stops at post time, everyone is in front of a screen if they’re not at the track and as he put it, it would be great to be hovering above Louisville to hear the roar that goes up from every corner of this city of 1.2m when the gates crash open and the field sets off. He also admits that he still gets misty-eyed when the crowd sings “My Old Kentucky Home” with the horses heading for the gates. That will, as always, be quite a moment, and it is now scarcely an hour away. Oh, and they were also stopping people bringing in umbrellas at the gate before racing. There is a huge umbrella graveyard somewhere nearby. Odd thing about all the rain is that it wasn’t forecast at all, even yesterday afternoon there was some confidence that there might be the odd shower but nothing too serious. The previous record for the wettest Derby day ever, incidentally, was apparently in 1918, so here’s an early warning to racegoers in 2118 to be sure to pack a raincoat. This is now, officially, the wettest Kentucky Derby ever, with 2.31 inches of inch so far today. Another runner in the big one that deserves a mention is My Boy Jack (stall 10, 5-1), as his current odds are well below the “morning line” prediction of 30-1. That may just mean that the early punters all know someone called Jack, as the serious money has yet to hit the pools, but he was tipped up by a few decent judges as likely to finish strongly through tiring horses from off the pace. as he did here in the Stonestreet at Lexington. Vino Rosso (stall 18, 14-1) is an interesting runner in the big one, as John Velazquez had a few options and came down in favour of the Wood Memorial winner. And three lengths behind Vino Rosso here is Enticed (stall 12, 55-1), who runs for Godolphin’s US operation overseen by Kiaran McLoughlin. Good Magic’s latest run was an improvement on his start behind Promises Fulfilled (stall three, 46-1) in the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream on 3 March. Good Magic (stall 6, 9-1) took last year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile, with Bolt D’Oro, who set off as the hot favourite, back in third. The track here at Churchill Downs is now officially “sloppy”, and the big outsider Funny Duck just took the Pat Day Mile on the dirt with Seahenge &amp; Ryan Moore out of the frame. Some more form from YouTube. Audible, currently a 6-1 chance to win from stall five, beat Hofberg, (25-1, stall nine) in the Florida Derby on 31 March. It was only the third start of Hofberg’s career and personally I have a feeling he might get a fair bit closer to Audible today. Don’t cry for me, David Johnson. I’m loving every minute. On the subject of HST’s day out at the Derby with Ralph Steadman, here’s a piece in the Courier Journal this week where they caught up with the artist to talk about his somewhat hazy memories of the 1970 Kentucky Derby. Went for a walk on the infield earlier (thankfully before the worst of the rain) to see if it bears any resemblance to the scene depicted in Hunter S Thompson’s famous piece “The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved”. There were plenty of moderately offensive bespoke suits in outlandish colours and designs but nothing too debauched, though it was early and I can’t imagine what it must be like out there now after several inches of rain. A proper gonzo journalist would head out there and wade in. I’m happier being non-gonzo and (relatively) dry. On with the form guide. Todd Pletcher’s Magnum Moon, who will break from stall 16, is, like Justify, trying to brake the so-called Curse of Apollo. He was the last horse to win without running as a juvenile, back in 1882. Whatever you think of stats, that’s quite a stat. Here he is winning the Arkansas Derby, with Solomini, who is drawn in 17 today, back in third. Deauville, one of Ryan Moore’s three rides on the undercard before the Kentucky Derby, has been scratched from the Turf Classic. Just went for a quick spin around the paddock. There are racegoers taking bets on whether they can jump puddles without getting their feet wet, and there are enough around to construct a entire Grand National course of puddles should you so wish. There’s a monster near the parade ring that would be a very daunting Chair. Justify, meanwhile, put up two of the best Beyer figures of the year in his first two starts this year, which were also the first two runs of his career, and then established himself as the likely favourite today with an easy win in the Santa Anita Derby on 7 April, where Bolt D’Oro, who is also in today’s field, was three lengths away in second. US fans are a little unsure what to make of Mendelssohn’s romp in the desert, not least after Rayya, the runner-up, completely failed to fire in the Kentucky Oaks here on Friday. But the time guru Andy Beyer put a figure of 106 on it, which is just 1lb behind Justify, the favourite, and Mendelssohn also has winning form in the States in last year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf, where the beaten horses included Masar, who was third in today’s 2,000 Guineas. Three hours to the off for the 144th Kentucky Derby and here’s the first of the video form for tonight’s big race. Mendelssohn’s romp in the UAE Derby seemed extraordinary at the time and still looks fairly remarkable when you look at it again a few weeks later. Threeandfourpence, Ryan Moore’s first ride for Aidan O’Brien here today, was never a factor and out of the frame behind Maraud (Todd Pletcher/John Velasquez). Hello from a decidedly damp Churchill Downs racecourse in Louisville, Kentucky, where steady – and at times torrential – rain has been an unwelcome addition to what is, without any doubt, one of the great occasions in any sport. It is not just a horse race, it is a national and international event which permeates the consciousness of pretty much everyone, in terms of an awareness that it exists at any rate. The Kentucky Derby stars in films, books and popular culture. Like the Grand National, people just know about it. For European racing fans, this year’s race is mostly about Mendelssohn, the 18-and-three-quarter length winner of the UAE Derby last time out and the most credible transatlantic contender for the Run For The Roses for at least 26 years. For the Americans, though, this is the final stop at the end of a traditional four-month trail that leads through trial events in Florida, Arkansas, New York, California and Kentucky towards what they like to call, with some justification, “the most exciting two minutes in sports”. And this year’s renewal is, by fairly general consent, one of the best for years, with no significant absentees among the main trial winners and Justify, who may shade Mendelssohn for favouritism, touted as a potential superstar by Bob Baffert, his trainer. Baffert, of course, prepared American Pharoah to win the first Triple Crown for 37 years in the 2015 season, and has been unstinting in his admiration for Justify, who is, like Mendelssohn, a son of the late stallion Scat Daddy. Scat Daddy’s final crop of yearlings went through the ring last year and fetched some astonishing prices as buyers fought to take their last chance to buy a piece of his genes. As was the case when Galileo eventually taking over the mantle of Europe’s top stallion from his own sire, Sadler’s Wells, a Derby-winning son of Scat Daddy would command a huge fee at stud and for all the tradition, history and glory attached to a win today, there is potentially a staggering amount of money at stake as well. As mentioned earlier, the weather here at Churchill is nothing like the warm temperatures and clear skies that were forecast just a couple of days ago (by my weather app, at any rate). There was a slight but steady drizzle in the early part of the morning, and then a proper downpour which started about three hours ago (17.30 BST), and while it has eased off somewhat since, the dirt track – which was officially “fast” this morning – is now described as “muddy” and has been sealed (which basically means compacted to keep it as even as possible. The racing here has been underway for nearly six hours – there are 14 races in all, with the 144th Kentucky Derby at number 12 – and Ryan Moore is due out imminently to ride Threeandfourpence for Aidan O’Brien in the Grade Two American Turf. He also rides Seahenge – like Mendelssohn, a son of Scat Daddy – over a mile on dirt at 4.28 local time (21.28 BST), and Deauville in the $1m Old Forester Turf Classic (10.25 BST) before climbing aboard Mendelssohn when the traditional “Riders Up” call goes out about 15 minutes before the off for the big one. The on-track betting for the big race is relatively unaffected by the changing conditions, with Mendelssohn currently showing as a 6-1 chance behind the 7-2 favourite, Justify. Mendelssohn’s odds with British books range from 3-1 to 5-1 and they are probably looking at quite a few tasty doubles after his stable companion Saxon Warrior took the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket earlier today. I’ll be posting plenty of YouTube video form for the big-race contenders shortly if you are hoping to make up your mind which way to jump. An enthralling few hours lie ahead with a potential moment of horse racing history in the offing and I’m very much looking forward to sharing it with you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/05/enough-liberal-hand-wringing-raising-alcohol-prices-is-not-class-war","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T17:15:04Z","webTitle":"Enough liberal hand-wringing – raising alcohol prices is not class war | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/05/enough-liberal-hand-wringing-raising-alcohol-prices-is-not-class-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/05/enough-liberal-hand-wringing-raising-alcohol-prices-is-not-class-war","fields":{"headline":"Enough liberal hand-wringing – raising alcohol prices is not class war","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Hatred of the nanny state is not only found among Conservatives raised by nannies. The left can be as libertarian as the right and as repelled by a culture dominated by prigs and killjoys. Left libertarianism powers the modern feminist approval of prostitution and its damning of traditional campaigners against the sale of women’s bodies as “whorephobes” and “swerfs” (sex worker exclusionary radical feminists, in the clunky jargon). As Scotland becomes the first country in the world to try to price drinkers out of alcoholism with minimum booze charges, the same resistance to the paternalist state is evident. The modern left is an overwhelmingly bourgeois movement and liberal guilt can always be exploited. In Scotland, four cans of beer or a bottle of wine cannot cost less than £4.50, a three-litre bottle of cider £11.25 and a bottle of vodka £13.13. Wealthy drinkers buy craft beers and fine wines and won’t be affected. Minimum pricing looks like class war from above: the prosperous telling the lower orders to “do what I say, not what I do”. From Orwell on, a strain of left-wing writing holds it natural for the overworked and exhausted to want the hit of fatty food and cheap booze. “We walked through the door at midnight at the end of a shift,” said James Bloodworth of his time in an Amazon warehouse, “kicked off our boots and collapsed on to our beds with a bag of McDonald’s and a can of beer.” As far as he and his colleagues were concerned, foodies telling them to eat a healthy diet “could go to hell”. Bloodworth, like Orwell before him, doesn’t believe a high-calorie, high alcohol diet does anything but harm. But their subtleties are lost in the general fear of seeming a snob. I’m all for liberal guilt. If liberals have a fault, it is that they are not guilty enough. But left libertarianism fails in theory and in practice. Only those who do not know what alcoholism is, or how the poor live, could entertain it. Most on low incomes don’t drink as much as the middle classes. (They can’t afford to.) Minimum pricing does not target moderate drinkers but the 5% of, generally, but not exclusively, poor people, lost in addiction. It is a truth universally unacknowledged that, like drugs cartels, the drink industry makes most of its money from addicts. It thrives on hooked customers, who put boosting the brewers’ profits before their and their families’ health and happiness. Sixty per cent of alcohol sales – worth £27bn a year in England – are to “increasing risk” drinkers taking more than 21 units of alcohol a week, in the case of men (about 10 pints or two bottles of wine), and “harmful” drinkers taking more than 50. Twenty one units (14 for women) does not sound much in my world of journalism, but it is a sign of people who cannot go a day without a shot of their drug, which is as good a definition of an addiction as any. Even at that rate, the afflicted bring on the risk of cancer, stroke, brain damage and liver failure. By the time you are topping more than 50 units (35 if you are a woman) you are at risk of full degeneration. Don’t think I’m talking only about old men on park benches. In a vain attempt to persuade Westminster to introduce minimum pricing, researchers at Sheffield University said it would limit the 63,000 alcohol-related deaths in the next five years in England and Wales. Before they go, the afflicted will have reached the stage where they can only feel well when they drink. They will sweat, vomit, succumb to an alcoholic dementia that destroys their co-ordination and memories and see their liver fail and stomach distend. As Ken Kesey succinctly described the process in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest: “He was blind and diseased from drinking. And every time he put the bottle to his mouth, he didn’t suck out of it, it sucked out of him.” When you clear away the old snobbery about fine wines and the new snobberies about single-estate gins and craft beers, you are left with a clear view of a drinks business whose main source of revenue is sucking the life out of its customers. And out of anyone unlucky enough to know them. John Stuart Mill’s principle that adults should be free to harm themselves as long as they don’t harm others does not help the alcohol conglomerates. Unlike the trade in illegal drugs, the sale of alcohol is not conducted with violence. Instead, it provokes violence. So much violence that the British Crime Survey estimated half of all violent crime was alcohol related. The partners and children of alcoholics take the hardest hits, a fact we seem to have forgotten. The original feminist movement was well aware of the relationship between booze, rape and abuse. Cristabel Pankhurst wrote against “the great scourge” of men driven by “foul thinking and alcohol” to infect their wives with syphilis, which was incurable in the early 20th century. Josephine Butler, who led the campaign in the 1860s against the forcible genital examination of women, but not men, to see if they were carrying sexually transmitted diseases, was also a temperance campaigner. Their successors do not want prohibition today. Just prudent public health measures: minimum pricing, mandatory health warnings on bottles and an advertising ban. They do not receive the support they deserve because the old knowledge that alcohol is a feminist and socialist issue has all but died. Few want to seem an uncool prude or risk the accusation of being the world’s first Derf (drink exclusionary radical feminist, if I may coin a phrase). Fewer still understand that coolness can kill and the only way to stop the killing is to become a killjoy. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/05/kentucky-derby-teachers-protest-matt-bevin-governor","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T15:29:15Z","webTitle":"Teachers to protest at Kentucky Derby, a symbol of state's inequality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/05/kentucky-derby-teachers-protest-matt-bevin-governor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/05/kentucky-derby-teachers-protest-matt-bevin-governor","fields":{"headline":"Teachers to protest at Kentucky Derby, a symbol of state's inequality","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Teachers’ union activists in a state that saw a dramatic strike last month plan to protest at the running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on Saturday. After last month’s Kentucky teachers’ strike, the state Republican majority chose to take control of the heavily black Jefferson county public school system, based in the Louisville area. Governor Matt Bevin said it was because of concerns about finances. Union leaders say Bevin is punishing teachers for striking. “That sure looks like pure retribution to us,” said National Education Association president Lily Eskelsen García. “Here you have Kentucky lawmakers angry that those upstart teachers demanded that something better is done for school funding and their students.” To many activists, the Kentucky Derby and its crowd of dignitaries, including Bevin, represent everything wrong with what some consider still a racially divided, Jim Crow state. “Kentucky does an extremely poor job of grappling with its history of racism. Symbols like the Kentucky Derby matter,” said Attica Scott, the only black woman in the Kentucky statehouse. For years a union organizer, Scott has helped previous protests at the Derby, for the rights of immigrant workers. At the 170,000-seat, 147-acre Churchill Downs complex, some seats cost as much as $6,000. But the course sits in a relatively poor Latino neighborhood, known as the Backside, where residents have frequently protested. Immigrants train horses for millionaires; hundreds of horse stable workers earn as a little as $400 a week and a place to sleep. This year’s protest will see teachers target Bevin. He has supported a “neighborhood schools” bill, which would largely defund bussing programs and emphasise schools that draw students from nearby neighborhoods instead of the whole area. Critics say this is re-segregation by stealth. With control over Jefferson county schools firmly in the hands of a panel of state education commissioners appointed by the governor, activists say Bevin will likely get his opportunity to smash a school busing program that has won national praise. “The governor has had it for Louisville since he was elected because we did not vote for him,” said Scott. “His ego has gotten the best of him. He has had it out for Louisville, and part of the way in which you attack Louisville is through its school system, which educates 101,000 students and is most diverse body of students [in the state]. That diversity scares and threatens the governor because that’s not something he’s comfortable with and respects or values.” Activists also worry that the Republican administration could threaten Jefferson county’s sanctuary schools program, which allows migrant children to attend regardless of the state of their documentation. Bevin claims he is taking over the school system because of financial mismanagement he blames on the locally elected school board’s relationship with teachers’ unions. “This is political,” Bevin told the Louisville Courier-Journal. “And it’s about power. And it’s about money. And it’s about union dues. And it’s about who gets to elect – and if people don’t think the teachers’ union has elected the school board in Jefferson county they haven’t been paying attention.” Activists say that if Bevin was serious about helping fund Louisville schools, he would start by eliminating tax breaks for horse racing and bourbon industries. Both are major political players in Kentucky: horse racing and associated business brings in more than $4bn a year while bourbon brings in more than $8.5bn. The precise value of tax breaks to bourbon and horses is unclear, but an analysis provided by Scott’s office showed that it deprives the state of tens of millions of dollars a year. “It’s a shame,” said teachers’ union activist Erin Vachon. “The Churchill Downs is a corporation, the bourbon industry is full of corporations, and they have an obligation to make wealth trickle down. We haven’t seen that.” The Jefferson county school board and the union intend to fight the governor’s takeover in court. If they don’t win there, Scott feels optimistic support for teachers and their unions will win back the state legislature in November. “We’ve got a historic number of women running for office, and a historic number of people of color running,” she said. “Intersectional organizing is powerful and this election is going to be a referendum on the attacks on education by the governor and his Republican supermajority.” This piece was amended on 5 May 2018.

In this year’s local elections everyone won something but nothing changed. The Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens all had vote and seat gains to cheer about, as all parties took a share of the electoral windfall from the dramatic collapse in Ukip. The Conservatives went into Thursday night hoping to avoid the traditional anti-incumbent swing endured by most governments in midterm local elections, but instead came away with morale-boosting seat gains across England. Voters seemed more focused on Brexit than bin collection in this year’s local contest, with strong links between Brexit-voting and Conservative performance, just as were seen in last year’s general election. The Conservatives advanced by an average of 13 percentage points in authorities that recorded a 60%-plus vote for Leave in 2016 – and all of the four Tory council gains came in strong Leave areas. The Conservatives also gained most from Ukip’s collapse, with larger advances in areas where Ukip did best in 2014. However, there was a lot of variation in how the purple cookie crumbled. Labour gained relatively more from the Ukip collapse in places where they were stronger prior to Ukip’s surge, resulting in the restoration of the status quo ante, taking Ukip seats in councils such as Basildon. While the collapse of Ukip and the Brexit realignment both benefited the Conservatives, it is the Liberal Democrats who will be happiest with these results overall. The party picked up more than 50 council seats, recovered control of its erstwhile London strongholds of Richmond and Kingston on large swings away from the Conservatives, and rebuilt a significant presence on many other local authorities. The party did best in areas that favoured both the Conservatives and Remain in past elections – epitomised by their dramatic takeover in South Cambridgeshire – but this was not a straightforward “Remainer revolt”. The party also enjoyed major surges in support in Leave-voting traditional Labour strongholds such as Hull and Sunderland. The Lib Dems may have recovered some of their chameleon-like capacity to mobilise local opposition regardless of the overall political climate. Labour will be more disappointed, as despite making over 60 seat gains, taking control of Plymouth and Kirklees and ending nearly 15 years of Conservative dominance in Trafford, the party finished the count in charge of fewer councils than before. Despite significant seat gains in the capital, predictions of big breakthroughs in traditionally Tory inner-London redoubts such as Wandsworth and Westminster proved wide of the mark. Outside the capital there was a small overall swing away from Labour, costing it control of Derby, Redditch and Nuneaton councils. There were signs that both parties have been hurt by scandals that have made headlines lately. The Conservatives did particularly poorly in areas where the last census recorded a large black community, which may hint at a Windrush backlash. They also fell back somewhat in Kensington and Chelsea, although the swing against them after last year’s Grenfell Tower fire was smaller than some anticipated, and the party suffered a net loss of just one seat. Meanwhile, Labour’s performance was noticeably poor in wards with large Jewish populations, which was particularly costly for the party in Barnet, a marginal London borough the party hoped to gain. Labour’s vote fell in the five Barnet wards with the largest Jewish populations, even as the party advanced strongly elsewhere.The recent antisemitism scandal thus looks to have hurt Labour at the polls this year, and to have played a significant role in the party’s failure to gain control of London’s most marginal council. The results also suggest that neither the government nor the opposition has yet found a way to bridge the deep demographic and geographical divisions revealed in the EU referendum and last year’s general election. Labour registered its strongest gains in areas with many migrants and ethnic minorities, in areas with many students and young people and in the big cities – trends which have been evident since Ed Miliband’s tenure as leader. Nearly all Labour’s seat gains came from advances in London. Yet the party already controls most local and Westminster seats in such areas, limiting the capacity for further gains. Labour cannot hope to achieve a majority if it continues to underperform in areas with key marginal constituencies such as Bolton, Derby and Southampton. The Conservatives have solidified their grip on Leave-voting rural and small-town parts of England with large numbers of older white voters with low education levels. Class politics was again turned upside down: the Tory vote share increased by over 10 points in the wards with the highest share of people doing routine manual work, or who left school with no qualifications, but flatlined in places with the most middle-class professionals and fell in the places with the most graduates. The steep age gradient in party support that emerged in last year’s general election was once again in evidence last week – the Conservatives advanced by up to 10 points in areas with the most pensioners, but there was a substantial swing to Labour in areas with the most voters under 35. The Conservatives remain on the wrong side of demographic trends – doing best with shrinking groups and worst with growing ones. They will struggle to achieve a parliamentary majority unless they can find a way to appeal to graduates, younger voters and ethnic minorities. As the final votes were tallied on Friday afternoon the BBC’s projected national share showed a dead heat, with both Conservatives and Labour on 35 points. Both parties improved on the showing in 2014 by recruiting Ukip voters and advancing in their areas of strength, but both trod water outside their strongholds. These local elections have thus entrenched the polarised, evenly divided status quo. Both the Conservatives and Labour now dominate large parts of England, yet neither party can hope to win a general election majority with support from “home territory” alone. Ukip’s collapse has not fundamentally changed the even balance of power between the two, and the Liberal Democrats, though they showed signs of life, remain too weak and marginal to challenge two party dominance.

Rayner, who left school pregnant at 16 with poor grades, told the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) annual conference that the government’s record on education has meant targets for teacher recruitment had not been met for five years. She said more teachers were now leaving than joining the profession and 500,000 children were in “supersize” classes, while teachers have had their pay capped. “I went to a so-called failing school and it was that school, those teachers, that headteacher, those support staff, all of the people there that made me the resilient person that can stand in front of you today, that has become the education secretary elect and has done so well,” she said. “Because you taught me about making sure that you respect yourself and you are valued and loved regardless of what other people say. That’s what good schools do.” To applause from delegates at the conference in Liverpool, she said the Tories “wouldn’t survive their own Ofsted inspection”. Rayner said Labour was committed to creating a “cradle to grave” national education service, “a meaningful and radical transformation of our education system”, and asked the NAHT for its help to shape the policy. Rayner said funding spent on education was money well spent and an investment for the future. “People say, well that’s ridiculous, how can you afford it, Labour’s ‘spend, spend, spend’. But you know what? We are spending so much money on making children and young people feel bad and then catch up at a later date in adolescence, where we are having to spend money in the wrong place,” she said. The general secretary of NAHT, Paul Whiteman, said: “We’ll be engaging with Labour’s consultation on their national education service and their other policies which affect young people. “As I said in my conference speech, education is the best route to a happy and fulfilling future for our young people, and the only silver bullet to solving the problems in our society.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/06/another-week-of-lies-trump-cheap-huckster-keeps-tawdry-show-going","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T05:12:11Z","webTitle":"Another week of lies and still Trump, the huckster, keeps his tawdry show going | Sarah Churchwell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/06/another-week-of-lies-trump-cheap-huckster-keeps-tawdry-show-going","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/06/another-week-of-lies-trump-cheap-huckster-keeps-tawdry-show-going","fields":{"headline":"Another week of lies and still Trump, the huckster, keeps his tawdry show going","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Earlier this year, a Saturday Night Live skit featured a gameshow called What Even Matters Anymore?, “the show where I tell you something our president did or said, and you have to tell me: does it even matter any more?”. In the final round, contestants have to write down what they think “would actually lead to any kind of consequences” for Donald Trump. One idea is “sex tape with Don, Jr”. But would that even matter? Trump has weathered endless scandals by creating a new one to distract from the last. He’s a carnival huckster running a three-ring circus; there are constant reports that he thrives on chaos, which is nice for him, and devastating for democratic norms and the rule of law. Trump has made it abundantly clear to anyone paying attention that he is amoral. He has no motive other than self-aggrandisement; his only principle is power. When I suggested on Question Time, two days after his election, that Trump had no interest in serving, David Dimbleby scoffed at me, demanding why else he would have run. My recollection is that I goggled and then said: “Power?” Or maybe I said “money”. They both ran through my head, as I tried to absorb the news that an intelligent, experienced BBC journalist was being blinded by norms. There is a clear bias among the media towards normality. We see this every time a journalist announces that Trump became “presidential” when he read a few words written by someone else. Trump is not “presidential”. He is ignorant, impulsive, undisciplined, undignified, uncouth. This makes him popular with some of his electorate but it does not make him presidential. We see the bias towards normality every time a journalist asks about a given aspect of his “policy”. Trump doesn’t have policies. He is an opportunistic chancer who changes his story with the wind and listens to whoever last spoke to him. We see it when newspapers refuse to say the president lied, hiding behind euphemisms such as “misrepresented”, “reversed his position”, “told an untruth”. We saw it when the White House Correspondents’ Association turned on the comedian they had hired to roast the administration. After Michelle Wolf called out White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, for her routine falsehoods and distortions, Wolf was attacked for criticising Sanders’s appearance. But what she said was: “I think she’s very resourceful. She burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye. Like maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s lies.” That is not deriding Sanders’s looks, it is deriding her mendacity and that of the administration she serves. But it merely prompted retaliatory falsehoods and distortions. The lies are working. Last week, a Gallup poll showed that the American president has a 42% approval rating. It was the same week he hired Rudy Giuliani, one-time mayor of New York and one of Trump’s surrogates during the campaign, as an attorney (after yet another resignation). Giuliani’s ties to the New York FBI office are widely held to have led to the pressure that prompted James Comey to announce he had reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton, a decision that, on clear evidence, turned the 2016 election. Giuliani promptly went on television and declared that Trump had been aware that his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, had paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 and that Trump had repaid him. This despite Trump’s repeated denials that he knew anything about the case and his and Cohen’s insistence that Cohen had paid the porn star with whom (they said) Trump had not had sex, out of his own pocket and just before the election, for no particular reason. Trump then said that the 73-year-old former mayor of New York “had just started a day ago” and “would get his facts straight”. In other words, as many tweeted, he would get his lies straight. Then Trump tweeted some more about Robert Mueller’s “witch-hunt” and later called Mueller a Democrat, despite his being a lifelong Republican, in order to claim that the investigation into him is party political. That was just the last three or four days. A few months ago, a journalist reported that Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser, told him: “The Democrats don’t matter. The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.” The Trump administration has taken this lesson to heart. There is so much clamouring for our attention in the three-ring circus that no one knows where to look. But we can’t ignore it, for they will keep flooding the zone with shit. Hannah Arendt, a refugee from Nazi Germany who knew quite a lot about how lies and chaos buttress fascism, has been finding new currency lately. In her book The Human Condition, she wrote: “The remedy for unpredictability, for the chaotic uncertainty of the future, is contained in the faculty to make and keep promises. Both faculties depend upon plurality, on the presence and acting of others, for no man can forgive himself and no one can be bound by a promise made only to himself.” The social contract is based on the faculty to make and keep promises. Trump is setting fire to it, because he doesn’t recognise promises, or the presence or acting of others, while too many of those others, blinded by ambition or deluded by the lies, support him. Trump may not be ideological – or consistent – enough to be a fascist. But he is clearly an authoritarian, as his “jokes” about becoming a president for life and demands for military parades attest. He claims to prize loyalty above all else (although he seldom demonstrates it), insisting that government officials offer unquestioning loyalty to him, rather than to their offices, that they worship their “dear leader”. (It’s not a coincidence that he’s so interested in Kim Jong-un.) This is the allegiance demanded by fascists and mafia capos. In 1937, a journalist named Dorothy Thompson, who was one of the voices of the American anti-fascist cause, wrote: “The enemy of Fascism is reason… Its enemy is humanism.” When they flood the zone with shit, we must counter it with reason and humanism. We have no choice, because of course it matters. • Sarah Churchwell’s Behold, America has just been published by Bloomsbury"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/05/saracens-gloucester-premiership-rugby-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T18:50:39Z","webTitle":"Saracens step up a gear to cruise past Gloucester as Alex Goode excels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/05/saracens-gloucester-premiership-rugby-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/05/saracens-gloucester-premiership-rugby-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Saracens step up a gear to cruise past Gloucester as Alex Goode excels","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Saracens sauntered to the play-offs after yet another second-half siege laid Gloucester to waste. They have now not conceded a second-half point in four matches – it was 40 unanswered here – and are hell-bent on returning to Twickenham later this month. Wasps will be the visitors in the semi-finals but after another nine-try showing, Mark McCall’s side are coming to the boil perfectly. Their day in the sun was tempered by concerning injuries to Liam Williams (shoulder) and Schalk Burger (hamstring) but they demonstrated an ability to race through the gears in the second half. “The lesson we got at Leinster [in the Champions Cup] was that against really top teams in semi- and quarter-finals there are no second chances,” said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall. Gloucester’s bright points were restricted to an excellent opening 40 minutes from their New Zealand-born, England-qualified full-back, Jason Woodward, in front of the watching Paul Gustard, and a blistering start to first-team rugby from Tom Seabrook. Gustard will surely have noted Alex Goode’s excellence, too. Both he and Woodward are the form full-backs in the Premiership this season yet neither have registered recently on England’s radar. While those wearing the No15 jerseys shone, it was the wingers making their mark on the scoreboard and that all four scored tries within the opening 17 minutes revealed everything about the laissez-faire attitude of both sides. It was hardly surprising as Saracens were already guaranteed to finish second and, while Gloucester had the chance to cement a top-six spot, 11 changes were evidence that Friday’s Challenge Cup final is the priority. Nonetheless they were first on the scoreboard through their 19-year-old Seabrook, who dotted down less than a minute into his first-team debut after a fine break from Woodward. Saracens responded after a bit of magic from Schalk Brits led to Sean Maitland over in the left corner but Gloucester were ahead again with Woodward once more the architect, breaking free of two tackles down the left before feeding David Halaifonua inside. Two minutes later Williams stepped inside and plunged through a pile of bodies for 12-12. An Owen Farrell penalty gave Saracens a three-point lead and, when the England playmaker cruised under the posts on the stroke of half-time,, after Alex Lozowski’s break, Gloucester’s goose seemed cooked. Juan Figallo barrelled over within seconds of the restart before Maro Itoje and Chris Wyles went over in quick succession towards the right. This led to a raft of substitutions – Saracens were caused such disruption that Ben Spencer and Ben Earl ended up on the wings and Goode at fly-half – but a penalty try ended the mini-drought in points before Ben Spencer’s late double. Gloucester finish the season in seventh but already assured of a place in next season’s Champions Cup and they can end a promising campaign with silverware in Friday’s showdown with Cardiff Blues in Bilbao. “We must come in with a positive frame of mind on Monday,” said the Gloucester head coach, Johan Ackermann. “It’s a massive challenge but it’s a must that we perform for 80 minutes.” Premiership roundup: Banahan treble helps Bath run riot Matt Banahan scored three of Bath’s nine tries on his farewell appearance as the home side sneaked into next season’s European Champions Cup after a 63-19 win over London Irish at the Rec. Since Sale and Gloucester lost without a losing bonus point, Bath leapfrogged both to clinch sixth place in the table having been all but written off only a couple of weeks ago. It took them three minutes to open the scoring through Taulupe Faletau, who signed a new contract last week. Banahan combined on the right with Cooper Vuna, who found the Wales No 8 with an inside pass. No one would have begrudged the visitors a try and it came just short of the hour as their flanker Josh McNally stretched over the line. Greig Tonks hit the post with his conversion attempt to leave the score at 49-5 before Bath ran up the score. Northampton finished a difficult season with a rousing bonus point victory over Worcester at Franklin’s Gardens. Tries from No 8 Mitch Eadie, centre Nafi Tuitavake, full-back Ben Foden and wing Tom Collins ensured a 32-24 victory that means Saints end the campaign ninth. Their fly-half, James Grayson, kicked three conversions and a penalty and Stephen Myler added another penalty. The Worcester centres Will Butler (2) and Ben Te’o grabbed their side’s tries, with fly-half Dorian Jones converting all three and adding a second-half penalty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/06/even-when-the-likes-of-macron-foul-up-multilingual-politicians-get-it-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T04:59:11Z","webTitle":"Even when the likes of Macron foul up, multilingual politicians get it right | Agnès Poirier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/06/even-when-the-likes-of-macron-foul-up-multilingual-politicians-get-it-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/06/even-when-the-likes-of-macron-foul-up-multilingual-politicians-get-it-right","fields":{"headline":"Even when the likes of Macron foul up, multilingual politicians get it right","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The French president, Emmanuel Macron, never ceases to surprise his audience, especially when he speaks in English. While some of his compatriots were shocked that he should address the US Congress in its native tongue, it pleased a large number of French people who appreciated how he engaged directly in version originale. A few days later, however, when President Macron thanked the Australian prime minister’s wife, Lucy Turnbull, for being “delicious” – conjuring up images of cannibalism and Hannibal Lecter – some commentators suddenly thought of Macron as creepy. It was hours before somebody thought to tell the Australians that the word “délicieuse” actually means delightful. Speaking a foreign language is a minefield for anyone who ventures there but also a source of constant wonder, joy and fun. The rewards are manifold and it is even thought to prevent Alzheimer’s disease. The smartest leaders either know many languages or understand the power of words enough to play with them to their advantage. Perhaps Macron used the word “delicious” on purpose; perhaps, even, the secret behind the strangely warm rapport between Macron, Trump and their wives is built on such deliciously faux amis? The fact is that multilinguists rule the world. That Angela Merkel is trilingual (she speaks German, Russian and English) should be no surprise. If David Cameron had not been a monoglot, maybe Britain would not have found itself in a Brexit nightmare. Just a thought. I will always remember when Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, on a visit to Paris in 1989 declared in French on French television that the PLO’s charter was “caduque!” What a stroke of genius. The world reached for their French dictionaries and discovered Arafat had just buried the 1964 Palestinian charter (since “caduque” means out of date), which had so far insisted that armed struggle was the only possible way to win back the homeland. This tiny word paved the way to the Oslo accords of 1993 and the famous handshake between Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin in Washington. In 1940, Parisians owed a big favour to Louisa Gross née Horwitz, the mother of the then American ambassador to Paris, William Christian Bullitt Jr. A German Jew, she made sure that her son was perfectly trilingual, as fluent in German and French as in American English. When the French government fled Paris, in effect making Bullitt the provisional governor of the city, there were only a few hours left to save the city from the fate shared by Rotterdam and Warsaw. Bullitt managed to persuade two French officials to meet their German counterparts at Écouen, 12 miles north of Paris, to settle terms for the handover. With the document signed, the German Field Marshal Georg von Küchler called off the bombardment of Paris. In everyday life, multilingualism and potential linguistic gaffes don’t carry such catastrophic potency, and faux amis leading to faux pas are part of the learning process. When I first arrived in Britain, aged 22, I found out that, more often than not, French words in the English language don’t actually mean a thing. I recall an awkward evening when an Englishman whispered some slightly salacious things to me. He winked and apologised for the “double entendre”. Double entendre? It took me some time to realise he meant “sous-entendre” – meaning implication. It is, however, always better to make small mistakes like Macron did in Australia than to rely on poor translators. The writer Oliver Kamm, the son of one of the greatest living British translators Anthea Bell, reminded me this week that in 1977, the translator Steven Seymour, accompanying Jimmy Carter on an official state visit to Poland, had to be fired after a disastrous first evening. President Carter had begun his speech saying: “I have come to learn your opinions and understand your desires for the future.” His translator told the Poles, in Polish: “I have a carnal desire for Poland.” • Agnès Poirier is the author of Left Bank, Arts, Passion and the Rebirth of Paris 1940-1950"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/05/observer-view-trump-folly-risking-peace-middle-east","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T20:01:00Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Trump’s folly in risking not just peace in the Middle East | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/05/observer-view-trump-folly-risking-peace-middle-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/05/observer-view-trump-folly-risking-peace-middle-east","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Trump’s folly in risking not just peace in the Middle East","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Unless he experiences a sudden, unexpected change of heart, Donald Trump will reactivate US sanctions on Iran next week and, by doing so, attempt to wreck the west’s landmark 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran. The likely negative consequences of Trump’s decision, if confirmed, are wide-ranging and extremely serious. The full or partial restoration of two sets of unilateral, pre-2015 American banking, financial and other sanctions would significantly undermine the moderate leadership of Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani. Before his landslide re-election victory last year, Rouhani promised voters much-needed economic renewal in exchange for maintaining the nuclear-related curbs. Now his hardline opponents are poised to strike. The destabilising of Iran, consequent on what would be seen there as an overt act of American aggression, could trigger a broader destabilisation of the Middle East. Predominantly Shia, Persian Iran is engaged in a fierce contest for power and influence with the Sunni Arab world, led by Saudi Arabia. If Trump, allied with Riyadh and Cairo, goes on the offensive, this rivalry may escalate as Iran inevitably reacts – with unforeseeable ramifications in places such as Yemen and Bahrain. One concern is that Iran’s clerical establishment, led by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, will revive a nuclear weapons research programme that, according to the Bush administration and the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency, ceased in 2003. This would produce the very result Trump ostensibly seeks to avoid. This, in turn, could spark a regional nuclear weapons race with the Saudis and others. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has long been lobbying Trump to end US adherence to the deal. Last week, he attempted to show that Iran was lying by unveiling a cache of stolen documents. Independent experts found nothing new in Netanyahu’s presentation. The IAEA, which has broad inspection rights, has verified 10 times, most recently in February, that Iran is in full compliance. But Trump hailed his ally’s PR stunt, with suspicious speed, as “proof” of Iranian cheating. As we reveal today, there have also been shockingly underhand efforts in the US to discredit key public officials associated with forging the deal. The alleged involvement of Trump aides in a privately run, Israeli-linked “dirty ops campaign” warrants immediate investigation. It recalls claims that Trump associates colluded with Russia to “dig up dirt” on Hillary Clinton before the 2016 presidential election. Leading figures in Israeli intelligence have warned Netanyahu that his aggressive stance does not serve his country’s best interests. Last week, Israeli forces again reportedly bombed Iranian targets inside Syria. Such confrontations are becoming regular occurrences. There is a clear danger, if tensions escalate further, that Israel could be sucked into an unwinnable, three-front war with Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Shia militias, the Assad regime, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Hamas in Palestine. At the same time, it is surely not to Israel’s advantage to continue to exaggerate the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran when Israel itself possesses an estimated 200 nuclear warheads, has never subscribed (unlike Iran) to the non-proliferation treaty, and does not allow IAEA inspections. Sooner or later, Israel will be called to account for this double standard. For its part, Iran says the US has failed to keep faith with the spirit and letter of the 2015 agreement, arguing that promised economic and financial relief has not materialised. Leading European banks still refuse to do business there, chilled by fear of American displeasure. Trump’s Muslim travel ban, targeting Iran, is another case in point. All this illuminates a larger problem: Trump’s lack of respect for international law and multilateral conventions in general, such as the Paris climate change agreement. The Iran deal, signed by all five permanent members of the UN security council, plus Germany, was incorporated into international law by the UN. It is to all intents and purposes an international treaty. Yet Trump is poised unilaterally to abrogate it, to the lasting detriment of America’s standing in the world. The harm a Trump decision to scupper the Iran deal would do to US relations with its European partners, all of whom are adamant in its defence, is incalculable. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, made a personal appeal to Trump during his recent Washington visit and was crudely rebuffed. The same fate befell Germany’s Angela Merkel. There is scant reason to believe any last-minute British intervention will fare better. A permanent rift is opening. There is no doubt that Iran’s actions in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere are cause for legitimate western concern, as is its expanding ballistic missile programme. Its human rights record is dreadful – witness its inexcusable treatment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual citizenship British nationals. But these are separate problems. There is no evidence that Iran is cheating on the nuclear deal. It remains a notable diplomatic achievement. It is essential that it is preserved intact – and built upon. Ultimately, this is about much more than nuclear proliferation. It is about the credibility, unity – and common sense – of the western democracies in jointly managing the challenges thrown up by a dangerous world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/05/stoke-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T13:30:24Z","webTitle":"Stoke relegated from Premier League after Van Aanholt strikes for Crystal Palace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/05/stoke-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/05/stoke-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Stoke relegated from Premier League after Van Aanholt strikes for Palace","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Exactly a decade ago on Friday Stoke City won promotion to the Premier League with a tense draw against Leicester City. Their 10-season spell in the top flight is now over, after defeat at home to Crystal Palace confirmed their relegation. At full-time they remained only three points from the last safe spot with one game to play but Swansea face Southampton on Tuesday and so one of those teams’ tally will increase beyond what is available to Paul Lambert’s side. “I can’t put my thoughts into words so soon after the game,” said Lambert. “Emotions are up and down after a tough afternoon. I feel for everybody connected with the club.” Xherdan Shaqiri had given Stoke both the lead and a bit of hope but second-half goals from James McArthur and Patrick van Aanholt, combined with an anaemic home display in which Lambert’s players looked absolutely terrified of their fate, sent them down. This has, of course, been coming. The club left it too long to dismiss Mark Hughes, under whom the club had stagnated, waiting until January to make the change. It might have looked like deflecting blame, particularly as Stoke have won only one of Lambert’s 14 games in charge, but it is tricky to disagree with his assessment of their fate. “When you don’t start right, and don’t get the grip of it, then you end up in trouble,” he said. The atmosphere was tense from the start. The home fans did their best to intimidate, booing every slight delay of a Palace throw-in as if the taker had spat on the statue of Stanley Matthews that stands outside the ground. But that merely masked their nerves. It was a bitty game that neither team looked capable of getting hold of. Lambert spent most of his time doing shuttle runs along the edge of the technical area, jawing in the ear of the fourth official, his face turning a curious shade of puce – or, put another way, looking every inch the nervous manager. He was briefly calmed just before half-time. Shaqiri was fouled about 25 yards out, hitched his shorts up his vast thighs and whipped the free-kick into the goalkeeper’s top-left corner. It flicked off Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who had committed the foul, in the wall on the way in but nobody cared: Shaqiri skipped into Lambert’s arms and there was hope in the Potteries. Yet the problem with a struggling team going ahead is it can exacerbate nerves rather than cool them. That has been a theme of Stoke’s season. “It’s people being anxious, worried about what might happen when we’ve got the lead,” Lambert said. That anxiety manifested itself in Stoke’s defensive line dropping virtually on to Jack Butland’s toes, inviting Palace on. Stoke looked like a team trying to hold on for 45 minutes and, while Lambert has tightened their defence since arriving in January, it seemed a risky approach. So it turned out, although Palace’s equaliser came after one of Stoke’s few attacks. Wilfried Zaha led a counter and fed Loftus‑Cheek, who slipped in McArthur. Shoulders slumped around the stadium when he bobbled a shot home. The decisive moment came with four minutes left. Zaha played what was actually a terrible pass looking for Van Aanholt, which Ryan Shawcross looked to intercept but poked straight into the Dutch full-back’s path, and he slotted the ball beneath Butland. It was cruel, perhaps, that the final error came from the man who has been with Stoke since they came up to the top flight. The result also confirmed that Palace are safe. Roy Hodgson has done an extraordinary job since taking over a team that had not managed a goal or a point in their first four games, (and went three more in kind under him) but he tried to direct praise towards his backroom staff. “I suppose every orchestra has to have a band leader,” he eventually said, when pressed for a little less modesty. “I’m really proud of our team’s performance, not just today but over the whole season.” In some ways it might be the kindest thing that it is over now for Stoke. Even with a victory they might still have gone down this weekend, so at least this curtailed their pain. “It’s a chance for Stoke to rebuild,” said Lambert."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/23/cary-on-brussels-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T22:09:35Z","webTitle":"Carry on Brussels review – a sorry slice of EU parliament life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/23/cary-on-brussels-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/23/cary-on-brussels-review","fields":{"headline":"Carry on Brussels review – a sorry slice of EU parliament life","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The European parliament is “one of the most misunderstood institutions in the world”, argues Carry on Brussels, a fly-on-the-wall documentary that exists in a kind of paradox. Had more effort been made to explain exactly what MEPs do prior to 2016, then Brexit voters might not have been so convinced of their uselessness; then again, a film about an institution running smoothly and fairly doesn’t pack a sufficient dramatic punch. So here we are, fiddling while Brussels burns – for the UK, at least. Director Christian Trumble spins comedy and tragedy into a watchable, if at times teeth-grindingly frustrating three-part series that pulls off a remarkably balanced portrait of seven MEPs from across the political spectrum, all working to very different ends. This first episode sets out its W1A-ish tone – we hear that SNP MEP Alyn Smith has booked “the third-floor coffee lounge” for a charity mixer, and he grumbles that Ukip aren’t mingling and are only there for the free wine – primarily by concentrating on the most embattled of the bunch. Seb Dance, a young Labour MEP, is notorious for holding up a sign reading: “He’s lying to you” behind Nigel Farage as he spoke in the EU parliament. As a result, he says, he gets tweets calling him a “knob”, a “big girl’s blouse” and a “shitbag”, and strangers offering to take him outside. He’s earnest and so upset by Brexit that, at one point, it moves him to tears. Dance has spent six months working on getting a sustainability report passed. We follow him to the crucial vote. One person whose support he won’t get is Ukip’s Gerard Batten, who rejects the EU system entirely, and thinks that legislating to reduce the damage done to the environment by red meat consumption, for example, is Europe sticking its nose in. He doesn’t eat red meat himself, he adds. Doesn’t like it. Prefers chicken and fish. Imagine Farage with every last drop of charisma drained from him, cross that with Alan Partridge in his Linton Travel Tavern years, and you’ve got Batten, whose inadvertent comedy becomes less and less funny as the programme goes on. He speaks at a joint committee hearing for almost twice his allotted speech time; when his microphone is eventually cut off, he declares that he is being discriminated against because he’s not a pro-EU leftie. This supposed denial of his democratic rights – his claims are quite clearly shown on camera to be untrue – is theatre and spectacle, designed to cultivate an image of victimhood and to disrupt proceedings as much as possible. Whatever you think about Ukip, it has proven an effective tactic, although Batten seems oblivious to just how embarrassing it looks when viewers are able to watch it play out from concept to execution. But then, he seems an oblivious kind of person. His 120-page alternative Brexit strategy, Taking Control, runs into hiccup after hiccup, ironically making it difficult for him to take control of anything, particularly his own report. The computer doesn’t work. He can’t print it out to send to journalists because it’s 120 pages long, and he doesn’t have the budget. He doesn’t bother talking to such mainstream media “propaganda organs” as the Guardian, the Times or Independent anyway, although he doesn’t mind the Daily Express’s propaganda organ, because it agrees with him, so that’s “fair enough”. We see him humming Land of Hope and Glory as he puts out his mini union jacks (“I’m the flag captain”). Like the other Ukip MEPs, he’s fighting Brussels from the inside, but if this is the extent of it, he makes a sorry case for the resistance. Of course I would say that. I’m part of a propaganda organ; one that Batten doesn’t like. And one of the skills of this documentary is that I suspect it’s a Yanny-or-Laurel affair. If you want to see Dance as a member of the leftie metropolitan elite – and his little “Let’s Dance” moment, the framed “He’s lying to you” sign in his office, make it easy – then you can. If you want to see Batten as a bumbling buffoon who blusters about common sense despite appearing to be entirely lacking in it, then that, too, is perfectly possible. Carry on Brussels does not so much challenge preconceptions, as allow itself to be moulded to fit the ones that already exist. But wasn’t that what got us into this mess in the first place?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/27/the-little-vampire-review-adequately-undead-animation","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T07:00:21Z","webTitle":"The Little Vampire review – adequately undead animation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/27/the-little-vampire-review-adequately-undead-animation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/27/the-little-vampire-review-adequately-undead-animation","fields":{"headline":"The Little Vampire review – adequately undead animation","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Rudolph (Rasmus Hardiker) is a little vampire – and “a little idiot” according to his older brother – who is turning 13 for the 300th time.

Two days after the Grenfell Tower fire last year, he recorded and released a fundraising tribute song and video. His second EP, Hold Dat, was well received earlier this year and his latest single is B.I.G. He plays Lovebox and Boomtown festivals this summer and the O2 Academy Islington, London, on 25 October. You reference west London in your tracks a lot – is local pride important? I like this area because it’s connected to Maida Vale, which is really affluent, so there are nice parks and nice places to chill nearby so there are nice places to chill nearby. But then you’ve got the other side, like the Mozart estate where I lived, where there’s a lot of people growing up in poverty. I know we’re not in a third world country, but you’ll be in the blocks, where people are crammed into tiny flats, knowing that round the corner there are huge mansions worth millions. The juxtaposition is mad. You have a track called Xenophobia, in which you make the case for migration. That was inspired by personal experience, wasn’t it? Yes. I’m half Lebanese and half Sierra Leonean, so my dad is from Lebanon but lived in Sierra Leone. My mum was from a poor part of Sierra Leone, where it was very dangerous when the war started in the 1990s, and when she was pregnant with me, my family came to a decision, like “we’re going to get you out of here”. My mum wanted to go to America, but her visa was denied – I always say to her, imagine if we were in America. I’d be making completely different music! Britain took her in as a refugee, and so I was born here. We lived in housing for refugees for about two years; me and my mum were living in just one room, with a shared bathroom and kitchen. I wasn’t depressed by it though: I was just a kid, and that was all I knew. We’re approaching the first anniversary of Grenfell. What are your memories of that week? When the fire started, everything was rumours, but pretty fast we found out what was going on, and suddenly everyone’s running to the block. Because they couldn’t do anything else, a lot of people there were recording what was happening on their phones – they didn’t realise they were actually recording [people] dying. We realised that we knew some people in the block – one of my friends, Yasin [El Wahabi], was in there – him and his whole family passed away that night. That whole week was just unreal, people were distraught – I remember a lot of anger, just a crazy atmosphere. If you’re from the area, you definitely lost someone you know. The next day everybody got up, and brought all their clothes, money, all their food, and took it to the mosque, or to the church. People gave so much. But why did it fall to the community? The response from the people was way better than the government’s. How did you end up putting out a tribute song so fast? I remember going home after the first day, and listening to this Mary J Blige song, No More Drama, and I was still in shock, but I felt like, I’ve got to say something. I went on YouTube, and wrote “Mary J Blige instrumental”, which is the old-school way: that’s how I first started writing bars [lyrics] – playing a classic rap instrumental off YouTube. I wanted to capture what the whole area was feeling. Has much changed? Well, a year on, I’ve got a friend who lived right in front of Grenfell, and she was evicted too, because it was a fire hazard for her to stay – she’s still in a hotel – and that’s not on the news; never mind the people who were inside, still waiting to be rehoused; their situation is crazy, the funding they were supposed to get is all over the place. This is why people are still angry: Kensington and Chelsea is the richest borough in Europe. And when people see a royal wedding going on that’s worth over £30m, they are always going to say: what does this country care about more? But then, how do you help people who have gone through something like that? On one level I don’t think money could buy what they need anyway. Do you think music and politics make a good mix? Music can be a way for young people to take in certain types of information – even if it’s just subconsciously. When rap music started in America, it was against the system – against “the man”, as they used to say – it was about empowerment. People use rap to express themselves in all sorts of ways, and that’s cool, but politics is at the core of rap music. It’s crazy when you think how far rap has drifted from its political origins, but saying that, you’ve got people like Childish Gambino who come out with a song like This Is Americacorrect – look how much impact look that had straight away! It shows it’s still so needed. Was grime’s association with Jeremy Corbyn part of that? Totally. All those artists who got involved to boost the youth vote did make a difference: more young people than ever voted Labour. I did an event with Jeremy. It was so funny – I got on stage and didn’t know whether to spit bars or make a speech. With Jeremy, there’s a little bit of hope that he could be a bit more in touch with that left side of politics, with the side that helps ordinary people. Even down to the fact he’s a big Arsenal fan. it’s just funny to see a politician talk about his football club – it shows us that he’s human. How did you get into making music? I first started making music when I was 16, just chilling in places like Mozart Estate. Literally just bored, smoking a zoot, and then somebody would just type “rap instrumental” into YouTube – it would probably have been classic old school beats like J Dilla; it’s easier to freestyle on because it’s slow, and it’s got pockets of space, compared to grime – freestyling off the top of your head on grime is not easy! Did you have a plan B? I always wanted to be a youth worker, and I got into Goldsmiths uni to do a youth work course, but as soon as I went, the music really started picking up. I’d be doing radio at night, getting home at 4am, waking up and having to be in lectures at 10. So in my second year I quit to do music full time, just living off whatever little paycheque I could get. By last year, my name was buzzing, because I did lots of radio sets and freestyles for YouTube, and people knew who I was, but I didn’t have a lot of finished music out there available to buy. So I started making proper finished projects, like the Big Zuu EP, to put on Apple Music and Spotify. Do you think streaming sites are working for up-and-coming artists? Definitely. Streaming services have got big really fast, so independent artists like me had a chance to make a living that way. It’s a new kind of independence – people like Wiley used to make money putting out their records as a hard copy themselves, before piracy and illegal downloads killed all that. By the end of 2017, me and AJ Tracey were on tour across the UK and Europe, like proper rock stars, with a tour bus and everything! Is it weird to be coming up at a time when the mainstream knows what grime is? It’s sick. Before I was a grime MC, I was a fan. I’m really lucky to be coming up at this time: with people like Stormzy and J Hus killing it, it’s made it easy for people like me to just be ourselves. People are finally saying, let’s support artists from the UK, not just music that’s imported from America. It feels like we’re succeeding on our own terms.

Pacey and Joey were obviously destined to spawn beautiful, chestnut-haired offspring from episode one. The moment these two velvety fawns laid their enormous brown eyes on each other, Dawson was out of the picture, but it took them all absolutely ages to realise it. Cue long summers of heart-tugging break-ups, huge, sad foal-eyes across crowded proms and Joey repeating that nervous hair-tuck until the tresses around her left ear went permanently bent. Poor Dawson could only look on like a terminally disparaged Ken doll as the love of his life cantered back up that beautifully appointed pier and into the waiting hooves of a waaaaaay hotter stallion. If you preferred Dawson to Pacey, you were scientifically wrong. Angela, Jordan and Brian – My So-Called Life Who would you choose to bang: a big-eyed boybander in a thong necklace or a kindly, asexual lion? My So-Called Life’s Angela Chase (Claire Danes) gave me weekly conniptions throughout the 90s with her idiotic refusal to see that neighbour Brian (the aforementioned lion played by Devon Gummersall) was the right boy for her. Instead, she homed in on vacant high-school heartthrob Jordan (Jared Leto) and his hypnotic python eyes. She thought she could save him from not being able to read good – but who could save her from her maddening over-thinking, and eventually turning into a jazz-mad FBI agent with a complicated personal life? Brian could’ve. But he didn’t get the chance because he was a cowardly lion as well as an asexual one and couldn’t fess up to his feelings at the crucial moment. Hence Carrie from Homeland was born. Ross, Rachel and Joey – Friends It always made sense that the two densest characters in Friends would eventually get it together. So when Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), who spent whole series oblivious to Ross’s tongue trailing on the floor whenever she was around, began having sex dreams about her good pal Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) – who hadn’t heard of Stalin – the universe leaned back on its chair and agreed that this would go well. All except Ross (David Schwimmer) who, despite now dating Joey’s ex Charlie (improbably, a hot palaeontologist), couldn’t reach acceptance when it came to the new relationship. Self-medicating with too many margaritas, burning his hands on fajitas and squawking about how FINE he was failed to convince anyone. The universe (and the writers) eventually agreed that, however implausible, Ross really was Rachel’s lobster and the two should end the show re-coupled while Joey went off to present Top Gear. Jeremy, Mark and Dobby – Peep Show Possibly the most fun thing about the toxic friendship between Mark Corrigan (David Mitchell) and Jeremy Usbourne (Robert Webb) was the latter’s spiteful insistence on falling for the former’s romantic partners, just to enrage him. Not once but twice Jez decided he was hopelessly in love with Mark’s girl: first Sophie (Olivia Colman) and then Dobby (Isy Suttie). The two men ended up angrily competing to hold in their wee at a picnic before repeatedly electrocuting one another on a rural fence. Meanwhile, Dobs ditched the pair of them for a new life in New York – and who can blame her? Mark and Jez were meant to be together for eternity anyway and no woman was going to spoil that. The Doctor, Rose and Mickey – Doctor Who Hardly a series goes by without there being some kind of sexy tension between the time-traversing eccentric and his younger, lissom female companion (which may or may not change with the arrival of Jodie Whittaker’s Time Lord). But back in the day (or forward: time has no meaning here) Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) had it bad for her Doctor (played by Christopher Eccleston, then David Tennant). It was Tennant’s incarnation that got the full force of Rose’s pout as, hanging off a ledge on some alien planet, she only occasionally remembered Mickey, the boyfriend back on Earth. His fate it was to look sadly at the space where the Tardis had been, wondering if he’d see her again. In the end, Rose swallowed time, went gold and moved to a parallel universe with a different version of her Doctor. The end. Dawn, Tim and Lee – The Office Before he had his empathy removed, Ricky Gervais co-wrote the tenderest love story between Dawn (Lucy Davies) and Tim (Martin Freeman) in The Office. Saddled with an archetypal “lad” who crushed her artistic soul, Dawn’s romantic muse was finally awoken by unassuming colleague Tim when he gave her some oil paints as a leaving present. Their eventual kiss to Yazoo’s Only You still makes you well up, as Dawn says she’s no longer engaged to Lee and goes for the full face-holder snog while a stunned Tim stands in the middle of the office Christmas party like a surprised mannequin. It was gratifying to see Tim, always the underdog, get the moment of romantic realisation he’d longed for – like never happens in real life. Buffy, Spike and Angel – Buffy the Vampire Slayer “I’m getting the brush-off for Captain Peroxide,” snarked altruistic blood-sucker Angel (David Boreanaz) to his vampire-slaying ex (Sarah Michelle Gellar) because she’d started seeing the Billy Idol lookalike. The perky evil-eradicator continued to hold a flame for Angel, despite plainly having a heap more deviant fun with the cockney blond who had a habit of crossing the room groin-first whenever she was in it and calling her “love”. Phwoargh. The great thing about dating undead men is the potential for rekindled romance long, long into the future. Angel and Buffy are almost certainly married now and having rows in Ikea for eternity. Carrie, Big and Aidan – Sex and the City The final episode of Sex and the City saw Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) finally get together with Mr Big (Chris Noth) after a passionate pinball game that saw her ricocheting back to Big more than once, despite his toxicity and tendency to page his limo driver and flee every time intimacy or commitment loomed on the horizon. The notion of a love interest nicknamed for his alpha-ness has dated quickly but there’s no denying the power he had over the neurotic columnist, even when she was trying to forge a future with someone new. Poor furniture-maker Aidan (John Corbett) was good with wood but less so with the fluctuating affections of a girlfriend still in love with her impossible ex. The death knell came for their relationship when Aidan physically tried to rip down a wall between them, symbolism definitely intended, and Carrie had a panic attack trying on a wedding dress. It was always going to be the cigar-smoking, vineyard-owning, supremely wealthy commitment-phobe for Carrie. Go figure. Martin, Ann and Paul – Ever Decreasing Circles Time to revisit this exemplary sitcom if you are unfamiliar. In it, Richard Briers plays Martin, a fastidious, beta-man with an exquisite wife named Ann (Penelope Wilton). Into their neatly arranged paradise comes Paul (Peter Egan), a louche salon-owner with one eyebrow permanently arched in sexual invitation. He toyed with his married neighbours for years, never quite understanding that Ann and Martin, for all her frustration, had a love that couldn’t be chipped by the semi-serious advances of an over-sexed hairdresser. Paul provided the grit that made Ann and Martin’s flawed oyster so beautiful. A more delicately balanced TV threesome you couldn’t wish to find. Rod, Jane and Freddy – Rainbow Sometimes, real life is more fascinating than fiction and so it was with Rod Burton, Freddy Marks and Jane Tucker who performed as the human musical trio in the children’s 70s-90s ITV puppet show, Rainbow. Jane and Rod had married and divorced by the time young Freddy arrived to join the band. But there’s always a fascination with what goes on behind the sunny smiles and exaggerated dance moves of children’s TV and – despite the denial of scandal on all sides – Rod’s eyes remind me of a sad bear who’s lost its owner. After 30 years together, Jane and Freddy finally got married two years ago and everyone still appears to be friends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/08/the-measure-audrey-brow-meghan-markle-knees","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T11:00:09Z","webTitle":"From Audrey’s brows to Meghan’s knees: this week’s fashion trends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/08/the-measure-audrey-brow-meghan-markle-knees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/08/the-measure-audrey-brow-meghan-markle-knees","fields":{"headline":"From Audrey’s brows to Meghan’s knees: this week’s fashion trends","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Going up White suits and puffballs Tom Wolfe dressing is summer’s cult reference.

But on some things, most notably an avowed desire to stick it to Europe, the two rival parties agree, and if they follow through on their promises Italy will be set on a collision course with the EU. The question is: will they? Much suggests they will not. As cabinet positions are being debated in Rome, the situation certainly looks awkward. An early clash looms over immigration: the coalition contract envisages an 18-month limit for the asylum process, the detention of irregular migrants, and the repatriation of half a million people to their countries of origin – most of it in violation of EU law. Another, over Russia, could come as soon as next month, when EU leaders are scheduled to roll over sanctions that the government accord – which describes Moscow as a possible partner rather than as enemy, of Europe, and certainly not a military threat – demands be lifted. The loudest alarm bells are ringing over the parties’ stated ambition to rewrite the EU’s rules, and their seemingly dichotomous domestic policies, which combine the rises in public spending promised by M5S with the tax cuts favoured by the League. The coalition contract says economic governance in the EU, “based on the dominance of the market rather than the broader social and economic dimension”, must be reviewed, and the single market reformed to “avoid prejudicial effects on national interests”. If he ends up getting the job – which is far from certain – the coalition partners’ mooted economy minister, Paolo Savona, could cause ructions. A former industry minister who opposed the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, Savona calls the euro a “German cage”. Europe has made little secret of its concern. As the European commission unveiled its economic advice to member states, the body’s finance commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, expressed what sounded like a forlorn hope. “We are hoping for cooperation [from Italy], on the basis of dialogue, respect and mutual trust,” he said. Earlier this week the trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstöm, said“there are some things there that are worrying” about Italy’s incoming government. Economists calculate the cost of the coalition’s promises – lower taxes, higher benefits, earlier retirement – could reach €170bn (£150bn), or about 10% of Italy’s GDP. This would add to the country’s €2.1trn debt mountain and potentially trigger the EU’s worst-case scenario: a Greek-style debt crisis in the eurozone’s third-biggest economy. But in contrast to foreign commentators, many Italian analysts are sceptical that Eurogeddon is inevitable, or even particularly likely. The government contract is vaguely worded and amounts to little more than a manifesto, they note. Behind the fierce anti-European rhetoric and bluster – a feature of the two populist parties’ election campaigns – there are few indications the new government will seek a serious showdown with the EU. Giuseppe Conte, the lawyer and academic with no political experience tasked on Wednesday with trying to form the new government, will have his work cut out simply finding acceptable compromises between the mutually antagonistic M5S and League and their respective leaders, Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini. Italian presidents have rarely used their constitutional powers to veto proposed government laws, but if he finds himself faced with policies he considers fiscally irresponsible or likely to lead to open conflict with Europe, Sergio Mattarella may decide there is a first time for everything. A significantly more formidable obstacle to the new government’s putative programme may prove to be the 318-seat senate, through which all new legislation must pass and where the coalition partners – not known for their voting discipline – have a slim seven seats. Salvini has promised that the coalition will “respect rules and commitments” and that Europe had “nothing to worry about”: the new government aims to “grow Italy and create jobs, bring companies to Italy to invest [and] make work more stable”. This is, however, Italy’s 66th government since the end of the second world war. Given the obvious tensions, obstacles and constraints, both domestic and international, that it will face, few would bet on its chances of surviving long enough to mend Italy, let alone stick it to Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/23/sajid-javid-seeks-to-win-over-police-with-new-funding-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T15:22:04Z","webTitle":"Sajid Javid seeks to win over police with funding pledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/23/sajid-javid-seeks-to-win-over-police-with-new-funding-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/23/sajid-javid-seeks-to-win-over-police-with-new-funding-pledge","fields":{"headline":"Sajid Javid seeks to win over police with funding pledge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The home secretary has signalled a departure from the Conservatives’ past approach to the police, telling officers he would prioritise getting them more money to reflect the increased demands on them. Sajid Javid told the Police Federation conference that he wanted to “reset” the relationship between the government and police. Under the previous home secretaries Theresa May and Amber Rudd, it was severely strained, as police budgets were cut and officers said their terms and conditions had worsened. Hundreds of rank-and-file officers in Birmingham heard Javid say he accepted their central claim that they were under more strain. “I’m not arrogant enough to turn up here after three weeks in the job and tell you how to do yours. What I will say is that I am listening and I get it. I get that there is increased demand,” he said on Wednesday. May and Rudd had maintained that crime was falling despite police budgets being reduced, but Javid struck a different tone, saying: “Yes, traditional crime is over a third lower than it was in 2010 – a credit to your hard work. But more crimes – like hate crimes and sexual offences – are being reported than ever before. “There’s also been a recent increase in serious violent crimes – including homicides, knife and gun crime. I am absolutely determined to put an end to the appalling violence that is terminating young lives far too soon. The threat from terrorism has also escalated and evolved. “And crime is increasingly taking place online. The internet has emboldened criminals to break the law in the most horrifying of ways.” But what the hundreds of delegates wanted was a pledge of more money from the government. Javid hinted at this, saying: “We’re giving PCCs [police and crime commissioners] the flexibility to increase council tax contributions to policing. “This has helped deliver a £460m increase in total police funding this year. We’re now investing over £1bn more in policing than we did three years ago, including money raised through council tax. “But we need to think more about the long-term funding of the police. So, my pledge to you is this: I will prioritise police funding in the spending review next year.” Javid ended his speech by saying he wanted a better relationship with the police, whose numbers have been cut by 20,000 since the Tories came to power in 2010. “It’s often said that British policing is the envy of the world. Everyone in this room wants to keep it that way. Let’s reset the relationship between the government and the police. I will give you the tools, the powers and the backup that you need to get the job done,” he said. “For those of you who stand on the frontline, be in no doubt that I will be standing with you.” Javid said he was horrified by the violence faced by his brother, who is now a chief superintendent in the West Midlands. His speech ended to warmer applause than past home secretaries have enjoyed. One delegate, John Apter, who chairs the Hampshire Police Federation, told Javid: “I found myself liking you a little bit.” In his speech, the Police Federation chairman, Calum Macleod, said police warnings that cuts would lead to rising crime had been ignored by Javid’s predecessors. Macleod, who is running for re-election, told him: “In recent years, government has turned its back on those who it expects to keep the public safe. Real-term salaries cut. Officer numbers cut. And yet, demand increases.” Javid’s wooing of the police saw him declare his support for stop and search, and for spit hoods, although he has next to no power over such policing methods, as they are operational matters for individual police chiefs. Louise Haigh, the shadow policing minister, said: “He claims he wants police to have the resources they need, but offers nothing beyond platitudes and the same inadequate funding settlement.” Officers who heard the speech welcomed its tone, but wanted to wait to see whether Javid delivered on extra money for policing. Che Donald, a vice-chair of the Police Federation, said: “Once bitten, twice shy. A cautious and reserved reception for someone who seemed to be saying the right things, but delivering on them remains to be seen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/oliver-burkeman-this-column-exceptions","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T14:00:14Z","webTitle":"When is an exception not an exception? | Oliver Burkeman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/oliver-burkeman-this-column-exceptions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/oliver-burkeman-this-column-exceptions","fields":{"headline":"When is an exception not an exception?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the more infuriating challenges of personal money management goes as follows. Suppose your dishwasher breaks down. It makes sense to replace it with a good one, instead of something cheap that will need replacing again next year, so you buy a high‑end model, congratulating yourself on your wisdom. The following month, it’s your 10th wedding anniversary. You’re not the type to splurge on champagne-fuelled city breaks, but this is different, a once-in-a-lifetime event, so marking it properly seems right. The month after that, you buy a pricey new work outfit, as an investment in yourself. The problem with all these “exceptions” isn’t that they’re unjustifiable – it’s that, if they crop up all the time, they aren’t really exceptions. Which is one reason it’s so hard to stick to a budget: there’s often a solid case for spending beyond your means just this once. But if “just this once” happens every month, there’s a name for that: it’s a monthly expense. The researchers Abigail Sussman and Adam Alter have studied what happens when we classify expenditures as exceptions, and their answers are unsettling. We chronically underestimate how much they’ll cost us – and, when it comes to each individual purchase, we’re prone to overpay. This is due to a flaw in what psychologists call our “mental accounting”: we don’t think of dishwashers and city breaks as the same kind of thing, so we don’t think of the money as coming from one pot marked “exceptional expenditures”; we also forget there will be other demands on those funds later on. This has its upsides: in another study, Alter and colleagues showed that people will donate more to charity if the request is framed as an exception to their usual spending. That’s a positive, because the beneficiary happens to be a good cause, but it’s still bad mental accounting. Our ineptitude isn’t confined to money. A working paper from Sussman and others suggests it applies to “caloric budgets”, too: we’re likelier to stray from self-imposed rules of healthy eating if we can classify the occasion as a special event or the food as somehow unusual. Then there are time budgets: I know I ought to spend the first few hours of every day on my most important projects, and I’d only ever break that rule for a truly urgent reason. But if there’s one of those twice a week, am I following my rule at all? This is one of those idiosyncrasies of psychology for which the best antidote may be simply remembering it exists. If you’re in the habit of drawing up a budget, you could include a category for exceptions and brainstorm what that might include. (Birthday presents are a good example: it’s possible to buy them almost weekly yet still think of them as one-offs.) To counter the tendency to spend time badly, you could add a “slack day” to your week, keeping one day free of scheduled work to deal with all the exceptions that – I promise! – will arise. Above all, develop the habit of distrusting the inner voice that tells you a given expenditure, of money or anything else, is worth breaking your rules for. Maybe it is. But you always say that.

It’s like the sound of a steam train, or even an experimental electronic music track. “Thankfully, no one needs to sit in here,” says the engineer showing us around. “You’d go crazy.” This isn’t some kind of vast industrial production line – this is a laboratory at Microsoft’s otherwise sedate headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The extraordinary noise is created when button durability on dozens of Xbox controllers is tested simultaneously. Tiffany Nguyen is a hardware reliability engineer at Microsoft. Her job is to oversee the testing of any accessory containing mechanical or electrical components that could wear or break during use. One of the most important devices they work with, and one that suffers enormous rigours in everyday use, is the Xbox joypad. Right now, Nguyen and her department are analysing the new Xbox adaptive controller, a device designed for people with disabilities. “With this controller we have a broader range of users who may have limited mobility, so they may use [it] differently,” she explains. “It might be mounted on a tripod, used at a different angle, and some people may use their wrist, their elbow, even their feet.” The Redmond campus has two labs where joypads are tested. In the measurements lab, there are huge work desks loaded with contraptions, tools and eviscerated controllers. Here, the general functionality of every device is analysed before being passed on to “the noisy place”. “We measure 14 or more different things about every single button press,” says test lab lead Robert Silbernagel. “We measure what each button press looks like in force, in travel and how it clicks, which is a very important part of every button press.” Everything is tested by strange, small, skeletal machines built in-house for specific applications. One machine inserts and removes a 3.5mm jack into the adaptive controller, over and over again – just to make sure the socket holds up. This is a place where detail is everything: where things are tested by robots, but where human interactions must be simulated properly. As Silbernagel explains, “For round connectors like power jacks and these audio-style jacks, if you simply insert and extract that lead thousands of times artificially in a lab, you just develop a big flat spot on the head of the jack. That’s not reality; when people do this, it gets rotated randomly, it spreads out the wear. So what we did was, we added a little stepper motor to the test fixture so every time the jack retracts, it rotates a little and spreads that damage out, better simulating what happens in the real world. When we measure these forces now, we do a much better job of matching reality.” Elsewhere in the room is a “torture test” unit, which pulls at the lead going into a controller to see if it snaps, and a unit that knocks a jack plugged into the pad up down, left and right, over and over again to see if that breaks the socket. In one corner, there is a darkened booth where staff test the brightness, colour and uniformity of the LEDs on the Xbox controller. There are environmental tests, too. Engineers test the durability of the pads in contact with at least 13 different common chemicals, including those found in skin lotion and perfume. But the noisy room is the button-pressing lab, where huge banks of units test bays of controllers. A central computer runs a proprietary gameplay simulator, and all the pressure units then start pushing buttons. Each unit has an array of prongs powered by air cylinders, allowing testers to control the exact forces exerted. Over the course of designing a controller, they’ll run through hundreds of prototypes. Jason switches the units back on and the noise starts up gradually before the piston-like plungers go at full tilt. “We spend as little time in here as possible,” he yells. “These systems are smart – they know when a failure occurs and they can flag it. So we can set it to run, go home for the night, come back the next morning and be ready to take a measurement.” Right now, with the adaptive controller, the team is carrying out crush tests, destroying the devices to make sure they don’t fragment into anything sharp or dangerous. They’ll also be dropped from a variety of heights and at different angles. The lab is filled with stacks of these things in various states of annihilation. Nguyen surveys the laboratory with quiet pride. “I break things for a living,” she says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/15/the-daddy-quota-how-quebec-got-men-to-take-parental-leave","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T04:00:06Z","webTitle":"'The Daddy quota': how Quebec got men to take parental leave","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/the-daddy-quota-how-quebec-got-men-to-take-parental-leave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/the-daddy-quota-how-quebec-got-men-to-take-parental-leave","fields":{"headline":"'The Daddy quota': how Quebec got men to take parental leave","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Daniel Goldsmith’s first son was born in Quebec in 2013, he took the newborn on a trip to Colorado Springs, the US town in which he grew up. “I’d smile at a mother in a coffee shop, because her baby was the same age as mine, just weeks old,” he recalls. “And then she’d tell me she was going back to work the following week.” Goldmith, a humanities teacher in Montreal, spoke to old friends about their experiences with babies and work. “It just sounded like the definition of insanity: mothers going back to work two weeks after a baby was born; fathers taking two days off.” The 35-year-old had emigrated to Canada with his wife, Giulia Zaccagnini, a few years earlier. He took advantage of a Quebec social policy unheard of anywhere else in North America: a programme of extended non-transferable paternity leave at 70-75% pay offered by the government. “Most of my [male] colleagues at work are somewhere between 28 and 40, and I don’t know of a single one in the department who’s had a kid who has not taken those weeks of paternity leave,” says Goldsmith. “If something generous like this is being offered, you don’t say no.” In the family of Canada’s provinces and territories, Quebec has long been the noisy, rebellious child. In 2006, it divorced itself from the country’s complex and lacklustre parental leave programme. The province created its own system, the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP), a model influenced by Scandinavian countries and with the aim of improving gender equality. Along with Quebec’s highly subsidised daycare system – the envy of parents across the rest of Canada, with rates as low as C$7.55 (£4.35) per day per child – QPIP was seeded in the 1990s by the controversial separatist leader Pauline Marois, then Quebec’s minister of families. “Marois is a feminist and fiercely determined,” says Sophie Mathieu, a post-doctoral fellow at Brock University who researches the Quebec parental leave system. “As a province, Quebec went from being the laggard in gender equality – Quebec was the last Canadian province to give women the vote – to being the leader.” QPIP gave parents higher replacement rates – 70-75% of one’s income, over a maximum 52 weeks – than other Canadian provinces, while offering more flexibility in terms of shared leave. But the most innovative aspect of QPIP is its “daddy quota” — the five weeks of “use-it-or-lose-it” benefits, for fathers and non-biological mothers in lesbian couples. “There is so much working against fathers when it comes to leave,” says Andrea Doucet, the Canada Research Chair in Gender, Work &amp; Care. “Fathers go into work and say they want to take leave, and their bosses say: ‘Well isn’t your wife taking leave?’ Fathers were being penalised for taking leave, all the stuff that women have been going through for so long. “What they found in places like Sweden is that if you give fathers their own leave, something families will lose if they don’t take, taking the leave becomes expected.” Among fathers in Quebec, the effect was close to immediate, with take-up rates among eligible dads jumping 250%. “Over 80% of Quebec fathers take their paternity leave,” says Doucet. And 86% of Quebec parents will also in some way share the rest of their parental leave. Compare that with the 15% of fathers who take parental benefits in the rest of Canada, and the estimated 2% of parents who use the shared parental leave programme in the UK, and the results of what some policy experts have called “the Quebec experiment” begin to seem quite stunning. Globally the picture is even starker. Almost two-thirds of the world’s children under a year old – nearly 90 million infants – live in countries where fathers are not legally entitled to a single day of paid paternity leave, according to new research by Unicef. Ankita Patnaik, an economist at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington DC, authored one of the first papers studying QPIP. She says the programme quickly showed results with regards to time use between couples. “I found that the mothers having babies in Quebec under QPIP were spending more time in paid work one to three years after having their children,” she says. What’s more, Patnaik found that fathers who made use of QPIP were engaging in more childcare and domestic work one to three years later than fathers who did not – 37 minutes more per day, on average. Doucet, who has studied fatherhood for two decades, says that the true worth of Quebec fathers spending more time with their babies is still difficult to reflect in numbers. “The real question is: later on when the child is sick, who is going to care for the kid? We’ve seen … that when fathers build their confidence, competence, love and the feeling that they are an equal parent, then when things go wrong, it’s not always the mother [who takes responsibility].” While five weeks of leave is a good step in this direction, “it’s just one step”, she adds. Goldsmith, who also used shared parental benefits to take months-long leaves for both his young sons, believes that men caring for their babies in the early weeks of their life has a significant and continuing benefit for family life. “It’s different for dads. Mums have an automatic bond but dads have to earn it. And then when you start getting reactions from your babies, it makes you want to be more involved,” he says. “I want to care for my kids, not because of some abstract theoretical notion of sharing 50/50. My son smiles when I smile, he smiles when he sees me. So I do things for love. Love becomes the reason.” In Canada, that love is spreading. “In the 2018 budget, we have introduced an additional parental sharing benefit of five weeks,” says the families minister, Jean-Yves Duclos. “This is directly related to this very successful experiment in the province of Quebec. “We know it’s policies like this that will help us achieve a more equal and inclusive society. These are the kind of policies we want. Not the kind that build walls. Here in Canada, we prefer bridges.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

The Breadwinner is a children’s animation about an 11-year-old girl named Parvana growing up in Afghanistan under the Taliban. It contains harrowing scenes of abduction, imprisonment, execution, warfare, and brutal repression of women. Twomey discovered that it was the adults who were most upset. Teachers and parents in the audience found it almost too emotional; younger viewers, less so. “Oftentimes adults can get really traumatised thinking about what children are experiencing watching a film but the actual experience can be something completely different,” says Twomey. “If you have a child protagonist in a film, the children in the audience take their cue from them. If the child in the film can take what’s going on, they can lead the children in the audience.” As well as proving that you don’t need talking animals and candy-coloured fantasy worlds to get children engaged, The Breadwinner succeeds where so many attempts to convey modern conflicts such as Afghanistan’s in other forms – live-action drama, documentary, war films, even comedy – have failed. In fact, it suggests that, in the right hands, animation could be the ideal medium for the job. “It allows you under the door,” says Nora Twomey. “A door that people might shut otherwise. It allows you to access different parts of people’s empathy. If I watched Parvana go through some of the more challenging things she does in live action, I’d feel like I would emotionally disconnect from her to protect myself. I wouldn’t want to go those places with her. Animation can lend you tools to stop audiences from doing that.” My Life As A Courgette is one such example: set in a care home full of troubled children, it dealt with themes of death, alcoholism and abuse. Or Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, which detailed the film-maker’s rebellious youth in Iran under a similarly repressive regime to that depicted in The Breadwinner. Even with higher-budget studio fare, animation can smuggle a great deal under the door, as with movies like Pixar’s Inside Out (which addressed teenage mental health), Wall-E (which imagined an environmental apocalypse), or Up (whose life-to-death montage has wrung tears from many a grownup viewer). It is also hardly a coincidence that the makers of The Breadwinner were primarily female. It is very much a story about gender: under the Taliban – still estimated to control 10 to 20% of Afghanistan – women are not allowed to work, drive, go to school or even shop without a male chaperone. So when Parvana’s father is imprisoned, leaving her mother and older sister housebound, she cuts off her hair and disguises herself as a boy. Her new identity brings new freedoms, but there is no glossing over the grimness of the situation. “As a storyteller, I am first and foremost a mother,” says the 46-year-old Twomey, “so when I tell stories, be they at bedtime for my two boys or in a cinema screen, I try to let them explore some of the darker areas of life but in a responsible way, where they feel supported.” Twomey is co-founder of Irish animation house Cartoon Saloon, whose two previous features, The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea were both Celtic-themed fantasies. The Breadwinner was originally a novel, by Canadian author Deborah Ellis. It was adapted for the screen by Hungarian-Canadian writer Anita Doron and its producers included Angelina Jolie. The premise is not as fanciful as it sounds, explains Ellis, who based her book on real-life interviews with Afghan refugees. There is even an Afghan term for it: bacha posh, which translates as “dressed as a boy”. Ellis became involved with a support group for Afghan women when the Taliban took control of the country in 1996: “I felt that one of the things I could do that would be useful would be to go over to the camps in Pakistan and collect some stories, so we could find out a bit more about who these women were, what they went through, how they felt about it, how they dealt with it, and most importantly how we could be helpful to them.” It is unlikely a male writer would have had the same access. The refugee camps were largely a world of women and children, who invited Ellis into their tents, gave her tea and told her their stories. Published in 2000, The Breadwinner became a children’s bestseller, and has generated three sequel novels. Ellis has gone on to write other similar stories of children in adverse conditions: AIDS orphans in Malawi, for example (in 2004’s The Heaven Children) or Colombian children caught up in the cocaine trade (2006’s I Am A Taxi). Money from the sales of the Breadwinner books goes towards women’s projects in Afghanistan, such as training women teachers and supporting girls after they have left orphanages. In an ideal world, it would be Afghan film-makers telling stories such as The Breadwinner, but the Taliban banned film-making outright, and subsequent attempts to restart the industry have faltered. Intriguingly, the first film to come out of post-Taliban Afghanistan was Siddiq Barmak’s 2002 drama Osama, which also focused on a girl who dresses as a boy to support her family. Iranian director Majid Majidi also made Baran, in 2001, about an Afghan immigrant bacha posh in Tehran. Around the same time, Iran’s Mohsen Makhmalbaf and his daughter Samira also both made films centred on Afghan women: Mohsen’s Kandahar, followed a Canadian immigrant returning to the country to search for her sister; Samira’s At Five in the Afternoon, centred on a young woman who goes to school against her father’s wishes. Many of these films made an international impact, but local activity seems to have waned in recent years, leaving the field open for US-made movies like The Kite Runner, or misjudged comedies like Tina Fey’s Whiskey Tango Foxtrot and Bill Murray’s Rock The Kasbah. Ellis did not visit Afghanistan until after she had written The Breadwinner, Twomey did not go there at all, and the story is set 18 years ago, during which time much has changed in Kabul. But both took great pains to get things right, which primarily involved talking to a lot of people. “It takes over a year to create a storyboard for an animated feature,” says Twomey. “During that time we had hundreds of discussions with Afghan people from different areas, perspectives, ethnic groups, people who left at different times, so you can get all those discussions inform the film. I was fairly open all the way along to being corrected.” Another key informant was Jolie, who set up girls’ schools in Kabul over a decade ago, and was an encouraging presence throughout the process. If the result is a sort of generalised, non-specific portrayal, that’s all the better, says Twomey. “With animation you are always abstracting: you’re abstracting the human face, abstracting the performances, the design, what audiences pay attention to. You’re not being absolutely specific.” Even Parvana’s ethnicity is deliberately broad, says Twomey, which means people from Afghanistan’s many ethnicities can identify with her, not to mention foreign audiences. Deborah Ellis agrees, saying the aim was to find a common humanity rather than being scrupulously specific: “There’s so much that’s universal: we don’t want to be beaten by people, we want to have access to some kind of economic power so that we can make choices about what we want to do with our lives, we want enough food and stable housing, and we want to be able to raise our children safely to adulthood. And if you throw in there the possibility of being able to explore our interests, develop our skills – that’s pretty universal stuff.” The other universal theme is being female in a male-dominated world. Life in Ireland or Canada might not quite compare to Afghanistan, but in film-making especially, the gender imbalances are still glaring. “As a female film director I get asked every day how it’s different to being a male film director,” says Twomey. “What’s interesting to me is, it’s a constant reminder that I am a female. I get up in the morning and I don’t see myself as female; I just see myself as Norah. And I very much wanted Parvana to have that same thing: it doesn’t matter whether she has long hair or short hair, whether she is wearing a dress or her brother’s clothes, she is still who she is, and that goes beyond her gender. How she’s perceived outside of that is a different matter. Girls no matter where they are respond to that idea, because we all see ourselves from the inside out. We don’t see the boxes others want to place us inside.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/23/liverpool-mohamed-salah-real-madrid-jurgen-klopp-alexander-arnold-marcelo","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T10:37:18Z","webTitle":"Liverpool face key call over how to use Mohamed Salah against Real Madrid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/23/liverpool-mohamed-salah-real-madrid-jurgen-klopp-alexander-arnold-marcelo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/23/liverpool-mohamed-salah-real-madrid-jurgen-klopp-alexander-arnold-marcelo","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool face key call over how to use Mohamed Salah against Real Madrid","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nothing, perhaps, should give Liverpool such heart ahead of Saturday’s Champions League final as Bayern Munich’s first goal against Real Madrid in the second leg of their semi-final. Nothing dramatic happens. Franck Ribéry turns in from the left flank and plays an unremarkable low pass in to Robert Lewandowski in a central position on the edge of the box. The ball bounces up in front of the Polish striker and his first touch as a result takes him away from goal. He is able, though, to shield the ball and, as Sergio Ramos decides to sit off, Lewandowski has time to work the ball wide to Thomas Müller who is, bafflingly, in 15 yards of space, out on the touchline, roughly level with the edge of the box. Marcelo, the Madrid left-back, has been drawn into the centre, tucking in as though anticipating that Lewandowski might allow Ribéry’s pass to run across his body and then turn Ramos. That much is reasonable. What is not is what then happens. Marcelo must have been aware of Müller’s presence. Müller is, after all, his primary concern. As soon as Lewandowski’s touch took him away from goal and Ramos didn’t lunge in (and nobody can blame Marcelo for thinking that he might), Marcelo should have been closing down the space. Instead, he dropped back, five yards behind the defensive line, and only then moved left to shut Müller down. By then it was probably too late, although Marcelo dawdled, hanging back in a no man’s land when a sprint might still have pressured the cross. Ramos, slightly half-heartedly, did cut out the cross at the near post, but his indecision knocked the ball down for Joshua Kimmich, who scored. Marcelo is perhaps the finest attacking left-back in the world. That deal that took him from Fluminense to Madrid in 2007 for around £5m may, pound for pound, be the greatest the club has completed. In the majority of the games they play, Marcelo is perfect for Madrid. He works up and down the line. He is quick. His touch is superb. He can cross. He scores a couple of goals a season. The only problem comes when he has to defend. Most of the time he doesn’t have to, but he surely will in Kiev. If Mohamed Salah is gifted the sort of space on Saturday that Müller was in that second leg, and if he produces anything like the sort of form he was showing a month ago, Liverpool will devastate Madrid on that flank. Normally, that would be enough to give them a clear edge, but this is anything but a normal game. None of the usual rules seem to apply. Nothing Trent Alexander-Arnold did in Rome was quite as eye-catching as Marcelo’s dilatoriness for that first Bayern goal, but equally the way Stephan El Shaarawy exposed him in the second leg will have not have gone unnoticed by Madrid. In part, of course, that’s because Salah was exempted from defensive duties that night, seemingly instructed to remain high up the pitch and occupy the space behind Aleksandar Kolarov so that every time Liverpool regained possession there was an obvious and dangerous out-ball. Whether Madrid play a 4-3-3 or, more likely, a 4-3-1-2 with Isco tucked behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, Alexander-Arnold will surely be targeted. The question for Jürgen Klopp is then whether to have Salah drop back and help out defensively, or to call Madrid’s bluff and risk them doubling up on the full-back for the potential reward of Salah constantly in space high up the pitch behind Marcelo. In most games it would be enough to say the battle on that flank would be decisive. But here it feels inadequate. Dani Carvajal did return, after a month’s absence, to play the full 90 minutes against Villarreal on the final day of the league season, which means he, rather than the converted winger Lucas Vázquez, will play at right-back. But if there is any doubt about his fitness it will be sorely tested by the pace of Sadio Mané, particularly if Andy Robertson can get up to support him – which he should be able to do if Madrid play a 4-3-1-2 and focus on trying to expose Alexander-Arnold on the other flank. And then there’s the question of the centre. Ramos is a fine defender in one-on-one situations, but how will he and Raphaël Varane cope with Roberto Firmino dropping deep, leaving them with space to mark until Salah and Mané dart into it? A repeated problem for Liverpool under Klopp has been the lack of protection afforded their back four when they lose compactness and space opens up in front of it. The nature of their pressing game means there is no natural holding player to sit in. That is a major concern and one that Isco, tucked behind two forwards, could be ideally placed to exploit. Everywhere on the pitch, it seems, on both sides, there are defensive flaws that might be exploited. And that’s what makes this final so hard to read. It’s not just that either side could win, it’s that either side could win by a wide margin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/23/talking-horses-john-gosden-on-course-to-challenge-aidan-obrien-dominance-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T10:13:35Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Dettori in surprise Derby booking for Hazapour at Epsom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/23/talking-horses-john-gosden-on-course-to-challenge-aidan-obrien-dominance-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/23/talking-horses-john-gosden-on-course-to-challenge-aidan-obrien-dominance-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Dettori in surprise Derby booking for Hazapour at Epsom","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tony Paley: Frankie Dettori has been booked to ride Hazapour in the Derby, a surprise move ahead of next week’s Epsom Classic. The Dermot Weld-trained colt, the fourth favourite for the Derby at around 12-1, won the the Derrinstown Stakes, the premier Derby trial in Ireland, at Leopardstown earlier this month. Hazapour’s impressive success that day was secured under Declan McDonogh, but Weld has booked Dettori, whose retained trainer John Gosden has a Derby contender in Roaring Lion, owned by Qatar Racing Ltd who will call on the services of their main rider Oisin Murphy. Hazapour hails from the same family as the 2016 Derby winner Harzand also trained by Weld, who is currently without stable jockey Pat Smullen, who has taken time off for health reasons. Dettori’s agent, Ray Cochrane, said: “I can confirm Frankie rides Mr Weld’s horse in the Derby. It’s a great ride to get. He looked really impressive in winning the Derrinstown, which is always the best trial in Ireland. He looks an exciting horse.” Dettori has won the Derby twice, on Authorized in 2007 and Golden Horn in 2015. He was quoted in the press two days ago that he was available for a Derby ride. Gosden can challenge O’Brien in trainers’ battle Aidan O’Brien is, inevitably, the strong favourite to retain the UK trainer’s title, which he won for the sixth time last season while also setting a new record for Group or Grade One wins in a calendar year. O’Brien’s overall dominance, though, has somewhat overshadowed John Gosden’s rise to unchallenged pre-eminence among domestic stables, and the hot novice stakes event which opens the card at Yarmouth on Wednesday offers another reminder that in Britain at least, all the power seems to be coalescing in Gosden’s Newmarket yard. Gosden, who was bidding on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin operation, was the underbidder when a Scat Daddy juvenile out of the mare Madera Dancer was knocked down for 900,000gns at Tattersalls’ Craven Breeze-Up sale in April. Stephen Hillen, the bloodstock agent who saw him off with the winning bid, said afterwards that he had made the purchase “for a client who wishes to stay anonymous,” adding that “he will be staying in the UK”. Two months later, and with the name Legends Of War, the colt in question makes his racecourse debut today in the colours of Qatar Racing – and trained by John Gosden, who is also responsible for Qatar Racing’s Roaring Lion, the second-favourite for the Derby. Gosden’s ability to attract horses from so many high-powered owners and somehow keep them all happy is impressive, and has been a key part of his rise to domestic supremacy. If it can be maintained, the sheer scale of his operation means that he could yet mount a serious challenge to O’Brien in this year’s title race, with a mix of quality and huge quantity threatening to overwhelm his rival’s prize-money haul from a relative handful of top events. Most of the big Newmarket yards have a runner in the race at Yarmouth and the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot could well be the next step for the winner. Legends Of War is the early favourite, but far from the only runner with an impressive pedigree or price tag. Roger Varian’s San Donato (2.20), who cost £500,000 as a yearling, qualifies on both counts, though this is really a race to watch with an eye to the future. Call Out Loud (4.25) could get an easy time of it on the lead in the seven-furlong handicap later on the card, while Tanasoq (4.05) and Star Cracker look like the pick of the prices as Flat racing returns to Ayr. Birds Of Prey (7.25) finished strongly on his first outing for Paul Nicholls after being bought from John Oxx’s stable in Ireland and can improve the trainer’s excellent record with his daughter Megan in the saddle when he runs at Kempton this evening. Sister Sibyl (3.15) should also go well on the jumps card at Warwick."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/23/climate-change-will-make-rice-less-nutritious","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T18:00:30Z","webTitle":"Climate change 'will make rice less nutritious'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/23/climate-change-will-make-rice-less-nutritious","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/23/climate-change-will-make-rice-less-nutritious","fields":{"headline":"Climate change 'will make rice less nutritious'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Rice will become less nutritious as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise, potentially jeopardising the health of the billions of people who rely on the crop as their main source of food, new research suggests. Scientists have found that exposing rice to the levels of carbon dioxide that are expected in the atmosphere before the end of the century results in the grain containing lower levels of protein, iron and zinc, as well as reduced levels of a number of B vitamins. “About two billion people rely on rice as a primary food source and among those that are the poorest, often the consumption of rice in terms of their daily calories is over 50%,” said Dr Lewis Ziska, a co-author of the research from the United States department of agriculture. “Anything that impacts rice in terms of its nutritional quality is going to have an impact.” While higher levels of carbon dioxide have previously been linked to lower levels of certain nutrients, such as proteins, in various crops, the study is the first time researchers have also looked at the impact on vitamins. Writing in the journal Science Advances, researchers report how they explored the impact of increasing carbon dioxide levels on rice by conducting experiments on 18 different types of the crop at sites in China and Japan between 2010 and 2014. The rice was grown in paddy fields, with large octagonal ring-structures installed above the crops. These rings were either supplied with carbon dioxide, or not. The concentration of carbon dioxide the plants were exposed to was monitored at the centre of each ring, and the rice produced by each crop was collected and analysed. The results reveal that crops that were exposed to higher levels of carbon dioxide were on average less nutritious, regardless of the country they were grown in, containing about 10% less protein, 8% less iron and 5% less zinc than rice grown under current levels of carbon dioxide. What’s more, levels of vitamins B1, B2, B5 and B9 also fell, with the latter dropping on average by more than 30%. By contrast, levels of vitamin E rose. Ziska said these differences might be linked to whether the various vitamins and nutrients contain nitrogen, with those that do typically seeing a drop in levels as carbon dioxide rises and those without seeing a rise. But with some of the varieties of rice apparently showing little change in levels of certain nutrients, the researchers say it might be possible to find or develop types of rice that will remain nutritious as the climate changes. A drop in the nutritiousness of rice as a result of climate change could have profound health effects, particularly for those who rely most heavily on the crop, with the authors warning that it could affect early childhood development and worsen the impact of diseases including malaria. Among the countries expected to be worst hit by a lower nutritional content of rice would be Bangladesh and Madagascar. Ziska said it was crucial to do further research into why levels of carbon dioxide affect nutrient levels, suggesting that it may be because the crops grow faster. He also stressed the need for research on other crops. “Many important cereals like wheat as well as staples like potatoes may be impacted by this as well,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/28/midsomer-murders-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T09:00:49Z","webTitle":"Frozen gateaux!

Maltby said she would cover most of her own legal costs and had donated £5,500 to the legal fund Time’s Up, which was inspired by the #MeToo movement for women experiencing sexual harassment. The piece, written by the Daily Mail’s Andrew Pierce, was published in the newspaper shortly after she made the allegations against Green last year and has now been removed from MailOnline. The dispute has been settled without admission of fault. Maltby is understood to have been prepared to go to court over the claims made in the Pierce article and any court case could have involved No 10 staff and senior members of the Conservative party being called to give evidence. Her original claim against Green, that he hinted he could advance her career in exchange for an affair, was judged “plausible” by a Cabinet Office inquiry. However, Green ultimately lost his job after admitting that he had lied about the fact that pornography was found on his parliamentary computer during a police investigation in 2008. The inquiry also examined claims that Green or his allies influenced the Mail article, which called Maltby “one very pushy lady”. Green and his aides have strongly denied they contributed in any way to the attacks on Maltby. In her original piece for the Times, which prompted the inquiry, Maltby said Green had fleetingly touched her knee during a meeting in a Waterloo pub in 2015 to talk about her political career, as he mentioned that his own wife was “very understanding”. Maltby, who writes regularly for the Times, said Green also sent her a suggestive text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper. In his resignation letter, Green said he did not recognise the events Maltby described in her article, “but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and for this I apologise”. Maltby told the Guardian: “Like many of the women who’ve spoken this year about abuse of power, I only felt able to speak publicly about inappropriate behaviour at Westminster because I had a strong media platform and was lucky enough to be able to afford legal representation. “Although my payout by [DMG Media, the Mail’s owner] represents their payment towards my costs, I have decided that the money is better spent supporting women who don’t have my advantages.” Samantha Rennie, executive director at Rosa, the UK-wide fund which manages the Time’s Up fund, welcomed Maltby’s £5,500 donation. “We can’t end the culture of impunity without generous people like Kate who inspire others to give,” she said. “Grants from the Justice and Equality Fund will be made to support organisations with a track record of success in tackling harassment and abuse, and of supporting people who have suffered it.” Maltby said the fund would “particularly focus on those less privileged … working-class women, women of colour, and those with other intersecting disadvantages” who were less able to face the brunt of harassment in the workplace. “It’s not enough for prominent white women to speak out against harassment from our relative safety. It is essential that we give tangible financial support to women who take greater financial risks in challenging power,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/24/zama-review-lucrecia-martel-daniel-gimenez-cacho","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T07:00:46Z","webTitle":"Zama review – desire and despair at the end of the world | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/24/zama-review-lucrecia-martel-daniel-gimenez-cacho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/24/zama-review-lucrecia-martel-daniel-gimenez-cacho","fields":{"headline":"Zama review – desire and despair at the end of the world","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Horror and despair hover just out of the frame, or below the surface, or behind the curtain, of Lucrecia Martel’s mysterious and dreamlike movie Zama. It’s a film that returns Martel to her themes of guilt, sex and shame – her first picture, in fact, since the enigmatic The Headless Woman 10 years ago. But Zama, with its eerie andante tempo and period setting, gives her ideas a new exalted platform, a new theatrical and formal grandeur. It’s the story of Diego de Zama, an 18th-century administrator in the service of imperial Spain, whose courageous exploits in battle long ago won him a sinecure as a magistrate in the brutally remote outpost of what is now Asunción, on the Paraguay River. Now he waits endlessly, frantically, desperately for news of the more glamorous and prestigious posting he once assumed would quickly follow and that would reunite him with his wife and children, left behind years before in Buenos Aires. Zama is played by Daniel Giménez Cacho with a perplexed hauteur, like a caged eagle. He is utterly alone, with a mediocre stipend, and nothing to do but cultivate a gloomy sexual fascination with the local women and capricious white aristocratic ladies of his own circle; his sexual brooding is a kind of anaesthetic for the panic that would otherwise overwhelm him. Zama must also participate – jadedly, diffidently – in the official duties of state violence and racism: enforcing the enslavement of the indigenous peoples. As an Americano – that is, someone born in the Americas and not Spain – Zama suspects that he himself is regarded as a second-rater in the service. Is this why he has been forgotten, left behind in this burning swamp? He doesn’t know, and has no way of finding out. It’s a waking nightmare that is part existential paralysis, part erotic reverie. Martel has adapted the 1956 novel by the Argentinian author Antonio di Benedetto, who has been rediscovered in the English-speaking world since Esther Allen published her translation for the NYRB Classics edition in 2000, with a fascinating introduction wondering whether the book’s languorous evocation of official cruelty foreshadowed Di Benedetto’s own imprisonment and torture at the hands of the Argentinian junta 20 years later, in the 70s. Zama is a story that obviously has something of Beckett and Kafka, but creates worryingly plausible real-world evocations of their cosmic loneliness and bureaucratic imprisonment. And its increasingly important and toxic plot development is Borgesian. The colonial officers, worried about their patent inability to keep the peace, are terrified by rumours of a certain all-powerful and legendary bandit Vicuña Porto. Eventually, out of pure frustrated rage, Zama will join an ad hoc military expedition pledged to capture and kill this spectral figure – only to suspect that he is closer to hand than anyone had imagined. Is Vicuña simply the ghost of their own colonial exhaustion and disgust? Martel creates deeply strange tableaux of longing and alienation. Zama furtively lurks behind a rock, peeping at naked village women taking a mud bath. When one cries “Voyeur!” and chases him, he slaps her – a gesture of arrogance and spite made more pathetic by the unavailability of that married patrician beauty he is hopelessly courting: Luciana Piñares De Luenga, terrifically played by Almodóvar regular Lola Dueñas. The difference between their dreary parochial setting and the fanatically imagined refinement of Spain is ever-present. In one of these spartan salons, Luciana murmurs: “Europe is best remembered by those who were never there.” The movie forcefully creates the colonial administrator’s stunned disgust and suppressed dismay: Martel’s Zama is not so far from Herzog’s Don Lope De Aguirre – or closer maybe to Coppola’s Capt Willard, journeying deep into the jungle on the orders of an imperial power. But Martel’s movie finds a emphasis different from Di Benedetto’s book. Her focus is not just on Zama’s gradual and pitiable breakdown, but on the violence that is crushing everyone. There is a different kind of orientalism at work here – an occidentalism, perhaps, an imperialism that has exoticised the peoples of the Americas to the west. Their bodies are fetishised: either bound up and chained, prior to beating and torture, or naked and exposed, in a way that discloses Zama’s horror of transgression, of giving way to his desires that may bind him here for ever. Zama is left with his tragicomic white man’s burden. A heatstruck world of desire and defeat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/25/mckellen-playing-the-part-review-ian-mckellen-documentary-joe-stephenson","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:00:45Z","webTitle":"McKellen: Playing the Part review – engaging portrait of a wizard Shakespearean actor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/25/mckellen-playing-the-part-review-ian-mckellen-documentary-joe-stephenson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/25/mckellen-playing-the-part-review-ian-mckellen-documentary-joe-stephenson","fields":{"headline":"McKellen: Playing the Part review – engaging portrait of a wizard Shakespearean actor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In an outtake over the credits, Ian McKellen jokes that this documentary about his life, career and LGBT activism is a bit of an obituary. As it happens he’s already sorted out his funeral. “Well,” he says, with a waggle of one of those owlish eyebrows, “I had an evening to spare … the most enjoyable evening.” I can’t think of anyone I’d rather spend 90 minutes listening to than the subject of Joe Stephenson’s film. The format is simple: an audience with Sir Ian beefed up by archive footage and dramatised scenes of his childhood (beautifully acted by 15-year-old Milo Parker). McKellen occasionally slips into the part of twinkly super-cool gay uncle that he tends to play in interviews these days. But mostly he’s thoughtful and self-reflective (and not at all gossipy about his theatrical chums, disappointingly). What we essentially get here is a profile of his success. McKellen believes that his drive to make it as an actor came as a boy from having to repress his true self as gay – at a time when homosexuality was illegal and impossible to talk about. He speaks about his mother’s death when he was 12 from breast cancer. McKellen came out in his 40s during the Aids crisis and campaigned against the Conservative government’s vicious anti-gay Section 28. In archive we see him take down an establishment duffer with a killer combination of charm and cold, hard facts. The thrilling clips here of his big Shakespearean roles are worth the price of a ticket alone. He says the luckiest thing that ever happened to him was becoming a film actor in the late afternoon of his career. About his film work, he calls Gandalf “a show-off” and there’s cracking footage of him being witheringly polite to Peter Jackson who’s giving him bland direction.

The figure is correct; it is just that Liverpool’s total of five is dwarfed by the Spanish club’s dozen. Not many teams can make Liverpool feel inferior in Europe but Real Madrid can. The current holders of the trophy have a habit of making everyone feel inferior. No one else is in double figures. No one else has won back-to-back titles in either the original European Cup knockout format or the modern Champions League era. It is true that Real’s near-impossible numbers are largely thanks to the dream start they had in European competition, when the side of Alfredo Di Stefano and (later) Ferenc Puskas won the first five editions of the European Cup before the rest of the continent got its act together, though the idea that the club’s potency is based on ancient history does not bear scrutiny. The cold fact Liverpool supporters must face is that their opponents are preparing for their fourth final in five years. Not only that, the previous three have all been won. Liverpool are fond of the boast that they have won the European title five times, and in terms of English football they have every right to be. Their successes of 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005 put them easily at the top of the list of achievers from this country. Their nearest challengers are Manchester United with three, Nottingham Forest (still) with two and Chelsea finally managed it in 2012. Apart from Real Madrid only Milan have won more (seven), and with five wins spread over three decades Liverpool find themselves level with Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Yet should Real Madrid win in Kiev it would confirm a dominance once thought unattainable in the modern version of the contest. Four wins in five seasons would be arguably more attention-grabbing. Until last season no team had been able to win back-to-back Champions League titles. In 24 years of intense competition the rejigged format had produced a different winner every time. Not even Barcelona at their most brilliant managed to win the European Cup then do it again the following season. The old patterns of success, which had seen distinct periods of dominance by outstanding sides such as Ajax (three consecutive wins between 1971 and 1973), Bayern Munich (three in a row between 1974 and 1976), or Internazionale, Forest and Milan winning it back to back in the mid-60s, late 70s and late 80s respectively, were thought to have been consigned to history. Uefa must have been quite pleased with itself for devising a competition so difficult to crack but now the possibility is being contemplated of a team who have already won two in a row making it three. Should that happen, and even if it does not happen, Real Madrid deserve enormous credit for consistency. The talk on Merseyside is that this might be Liverpool’s year. Yet there is a recognition within that expression that under the modern format even a club with a rich European pedigree might manage a tilt at the ultimate title only once in a while – not every year certainly and not for a club like Liverpool or, from the look of things, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Barcelona or Bayern Munich either. All these are now relative strangers to European Cup finals whereas Real Madrid are beginning to feel at home. There might have been a 12-year gap between the Zinedine Zidane volley in Glasgow that earned a ninth European title in 2002 and the victory over Atlético Madrid in Lisbon that took Carlo Ancelotti’s side into double figures, but victories over Atlético and Juventus in the last couple of finals have firmly re-established Real Madrid’s pre-eminence. Liverpool’s task in Kiev is to find a way of prospering against the savviest team around. History counts for only so much but the record books show that Liverpool have been in two European Cup finals since the competition was reorganised in 1993. They won one, famously, in 2005, and lost the next to Milan in Athens two years later. Real Madrid have appeared in six finals over the same period and won the lot. The acceleration over the past few years means Real Madrid actually have a higher success rate – six wins in 25 attempts – under the new format than the old one, where despite their blistering start they added only the 1966 title to their initial five to record six wins over 37 seasons. So in one sense Cristiano Ronaldo and his pals are very much the Real deal, a trophy machine even more efficient than the original, something that will be glaringly obvious should they prevail on Saturday. Of the 15 in which they have competed, they have lost only three. Adam and the Ants were at No 1 with Stand and Deliver the last time Real Madrid lost a European Cup final, Bob Champion had just won the Grand National on Aldaniti and England was about to come to a halt for a royal wedding. It was 37 years ago in other words but their opponents in 1981 were Liverpool."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/25/this-is-congo-review-documentary-daniel-mccabe","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T09:00:43Z","webTitle":"This Is Congo review – distressing story of a humanitarian crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/25/this-is-congo-review-documentary-daniel-mccabe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/25/this-is-congo-review-documentary-daniel-mccabe","fields":{"headline":"This Is Congo review – distressing story of a humanitarian crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Photographer-turned-filmmaker Daniel McCabe’s This Is Congo feels like the documentary equivalent of a long read about the humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The film’s potted history in 92 minutes (delving into the complexity of the DRC’s colonial history, post-independence power struggles, foreign meddling and corruption) will no doubt frustrate experts as superficial. But here’s a necessary reminder of a conflict that has gone on for so long that the world seems to have disengaged and moved on to other war zones. McCabe interviews two soldiers; one of them a high-ranking officer, the other a charismatic young colonel who boasts that his soldiers have been trained in human rights. (Earlier in the film we watch a few of them beat a man with a belt). Bibianne, known to everyone as Mama Romance, is a single mother who keeps her kids in education by illegally smuggling gemstones. Hakiza Nyantaba is a tailor who for the sixth time has fled fighting in his village, carrying whatever he could grab. We don’t hear from women or girls who’ve been victims of sexual violence, which is widespread in the DRC. There is some deeply distressing footage here, shot on the frontline of a 2012/2013 conflict between the army and a rebel group. Elsewhere, in a scene filmed in a camp for displaced people, a man carries a child’s coffin above his head – so small it needs just one pair of hands to bear the weight. At the graveside, a priest recites the usual line about a “time to be born” and “time to die”. Now? This is the time – in this place? From cholera? No wonder a solider says the “our country belongs to hell”. And now, on top of everything, we learn this week the country is suffering a new Ebola outbreak. A difficult, depressing watch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/23/battered-chip-shacks-of-brussels-in-taste-tussle","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T14:34:35Z","webTitle":"Brussels' battered chip shacks to get revamp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/23/battered-chip-shacks-of-brussels-in-taste-tussle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/23/battered-chip-shacks-of-brussels-in-taste-tussle","fields":{"headline":"Brussels' battered chip shacks to get revamp","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The frite, or frieten, as they say in the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium, is a national institution. But given the skinny chip’s veneration, whether enjoyed with a dab of mayonnaise or taken au naturel, the ramshackle appearance of many of the frietkots from which they are dispensed around Brussels has been a source of shame for the city council. The embarrassment has prompted officials in the capital to commission a prize-winning architect to rebuild 10 of the chip shacks, creating shiny, ecologically friendly, shrines to frites. The aim is not only to attract tourists but serve and satisfy the city’s residents. But it is not proving an easy task. While some people are pained by the existing frietkots many have expressed their deep unease at this leap into the future. Thomas Hick, the architect behind the new-look frietkots, said: “It was a contentious issue at the start and we hesitated in taking part in the competition to design them. The frietkots are old and ramshackle and it’s something we like about Brussels. No fuss. As opposed to the French way – the Belgians are more raw in the way they eat frites.” Hick said he took the popular discontent as a challenge. “We wanted to find a solution to this contradiction. We asked, what are these frietkots about? Why are they like they way they are? They are not about architecture, but they are about function, and the signage was the most important part, that’s what gives them their identity.” Belgian passions have been stirred by the frite in the past. A suggestion last year from the European commission that friteries might want to blanche their potatoes before frying to prevent formation of a carcinogenic compound was met by claims from a tourist minister that the EU was committing a crime against the people. Devotees swear by the double frying of bintje potatoes in beef or horse fat to achieve an ideal combination of succulent centre and crispy exterior. Hick understood the perils of meddling. Inspired by the 1972 book Learning from Las Vegas, (by Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour) an architectural bible that urges his trade to dispense with the grand and appeal to local tastes, he kept the standard box shape of the much loved friteries. The characteristic awning and glass bar have also remained the same. The facades, however, will be mirrored, and the neon signage and colour of the interior tiles will reflect each shack’s local area. The €50,000-a-shack scheme also makes space for solar panels on the roof to provide energy for the signage (it is more ecological to stick with gas for the fryers), and there will be a rain-harvesting system that collects water in a tank at the back for washing down the frietkot. A bench may be incorporated in the shack, though this feature has also met some resistance. “The owners are bit concerned that drunk people might be tempted to hang around a bit too long,” Hick said. “But these are important communal places too. Some of them are in places where it might not be safe to walk at night and they offer security.” The frietkots are owned by the vendors, while the council owns the sites. After the demolition and reconstruction work, the shacks will be owned by the council and let at no extra cost to the former owners. It is hoped all 10 shacks will be complete by 2019. Officials at Brussels city council have suggested that the new frietkots could, in time, acquire the resonance of London’s red telephone booths. Hick, whose firm, Studio MOTO, is also designing the culinary garden at the National Botanical Garden, in Meise, said: “No, I realise that on one hand it could be something iconic, but the Belgians are a bit sick of being branded as being all about chocolate, beer and frites. There is more to the country than that. We are also a creative country and we are forwarding looking. I’m not taking offence at that, in some ways it is a compliment, but it was certainly not our plan.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/25/show-dogs-review-will-arnett-ludacris","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Show Dogs review – canine caper that's as ruff as they come","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/25/show-dogs-review-will-arnett-ludacris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/25/show-dogs-review-will-arnett-ludacris","fields":{"headline":"Show Dogs review – canine caper that's as ruff as they come","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Should you require further evidence of western cultural decadence, consider the staggering hours moviemakers have logged filming dogs doing things dogs aren’t generally inclined to do: playing competitive sports (Air Bud, Soccer Dog), seeking Simon Cowell’s approval (Pudsey), rolling over for second billing behind long-eclipsed humanoid stars. Show Dogs hails from that good-cop-dog-cop line that once begat Turner and Hooch and K-9 – but its USP is that the mutts now bark back with (minor) celebrity voices. If your actual dog were this lame, you’d be making ominous arrangements with the vet, not hustling everybody towards the cinema. Director Raja Gosnell has previous with these cinematic chew toys, although there was obvious tail-off even between Scooby Doo (2002) and Beverly Hills Chihuahua (2008). Here, we get a shaggy-looking Will Arnett and Max the rottweiler (voiced by rapper Ludacris), who emerge from the first act’s matted exposition having to enter a Vegas beauty contest so as to apprehend nefarious panda smugglers. Anyway, never mind about the plot, because – look – dogs! Dogs with badges! Farting dogs! Dogs getting bikini waxes! Dogs having their privates inspected! No film in motion picture history can ever have made more fuss about the state of one canine’s anus. Of the handlers, Arnett has the terse air of a man doing anything he can to keep up with his alimony payments; Natasha Lyonne submits to a makeover so comprehensive she’s all but unrecognisable – a smart move on reflection. Mostly, it’s anonymous voices growling unfunny references, very cheaply inserted between the jaws of creatures with no idea of the indignities this production had in store for them. Few will leave Show Dogs feeling shortchanged – it’s as mirthlessly cynical as it looks – but it does suggest we perhaps need a dog equivalent of those movements presently working to make the industry a healthier place. #TimesPup?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/23/giro-ditalia-2018-stage-17-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T15:14:34Z","webTitle":"Giro d'Italia 2018: Elia Viviani wins stage 17 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/23/giro-ditalia-2018-stage-17-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/23/giro-ditalia-2018-stage-17-live","fields":{"headline":"Giro d'Italia 2018: Elia Viviani wins stage 17 – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"You’ll presumably be wanting this. That was hectic stuff, with plenty of action before an excellent sprint strategy from Quickstep in difficult, greasy conditions. Viviani, barring a major accident, has the maglia ciclamino in his grasp. Back to the mountains they go tomorrow, a long ride from Abbiategrasso to Prato Nevoso, which ends with a category one climb almost a mile high after what looks a flat stage. No rest in the Giro, so see you tomorrow. And here’s the General Classification, unchanged from this morning. 1 Simon Yates (66hrs 39:14) 2 Tom Dumoulin (+0:56) 3 Domenico Pozzovivo (+3:11) 4 Chris Froome (+3:50) 5 Thibaut Pinot (+4:19) So, here’s the stage results 1. Elia Viviani, Quickstep 2. Sam Bennett, Bora-Hansgrobe 3. Niccolo Bonifazio, Bahrain–Merida 4. Danny van Poppel, LottoNL–Jumbo 5. Jens Debusschere, Omega Pharma-Lotto Chaos reigned but Quickstep got him home. Sam Bennett got second, having had to come back from a distance out, and with bodies his way. Viviani takes his fourth stage, and surely the purple points jersey is his. Bennett way back. Viviani leads it out.... Viviani has two team-mates for company. Bennett trying to get on his wheel. Quickstep, Viviani’s team are pushing to the front. Sam Bennett is finding himself with some serious company. And here come the puddles.... Swinging round some dangerous looking roundabouts, they are hurtling into the town centre. Simon Yates covered up by his team in the main group. They pass the 3km free zone, so his place at the lead of GC is assured. That may come into force if that rain causes problems. Lammertink surely won’t last long but it’s a valiant effort, this one. Under 5km to go now.... Brambilla sits up, Stybar takes up the pace, but the peloton draws near. And they have a flood at the finish line to deal with, by the looks of things. The peloton catches up but Dutchman Maurits Lammertink has catapulted himself to the front. There’s a breakaway from Gianluca Brambilla with Robert Gesink giving chase. Zdeněk Štybar has joined in, but the gap to the main field is now closing. TV pictures show heavy rain at the finish, but the riders are in the dry. Into the final 10km we go, and an expectant crowd is being washed by summer rain that is probably cooling them, but holds plenty of fears on such a complicated final run-in. The speed of the peloton has produced gaps, with contenders being spat out. This is a breakneck pace now. Sanchez and De Marchi have given up the ghost at the front. And the breakaway is done. This is a winding old road into Iseo, with some punishing hairpin bends, and with that sheen of rain adding grease, these are treacherous moments. Lotto NL, Bora, Quickstep and Michelton-Scott are the teams driving the pack. Rain now coming down, which adds peril to a sprint on the best of days. De Marchi and Sanchez trying to stay away, but the gap is down to 25 seconds. Under 20km to go now.... Luis Leon Sanchez has made multiple attempts to get clear, but now must give up the ghost. So, the field has already had one look at the finish line, which may help the sprint strategy of those chasing the stage win. Meanwhile, De Marchi is sat up in the breakaway group. Their fun looks to be over for the day. Soon it will be time to freewheel home. Poels has given up the ghost and slows down so his Sky team-mates can catch him up. One lap of Iseo to go now, as the tifosi gets more than look at the riders. There are 23km left. Yes, that leading group is now shedding seconds at a rate. Poels’ hopes of going up the GC look to have vanished. The crowds are building up on the road to Lake Iseo, and the gap is dropping fast. It’s 48 seconds at the moment. It looks like a sprint finish is in order. Viviani v Bennett: It’s on. And here they are: Rob Stringer emails in: “John, I’m on honeymoon in Italy and my delighted wife can’t believe her luck that I’ve brought her to the Giro at Lake Iseo!! Any help from your readers how I can save my marriage so early would be appreciated!” Many congratulations Mr and Mrs Stringer (should she have taken Rob’s name). Rob has sent a picture of the happy couple at the finish line. That reminds me: who was the football manager who took his new wife to a reserves game? There is nothing calm about race day in this year’s Giro. It’s been helter skelter stuff from the first day. No time to sit up in the saddle. There is a second chasing group forming ahead of the peloton, and at the back, the likes of Aru, Bennett and Van Poppel looked to be dropping but have had to chase back. Petrol used up for Bennett? Viviani has taken two points in an intermediate sprint in the meantime, as he increases his stranglehold on the purple jersey. That leading Poels group is still 1’ 24” clear. There seems to be a discussion taking place between the breakers. Poels is rather too high on GC for those thinking of their team, though at ten minutes back he is not too much of a threat for the likes of Simon Yates. With the final circuit approaching, it’s time to think strategically. Dumloulin also had to drop back to the team cars, but he’s calmly enough making his way back the main field. Dare we say that this is something of a lull? The leaders are 1’ 28” clear. That’s a decent gap but there is still 45km to go. My mistake below - Viviani is with Quickstep, Sam Bennett is with Bora. Talking of Viviani, he’s had a mechanical, and needed to drop back to get his bike fixed. A temporary panic, and Viviani returns to the field. Added to the confusion was that this all happened at a feed station. Bora’s domestiques looking for others to do the work, and Mitchtelton-Scott are taking up the chase. Wout Poels is pushing on the breakaway which is up to 34 seconds. The gap at the front is around 20 seconds, and the rain has gone, to be replaced by what looks like a significant temperature. Muggy, as the English say, though not in the Danny Dyer meaning of the word. David Alderton emails: “This has been a most exciting race so far, and Yates has been superb. He has ridden with both style and panache, qualities needed in a GT rider above any other. Although I was sceptical of his ability to maintain the effort, he is making a great fist of it, especially with yesterday’s result. The competition seems to be fading away, and I now think he can really do this.” I have to agree, and I think most of the field do. Perhaps most of all Sunweb and Sky. Let’s see in those mountains, though. Some wild fantasising from a, er, “Malicious A” on the Twitter: “It is raining and being over 4 minutes adrift means that Pinot has a great opportunity to get a stomp on so we can experience the thrilling heroics of him riding himself back into contention before winning overall.” That would be up there with Nibali in 2016. This latest climb is uncategorised, but looks tough enough to me. The riders are snaking up through heavy crowds. Bora, the team of Viviani, are leading the main group, with that final sprint in mind. That breakaway looks to comes to naught, and the peloton is back together. Just over 60km to go now...but away they go again. Poels, Sanchez, Hermans and De Marchi, the latter the attack specialist of this Giro. Rodolfo Torres has also gone with them. Here’s an example of just how fast they go in the Grand Tours, some 2009 amateur footage from the Lago de Iseo, where they finish up today. That blur on the shore is the cyclists. Rain absolutely hacking down now, and that’s potentially bad news. They are racing down to the flat section, at least, but they are racing at almost 60km an hour. Tom Dumoulin is sat amidships of the peloton, with no team-mates around him, but looks comfortable enough. Yates’ Mitchelton-Scott team are marking down the breakaway on this fast descent. Some unwelcome rain is also falling. That’s never welcome on the way down. The descent from the big climb of the day has begun. The gap is 24 seconds to Yates’ main group. Sanchez is amid an eight-man group, which includes Wout Poels and Kenny Elissonde of Team Sky. Has Froome decided he wants team-mates to just go out there any enjoy it, or is there another strategy at hand? There are gaps appearing in the field. With a long descent to follow, the expectation is that all will come back together, but plenty of fuel has been used up by all those breaks and now this climb. Luis Leon Sanchez is having another dig at getting into a break. The rest of the field won’t thank him for that. After all that chaos, now for a big climb. This is a category 3, up to Lodrino. The field is back together now, so this could be the launchpad for further attacks. Thanks to Tim Young for his prompt answer to Richard’s question below: “Think that Juan José Cobo beat Froome into second place with win bonuses in the 2011 Vuelta.” Yes, imagine if Froome hadn’t had to play super-domestique for Brad Wiggins. Cobo won by 13 seconds, though was playing a similar role to support Denis Menchov himself. Looks like Viviani didn’t add to his points lead over Bennett in the purple jersey chase. Viviani has 237 points to Bennett’s 197. Viviani was the sprint winner from the main group, but if he got any points from that, it was only a single one. An intermediate sprint awaits, but the current stage leaders, Marco Frapporti and Darwin Atapuma, will be taking the main points from Viviani and Bennett. Question to the floor from Richard Powell: “Is it still feasible that Yates wins with a slower overall time due to his bonuses? And has this ever happened on a Grand Tour before?” Currently trying to recall if the 1989 Tour, that infamous eight seconds between LeMond and Laurent Fignon, included time bonuses. Any help appreciated, and other examples welcome. At the front of the field, France’s Quentin Jauregui, Italy’s Mattia Cattaneo and Krist Neilands of Latvia are our three-man leadership group. The jiggery pokery behind the group behind them and those chasing that down might give them leeway to get away for a while. Who else is in the second chasing group? Miguel Angel Lopez is pedalling like thunder alongside Froome. That’s bad news for the white jersey holder. Meanwhile, Froome seems to be having one good day followed by another bad day at the moment. Should he actually be allowed to ride this year’s Tour de France, that’s not a good sign. Andy McGrath, from the excellent Rouleur mag, emails in, to tell this tale. You’ll like this, John. A bloke in New England called Simon Yates has been getting hundreds of Tweets of encouragement intended for the Giro leader due to his Twitter username. An extension of the Chris Hoy/Chris Foy confusion years ago. Some official accounts have made this mistake. And here’s the other Simon Yates. Up the front, the peloton is catching up the breakaway. Just 12 seconds in it now. But it’s the gap between the chasers that’s intriguing. Yates and Dumoulin, in the leading group of chasers, have distanced a group containing Chris Froome and there’s 15 seconds in it. And this was supposed to be the quiet day. Sam Bennett, in becoming the first ever Irishman to win a Giro stage in 31 years, is almost certainly the best sprinter since the legendary Sean Kelly, these days best known for being a voice on Eurosport. Kelly, who sounds like the most impassive man in show business, was pumping the air in delight at his compatriot’s success. And who won 31 years ago? Stephen Roche. Kelly was the superior one-day racer, perhaps the greatest of his era, but Roche had that amazing 1987. Anyway, here’s Kelly on his old pal. Back in the peloton, there is some early intrigue. Elia Viviani, holding the leading sprinters’ purple jersey, seemed to have fallen off the back but is now at the vanguard. Bora–Hansgrohe’s men were putting in work and looked to be trying to distance the Quickstep man to help out Sam Bennett, who has designs on that purple jersey. The breakaway group is now on the descent. Ok, as expected, there has been a breakaway. The hilly section of today’s course is at the start and there’s a gap of 40 seconds to a sizeable group which includes no GC contenders. The biggest name in there is Spanish veteran Luis León Sánchez, who has been trying to get others to do work. Afternoon, all. This Giro is Simon Yates’ to lose now. And it would be a hell of a surprise if he lost it today, a flattish ride through beauty spots, from the banks of Lake Garda to Lake Iseo in Lombardy. After Tuesday’s time trial, the gaps is 56 seconds, by no means unbridgeable, but there are mountain stages to come this week in which it would be expected that Yates takes more time out of second-placed defending champ Tom Dumloulin, with Domenico Pozzovivo 3’ 11” back on the Dutchman. Chris Froome lurks on 3’ 50” behind, but last night appeared to be dismissive of his chances of repeating the amazing comeback that Vincenzo Nibali pulled off in 2016 when coming back from over four minutes down to steal the race in its final days. Froome’s lack of form suggests he is not in the right shape for such a miracle, and not when Yates has looked almost invulnerable on the climbs. The leader was helped somewhat by a TT yesterday that was not as harsh as expected, with Dumoulin’s Sunweb team a little miffed at its relative ease. So, this one looks a day for the sprinters, with Sam Bennett perhaps seeking a third stage win. The Irishman was dead last up the Zoncolan on Saturday, and rather took the Michael in pulling a series of wheelies up the final climb. His main rival is Elia Viviani, the Italian seeking his fourth stage win. Before that crescendo, expect some cat and mouse stuff between Sunweb, Team Sky and Yates’ Mitchelton-Scott team, who are now expected to ride defensively. And, of course, with possible stage wins now at a premium, expect the breakaway specialists to have an early dig or two."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/23/uk-might-have-to-pay-39bn-brexit-bill-before-trade-deal-agreed","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T11:29:21Z","webTitle":"UK might have to pay £39bn Brexit bill before trade deal agreed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/23/uk-might-have-to-pay-39bn-brexit-bill-before-trade-deal-agreed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/23/uk-might-have-to-pay-39bn-brexit-bill-before-trade-deal-agreed","fields":{"headline":"UK might have to pay £39bn Brexit bill before trade deal agreed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Brexit minister has admitted there are no plans for a legally enforceable link between Britain’s £39bn divorce bill for leaving the European Union and future trade. Suella Braverman, who was previously chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of MPs, suggested that paying the withdrawal bill and any trade deal could be enforced only by a “duty of good faith”. Some MPs on the Brexit committee expressed concerns that parliament would have to vote on the financial deal in the withdrawal agreement this autumn, without first having a legal assurance over what the UK would get in return. Ministers have said they will publish the final departure deal with the EU, which is about 75% agreed, as well as a separate political declaration on the future relationship, in October. The government has always insisted that paying the Brexit bill would be linked to agreeing a future trade deal, but Braverman’s comments cast doubt on whether this would in fact be the case. She insisted the duty of good faith was “more than just words”. The minister, pressed on about a dozen occasions by MPs from all sides on the issue, confirmed that Britain had raised the possibility that the final deal might be conditional in negotiations, but did not reveal what those conditions might be. The Labour committee member Pat McFadden asked her: “Isn’t it the case that we will be agreeing to pay the financial settlement before we have a legal text on the future agreement between the UK and the EU?” Braverman responded: “The withdrawal agreement text has been nearly finalised and agreed, that contains issues relating the financial settlement. At present, it doesn’t contain aspects you talk about on conditionality. “There is agreed a duty of good faith and that is an important aspect of the withdrawal agreement which obliges both parties to cooperate in a way, which means we are working constructively towards a future framework which is mutually beneficial and meets our objectives.” She added: “The prime minister has made very clear that the offer on the financial settlement is made as part of a broader package relating, and in the spirit of our future partnership the two will be connected when we vote in October.” Braverman suggested that if a trade deal with Brussels was not agreed then there was a “very clear possibility” that a renegotiation would take place and “those payments would not be owed”. MPs pointed out that parliament would have already voted on paying the Brexit bill by that point. Britain’s financial obligations are also understood to be heavily front-loaded so the money could already have been paid. Boris Johnson was asked about the issue in Santiago, Chile, where the foreign secretary is on the last leg of his trade tour. He said: “Article 50 makes it absolutely clear that the terms of the withdrawal have to be seen in the context of the future relationship. “And [I’ll] just remind you of the basic fact of all negotiations that is nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” The prime minister’s official spokesman reiterated that sentiment, adding: “We’re clear that we intend to agree the future framework at the same time as the withdrawal agreement ... This means that parliament will vote on the withdrawal agreement at the same time as the terms of our future relationship with the EU.” He suggested that the EU would honour any commitment it had made, legal or otherwise, on the future relationship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/23/pussycat-dolls-sue-daily-mail-over-prostitution-ring-story-kaya-jones","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T12:19:29Z","webTitle":"Pussycat Dolls sue Daily Mail owner over 'prostitution ring' story","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/23/pussycat-dolls-sue-daily-mail-over-prostitution-ring-story-kaya-jones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/23/pussycat-dolls-sue-daily-mail-over-prostitution-ring-story-kaya-jones","fields":{"headline":"Pussycat Dolls sue Daily Mail owner over 'prostitution ring' story","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Girl group Pussycat Dolls are suing the parent company of the Daily Mail, after an article was published in which former member Kaya Jones said the group was a “prostitution ring”, where members were given drugs and “passed around” music industry executives for sex. The lawsuit, filed by the band’s manager, Robin Antin, as well as under the Pussycat Dolls Inc brand name, is citing defamation as a result of the article, published in October 2017. It describes the article as “intentional, reckless and malicious … false and defamatory statements made by a disgruntled, unreliable and biased person looking for her 15 minutes of fame, Kaya Jones, when the defendants knew through their direct prior dealings with plaintiffs, or should have known, with even the most basic check, that Ms Jones was unreliable and her story obviously false”. The Mail Online article published tweets by Jones that made the accusations, and also quoted an interview Jones gave to the website InfoWars that contained further accusations. The UK office of the Daily Mail didn’t comment; the Guardian has contacted the US office for its reaction. Jones joined the Pussycat Dolls in 2003, as they were transferring from being a dance troupe to a pop group, led by frontwoman Nicole Scherzinger. She recorded backing vocals for their debut album but left the group in 2004, before the release of their breakthrough single Don’t Cha. The group went on to score other big hits in Buttons, Jai Ho and Stickwitu across two studio albums, which hit the Top 10 in both the US and UK. There were reports that they were to reform in 2018, with member Kimberly Wyatt telling Comedy Central UK: “We’re reuniting at the end of this year. When I’ve got a dream and an intent, I’m quite relentless at pushing forward and making it happen.” There have been no confirmed tour dates or new material, though, and the lawsuit claims that the news stories impacted on the plans to reform. “One of the central themes of the all-women group is female empowerment,” the claim reads, continuing that the articles “directly impacted the groups reputation in this regard and in turn has caused incalculable damage to any effort to reunite by the group”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/24/following-a-pattern-orla-kielys-life-work-goes-on-show","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T13:01:53Z","webTitle":"Following a pattern: Orla Kiely's life work goes on show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/24/following-a-pattern-orla-kielys-life-work-goes-on-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/24/following-a-pattern-orla-kielys-life-work-goes-on-show","fields":{"headline":"Following a pattern: Orla Kiely's life work goes on show","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Designer Orla Kiely’s Stem pattern may be one of the most recognised motifs of 21st-century fashion, but a new exhibition opening this week is set to shed light on the unsung elements of the designer’s archive. A Life in Pattern, opening in London on Saturday at the Fashion and Textiles Museum, is the first exhibition dedicated to the Dublin-born designer, whose breakthrough came in the mid 90s with her iconic laminated bags that featured a simplified plant print in bright and bold colours. “I hope that visitors will take away a sense that our type of print is much, much bigger than Stem and that the body of work is more than they ever imagined,” says Kiely, who has had a close hand in the curation of the exhibition. Cue hand-drawn blooms, abstract animal designs, playful plant shapes and geometric forms. Over the past 23 years, Kiely’s eponymous label has, of course, evolved into more than a bag and fashion brand. In fact, it is as recognised – if not more so – now for its interior design and homewares, all of which is celebrated in the retrospective. Homeware currently accounts for about half of the brand’s sales, with the iconic enamel plant pot recently going though the one million sales mark. Kiely worked with the textile historian Mary Schoeser and the museum’s head of exhibitions, Dennis Nothdruft, to play with scale in order to maximise the impact of her plant-based patterns. As such, giant oversized mannequins wearing bespoke dresses will be displayed beside their miniature counterparts and there will be “an immersive installation” where visitors will “be absorbed in the kaleidoscopic colours and rhythms” of Kiely’s design world. Her mood boards, methods and processes will also be explored in detail. “Every part of [the exhibition] has something I love and it’s amazing to see the archive of print we have built up,” says 53-year-old Kiely, who lives in south London with her husband, Dermott, and their two sons, Robert, 23, and Hamish, 21. “When we first started looking and trying to dig out the archive, we didn’t really know what we had. It was lovely, and also emotional, digging out boxes full of products and things I haven’t seen for 15 to 20 years. My children were born at the very beginning and every time I look at something I feel like I can see markers in my life.” The exhibition’s timing is apt, given the frequency at which the lifestyle and fashion industries increasingly collide. Now, it’s common place for a fashion designer to have a collaboration with an artist on the side, or a cushion to be sold alongside a coat, yet Kiely was one of the first to spread her net. Her early influences of Mary Quant, Biba and Betty Jackson growing up in Ireland and the inspiration she has mined from Danish design, cinema and photography since, have translated as effortlessly to what you’ll find in your wardrobe as they have the kitchen cupboard since day one. Kiely attributes this to finding the right balance between consistency (“We don’t really follow trends, we do what we like and what we feel is nice for the season, so we’re on our own journey”) and reinvention – the latter of which is most keenly felt on the fashion front. Kiely is about to release her fourth fashion collaboration with the stylist Leith Clarke, L’Orla, which has seen a new generation of fans flock to the brand, led by style influencers such as Alexa Chung, Keira Knightley and the Duchess of Cambridge. “We are always looking to inspire ourselves; we don’t rest and think, ‘Oh, that was incredible last season, let’s just do another version of that’. We’re constantly building, recreating and working with people who are really inspirational,” says Kiely. “Somehow, our prints have an uplifting effect,” she says, “and make people smile.” Orla Kiely: A Life In Pattern is on at The Fashion and Textile Museum from Saturday 25 May to 23 September 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/may/23/philip-roth-remembered-authors-friends","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T10:12:40Z","webTitle":"'An astonishing force field': Philip Roth, as remembered by authors and friends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/23/philip-roth-remembered-authors-friends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/23/philip-roth-remembered-authors-friends","fields":{"headline":"'An astonishing force field': Philip Roth, as remembered by authors and friends","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hermione Lee, writer and friend I first met Philip when I did a small book about him for a series for Methuen in 1982, when he was in the middle of writing the Zuckerman series. I got to know him after that, and then I was one of the group of people that read for him when a manuscript was in a penultimate stage. He revised and revised and revised. What seems like amazing spontaneous flow in these novels is massively worked over, over a very intense period of time. When he was living in England, I would go to his office and give him my thoughts about the books – like live criticism. He would record this and then he would take me out for lunch as a reward, where we would gossip. What made it not intimidating was that he was so eager to get feedback. This was not someone who was precious and protective about his own work. He wanted people to tell him what they thought; I remember him saying, at one point, “There’s no point in this if you’re going to be timid and polite.” He hated English politeness, everyone saying sorry the whole time (he used to do great imitations of English people apologising). He wanted his readers to say exactly what they thought did and didn’t work. He was an astonishing force field. Everything you said, whether it was useful or not, would be grist to the mill, this great mill of intellect and energy and imagination, churning over. You would find that something you’d said that he rather disagreed with would get put in the mouth of an unsympathetic character. He was very generous, and also fierce and demanding. He was prolific with jokes and stories – he loved to tell stories, and he loved terrible jokes. His last novel, before he stopped writing novels with that great proclamation, was Nemesis, in 2010, which was dedicated to me as his long-term reader. No one could actually believe he was really going to stop. I went to the celebration of his 80th birthday in 2013. Fittingly it was in Newark, and he made a terrific speech, expressing how pleased he was with having stopped, three years after having done so. He said, “I’ve finished with that stuff, I’ve described my last javelin throw, my last stamp album and my last glove factory and my last jewellery store and my last breast, and my last butcher’s shop and my last family crisis and my last unconscionable betrayal and my last brain tumour of the kind that killed my mother. I don’t have to do this anymore.” And he meant it. He made that decision – nobody could believe it. It’s an astonishing career. I can remember when Portnoy’s Complaint was the book that everyone identified him with. He was very much part of that great outburst of liberation, freedom and erotic excitement of the 60s. He was the head of that wave. But after the Zuckerman phase, he became much better known as an astonishing historian of America, with books like I Married a Communist, American Pastoral, and the deeply and sinisterly prescient The Plot Against America. This is an old diehard Roosevelt-era Democrat from the 30s, who was appalled by what was going on in the far right in America. Everything fed into the big machine that was Philip’s writing imagination. As told to Alison Flood Jonathan Safran Foer, author Roth was as great as any writer America has produced, in the company of Melville and Dickinson. If I have grandchildren, I hope and assume they will read him, and that their lives will be shaped by his words, as mine has been shaped. He was my hero. Gary Shteyngart, author He blew up my conception of the writer as this formal, hectoring creature. You could be warm, honest, real. You could write about Newark, you could write about your so-called ethnic group, and try as they might to silence you at first, they would not succeed. In at least one way, Roth led a life for which most writers would give up both of their typing arms: he completed his life’s project and then he stopped. Could there be a better writing life than that? Joyce Carol Oates, author Philip Roth was a slightly older contemporary of mine. We had come of age in more or less the same repressive 50s era in America – formalist, ironic, “Jamesian”, a time of literary indirection and understatement, above all impersonality – as the high priest TS Eliot had preached: “Poetry is an escape from personality.” Boldly, brilliantly, at times furiously, and with an unsparing sense of the ridiculous, Philip repudiated all that. He did revere Kafka – but Lenny Bruce as well. (In fact, the essential Roth is just that anomaly: Kafka riotously interpreted by Lenny Bruce.) But there was much more to Philip than furious rebellion. For at heart he was a true moralist, fired to root out hypocrisy and mendacity in public life as well as private. Few saw The Plot Against America as actual prophecy, but here we are. He will abide. Nathan Englander, author I can remember both times I first met Philip Roth. There was the day, back around 2004 or so, when my friend Hermione Lee tapped me on the shoulder at the New York Public Library and asked me if I wanted to come uptown with her to meet an old friend. That introduction sparked a relationship that lasted until yesterday, when Philip passed away. I miss him, already. The other time I first met Philip, was as a teenager — a very naïve, very religious teenager with lots of questions about the cloistered world in which I lived, and the culture that defined every aspect that life. That meeting took place in my parents’ bedroom, where I found a copy of Portnoy’s Complaint tucked behind some other novels. I read that novel and was shocked and thrilled and amazed by it — by a voice that powerful, and also, that familiar, in a personal, Jewish way. I went on to read and fall in love with Goodbye Columbus and the Ghost Writer and Operation Shylock, and American Pastoral, and have too many favourites from his vast body of work to name. And it’s that relationship, the one with the books, that has also evolved and grown over the years. And today, it’s that friendship that I look to, the one that never ends. Jay Parini, novelist, poet and academic It’s strange that I’m sitting here on a holiday in southern Italy and reading – for the 10th time at least – The Ghost Writer by Philip Roth. It’s a book I can’t stop reading. I have gone back to Roth’s novels again and again over the years for energy and inspiration as a writer. His tangy and intensely palpable voice meant so much to American fiction over the last 50 years. He made poetry out of everything he touched, and even his raunchiest moments – Sabbath’s Theater is nothing if not raunchy – delighted me for the exuberance of its language. Roth was unafraid, and he wrote exactly what he wanted, as he wanted. He consumed the world, swallowed it whole. I think it’s a mistake to focus on the Jewish side of that Jewish American epithet. He was American to his fingertips, and my generation – the generation who came after him – looked to him with admiration as well as, now and then, frustration. He was uneven as a writer. What writer isn’t? But he was massive in every way. As a grateful reader, I will miss him. Anne Margaret Daniel, writer Philip Roth was already sitting at the table in his favourite Portuguese restaurant in his Upper West Side neighbourhood when I walked in. It was the only occupied table in the place. He stood up and smiled, and pulled out a chair for me. “Hey, Geo, get the lady a menu,” he said to a man in the shadows. For the next two hours, he and I and a mutual friend talked about Yankees baseball from the 20s to the present (he liked Tony “Poosh ’em Up” Lazzeri), the excellence of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Roth’s brief time as a writing instructor at my university, the New School, and dire contemporary days. His eyes were deep and warm and full of sharp thought, his long hands moving often as he talked, his humour swift and glad. He spoke as he wrote, in perfectly turned sentences as he told a story or elaborated on a moment in American history, or in a two or three-word riposte as the conversation sped and shifted. We walked him back to his apartment. Outside it, three workers were smoothing fresh cement on the wide sidewalk. Our friend said, “Let’s write our initials,” and Roth eagerly agreed. We all compared keys to see which was the sturdiest-looking, and Roth said to one of the cementers, “Excuse me, we’d like to write our initials.” He paused, courtly, for a reply, and the guy shook his head, no, not yet. Then he nodded at Roth, but held up a cautionary finger. “When I’m finish,” he replied. Roth guffawed. “That oughta be the title of my autobiography.” The smoothing over, we wrote our three sets of initials, and said our goodbyes. In fact, he wrote that autobiography in every work of fiction, every essay, every review. No American writer had a richer and righter knowledge of our country’s history, for better and for worse, and was more honest in his telling – The Great American Novel, Our Gang, and The Plot Against America should be required reading in any course on 20th-century US history. No one could turn a sentence and keep it in you like Roth. He is untouchably fierce, funny, and fine. No one else even came close, or will. Matt Haig, author Philip Roth was a towering figure because he could do so much: humour, darkness, America, politics, pathos, history, sexuality, identity (particularly Jewish identity). He was brutally honest about himself, via his fictional alter egos, and never shied away from the dark side of the psyche, exploring themes of sex and anger and dysfunction with unflinching honesty. When I first read Portnoy’s Complaint it was 30 years old, but it still felt dangerous and subversive and wildly funny. He was a highbrow writer but never a pretentious one, as he never wanted to impress with fine moral virtues. He just presented life, and the inner life, as he saw it, and made no compromises to what he called the “moral beauty contest” that other writers engage in. With his death it feels a whole era has passed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/may/23/barclays-reported-to-be-exploring-merger-with-standard-charter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T15:40:01Z","webTitle":"Barclays reported to be exploring merger with Standard Chartered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/23/barclays-reported-to-be-exploring-merger-with-standard-charter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/23/barclays-reported-to-be-exploring-merger-with-standard-charter","fields":{"headline":"Barclays reported to be exploring merger with Standard Chartered","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Barclays has been exploring a potential merger with rival banks including Standard Chartered, according to a report in the Financial Times. The FT said Barclays directors had held “exploratory conversations” about possible deals in response to pressure from Edward Bramson’s US-based activist investment fund Sherborne, which has a 5.4% stake in the bank. John McFarlane, Barclays’ chairman, was in favour of a deal with Standard Chartered, according to the FT, while Sir Gerry Grimstone, who chairs the Barclays International unit, was also said to be supportive of the idea. A private conversation took place between a director at each bank about the potential benefits of such a deal but no formal or informal bid approach had taken place, the FT said. Barclays declined to comment on the report. A spokesman for Standard Chartered said: “We are entirely focused on executing our strategy and do not comment on this type of speculation.” Shares in Barclays were down 0.4% on Wednesday morning after the report was published, while Standard Chartered shares rose 2.2%. Sources close to Barclays poured cold water on the report and said the bank was not working on a deal with any of its rivals. Bramson is calling for a shake-up of the bank that is thought to involve a radical reduction in activities at its underperforming investment bank, in a plan to cut costs and boost shareholder returns. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, met Bramson in New York earlier this month and was told by the activist investor that he was still working on his proposals for the bank’s future. Also this month, Staley was fined £642,430 by UK regulators for a breach of conduct after he attempted to unmask a whistleblower. As well as being fined by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, Barclays said it would claw back £500,000 of Staley’s bonus over the matter. The bank will also have to report annually to the regulators detailing how it handles whistleblowing after they expressed concerns about its existing systems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/23/football-transfer-rumours-who-could-be-in-and-out-under-emery-at-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T08:16:52Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: who could be in and out under Emery at Arsenal?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/23/football-transfer-rumours-who-could-be-in-and-out-under-emery-at-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/23/football-transfer-rumours-who-could-be-in-and-out-under-emery-at-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: who could be in and out under Emery at Arsenal?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Arsenal manager Unai Emery – this is going to feel strange for a while, isn’t it? – will make a move for Nice’s Jean Michaël Seri, a long-time target of his predecessor.

The loss of the files means that there is almost no record of the British government’s work with the Sri Lankan authorities at the start of a famously brutal civil war. The destruction of the files raises fresh concerns about the Foreign Office’s attitude towards handling historic files on sensitive subjects. An official review in 2012 found that the department had destroyed thousands of documents detailing British counter-insurgency operations in Kenya and other colonies as the empire came to an end. Under the Public Records Act 1958 government departments are obliged to preserve historic records. But, in response to a Freedom of Information request from the Guardian asking for information about the destruction of the files, the Foreign Office stated that it was not required to preserve the documents. It said the files’ content “may be of a policy nature but might also be administrative or ephemeral”. The Foreign Office has now confirmed that it destroyed 195 files on Sri Lanka, dating from 1978 to 1980, three decades after the country became independent from Britain. The department would not say exactly when, where, or how the destruction occurred. “Files not selected for permanent preservation would have been destroyed offsite by the company contracted by the FCO for this purpose,” it said. “We understand the files would have been destroyed in line with the FCO’s paper and file destruction contract in force at the time.” Rachel Seoighe, a criminologist and Sri Lanka expert, at Middlesex University, said: “This discovery is very concerning given the lack of public information available about British involvement in Sri Lankan security practices at the beginning of the civil war.” She has filed a complaint with Unesco, the international body that protects world heritage. She added: “We know from other contexts, such as Kenya, that official files have been deliberately destroyed to conceal and deny abuse. The public has a right to know the extent to which Britain assisted Sri Lankan preparations for a war that was defined by disappearances, torture and mass atrocity.” The Foreign Office kept a list of file titles, showing that the destroyed papers would have covered a range of important subjects, from security co-operation and arms sales, to foreign aid and “requests for political asylum in the UK”. The scale of destruction is such that only three files have survived from 1978, compared to 38 files from the previous year. The loss of these records is a blow for Tamil historians, who struggled to safeguard records throughout the Sri Lankan civil war. The famous Jaffna library was burnt down in 1981 by anti-Tamil groups, incinerating almost 100,000 documents including irreplaceable ancient texts. “The Tamil community is taking strenuous efforts to collect and preserve records on history and the human rights situation in post-independence Sri Lanka,” said Vairamuttu Varadakumar, executive secretary of the Tamil Information Centre, in Kingston, London. “We are horrified to learn that the UK’s Foreign Office has destroyed vital information on the British government’s training and arming of Sri Lankan security forces, which were involved in widespread human rights violations against the Tamils.” The Foreign Office claim that the information contained in the files was insignificant has caused dismay among Tamil experts. Varadakumar said: “It is improper for the UK government to deceive the public, who have the right to know. It appears that the Foreign Office’s action is designed to cover up the involvement of the SAS and MI5 in the training of Sri Lankan security forces that might be potentially embarrassing to her majesty’s government.” The Special Air Service visit to Sri Lanka is only mentioned in a handful of surviving files at the National Archives, which were preserved by the Ministry of Defence. Their contents have never been reported on before. One MoD file reveals that late in 1978 Sri Lanka’s right-wing president, Junius Richard Jayewardene, asked the Foreign Office for a British security expert to visit his country to help counter Tamil militants who were demanding an independent state of their own. However, a Foreign Office file called Sri Lanka: Security Assessment 1978, which could have shed light on the president’s request, was destroyed. From the surviving defence files, it emerges that an MI5 director, who held racist views, made two advisory visits to Sri Lanka in 1979, under both Jim Callaghan’s Labour government and Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative administration. The full facts of these visits are hard to establish because the Foreign Office destroyed a 1979 file named Sri Lanka: Defence Visits from UK. The MI5 officer was John Percival Morton CMG OBE, better known as Jack Morton, a former colonial police chief in India who had spied on the independence movement there and once wrote that Indians were “a sort of immature, backward and needy people whom it was the natural British function to govern and administer”. He later became a director at MI5 and held various security positions inside Whitehall. According to a defence file it was on Morton’s recommendation that an SAS team visited Sri Lanka in 1980 to train a new army commando unit. Among the files destroyed by the Foreign Office was one entitled UK military assistance to Sri Lanka, 1980. The SAS visit occurred weeks after Britain’s premier special forces regiment staged the Iranian embassy siege.

It is the most scabrous and disgraceful piece of living tissue since Henry Miller, and just possibly the most outrageously funny book about sex yet written. Also and curiously, far from being offensive it is positively and humanly endearing. It should be suspended by a hair, preferably pubic, as a warning, over the desks of those novelists who brandish their current sex-licence like a rattle. Rather than toil in Roth’s wake they might be persuaded to reapply their talents and leave sex to a master of the field. Newark-bred, mother-stifled, father-exasperated, Alexander Portnoy – “Portnoise” when inventing a New Orleans pedigree for the goy girls who infest his growing fantasies, “Portnose” when his proboscis threatens to give the game away. “Portnoy-oy-oy-oy” when Jewishness grabs his wincing psyche by the short and curly – is talking to his analyst (Punchline after pouring out the vials of his pullulating ululating sex life, “So. Now ve may perhaps to begin, Yes?”) Father, martyred by constipation later matched by son’s hyperacidity, sold insurance to blacks and Puerto Ricans; you could eat your dinner off mother’s floors; when good, Alex is the apple of her eye, naughty he is guilty of unspeakable crimes against Jewry and his toiling parents; the guilt sticks, confusion abides. He identifies with the male: kicking his mother in an early tantrum is partly filial: “You schmuck, I kicked her for you.” Years later, laying the Pilgrim-stock niece of his father’s employer is a small revenge for dad’s years of exploitation. Morality is the stoat, he the bad rabbit, furtively engaged in the bathroom when mother shouts about his bowels through the door; stilted by Superego even when he picks up a whore for a threesome with his mistress, a lass of unparallelled and unmentionable appetites. “Believe me, doctor, I’m not trying to slither out of my slime, I’m trying to slither into it.” He may sit on august committees and be Assistant Commissioner for Human Opportunity, but a Jewish boy with parents alive is a 15-year-old “until they die.” So, the eternal reproach, no nice Jewish wedding, no grandchildren; the shadow of the barmitzvah over all that gentile-screwing; the fascination of all those secretions and apertures, American apertures; and the built-in Jewish homily calling to order; guilt at the prow, rebellion at the helm, the sheepish Id in irons still aboard the not-so-Jolly Roger. Any blonde who quibbles at his more peculiar requirements is discriminating racially: the model who sees him as her Yiddish Ivanhoe he sees as the ultimate, liberating wallow: his very first Jewess, a sabra in Israel, “where we are the WASPS,” lectures him, butts him expertly and shrinks his ardour. The old theme of a man divided against himself is scandalously refreshed, the wilder crannies of America’s sex-geography are explored, the smut is the elemental ur-stuff though doubtless deplorable, laughter gushes from a perpetual spring in the weird desert of the human condition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/may/24/ticket-next-life-buddhist-dog-funerals-bangkok","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"'A ticket to the next life': the lavish Buddhist dog funerals of Bangkok","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/24/ticket-next-life-buddhist-dog-funerals-bangkok","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/may/24/ticket-next-life-buddhist-dog-funerals-bangkok","fields":{"headline":"'A ticket to the next life': the lavish Buddhist dog funerals of Bangkok","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fou Fou always liked the good things in life. The pomeranian puppy had “a heart of gold” and a taste for expensive grilled pork. Varunthip Manthin loved the tiny dog as much as any of her sons. When she discovered him dead in the road having been hit by a motorbike, she was inconsolable. Despite her grief Manthin knew one thing: she would give him a funeral worthy of her own child. And so, on a Saturday morning, Fou Fou’s body was brought to a small chapel in Bangkok’s Wat Krathum Suea Pla temple, laid in a fuchsia pink coffin, set among a kitsch display of plastic flowers, and sent into eternity with the blessings of a monk. The monks of this temple once only offered such funeral rites for deceased humans. However, that has recently changed as a new market became apparent: beloved pets. Buddhists believe that as part of the samsara life and death cycle, dogs and cats – as well as elephants and horses – can potentially be reincarnated as humans. By giving their pets full funeral rites – including prayers for forgiveness, a blessing by a monk, filling the coffin with (fake) gold and “tickets to the next life”followed by full cremation – many owners hope to give them a better chance of returning to this world in a higher form. Varunthip Manthin and her daughter Phatcharakorn Likanrapichitkun during the funeral of their dog, Fou Fou. Photographs: Cory Wright “I feel complete now that I can hold a funeral ceremony for him like I would for any of my children; I am a mother doing everything she can to honour my son,” said Manthin through floods of tears, as she looked down at Fou Fou and scattered petals over his body, cozily tucked up inside the open pink casket. “I definitely believe that Fou Fou will be reborn in the next life as one of my children because he was just so different from other kinds of dogs; he was just so clever. He understood me better than anyone.” After an emotional ceremony – during which Manthin and her daughter, Phatcharakorn Likanrapichitkun, 20, wore black and wept freely as the monk offered the last Buddhist rites and laid a sandalwood flower on the body – Fou Fou was taken for cremation. As his body was enveloped by flames in the vast marble oven, Manthin lamented that Fou Fou’s best friend, the family cat, could not be with them to say goodbye. Phatcharakorn Likanrapichitkun says a final goodbye to Fou Fou before he is consigned to the flames. According to Theerawat Saehan, who organises the pet funerals, business is booming in Bangkok. The temple now performs up to 300 a month, and with each funeral costing 3,000 Thai baht (£70) for animals weighing under 20kgs (44lbs), and 4,000 baht for heavier animals, it is proving extremely lucrative. Most are dogs, though around 10% are cats, 5% rabbits and 3% reptiles; funerals have also been held for goldfish, catfish, monkeys, iguanas, a rooster, pigs and a small horse. The idea came to Saehan, who used to own a pet grooming shop, after he was invited to the funeral of one of his canine customers. “It felt like a really sad occasion, not a proper funeral at all – just the burning and destroying the body of someone they loved like family. So I felt I must do something,” he said. He approached the Wat Krathum Suea Pla temple about holding a proper Buddhist ceremony with the monks, and managed to get their agreement. “Suddenly I had so many people contacting me, asking for me to arrange funerals for their pets too,” he said. “We believe in the next life, so this ceremony is to help with reincarnation, to give them what they need.” As well as the funerals, monthly boat trips for scattering the ashes are also offered. Over 120 families taking part each month, ceremonially casting their pets’ remains over the Chao Phraya River. During the final stages of the ceremony family members transfer water from one container to another in order to dedicate merit for the deceased pet, to reduce bad karma. Photographs: Cory Wright While most are satisfied with just one monk and a half-hour ceremony, the most extravagant pet funeral Saehan has been called upon to arrange was for a golden retriever belonging to a Thai businessman. Sixty monks and 80 guests attended the event, which featured a custom-made coffin and a motorcade funeral procession, at a total cost of 400,000 baht (£9,300). But Saehan was most moved by the ceremony for Daam the street dog, who had lived in a Bangkok vegetable market. Opening up the envelope which contained the payment, he was moved to see it was made up of hundreds of small coins and bills, all donated by dozens of market stallholders. “I felt like this dog, even though he was a street dog, must have been very good to have been loved by so many people who wanted him to have a proper funeral,” said Saehan. On this particular Saturday, those overseeing the pet funerals barely have time to draw breath as a steady stream of heartbroken owners turn up at the temple, clutching their dogs, limbs stiff with rigor mortis, in towels or boxes. Ninja, too big for a coffin, was laid to rest under his favourite towel instead. Ninja, a large mixed breed dog, causes a slight kerfuffle as he is too big to fit in a coffin; heis eventually laid out beneath a Mickey Mouse towel. He was diagnosed with cancer last year, and his owner Pimpha Darakon Na Ayuttha, 65, said she was glad he was finally no longer in pain. “Whatever animal you are reborn as Ninja, please come back to me, please come back and find me,” she pleaded as Ninja’s body was carried to his cremation. Apicha Taninchotikorm, 39, looked forlorn and tearful as she stroked the body of Klom Klom, another pomeranian, who had died that morning. He was 20, and had barely been able to eat towards the end, but his death was still devastating. Klom Klom had been with her half her life, even travelling to university with her. “I do believe he will become a human in the next life,” said Taninchotikorm. “I think this was his last life as an animal, so I didn’t want to bury him. “We wanted this ceremony because it is the last farewell that we would give to any member of my family, he is not different. And I am glad we did it; it’s a hard feeling to describe, but it felt important to say goodbye – I feel like we’ve sent him away to the heavens.” Additional reporting by Navaon Siradapuvadol Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/23/seven-reasons-why-marks-spencer-is-in-trouble","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T11:23:03Z","webTitle":"Seven reasons why Marks & Spencer is in trouble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/23/seven-reasons-why-marks-spencer-is-in-trouble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/23/seven-reasons-why-marks-spencer-is-in-trouble","fields":{"headline":"Seven reasons why Marks & Spencer is in trouble","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Profits are down sharply at Marks &amp; Spencer again. What are the main problems facing the UK’s biggest clothing retailer? Wired world: M&amp;S faces greater competition as the internet has made it easier than ever to shop around, compare prices and access fashion from around the world. About a quarter of fashion and footwear is now bought online in the UK, says retail expert GlobalData, and the switch from the high street is benefiting the likes of Asos as well as dozens of smaller brands from Boden to Me+Em. M&amp;S has struggled to adapt. It made a massive investment in an automated home delivery warehouse which has struggled to cope with demand. Too many shops: M&amp;S is closing a third of its 300 high street stores which sell its full range of clothing, homewares and food. The radical plan will cut the amount of high street floor space devoted to clothing and homewares by a quarter but some question whether even that is going far enough in a digital age. Poor stores: After nearly 115 years on the high street, M&amp;S has collected a motley array of stores, some of which have seen better days. A lack of investment in small, local outlets has left them looking shabby and dated, while some of the larger stores are now too big and difficult to navigate. A lot of work has been done to improve matters, bringing in coffee shops and other services, but more work is needed to create truly exciting spaces. Fashion faux pas: A third of the nation still buys its undies at M&amp;S, but the chain has struggled to maintain its everywoman appeal for everyday clothing amid heavy competition. Middle-aged, and even elderly, women now expect to dress much more fashionably than they did in the past and M&amp;S has struggled to keep pace with their desires. Cutting quality in an attempt to bring prices closer to discounters such as Primark has backfired in the past. The group’s multiple sub-brands, such as Per Una and Limited Edition, also lack authority and consistency and shoppers don’t understand who they are aimed at. This is not just M&amp;S food … It’s too expensive and rivals have caught up. After several years of bumper growth, M&amp;S food halls are lagging as rivals from Aldi and Lidl to upmarket Waitrose raise their game with the kinds of new products M&amp;S was once famous for. M&amp;S Inc: The business culture at M&amp;S has long been criticised for being too bureaucratic. Chief executive Steve Rowe admitted it is “a top-heavy business that was inward looking and too ‘corporate’”. After previous false dawns newish chairman Archie Norman is expected to be instrumental in bringing change. Peak stuff? M&amp;S is exposed to a shift in spending that is seeing Britons spend less on wardrobe updates. The volume of clothing and footwear sold in 2017 declined 0.8%, according to GlobalData, and is expected to fall again this year. At the same time, M&amp;S’s traditionally middle-aged female shoppers have more choice that ever before thanks to fast fashion rivals such as Zara, H&amp;M and Primark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/23/r-kelly-responds-to-muterkelly-campaign-its-too-late","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T12:01:51Z","webTitle":"R Kelly responds to #MuteRKelly campaign: 'It's too late'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/23/r-kelly-responds-to-muterkelly-campaign-its-too-late","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/23/r-kelly-responds-to-muterkelly-campaign-its-too-late","fields":{"headline":"R Kelly responds to #MuteRKelly campaign: 'It's too late'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Video has emerged of R Kelly telling a room of male supporters that attempts to suppress his influence following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct are “too late”. In the clip, Kelly appears to reference the #MuteRKelly campaign, which is putting pressure on the music industry to stop supporting the R&amp;B singer. Streaming services including Spotify and Apple Music have removed his songs from their curated editorial playlists (although the streaming services still carry his songs in their libraries). “They should have did this shit 30 years ago,” Kelly said while smoking a cigar and holding a glass. “I’ve got a million motherfuckers hating me, and 40 billion motherfuckers loving me,” he said, to appreciative sounds from the room. The available footage of Kelly’s speech concludes with him proposing “a toast to all the strong motherfuckers in here right now. Motherfuckers like you is why I still continue to do, because I have a basketball mentality. As long as I got the ball, the world is on defence.” The video first appeared on Facebook Live on 18 May, Spin magazine reports. The full clip appears to have been removed from Facebook. Allegations that Kelly coerces women into having sex with him are growing in number. He faces a new lawsuit from Faith Rodgers, who alleges that the singer abused her “mentally, sexually and verbally”, filming her against her will in “deviant and compromising sexual contact”. She also alleges that the first time they had sex it was “non-permissive, painful and abusive”, and that he infected her with herpes without her knowledge. Rodgers claims he locked her in rooms and cars to punish her “for failing to please [him] sexually and/or for perceived offences and violations of his prescribed code of conduct”. Her charges are in keeping with others made against Kelly recently, from women who allege that he held them against their will in a “cult”. Kelly is yet to respond to these specific charges. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, most recently calling the string of allegations, and the subsequent backlash from the Time’s Up movement, “a greedy, conscious and malicious conspiracy to demean him, his family and the women with whom he spends his time”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/may/24/china-has-been-a-great-driver-of-our-economy-but-we-cant-rely-on-it","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T23:46:49Z","webTitle":"China has been a great driver of our economy – but we can't rely on it | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/24/china-has-been-a-great-driver-of-our-economy-but-we-cant-rely-on-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/24/china-has-been-a-great-driver-of-our-economy-but-we-cant-rely-on-it","fields":{"headline":"China has been a great driver of our economy – but we can't rely on it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The importance of China to our economy over the past 15 years can hardly be overstated, but with that importance comes risks. A new study by researchers at the IMF looks at the links between the Australian and Chinese economies and examines the risks to Australia from both positive and negative shocks to the Chinese economy – and concludes that the best mitigation is to continue to diversify our economy towards the services sector and also to other Asian markets. The importance of China to Australia is perhaps best demonstrated by the change in the amount of our merchandise exports that go to that country now compared to 15 years ago. Back in 2003 China took 7% of our merchandise exports – less than went to Japan and Korea. Now it takes 32.7% – more than goes to not only every other nation, but more than goes to all non-Asian nations combined: And while the focus of our exports to China generally is on iron ore and coal, the IMF report notes the importance of our services sector – especially tourism and education – as China itself moves towards a more services-consumer driven economy. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday In the past decade the number of Chinese visitors to Australia each year has grown 273% compared to just 43% for all other nations. And with that increase has also come a massive rise in the amount they spend here each year: A big reason for the increase is not just holiday makers, but students. While students make up just 7% of all visitors they account for 37% of all money spent in Australia – more than any other group: And because a higher share of Chinese visitors to Australia come for education than most other nations that means overall Chinese visitors spend more on average than those from other nations. In 2017 Chinese visitors spent on average $6,622 compared to $3,589 for those from India and just $2,934 for those from the UK. But even though UK tourist here for a holiday spend more on average than Chinese tourists, in all other categories – including business and employment reasons – Chinese spend more on average: The importance of Chinese students to our economy is highlighted by the fact that while they account for 36% of those travelling to Australia for educational purposes, they spend nearly half of all money in Australia by such visitors: So clearly there is more to our relationship with China than just mining exports. And this is clearly evident in the IMF study, which considers three shocks to the Chinese economy – two positive and one negative. The first involves China shifting faster than expected from a saving to a consumption driven economy. In this scenario, not surprisingly the result for Australia is mostly positive. The study finds that this would lead to a short-term boost to our services sector and while movements in the exchange rate would mean the benefits would be reduced in the long term, overall there is little cause for worry. The second positive shock involves the Chinese government moving to deal with overcapacity issues and low productivity. This would see it close its inefficient steel-producing firms – which would reduce steel production capacity by 10% – and also reduce its domestic supply of iron ore and coal by 5%. Crucially, this would not reduce the Chinese demand for iron ore and coal, so international commodity prices would actually rise. Such a move would have two ramifications for Australia. The commodity price rise would be good for our mineral exporters, but because the reduced steel production would also reduce Chinese national income that in turn would see a fall in the demand for tourism and education. Under this scenario the value of our dollar would also rise – in line with the increase in commodity prices – which would also make tourism and education in Australia more expensive for Chinese. The study estimates this would also lead to our GDP being slightly lower, but this overall small drop hides a large change within our economy. The mining sector would be fine, but our services sector would suffer a big decline and our national consumption would also fall in line with jobs cuts in the tourism and education sectors. The final shock is the hardest for Australia to deal with – one where the transition in the Chinese economy does not go smoothly and its productivity growth is lower than expected leading to its real GDP being 5% lower in the long term. This leads to lower demand for our exports – both minerals and services. The study estimates however that while our real GDP would fall initially “by about 0.4 percent” it would rebound in the long run. However, this again masks the real struggles that would occur. Firstly commodity prices would fall – meaning our national income would also drop. But because that our exchange rate would fall, tourism and education in Australia would become cheaper. The problem as China is our biggest market for education and general tourism the rest of the world would have to take up the slack – and those from such nations spend less on average than the Chinese do. And this is where the study highlights the need for our economy to remain diversified – both in terms of our exports having both mining and services sectors, but also in term of who we export to. The study notes that a faltering China, and the resultant drop in commodity prices would actually provide a boost to other emerging Asian economies. The report concludes that “China may be Australia’s largest trading partner, but the rest of Asia is also rapidly growing, and is a potential market for Australia’s future expansion”. While China may have been the great driver of our economy over the past 15 years, the future looks likely to see the rest of Asia take a greater role – something we should be seeking, if only to mitigate the risk should the Chinese economy falter. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/23/abortion-laws-bill-to-establish-exclusion-zones-likely-to-pass-nsw-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T08:25:22Z","webTitle":"Abortion laws: bill to establish exclusion zones likely to pass NSW parliament","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/23/abortion-laws-bill-to-establish-exclusion-zones-likely-to-pass-nsw-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/23/abortion-laws-bill-to-establish-exclusion-zones-likely-to-pass-nsw-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Abortion laws: bill to establish exclusion zones likely to pass NSW parliament","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A bill to establish exclusion zones around abortion clinics in New South Wales is likely to pass the state’s parliament. The legislation would establish 150m “safe access zones” around abortion clinics and proposes potential jail time for people caught harassing people within the zones. It would also make it an offence to record or distribute a recording of a person inside the exclusion zone without their consent. The state parliament’s upper house is due to vote on the bill on Thursday and both supporters and opponents said it was almost certain to pass after the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, gave the Liberal party a conscience vote. “I’m pretty confident that, all going to plan, it will go through,” Labor’s Penny Sharpe told the Guardian. Labor has 12 members in the upper house and the bill will be supported by the five Greens MPs. The bill was co-sponsored by Sharpe and the Nationals MP Trevor Khan when it was introduced into the parliament earlier this month and has cross-party support. It will still need an additional five votes from the seven Nationals and 13 Liberal party MPs to reach the 21 it needs to make it to the lower house but even opponents of the bill conceded it would pass the first hurdle. Catherine Cusack, a moderate Liberal in the upper house, said she would oppose the bill because of concerns about freedom of expression. “I won’t be supporting it, a number of us have issues with the freedom of speech problem,” she said. “There are already cases before the high court in other states, and I just really don’t think people should go to jail for praying.” But she said the premier’s decision to grant a conscience vote meant the bill would “definitely” pass the upper house. “With Trevor Khan pushing it a lot of the Nationals will support it,” she said. If it makes it through the upper house, the bill will likely be voted on in the lower house next month. The Nationals MP Leslie Williams has already indicated that she will introduce the bill if it does and, on Wednesday, Berejiklian indicated that she would support the legislation if it passed the upper house despite saying the bill was “flawed”. “The bill is not perfect at all,” Berejiklian said. “I also felt it very important to give all of our members in parliament a conscience vote because the bill isn’t perfect. It’s flawed.” One source from the NSW right told the Guardian that conservative MPs were more annoyed about the politics of the bill than the policy. “The real thing angering the hard right is that the Nationals have become activists for social issues,” the source said. “The evangelical Christians bothering people outside of abortion clinics are not really the hard-right’s usual constituency. It’s the Nationals’ love-in with Labor and the Greens that’s driving people crazy. If the bill passes, NSW would follow Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT in establishing exclusion zones around abortion clinics. In 2015 Victoria passed a law making it an offence to harass or intimidate women seeking access to an abortion within 150m of any hospital, GP clinic or health services that performs abortions. Religious picketer Kathy Clubb became the first person to be charged under the act in 2016 after she approached a couple outside East Melbourne Fertility Control Clinic and tried to hand them pamphlets. She was found guilty of one charge of prohibited behaviour within a safe access zone and fined $5000. Clubb is now challenging the conviction in the high court, arguing that the law breaches her rights because it seeks to prevent anti-abortion political speech by banning communications. The Victorian government has submitted that the legislation “is not directed to political communication” and had an “insubstantial” effect on it. Sharpe said NSW had modelled much of the bill on Victoria’s, and said she was “as confident as you can be without being a high court judge that it would survive a challenge”. “What we have is a clause which is the same as Victoria’s, which is aimed at picking up abuse or harassment of people trying to access an abortion,” she said. “The whole law is about protecting people who are being targeted as they’re going in and out of clinics.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/23/chinese-province-introduces-divorce-test-for-couples-planning-to-split","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T05:28:16Z","webTitle":"Chinese province introduces 'divorce test' for couples planning to split","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/23/chinese-province-introduces-divorce-test-for-couples-planning-to-split","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/23/chinese-province-introduces-divorce-test-for-couples-planning-to-split","fields":{"headline":"Chinese province introduces 'divorce test' for couples planning to split","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“What is the best memory between you and your partner?”; “How many times have you travelled together?”; “What is your partner’s favourite food?”; “What is your child’s favourite snack?” These are some of the questions in a “divorce test” introduced last week by a civil affairs department in China’s eastern Jiangsu province for couples applying to end their marriages, one of many government measures brought in to stem the rising tide of divorces in the country. Couples who score above 60 on the exam, which also asks for the dates of anniversaries and birthdays, still “have hope”, according to a post by the Lianyuwang city government on Weibo. Those who score below can conclude their marriage is “about to break.” “The aim is to let both sides understand themselves, and the other side, and recall little moments in their marriage,” the department said, according to the state-run news outlet Global Times. For more than a decade, divorce rates in China have been rising. Last year, 3.4 million Chinese couples filed for divorce, an increase of 8% from the year before, according to the ministry of civil affairs. In 1995 just over one million couples divorced, after new laws made it easier to separate. In 1979, only 319,000 Chinese couples registered for divorce. Chinese authorities have been trying to stop the trend, caused by a combination of factors including the increasing financial independence of Chinese women and growing intolerance of domestic violence and extramarital affairs. President Xi Jinping in 2016 called families the “cells of society” and called on all Chinese to “promote fine family culture.” China’s supreme court that year urged courts handling divorce petitions to distinguish when couples are in a state of “marital crisis” or “marital death” and to try to save marriages when possible. Several courts have required couples who wish to divorce to first observe a three-month “cooling off” period before finalising their separation. In Guangdong province, couples have to attend mediation classes. After criticism online of the divorce test, the department in Lianyuwang clarified that the exam is purely voluntary.

The phone rang. I heard the words as if from a distance. My heart caved in, my mind froze, my body disappeared. I pulled myself together enough to call my nephew – a shattered young man – before I completely broke down. Two days later, I was on national TV, launching my long-awaited book on strength-based parenting. Three months later, I was in Montreal accepting the presidency of the International Positive Psychology Association. Just as many of my dreams were coming true, my world was falling apart. I was confronted head-on with the irony of reaching a professional zenith in the field of positive psychology at exactly the same time I was dealing with excruciating personal darkness and loss. How would my expertise deal with this king-hit? My sister was proud of my book. She read various sections and loved it. We both shared a passion for helping others. I’d written this acknowledgment to her: To my beautiful sister, Colleen, an amazing social worker who has used her strengths of courage, persistence and compassion to help thousands of people … You have made such a positive difference to the world I’d been saving it to show her in person. She never saw it. The night after she died I was so incapacitated by grief that my husband’s mother and sister had to help me pack for the book tour: “You need a suit for TV ... this skirt ... these shoes ... where’s your passport?” In interviews, I’d smile and discuss how to create happy families. Then I’d crawl into bed and weep. PTSD flashbacks from my childhood would stop me from sleeping. I expected the emotional pain but was taken aback by the physical pain. For months, sharp pain radiated down my face, through my throat and across my ribcage. Painkillers did nothing. Friends were shocked when I’d double over in mid-sentence. Colleen and I didn’t have a perfect relationship. Growing up with abuse strained our bond. But we loved and understood each other. We were bridesmaids at each other’s weddings and the first person we called when we each found out we were pregnant. We supported each other to seek therapy. No matter what, we knew we were there for each other. We were survivors. But now I am left without her and I no have words to describe the pain. My friends worried that I wasn’t addressing my grief. Some advised cancelling my tour. To be honest, I couldn’t tell if the tour was a good thing because it kept me together, or a bad thing because it stopped me from falling apart. Fall apart. That’s what you’re supposed to do when a loved one dies, right? Or are you supposed to stay strong? Is it okay to be happy? Is it selfish to go on? Life doesn’t pause to help us answer these questions. Each of us must find our own answers as we go. If I had to sum it up, I’d say: allow yourself to fall apart in some moments AND will yourself to stay strong in others. I didn’t do this perfectly, but here are some ways that I navigated as best I could: Use mindfulness to be present to your feelings and needs. Mindfulness helped me feel the loss and deal with the PTSD flashbacks but not be overwhelmed. I tried to be present to all of the feelings moving through me, knowing I was bigger than the grief; that I could let it wash over me but that I’d come back. Understand that others will respond based on their relationship with death. Try not to take it personally. Some friends sat with me in the messiness of it all. Others dropped away for months, later confiding: “I just didn’t know what to say.” Many people are afraid of suicide and don’t have a language to talk about it. But I decided to talk about it and about her. The way my sister died does not define her. The 44 years she spent on this Earth – helping others as a social worker and raising a good son – these define her. Draw on your strengths to comfort and steady you. Each of us has our own unique strengths. Grief amplifies the need for us to use them. For me, Colleen’s death was a call to action to step more fully into my nephew’s life and to use my strengths as a psychologist to help him through his profound loss. I couldn’t be more proud of my nephew and the strength he has shown over this past year – wisdom, dignity, compassion and grit beyond his years. Seek healing, more than happiness. People advised me to try and stay happy. That wasn’t working for me, yet I didn’t want to drown in grief. I had my nephew and my kids to look after, not to mention the book tour. I decided to focus on “healing” rather than “happiness,” engaging in healing practices like journaling, walking, prayer, and meditation. Hold on to the small moments of light. To ensure that I didn’t drown in sadness, I made a choice to savour the good things: the immense gratitude I felt for my husband, his family and my loving friends (I had a freezer full of casseroles for 6 months); life’s little joys – sunshine on my back, the smell of good coffee, my kids’ laughter and the affection of my dog who, for months after Colleen died, followed me around the house gently nudging my leg with his nose. These small things made the grief less daunting. Give yourself permission to walk away. Grieving is warrior work. It takes enormous amounts of energy. Do you need time by yourself? Take it. Are there things you can take off your plate? Do so. Are there people in your life who are unsupportive, or outright harmful? Walk away. It may not be forever, but you need to protect yourself during this time. Be authentic and courageous. “Putting on a brave face must take so much out of you,” one friend commented after a book event. But bravery was not a face I put on to hide my grief. Bravery was born because of the grief. I had to have the courage to talk about her death in order to honour her and support her son. When all I wanted to do was crawl into a ball, I willed myself to speak up about suicide and abuse in the hope that it will help others who are going through similar circumstances. You will have your own circumstances but I encourage you to be real and courageous. I miss Coll every day. I keep expecting a text from her with a funny joke or the lyric from an eighties song. I keep going to dial her to tell her the latest gossip. I haven’t “moved on”. But I have “gone on”. I don’t ever want to move on from my sister, she is a part of me and I always want her in my life. But I know I need to go on for the sake of her son, my kids and myself. The raw grief still hits me at unexpected moments – like a sudden punch to the throat – but it’s happening less frequently. Most days the rawness has been replaced by a soft sadness. I know that this sadness will be with me for the rest of my life but, as time passes, I find myself thinking of our fun times and my body warms. With each happy memory of my darling sister, the warmth will grow. I know that the warmth won’t replace the sadness but I trust that they will find a way to sit beside each other. I feel Colleen is somewhere cheering my work. Her work was about rescuing kids from unhappy families and mine is about helping kids thrive by creating happy families. Her legacy lives on through my book. Embracing life doesn’t mean denying a loved one’s death, or that we miss them less. It means honouring and celebrating their life. It means taking over where they left off. But most of all, it means having our eyes open to the enormous gifts we gain in our own life as we continue to stumble and get back up again.

Critic editor Joel MacManus and his staff had no idea what happened to the copies of the special menstruation issue, and spent Tuesday trying to access campus CCTV footage to identify who had taken them. It wasn’t until Tuesday night that MacManus learned via a press release that Otago University was behind the disappearance. The university’s actions have since been criticised by MacManus and prominent New Zealand media voices as “censorship”. “[This] goes against everything a university should stand for,” MacManus said. “We stand by the content of the magazine, and believe it touched on a number of very important issues about period poverty and trans issues, as well as breaking taboos about a bodily function that half the population experience.” University alumni were also dismayed. In a statement the University of Otago said proctor Dave Scott made the call after requests from Dunedin Public Library and Hospital to remove the magazine from stands in their foyers, because “the cover was objectionable to many people”. “This was an assumption, rightly or wrongly, that this action needed to be taken as the University is also a public place, where non-students regularly pass through.” In a further statement, the university clarified their position, saying the decision to remove the magazines was a “mistake”, and “the actions that were taken here are regrettable. The University has no official view, however, on the actual content of this week’s magazine”. MacManus said Critic had decided to dedicate the issue to menstruation after being approached by Otago Women’s+ Club, with the goal of raising awareness of menstruation issues on campus such as reliable access to sanitary bins and the high cost of sanitary items in New Zealand. The issue – which has been read more than 18,000 times online – included tips on where to find free sanitary products on campus, an article about moon cups and personal stories from students about having their period. Seventeen former Critic editors have signed an open letter expressing their “deep concern” over the destruction of the magazines. Saskia Rushton-Green, the freelance illustrator who designed the cover image of the gender-neutral person menstruating, said the image was intended as an empowering one, with the figure depicted giving the thumbs up despite feeling “gross” while on their period. “I bleed for about a third of my life and it’s not glamorous,” Rushton-Green said. “There’s a lot of underlying judgement around it that makes bleeding more stressful than it needs to be.” The majority of New Zealand media outlets chose not to publish the cover of Critic in their articles reporting the incident. The Otago Daily Times pixellated the image of the menstruating person, as did Newshub and The New Zealand Herald. Stuff cropped a photograph so only the masthead of the issue was visible, as did Radio New Zealand. Copies of the Critic issue have appeared on New Zealand auction site Trade Me for sale, with current bids clocking in at NZ$40."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/23/lake-eyre-yachts-set-sail-as-floodwaters-end-two-month-journey","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T03:44:16Z","webTitle":"Lake Eyre: yachts set sail as flood waters end two-month journey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/23/lake-eyre-yachts-set-sail-as-floodwaters-end-two-month-journey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/23/lake-eyre-yachts-set-sail-as-floodwaters-end-two-month-journey","fields":{"headline":"Lake Eyre: yachts set sail as flood waters end two-month journey","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After weeks of tracking the slow progress of flood waters through outback Queensland, members of the improbable Lake Eyre Yacht Club have been able to return to the water. Water reached Lake Eyre, or Kati Thanda, in South Australia on 15 May, two months after falling in the upper Diamantina catchment in western Queensland, some 1,000km away. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Two days after the water arrived, pilot Mariano Salvati from outback charter company Wrightsair spotted three yachts sailing the ephemeral lake. Members of the yacht club have been excitedly tracking the water level of the Warburton River, which discharges into the eastern side of Lake Eyre, since April. The river became navigable in early May, reaching a height of 4.5 metres. Satellite images showed water flowing from the Warburton into the lake last week. The waters had been snaking down the Diamantina River, one of the main arteries of the Lake Eyre system, causing flooding in Birdsville in far-western Queensland in April and cutting off the remote town, which is 1,953km west of Brisbane and about 380km north-east of Lake Eyre. They brought relief to the channel country around the border of Queensland, South Australian and Northern Territory, which had below-average rainfall in 2017. Images from the Nasa Earth Observatory show the area becoming green as the flood waters move through. The Lake Eyre basin is the lowest natural point in Australia, falling about 15 metres below sea level. The average annual rainfall is less than 125mm, meaning the lake and surrounding creeks and streams are usually dry. When full, it is the largest lake in Australia and as salty as seawater. The flood waters that have reached the lake at present are not enough to fill it completely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/14/israel-is-70-is-hope-for-a-two-state-solution-gone","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T16:55:25Z","webTitle":"Israel is 70 – is hope for a two-state solution gone? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/14/israel-is-70-is-hope-for-a-two-state-solution-gone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/14/israel-is-70-is-hope-for-a-two-state-solution-gone","fields":{"headline":"Israel is 70 – is hope for a two-state solution gone?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ten years ago, the Guardian published a letter from more than 100 Jewish signatories explaining why we would not be celebrating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel. We are now approaching the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, the catastrophe that dispossessed Palestinians from their land and turned three-quarters of a million of them into refugees. And the situation, both within Israel and in the occupied territories, has significantly worsened. There are now 750,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. Palestinians in the West Bank live under an oppressive apartheid system, face demolition of their houses and uprooting of their olive trees, while the settlements expand unchecked. In East Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, the policy of ethnic cleansing continues to be implemented, while the vicious punishment of the civilian population of Gaza is creating a human catastrophe and rendering the territory uninhabitable. Israel itself is a highly segregated society where the non-Jewish minority is viewed as a demographic threat and excluded from full citizenship; where religious fanaticism and repression take greater hold and dissident voices like B’Tselem, Breaking the Silence and the few principled journalists like Gideon Levy and Amira Hass, are attacked, marginalised and delegitimised. Ten years ago a two-state solution still seemed possible. That chance has now gone. There are no peace negotiations. The peace process is dead. In reality it was never more than an excuse for Israel to consolidate its settlement project. The two-state solution is dead. Both Netanyahu’s government party and the so-called opposition, Zionist Unity, which includes the Israeli Labour party, are in agreement: the settlements will not be removed. It is surely time to face up to the reality. As Jews, we believe that Israel has no long-term future as an exclusively Jewish state, an apartheid state. The only just solution for both sides is one secular state with equal rights for all.

Such a celebration might then lead to the disbandment of Hamas and Hezbollah – originally created as a defence against the actions of Israel. There are many groups of teachers, rabbis, mothers and grandmothers and others in Israel patiently working for a new approach and they should be truly celebrated as sowing the seeds of hope and the possibility of restarting meaningful peace talks which this time might stand a chance. That would be something worth celebrating. Rev Canon Robin Morrison Barry, Vale of Glamorgan • One will have every sympathy with the plight of the Gaza Palestinians and may well criticise the Israeli occupation generally, but what is disappointing about Atef Abu Saif (Opinion, 14 May) is that all his condemnation is directed at Israel and none at his leaders, and Hamas in particular. He writes that the protesters have no wish to negate the state of Israel, but Gazans voted for Hamas when its charter called for Israel’s elimination. He states that it is the hope of becoming a fully recognised state that has kept Palestinians alive for the past 70 years. Yet it was 70 years ago in 1947 that the Palestinians were offered their state by the UN and they refused it, preferring instead to wage war against Israel. Atef Abu Saif shares the general lack of concern by all Arabs of the plight of the 700,000 Jewish refugees expelled from most Arab lands in 1948. Most found refuge in Israel where, not without hardship, they forged new lives. It is a tragedy that the Arab states did not offer the refugee Palestinians the same opportunities.

Witnesses described morgues filling up and a sense of panic as hundreds of relatives converged on hospitals seeking news. Among the 40,000 Palestinians who flocked to Gaza’s border fence, it was clear to many that the day would end with death. “Today is the big day when we will cross the fence and tell Israel and the world we will not accept being occupied for ever,” said Ali, a science teacher who declined to give his last name. “Many may get martyred today, so many, but the world will hear our message: occupation must end.” But after weeks of similar protests in which at least 40 Palestinians have died, the violence at Monday’s “Great March of Return” – coinciding with the controversial ceremony in Jerusalem to mark the relocation of the US embassy – was shocking even by the standards of the recent demonstrations. Within the space of a few hours, at least 55 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, including five minors, in the single most deadly day in Gaza since the end of the last war in 2014. In line with previous protests in recent weeks that have resulted in dozens of Palestinian fatalities, there were no reports of any dead or injured on the Israeli side. It was soon clear that repeated calls on Israel to show restraint were being swept away by volleys of teargas and live bullets, with most of the casualties concentrated in the southern Gaza towns of Khan Younis and Rafah. The violence began as it would continue. In one area, about 150 metres from the border fence, reporters watched two men who tried to advance towards the border fence being shot in the legs by Israeli troops. Scores more were hit in the upper body, according to health workers. Included among the Palestinian fatalities were three men the Israeli military said it had killed as they tried to place an explosive device near the border fence; 14-year-old Az-Adin Asamak; a medic; and a man in a wheelchair who had been pictured on social media using a slingshot, while Al Jazeera television said one of its reporters had been injured by Israeli live fire. Israeli jets launched airstrikes against five Hamas outposts and Israel said it was preparing for the risk of retaliatory rocket fire from Hamas in Gaza. Many of those drawn to the protests spoke of mounting desperation in Gaza where Israel’s blockade has devastated the economy, leaving unemployment for under-25s at more than 60%. “I’m here because we want our land returned. We have nothing to lose,” said Mohammad Nabieh, 25, who had been burning tyres to provide cover for the protesters. Nabieh said he was the descendant of refugees from a village near the Israeli city of Ashdod but had never been able to visit the place his family came from. “Nobody cares about us, so why to wait to die slowly. The blockade put us in a big cage – we have to get out. I’m 25 and have almost no work. What am I supposed to do? Rely on aid?” Said Gherbawi, 28, who was black with soot, had also been burning tyres. “I have no work. This is my work now. We have to keep Israelis bothered by the smoke. I don’t know any better way than this. We have to fight,” he said. Ismail Radwan, a senior Hamas figure, said the mass border protests against Israel would continue “until the rights of the Palestinian people are achieved”. Israeli troops had been reinforced along the border before the protests that coincided with Palestinians marking Nakba – or “catastrophe” – day, the annual commemoration of the displacement of Palestinians during the foundation of Israel in 1948. Israeli planes dropped leaflets warning Palestinians not to approach the fence, while amateur Israeli drone racers were recruited to bring down “incendiary kites” launched over the fence. “Even if the fence is breached,” warned Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus in advance, “we will be able to protect Israeli civilians from attempts to massacre or kidnap or kill them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/15/5-best-scenic-bike-rides-in-west-country-dorset-devon-cornwall","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T05:30:48Z","webTitle":"Five of the best scenic bike rides in the West Country","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/15/5-best-scenic-bike-rides-in-west-country-dorset-devon-cornwall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/15/5-best-scenic-bike-rides-in-west-country-dorset-devon-cornwall","fields":{"headline":"Five of the best scenic bike rides in the West Country","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Around the Purbecks Dorset Type of ride Cliffs, coast roads, wild swims and a lost village Start/finish Wareham Distance 45 miles Difficulty Challenging. Hilly; lanes with a short section of off-road cycleway Route map The “Isle” of Purbeck is not really an island but a peninsula bordered by the sea to the south and west and the River Frome to the north. It’s a geologist’s paradise, featuring sandy heath, ball clay, chalk downland, oil-bearing shale and hard limestones long prized as building materials. Much of London was rebuilt after the Great Fire with stone from Purbeck quarries. The rich geological layer cake provides a variety of wildlife habitats and the Purbeck hills are home to many species of wild flower. Note that this ride passes through the army’s Lulworth firing range. Whiteways Road (between East Lulworth and Steeple) is open almost all weekends, and all the time during the summer but check ahead on the Ministry of Defence’s website to ensure the road is open. Starting out of the fortified Saxon town of Wareham the route heads east through the heath and coniferous woodland above the largest onshore oil field in Europe. Turning west just outside Swanage, the ride passes the craggy ruins of Corfe Castle en route for the “lost village” of Tyneham: in 1943 the war office evicted its 225 residents and the village is now an open-air museum. It’s then a thrilling descent to Lulworth Cove (and a testing climb back up the same road) before heading inland on quiet lanes via Chaldon Herring to the River Frome at Moreton (there are paddling and swim spots by the ford). The church is worth a look for its engraved windows by Laurence Whistler. TE Lawrence “of Arabia”, who lived nearby, is buried in the graveyard here. Lanes on the south bank of the Frome lead back to Wareham. Food/drink/stay • Olivers in Corfe Castle is a cafe and B&amp;B in the heart of the village (doubles from £95 B&amp;B, April to October). • The Boat Shed Cafe on Main Road Lower in West Lulworth is in a perfect location overlooking the cove. Grand Tour Somerset/Wiltshire borders Type of ride Rolling countryside, stately homes, follies and a castle Start/finish Frome Distance 32 miles Difficulty Easy. Lanes and a couple of short sections of unsurfaced track. Route map Frome is a groovy, independent-minded Somerset town blessed with many handsome old buildings and some steep, narrow, cobbled streets. There’s a strong cycling scene, too. The hip bike company Charge is based here, as is the Bicycle Academy, which runs courses in framebuilding. This ride takes in two of the great treasure houses of the West Country: Longleat and Stourhead, making use of cycle paths and bridleways that allow people on bikes privileged access to their grounds. Starting out of Frome on National Cycle Route 24, quiet farm lanes lead to Longleat, the 130-room Elizabethan pile set in 10,000 acres, which includes Britain’s first safari park. It’s a real thrill riding from the house up the broad, tree-lined carriage drive to the imposing gateway. Heading south through rolling countryside on the edge of the Wessex chalk downs, the next stop is Stourhead, a Palladian mansion most famous for its gardens, which were inspired by scenes of the Grand Tour of Europe. The ride takes in a short wooded bridleway – that can get muddy after heavy rains – en route to the grandest of Stourhead’s follies: King Alfred’s Tower tops a hill on the border of Wiltshire and Somerset, reputedly the spot where Alfred the Great rallied his troops in defence of Wessex against Viking invaders. More quiet farm lanes lead to Nunney, a bewitchingly pretty village set around a moated castle. From there it’s just three miles back to Frome. Food/drink • The Seymour Arms in Witham Friary is a fabulous time-warp of an estate pub. No food served but you can bring your own. • Moat and Turret Cafe in Nunney is popular with cyclists and serves great cakes and light lunches. Widecombe Way Devon Type of ride Dartmoor explorer Start/finish Bovey Tracey Distance 32 miles Difficulty Challenging. Hilly; lanes and a railway cycle path Route map This ride begins in Bovey Tracey, the self-styled Gateway to the Moor and home to a recently opened Cafe 3 Sixty, an airy, stylish cafe, bike shop and social hub of the local cycling scene. If you’re getting here by train, the flat and mostly traffic-free Stover Trail connects from Newton Abbot station about four miles away. Any bike ride on Dartmoor is going to be hilly but this ride front-loads the climbing, when the legs are freshest. The first five miles are almost entirely uphill all the way to Haytor Rocks, Dartmoor’s most famous landmark. It’s a long and rewarding descent into Widecombe-in-the-Moor, whose church, known as the Cathedral of the Moor, towers above low-slung granite cottages with thatched roofs. From Widecombe, a sliver of tarmac lane climbs gradually up Challacombe Down. Here the desolate wildness of Dartmoor becomes startlingly apparent. Just short of the summit pass short track on the right leads to the remains of Grimspound, a large bronze age walled settlement. It’s an eerie spot and it is fitting that while researching The Hound of the Baskervilles, Arthur Conan Doyle sheltered in one of the huts to a smoke a pipe. The ride then swaps the wide open expanses of the uplands for the complex topography, patchwork fields and dense woodland of the moorland edge, passing through the lovely villages of North Bovey and Lustleigh. The last two miles follows the new Wray Valley cycleway back to Bovey Tracey.

The Dart Circular Devon Type of ride Devon lanes by a majestic river Start/finish Totnes Distance 25 miles Difficulty Moderate. Short but some steep hills. Lanes and a short section of unsurfaced cycleway Route map Queen Victoria praised the River Dart as “England’s Rhine”, which says as much about her own world view as it does about the Dart. The rivers are actually very different. The Rhine is long, wide and meandering and with a vast lowland delta, while the Dart is short, shallow and fast-flowing until Totnes, where it empties into a tidal flooded river valley. What the tidal Dart does share with the Upper Rhine is scenic grandeur, castles and country houses. This short but deceptively hilly ride begins on the traffic-free path from Totnes along the banks of the Dart towards the Sharpham estate. It’s downhill to Bow Creek, one of the fingers of the Dart and a pair of riverside pubs. The Maltsters Arms was once owned and run by Keith Floyd, the TV chef and gastronome. Over the next hill is Dittisham (pronounced Ditsham), a village that sits high on a spur overlooking the Dart and extends downhill to a little quay. Ring the bell for the tiny clinker-built ferry across the water to Greenway (£3.50 for adult plus bicycle). The childhood home of Sir Walter Raleigh, the estate was later bought as a holiday home by Agatha Christie. It’s now in the possession of the National Trust. Some very quiet lanes lead to Stoke Gabriel, another sleepy riverside village, and back via Littlehempston and over the grand stone bridge Staverton for a final run in to Totnes through the grounds of Dartington Hall. Food/drink/stay • The Maltsters Arms in Tuckenhay is a large foodie pub overlooking the river, which also has double rooms from £79 B&amp;B. • The Anchor Stone Café in Dittisham serves local seafood specials on the quayside. Promised Land Cornwall Type of ride Classic Cornwall, from tiny harbours to cliff-top mines Start/finish Penzance Distance 35 miles Difficulty Moderate. Mostly lanes with two sections of gravel track Route map Penwith is Cornwall’s Cornwall: a peninsula on a peninsula. It outdoes the rest of the county when it comes to archetypal Cornish characteristics: its coastline is wilder, its rocks are richer in ores, its fishermen catch more fish and it has more prehistoric ruins. Starting in Penzance, the ride passes the newly restored art deco saltwater lido. Trawlers mass in Newlyn’s harbour and the quayside fish shops sell the day’s catch. Around the headland is Mousehole, where tightly packed terraces rise from its compact harbour and tiny sandy beach. Heading inland, the route passes Carn Euny, one of the best-preserved prehistoric villages in the West Country (free entry). From St Just, an old mining track rounds the headland. It passes the old copper and tin mines whose chimneys and engine houses perch precariously on cliffs above the Atlantic waves. Some of the seams extended deep underground and up to half a mile out to sea. Back on the tarmac at Pendeen, the coast road east towards Zennor is a pure joy to ride, especially when the prevailing westerly tailwind is blowing. It’s a dramatic, elemental landscape: ancient patchwork fields, dark craggy cliffs on the left and shapely hills rising on the right. DH Lawrence rented a cottage near Zennor and loved it here. “This isn’t merely territory,” he wrote in a letter, “it is a new continent of the soul”. The final leg is on quiet lanes to St Michael’s Mount and then the traffic-free promenade path back to Penzance.

The claims were made under parliamentary privilege. They were based on files written by Monaco’s security services, including information from France’s DST foreign intelligence agency. Chandler is described as an “object of interest” to the DST because of his alleged Kremlin ties. “The documents indicated a link – a noted individual in this country – with Russian intelligence,” the Conservative MP Bob Seely said. Chandler dismissed the claim: “No, I’m not a Russian spy. I don’t speak Russian. I don’t know anybody in the Russian state thing.” He said he was baffled by the documents and had no idea he had been under surveillance. The French never contacted him, he said, and their operation went nowhere. “We lived peacefully in Monaco for 20 years. The whole thing is insane.” Chandler funds the Legatum Institute, a London-based thinktank which has been accused of advocating for a hard Brexit. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who has raised questions about the Kremlin’s possible role in the EU referendum, has called on the authorities to investigate. Legatum said it was an “absurd accusation to say that they had an undue influence on Brexit”. A series of exposés by the Mail on Sunday claimed that the institute’s former economics director, Shankar Singham, held clandestine meetings with Michael Gove and Boris Johnson. The goal was to pile pressure on Theresa May to leave the single market and customs union. Chandler, who lives in Dubai and received Maltese citizenship in 2015, insisted that Legatum did not have a firm stance on Brexit. Its focus was prosperity, he said. “Brexit is not our game,” he insisted. He added that he knew of Nigel Farage but was only dimly aware of Arron Banks, the main financial backer of Leave.EU, which was fined last week by the electoral commission for multiple breaches of expenditure guidelines. Asked if Russia had sought to influence the outcome of the referendum by backing leave, possibly through undercover methods, Chandler said: “I’m totally unqualified to comment. Is Russia capable of doing that? No question. Did they actually do it? I don’t know. They certainly didn’t do it through us.” He was reluctant to offer an opinion on whether the Kremlin was trying to sabotage or undermine western democracy. Nor would he say if it had sought to help Donald Trump win the 2016 US election – the consensus view of all US intelligence agencies. Chandler described the recent attempted murder in England of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal as “abhorrent”. “Probably it’s what it looks like,” he said when asked who he thought was to blame, but stressed that he was “unqualified” to judge if Moscow was ultimately behind the nerve agent operation. The businessman was already rich when he invested in Russia soon after the end of the USSR. He said he earned “hundreds of millions” from his stakes in various companies, but also invested “hundreds of millions” and lost large sums in 1998 when the Russian economy collapsed. Asked if he was the beneficiary of a corrupt system in the 1990s, which created the oligarchs but made most ordinary Russians considerably poorer, Chandler said: “We genuinely believed we could be a force for good [in Russia] by bringing our investment experience.” Chandler and his brother Richard ended up with a 4% stake in the energy company Gazprom. He said that as a minority shareholder in Russia, he came up against “well entrenched interests”. They placed damaging “kompromat” about him in the Russian media. Some of it may have reached Monaco, he suggested. The Mail on Sunday reported over the weekend that the Chandlers backed Vladimir Putin’s attempt to oust Gazprom’s chief executive and to replace him with a St Petersburg ally, Alexey Miller. The paper cited a recent pamphlet written by Richard Chandler. It said the Chandlers managed to appoint their own candidate to Gazprom’s board of directors and then “appealed directly” to the president, paving the way for Miller’s appointment. Chandler acknowledged corruption at Gazprom but said he had fought against it. He described his brother’s version of events as wrong and said he had not heard of Miller when he got the top Gazprom job in 2001. Chandler said he never met Putin and met Miller just once, in the summer of 2003. “I didn’t spend enough time to get the measure of him,” he said. Chandler said he offered ideas via an interpreter on how Gazprom might be reformed. In 2006 Chandler exited from the Russian market when he separated his business affairs from those of his brother. Richard Chandler continued to trade Gazprom stocks. The French and Monaco intelligence files stretch to 85 pages, it is understood. The businessman visits the UK rarely and does not often given interviews. He has been described as secretive. “I don’t have any secrets. I’m a regular person who likes his privacy,” Christopher Chandler told the Guardian, speaking from Legatum’s townhouse office in Mayfair. Chandler said he felt aggrieved the MPs had not contacted him before making their “erroneous” claims in the House of Commons. He said he spent several hours last week sitting in Portcullis House, where MPs have their offices, trying unsuccessfully to meet them and to make his case in person. Lawyers for Chandler have written to several parliamentary committees asking them not to publish the Monaco “dossier”. To do so, they argue, would infringe the businessman’s rights. And what about Brexit? Chandler is unwilling to say whether it’s a good idea. Or a bad one. “I think it’s up to the UK to determine,” he said. “It will be determined by what you do with it. You can make a success or a failure out of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/15/club-rugby-requires-planning-and-innovation","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"Club rugby’s inability to sell itself calls for planning and innovation | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/15/club-rugby-requires-planning-and-innovation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/15/club-rugby-requires-planning-and-innovation","fields":{"headline":"Club rugby’s inability to sell itself calls for planning and innovation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The word final is a relative term in rugby. Leinster’s European Champions Cup victory in Bilbao should logically have represented a high-profile full stop but for many it is not yet the end of the season – far from it. The Premiership and Pro14 have yet to play their semi-finals, the Top 14 final in France is not until 2 June and this summer’s hectic international tour schedule would cause even a travel agent’s head to spin. Talk to the Champions Cup organisers and they freely admit they would prefer their tournament to mirror football’s Champions League final: a natural conclusion to the season for every club in Europe. As things stand Leinster have just won the ultimate prize but, as with Saracens last year, now have to prove themselves all over again. It is a bit like hosting a royal wedding and then arranging the stag night on the subsequent weekend. Leaving aside the significant element of roulette it lends to the domestic play-offs – if Munster are not fresher than a battered Leinster this Saturday it will be a miracle – it also has an effect which, left unchecked, threatens the future growth of the entire sport. Undercutting one’s best product by shunting it into a slot in the calendar that dilutes its impact is not what is taught at business school. It is part of a wider issue: professional club rugby’s curious inability to sell itself better. The past weekend in northern Spain was a fine example of what can happen when the net is thrown a little wider. In addition to blue-clad Irish and Welsh supporters following their own teams, the people of Bilbao and San Sebastián found themselves welcoming everyone from French fans dressed in chicken outfits to a bunch of old farts from Edinburgh University on a reunion weekend. Give or take some of the more excessive hotel prices and travel disruption, spreading the rugby gospel to Spain clearly caught the imagination. Hopefully it will be the same in Newcastle next year: taking the finals somewhere outside the normal roster of Six Nations venues – Amsterdam, Milan or Munich in 2020, anyone? – may necessitate an extra financial cost but tends to be repaid many times over by the added exposure it brings the sport in places that may otherwise take little notice. Despite faithful sponsors such as Heineken and Turkish Airlines, there continues to be a sense that club rugby, as a product, should be bigger than it is. For all the fine work done by Sky Sports in covering European rugby over the past two decades – they have been edged out entirely by BT Sport for next season’s tournament – how many of Leinster’s champion XV apart from Johnny Sexton would stand a chance of being identified by the public if they strolled down a busy London street? It would be a similar story for many of England’s supposedly best‑known current players. Maybe it is time to sit down with every press officer in Britain and Ireland and, not for the first time, advise them that clubs or coaches who restrict team members from talking to the media or teach them to converse only in mind-numbing robot speak do the players and the game a major disservice. Loosening the PR shackles may even help them perform better: the individual better able to express himself off the field will surely develop into a more mature, confident presence on it. Instead of clinging to the tried and tested, why not take a risk or two? In Australia something genuinely interesting is happening: the World Series Rugby concept invented by the billionaire West Force owner, Andrew Forrest, is attracting crowds significantly in excess of Super Rugby attendances. For the second weekend in a row the exiled Western Force drew the biggest crowd in Australia, with 16,323 fans watching them beat a Tongan representative side compared with the 5,283 who watched the Brumbies against the Melbourne Rebels in Canberra. Forrest’s stated mission is to make rugby a more exciting day out and the early signs would suggest he could be on to something. With the English domestic season set to run into mid-June in future and the Test window due to shift to July, the status quo will shortly be challenged here as well. Sooner rather than later the desire for more South African teams to play in Europe will intensify to the point where it becomes a financial no-brainer. A Champions Cup final involving the Stormers or the Sharks? It might be closer than people think. As with cricket and golf, it is all part of a wider discussion rugby union should be having with itself. Sporting tastes are changing fast and what happened last year can no longer be tomorrow’s blueprint. The calendar is a vital component but so is calculated innovation. Maybe next season’s replacement for the defunct Anglo-Welsh Cup should be played under different regulations: less kicking permitted, a countdown clock for set pieces, rolling subs or fewer players, an extra on-field official to enforce the offside line properly? Or maybe not. What really matters is recognising the obvious: the traditional northern hemisphere season is too long, frustratingly structured and increasingly ripe for change. King of the Cotswolds Confirmation that Danny Cipriani and James Haskell are flying the Wasps’ nest to play for Gloucester and Northampton respectively next season provokes one obvious question: which of the three clubs concerned has done the best piece of business? Their respective league positions next season will provide the ultimate measure but Cipriani’s move to Kingsholm feels like a good move for the player. If the fly-half can light up the Cotswolds and earn the Shed’s instant respect, he will discover there are few more satisfying places in Britain to play rugby. One to watch On the subject of Cipriani, this Saturday’s Premiership semi-final between Saracens and Wasps offers a tantalising head-to-head between England’s prodigal No 10 and Owen Farrell, set to lead his country in South Africa next month. Different in style but now with identical goals, this is Cipriani’s chance to show definitively that he can shape major games against top opposition. If Wasps are given the freedom to attack as they can do, it could be the livelier of the two big sporting contests being staged in north London this Saturday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/01/dutch-fishermen-to-sail-fleet-into-amsterdam-in-wind-turbine-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T04:00:39Z","webTitle":"Dutch fishermen to sail fleet into Amsterdam in wind turbine protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/01/dutch-fishermen-to-sail-fleet-into-amsterdam-in-wind-turbine-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/01/dutch-fishermen-to-sail-fleet-into-amsterdam-in-wind-turbine-protest","fields":{"headline":"Dutch fishermen to sail fleet into Amsterdam in wind turbine protest","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Netherlands may be the land of the windmill, but fishermen are planning a major protest on Saturday against the Dutch government’s latest wind turbine construction in the North Sea, with an armada of fishing boats sailing into Amsterdam. After alighting from at least 15 boats at the back of Amsterdam’s central station, it is understood that hundreds of fishermen will march to the capital’s Damrak canal, where they will upend bags of small fish deemed too small for sale by the EU, and cover them with red dye. Fishing community leaders say they are being crowded out of their waters and that the towering turbines damage fish stocks and deafen and displace the local porpoise populations. The Dutch government has announced plans to build three more windfarms off the Noord-Holland coast and north of the Wadden Islands, in addition to five new windfarms already agreed upon, at a cost of €20 billion (£17.5bn). It is claimed by local fishermen that 25% of Dutch fishing waters will be covered with turbines by 2025 and made out of bounds for larger fishing vessels. A Dutch energy network is additionally drawing up plans for an island of wind turbines on Dogger bank, a patch of shallow fishing waters 78 miles off the east Yorkshire coast frequented by Dutch, Danish and UK fishermen. Ministers are fighting off accusations they are rushing to develop wind technology without examining the consequences on the ecology of the shallow waters being targeted. A major factor driving the ambitious round of turbine construction is the need to end extraction of gas from the Groningen fields, due to the increased strength of earthquakes in the area. Saturday’s protest is being organised by the Eendracht Maakt Kracht (Unity Brings Strength) action group, which was formed two years ago by fishermen who were unhappy with the level of activity from the two main unions. Job Schot, the chairman of the EMK group, said: “Dutch, German and British turbines are pushing us out of the southern part of the North Sea. About half a per cent of our fishing waters are covered by turbines at the moment, but it will be 25% within a decade, and in our prime fishing grounds. The government know where we fish. “They claim that the area around the windfarms creates some kind of paradise of biodiversity. It is exactly the opposite. The acoustic sound from the turbines discourages fish and if it carries on long enough they just don’t come back. There are lots of oysters and mussels around the turbines, but not fish. It’s a dead area. “The ramming of seabed kills everything within 6km. The porpoises are deafened and once they lose their hearing, they die. There has not been enough research, but we see what is happening every day.” The scientific consensus is that the use of pile drivers to pound holes into the seabed, the acoustic noise of the operating turbines and the electromagnetic fields around the transmission cables do have an impact on sea life, although findings are mixed in terms of the scale of the damage. Recent research sponsored by NoordzeeWind, a joint venture of Nuon and Shell Wind Energy, stated that offshore windfarms could have a beneficial long-term effect on wildlife, with new species being attracted to the turbine foundations and surrounding rocks. Jaap Tanis, 59, a third-generation fisherman, who owns two fishing boats running out of the harbour at Stellendam, said: “We are being squeezed out of the seas. The area we can work in is getting smaller and smaller. This harbour had 45 boats working out of it 20 years ago. It is eight or nine today. We can all see what happens to the fish when the turbines are put up.” The planned protest illustrates the frustration of the Dutch fishing industry, which has been buffeted by unwelcome developments in recent years. From the imposition of the EU’s landing obligation, which obliges fishermen to count undersized, unsellable fish as part of their quota and keep them for destruction, to the anxiety prompted by Brexit, which threatens to curtail access to UK waters, the industry feels under attack, said protest organisers. Schot added: “Brexit, the landing obligations and the windfarms are three big worries. Fishermen aren’t being heard, and the EMK was formed to give us a voice, and a bit of pride.” A government spokesman said they understood that “this is something that has implications on space for the fishing sector”. He added: “We are still having talks with the energy and fisheries sectors.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/19/aristocracy-royal-wedding-is-this-the-new-posh","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T07:00:21Z","webTitle":"'They're woke, glossy and active on Twitter': is this the new posh?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/19/aristocracy-royal-wedding-is-this-the-new-posh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/19/aristocracy-royal-wedding-is-this-the-new-posh","fields":{"headline":"'They're woke, glossy and active on Twitter': is this the new posh?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Is the aristocracy changing, in face if not in spirit? Prince Harry is marrying Meghan Markle, a divorced mixed-race television actor, parodied in the Channel 4 comedy The Windsors. “I’m Meghan from Suits,” was almost her only line, and she was always in a tracksuit pouting at Pippa Middleton, who was – in this telling – fat, evil and into Harry. According to the fashion press, which observes them closely, the dead-bird-in-the-hair toff who shops at Tesco to preserve the estate is dead, mostly from mockery. When the Bullingdon Club convened for its most recent photograph at Christchurch, Oxford, dressed as 20 Lord Nelsons, they were heckled, and someone played the Benny Hill theme tune Yackety Sax at them. These new toffs are woke, glossy and active on Twitter. They visit personal trainers and psychotherapists. Lady Violet Manners retweets criticism of antisemitism in the Labour party. Lady Kitty Spencer is an ambassador for the homeless charity Centrepoint. Some are not really toffs, but loving parodies. Georgia “Toff” Toffolo, the star of Made In Chelsea and most recent winner of I’m A Celebrity…, is the poster-girl toff of the age, signed by a newspaper to discuss toff things in a weekly column, and her father is a scrap metal dealer called Gary. To me, that proves how little the rest of us understand them. Even so, she slides through life gasping, soliciting the company of Stanley Johnson with highlights in her hair. I am Jewish, and middle-class, so I share the national obsession with class: all those childhood weekends at Hampton Court wondering why the Christopher Wren part looks like Bentalls department store. (The answer is: it’s a copy. Bentalls, not the palace.) And I have a weakness for Cardinal Wolsey, the son of a butcher, who was a sort of Tudor Georgia “Toff” Toffolo. I suppose I want to know why I am not considered as excellent as they are. My school was a parody of their schools. My university, Oxford, was built to educate them, but because the elite is self-interested enough to be porous, they let me in. It is easy to laugh at toffs and their idiocies, but they are serious about survival, and good at it. The idiocies are both a disguise and a state of national denial. I have read the data. They may be exiled from the House of Lords – except for 92 who remain, like hostages – but in central London the Grosvenors, the Russells, the Portmans and the Howard de Waldens own the land beneath your feet. Fourteen aristocrats are richer than the Queen. The Duke of Westminster is worth £9bn. Anyone who has held on to an estate and survived the collapse of land prices in the early 20th century is very rich. When I first met posh people, as a newspaper diarist 20 years ago – they were, by then, too stupid or lazy to attend Oxford in large numbers – they still matched the cliche of the 1980s, as detailed in Peter York’s Sloane Ranger Handbook. The men wore red trousers and brayed. They called me “Tarn-ya”. (They can’t compute the flat A of “Tanya”: it’s too common.) The women were slender, blond and cold. My colleague Emma Parker Bowles was rumoured to be a girlfriend of Prince William (she was not) and we had to answer the telephone on her behalf and tell other journalists to stop bothering her – a conceit she loved. The posh people didn’t stay long. It – I mean talking and thinking critically – was too much like hard work. They moved into public relations where there is less conflict, or they moved on, and Emma’s aunt is nearly Queen of England now. It is easy to observe posh people – I am a restaurant critic and I see them at Wiltons sucking claret – but much harder to know them. My posh friends – I have a few, at the edges, all male (I find the females unreliable and selfish) – are quite emotionally cauterised, unless drunk. Their best relationships with women are usually with their cleaners. It’s boarding school, I suppose; when you put on the mask that young, it’s hard to remove it. Good manners are the substitute, and it’s effective; I have met almost no one as charming or as secretive as an Old Etonian. Still, to celebrate the wedding of Harry to Meghan from Suits, I go toff hunting. It is not as easy as it sounds, especially if you are writing for the Guardian; any sniff of socialism and off they run, like hares. The Duke of Devonshire is busy, so I can relay only my reminiscences of staying in a converted stable at Chatsworth. It was not my idea. There was marketing literature in which the duke and duchess were photographed under a tagline “the best of friends”, as an incitement to become a “member” and browse the shop for books about the internal lives of chickens. There was a direct debit form on the back. Nancy Mitford once said that all toffs consider themselves poor and compete among themselves for the greatest turnover from gawping visitors. The Duke of Marlborough is also busy, but I don’t really mind because I can’t think of anything interesting to write about Blenheim, except that it’s got a very big roof. I have interviewed the next Marchioness of Bath, who lives in the old nursery suite at Longleat in the middle of a safari park and seems lost there, even if she does have a small Titian. I press on. I am assured that the Manners sisters are “media friendly” and will speak to me but, as I refuse to lie and say I am writing about social change for Vogue, they don’t. I am not allowed to visit Robin Birley’s private London club, 5 Hertford Street, although I have known the publicist since the 20th century. He is one of the red-trousered ones parodied on the blog Look At My Fucking Red Trousers, which exists to disseminate photographs of men wearing red trousers, or sometimes photographs of the trousers by themselves. Laugh at the trousers; ignore the stranglehold. I am not allowed into the new Annabel’s, not even when it is closed. I have a flashback to the time that a publicist from Quintessentially – a concierge company co-founded by the Duchess of Cornwall’s nephew Ben Elliot – called me a chav. I emailed her to say I had been asked to write about Quintessentially for a magazine. She replied, “Nice try, chav.” Fifteen years later, I am still trying to compose an adequate reply. I consider going to an open day at the Royal Agricultural University at Cirencester and pretending I want to take a BSc (Hons) in rural land management, but that would be awkward (I am 44). So, instead, I go to the Cheltenham festival, to see them in groups doing what they love: watching horses running from point A to point B very fast. They look like a vast curling dragon made of Barbour. The Duchess of Cornwall wanders into the parade ring to congratulate someone on owning a very expensive horse that has won a race. There is a clear divide between the old and young female toff: the older ones are not vain, not at all (that is the confidence of status) and are dressed for wind, like igloos; the younger ones, vulnerable to celebrity culture and fashion idiocy, are. They are ferociously styled in a sort of mass Crocodile Dundee chic; many wear ponchos, and rancher-style hats on blond heads, as if they are popping off to murder a cow before cocktails. We watch from a sort of amphitheatre called the parade ring and clap the horses (I hope it is the horses); aristocracy as spectacle, as it always was. I have forgotten, despite my diarist’s training, how difficult it is to infiltrate these circles, even if I had faith that they could define themselves in their own words – which they can’t, because they have never had to. (You can count the good toff novelists on one hand.) Words come almost always from unease, and they have none. But I have plenty. I walk up to the Duke of Beaufort and say hello. I once met him at a party, and he was friendly then, possibly because I was with a posh girl who had the talent of waving her arms about and talking about nothing, with soaring cadences, and looking lovely doing it. Hello, Bunter, I say now. (Silly names are an essential part of the camouflage. It’s hard to fear someone named after a cartoon character or dog.) He looks at me as if I am a piece of garden furniture that has spoken, and mutters an incomprehensible half-syllable. It is a moan for me to go away; it is barely speech. I am invited to dine in a private members’ club called Albert’s, named for Queen Victoria’s Prince Consort, which is, very occasionally, opened to non-members. Stylistically, it is horrifying: coked-up Balmoral, if you can imagine such a thing. There are paintings of horses and an installation of what I suspect are fake ecstasy pills, branded Hermès. We eat the sort of food you get in any gentleman’s club, in vast portions – fish, red meat, caviar – and watch, as the dining room is turned into a nightclub. Young toffs scream and play with their hair. Ancient toffs dance to 70s trash disco, commemorating some anniversary known only to themselves. And then I find one who is willing to speak to me. His name is Francis Fulford and he starred in the reality TV show The Fucking Fulfords – for money, he said on screen. (He has 3,000 acres that are worth £30m.) His family have lived at Great Fulford, Devon, for 27 or 28 generations – he isn’t sure – or since Richard the Lionheart’s time. I meet him there, in a four-square crenellated house with a central courtyard in which two small and shabby cars are parked. He wears brown cords and a blue jumper. He is shadowed by a big dog and a little dog. His voice is extraordinary. It rises and falls, very slowly. Posh people never speak fast. They do not have to, because they have an expectation of being listened to. I understand perhaps a third of what he says to me in person, half of what I have on the Dictaphone. We speak in an old kitchen with an Aga, except it’s the new kitchen: the old kitchen is down a cold, stone passageway. It’s Tudor. Perhaps it is because I don’t know any aristocrats intimately, but Fulford seems barely of this world. He is not a buffoon. There are books everywhere; that aristocrats don’t read is a myth. They simply prefer to hide their cleverness, as they hide their ruthlessness; it’s the art of war. He goes to Sainsbury’s to buy cheap wine on special offer, and mows his own parkland, but he speaks of dead men – Oliver Cromwell, Thomas Becket, who was murdered by his ancestor Reginald Fitzurse – as if they are personally known to him. His cares are unusual. “If you have a house like this,” he says, “and land, you spend your entire time planning your death. Ever since I’ve been born, I’ve been planning my death. It is slightly depressing.” He has a slight persecution complex. There is his resentment towards Cromwell, which is understandable because he tried to blow up his house, and also “the tax man. He has always aimed to destroy us as much as possible”. At one point he asks me, without irony, “What’s the nation ever done for me or my family?” His father died in 1969, when he was 17. “Those days were bloody awful, especially for places like this. JR Milne said the country house as we know it is like the osprey, doomed to extinction. In 20 years there will be none left apart from a few in public ownership or the National Trust.” Fulford’s life is not so different from his father’s. He does less public service, locals do not doff their caps (they do not wear them) and he has no full-time servants. The deference has gone, but the money has not. “Nothing changes – we still live in the country, still make money from agriculture, still follow country pursuits.” He entertains to earn money: “A few business events, a couple of music festivals, a few tours of the house, people staying for shooting, the odd wedding, the odd stag party.” We tour the house. He doesn’t know how many rooms he has. In the yard, which is medieval, there is a designated area for making gates. His coat of arms is on a bin. He doesn’t think primogeniture, which kept these estates intact, while those in continental Europe were divided, is unfair: “The aim is always to try and pass on to your son something in a better state than when you received it. I think if I died tomorrow and did go up and meet my father and my ancestors, I would be able to look them in the eye.” At the end he lets me photograph him with a dead squirrel, killed in a trap. Fulford leaves me with a definitive insight. “The aim,” he says, “is to survive.” He then disposes of the squirrel, which did not. Tom Galbraith, who used to be the Tory leader in the House of Lords, tells me you cannot understand the aristocracy in terms of centuries. They think, and plan, in millennia. They are flesh, not stone, and they adapt with every generation to the world that is. And so you might think Harry and his set have nothing in common with the Fulfords. They behave more like the international rich, whose obscene wealth fuels the idea that the land-owning British aristocracy are comparatively poor, and their addled sense of victimhood, which is simply the misery of not having everything your own way, as in 1311. They visit Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire and dress like the younger Trumps; they drive new Land Rovers and drink Grey Goose vodka martinis; Harry pretends to be a feminist, though possibly only to impress a woman. It is a sheen of “democratisation” that is, if you think critically, nothing of the sort. Marrying a middle-class girl and talking nonsense about equality when your entire existence is dependent on hereditary power is not a radical act. It is hypocrisy, and the theft of language from others who need it more. Peter York says the aristocracy are less boastful than they used to be – this is camouflage again, a strategy for survival in a quasi-equal age. They are leaky: they try to suck anything dangerous, or potentially profitable upwards, and plenty fall away – so the marriage of Harry to Meghan is not so strange. Rather it is the natural progression of a class that acts, despite the propaganda that calls privilege duty, in its own interests. (I doubt Harry’s feminism will aid one single woman.) Aristocrats have always married heiresses, and Americans, and even Jews. They will take the tribute toffs and the interlopers, if they are loyal, and grateful, and fix the roof, and steady the power; anything to push the good ship Class onwards. • Commenting on this piece?

The International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Cicig) has dented the immunity long enjoyed by the country’s criminal rich and powerful, using 21st-century law enforcement techniques such as witness protection, wiretapping and covert operations to expose criminal networks. The UN-backed force is Latin America’s most successful and popular anti-corruption venture, and is reviled by corrupt officials and criminal networks in Guatemala. It is also currently leading corruption investigations against the country’s president, Jimmy Morales, and his family. These opponents now have an unlikely ally in Washington DC: the Republican senator Marco Rubio, who last week suspended US aid to Cicig amid claims of Kremlin infiltration. “This was a stich-up. Rubio changed policy after hearing one side … this is a classic fake news scenario,” said Jo-Marie Burt, Guatemalan expert from the Washington Office on Latin America. In what appeared to be a separate assault on Cicig, Sweden’s ambassador, Anders Kompass, was last week declared persona non grata and given 30 days to leave the country. The official justification for the move was that Kompass meddled in domestic affairs by describing Guatemala as a “corrupt society”, but observers said that the real aim was to remove a prominent supporter of Cicig, which Sweden – along with the US and the European Union – has supported financially. “The most reasonable explanation for demanding ambassador Kompass’s withdrawal is to weaken Sweden’s diplomatic and financial support to Cicig,” the former foreign minister Fernando Carrera told the Guardian. “[Guatemala] has not experienced such international isolation since the worst years of the armed conflict.” Cicig was created in 2007 to tackle impunity and help dismantle an alliance of criminal networks and clandestine security structures operating as a “corporate mafia state”. This complex web of economic, political and military elites – and common criminals – infiltrated public institutions following the 1996 peace accords to end the 36-year armed conflict. Since then, Cicig has helped transform the country’s criminal justice system, resulting in the prosecution of scores of high-impact cases including human and drug trafficking rings, corrupt judges and retired generals accused of masterminding civil war atrocities and criminal syndicates. Its most high-profile victory was a joint investigation with public prosecutors into a multimillion-dollar customs fraud which in 2015 toppled President Otto Pérez Molina, who is now awaiting trial. Morales, a former comedian best known as part of a blackface double act, was elected in 2015 pledging support for Cicig while promising he was “neither corrupt nor a thief”. But since August 2017 prosecutors have made three requests to impeach the president over separate criminal charges. Morales, meanwhile has fronted a broad campaign to weaken Cicig. He declared the commission’s Colombian chief, Iván Velásquez, persona non grata – an order later ruled unconstitutional – and appointed a new attorney general, María Porras, who has no track record in tackling corruption. When she takes over next week, one of her first decisions will be whether to pursue charges against Morales and his party after the outgoing attorney general and Cicig detailed evidence of illegal campaign funding worth almost $800,000. Last week’s diplomatic expulsions were a blow for anti-impunity crusaders, still reeling from Rubio’s move to suspend funding. The Florida senator said that his decision was motivated by the case of a Russian exile family convicted by Cicig on charges of identity fraud. The Bitkovs were prosecuted as part of a broader investigation into high-level corruption at the immigration office which has so far resulted in more than 40 convictions. But Rubio, chair of the western hemisphere subcommittee, seized upon the Bitkov case after a Wall Street Journal editorial blamed their lengthy jail sentences (which are under appeal) on Russian interference. Cicig has never received funds from Russia. Rubio suspended the $6m Senate funding – a third of the annual budget – after a Helsinki Commission hearing which Cicig didn’t attend, and to which no Guatemalan experts were invited. “Given that Cicig is funded significantly by US taxpayer dollars, Senator Rubio is currently holding $6m while Congress fulfils its oversight role … to ensure [Cicig] is upholding its mandate to fight corruption in Guatemala,” Rubio’s office said. But the commission did not hear how the whistleblower who triggered the immigration office fraud investigation was murdered in 2010, three months after reporting death threats. Meanwhile in Guatemala, the murder of three campesino leaders – Luis Arturo Marroquín, José Can Xol and Mateo Chamán Paausince Rubio – within a week has prompted calls to strengthen not weaken crime fighting. Political analyst Luis Solano said losing US support would be a financial and political blow for Cicig, but also counterproductive to America’s own interests. “It would strengthen ultraconservative groups, and encourage the organized crime structures and parallel power groups to which they are linked.” • This article was amended on 24 May 2018. Cicig was invited to attend the Helsinki Commission hearing, however did not attend. Rubio didn’t chair that meeting, as an earlier version suggested, but did participate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/14/trawlerman-airlifted-after-being-bitten-by-shark-caught-in-nets-lands-end","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T16:20:30Z","webTitle":"Trawlerman airlifted after being bitten by shark caught in nets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/trawlerman-airlifted-after-being-bitten-by-shark-caught-in-nets-lands-end","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/trawlerman-airlifted-after-being-bitten-by-shark-caught-in-nets-lands-end","fields":{"headline":"Trawlerman airlifted after being bitten by shark caught in nets","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A fisherman was airlifted to hospital after being bitten on the leg by a shark landed on a boat off the Cornish coast. Crewmates of Max Berryman, 21, tended to his wounds before a coastguard helicopter winched him off the vessel and back to the mainland. The porbeagle shark was hauled up by the crew of the Govenek of Ladram in a net more than 100 miles off Land’s End. Crew members sterilised and dressed Berryman’s wounds and called for help. The helicopter flew from Newquay in north Cornwall to the 23-metre vessel on Sunday morning and Julian “Bungi” Williams, a paramedic, was lowered on to the boat to attend to Berryman before the fisherman was winched up to the helicopter. Berryman, from Penzance, was taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital in Truro. Williams said: “The crew had done a really good job of dressing the wounds before we arrived, which meant that we were able to save time getting the casualty to hospital. We understand that the porbeagle shark was on the deck when the incident happened but as the crew were attempting to put it back in the sea one of the fisherman was bitten in the process.” Alex Grieg, a senior maritime operations officer for HM Coastguard, said: “Thanks to the efforts of the crew onboard and their swift actions in treating the wounds and contacting us, we were able to arrange the evacuation of the crew member promptly and get him to hospital. We understand the fisherman is still in hospital and wish him a speedy recovery.” Berryman has been a crew member of the Govenek for about two years. A year ago, he was pictured with a porbeagle shark that had also got caught in the nets. Tony Fitzsimmons, a photographer who knows the boat and crew, said they would have been fishing for hake rather than shark. “It is just one of those freak things that have happened,” he said. “This particular crew were a great team, Max was the youngest, but they were all a fantastic bunch and knew what they were doing. They all had each other’s backs.” According to the Marine Conservation Society, a porbeagle shark is usually 2-3 metres long. The animal is found in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean and its status is “vulnerable”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/16/oneplus-6-smartphone-launch-all-glass-design-big-screen-notch","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T17:00:05Z","webTitle":"OnePlus 6: all glass, bigger screen phone takes iPhone X challenge up a notch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/16/oneplus-6-smartphone-launch-all-glass-design-big-screen-notch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/16/oneplus-6-smartphone-launch-all-glass-design-big-screen-notch","fields":{"headline":"OnePlus 6: all glass, bigger screen phone takes iPhone X challenge up a notch","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With the new OnePlus 6 the Chinese upstart smartphone manufacturer wants to steal people away from Apple, offering an iPhone X-like smartphone complete with “notch” for less than half the price. The new smartphone has a large 6.28in screen squeezed into a body the same size as last year’s OnePlus 5, which had a smaller 5.5in screen, and bigger still than the OnePlus 5T’s 6in screen. Launched at an event in London on Wednesday, the OnePlus 6 comes equipped with the latest top-of-the-range Snapdragon 845 processor from Qualcomm, at least 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus the latest version of Android 8.1 Oreo. The OnePlus 6 is the company’s first flagship phone with glass on the front and back, replacing last year’s curved aluminium with various finishes of curved glass. The phone still has a headphone jack, unlike the majority of the current premium smartphones, and is partially water resistant – although OnePlus has not gained an IP rating for the device as rivals have. The full HD+ AMOLED screen has a cut out at the top containing a speaker, sensors and a 16-megapixel selfie camera that is used for facial recognition, which OnePlus claims is one of the fastest on the market, using over 100 identifiers for security. Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight, said: “It looks like 2018 is most definitely the “year of the notch” when it comes to premium smartphones. Once again, Apple has emerged as the trendsetter with regards to smartphone design, but my own personal view is that its facial recognition is still the benchmark to beat despite bold claims by rivals.” A new dual camera system with optical image stabilisation hopes to keep pace with rivals, placed vertically on the back and offering better low-light shots and portrait mode. Below the camera is a rear oval-shaped fingerprint scanner. The OnePlus 6 runs the company’s modified version of Android called OxygenOS, which it says will stay as fast on day 365 as it does on day one out of the box – a common criticism of Android smartphones is that they slow down over time. The company claims the OnePlus 6 will therefore have “no lag of any kind”. The OnePlus 6 is also one of a small collection of smartphones eligible for the Android 9 P beta test, which was recently made available for Google’s Pixel devices. The hope is that OnePlus will be able deliver rapid updates, addressing another pain point for Android smartphones, which can wait up to 12 months for major software updates. The new phone supports two sim cards at once, and also has OnePlus’s Dash Charge fast charging system, which the company says will give the phone a day’s worth of battery in just 30 minutes. For Wood, OnePlus has ticked enough boxes to keep its dedicated followers happy, using the best technology available within the sub-£500 price boundary. But differentiating it against competitors will remain difficult. “The bigger challenge of making the new phone stand out from rivals is more problematic,” said Wood. “For all smartphone makers this is harder than ever before as devices look more similar than ever.” The OnePlus 6 will be available from 22 May starting at £469 ($529) with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage in a gloss “mirror” black colour, with a matt “midnight” black costing £519 with more memory and storage, and a “silk” white colour available on 5 June. The phone will be available direct from OnePlus or through O2 in the UK.

Documents obtained by the Guardian reveal that a network of radical conservative thinktanks spanning all 50 states is planning direct marketing campaigns targeted personally at union members to encourage them to quit. The secret push, the group hopes, could cost unions up to a fifth of their 7 million members, lead to the loss of millions of dollars in income and undermine a cornerstone of US progressive politics. “Well run opt-out campaigns can cause public-sector unions to experience 5 to 20% declines in membership, costing hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in dues money. This can affect the resources and attention available for union leaders to devote to political action campaigns,” the internal documents say. The anti-union marketing drive is the brainchild of the State Policy Network (SPN), a coast-to-coast alliance of 66 rightwing thinktanks that has an $80m war chest to promote Donald Trump-friendly regressive policies such as low taxes and small government. The group is funded by such billionaire conservative donors as the Koch brothers and the Walton Family Foundation that stems from the Walmart fortune. Previous SPN literature exposed by the Guardian has revealed the political motives behind the network’s attacks on unions. It aims to “defund and defang” public sector unions as a means to “reverse the failed policies of the American left”. The goal, the group said, was “permanently depriving the left from access to millions of dollars in dues extracted from unwilling union members every election cycle”. The Guardian has now obtained what SPN is calling a “toolkit” of advice to its followers on how to go about fomenting “union reform” – a euphemism for draining unions of members and cash. The “toolkit” sets out four “tactics” for depleting their power – “effective union reform”, in its language. One of those tactics is the opt-out campaign. “To get employees to opt-out of their union,” the documents say, “they first need to know they have a choice. A direct marketing campaign to union represented public employees that combines mail and digital outreach helps raise awareness and raise opt-out rates.” The SPN blueprint sets out how to acquire the private details of union members through state freedom of information laws so that opt-out propaganda can be targeted directly at them. It says: “Access to lists of union members is essential to this project. The most common means of obtaining lists is through requests made under state public records laws.” The toolkit is being circulated at a vital moment for public sector trade unions. The wave of school teachers’ strikes in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado and elsewhere has reinvigorated the labor movement as a key part of the resistance to stagnating wages, waning resources and a hostile White House. More perilously, the US supreme court is poised to deliver its ruling any day in Janus v AFSCME, one of the most important trade union cases in recent times. If the five conservative justices on the highest court vote in favor of the anti-union plaintiff, as many expect, they would deal a severe blow to organized labor by giving employees the right to opt-out of paying their share of the costs of collective bargaining even though they benefit from negotiated higher wages and improved conditions. That in turn would give the green light to conservative groups like SPN to step up their efforts to encourage mass resignations of union members. As a clear statement of intent, SPN invited Mark Janus, a child support worker in Illinois who is the named plaintiff at the center of the supreme court case, to speak at its annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas, last August. Carrie Conko, SPN’s vice president of communications, said that “workers should be able to decide for themselves if payment of union dues and fees is a good use of their hard-earned money or if their money is better spent elsewhere”. SPN’s aim was not political, rather it was “simply about protecting free speech”. Public-sector unions had created a problem for themselves, Conko said, by leaving some workers to feel they were being used. The Janus case might actually help government unions improve their standing with members as “they will need to prove their worth by providing better representation to earn the voluntary dues”. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the Guardian documents revealed the extent of secret planning by rightwing groups in advance of the supreme court’s Janus ruling. “These documents make clear that Janus v AFSCME is not a case brought by individuals trying to have a voice, it’s a case brought by wealthy forces to eliminate worker voice and power.” She added that rightwing billionaires such as the Kochs “know working families only have power through their unity as a union, and they will stop at nothing to destroy that. But we have seen unprecedented support for our unions and the opportunities they enable for a better life – when the Janus decision day comes, we will stand united, ready to act and fight back against the forces that want to silence workers.” One of the SPN thinktanks, the Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington state, has already begun campaigning and fundraising on the back of a Janus ruling that goes against the unions. It has been mailing out to supporters in which it says “we are gearing up in a major way to launch an extensive education and activation campaign to take full advantage of a favorable ruling in this historic case”. The foundation goes on to say: “The consequences of a favorable ruling are huge. Imagine tens, even hundreds, of millions of dollars currently used to push damaging leftwing causes and candidates … vanishing.” In 2016 the Freedom Foundation ran a brazen campaign in Washington and Oregon in which it went knocking on the doors of more than 10,000 childcare and home care workers telling them that under a previous US supreme court ruling they could opt out of paying union dues. In the document obtained by the Guardian, SPN boasts that the foundation’s operation cost the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) in those states $8.8m in lost dues and legal fees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/eight-out-of-ten-women-stressed-why","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T15:15:17Z","webTitle":"Eight out of 10 of women have felt unable to cope in the past year – here's why we're so stressed | Chitra Ramaswamy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/eight-out-of-ten-women-stressed-why","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/eight-out-of-ten-women-stressed-why","fields":{"headline":"Eight out of 10 of women have felt unable to cope in the past year – here's why we're so stressed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Like every other age known to humankind, these are hard times to be a woman. According to the UK’s biggest survey into the impact of stress, 81% say they have felt overwhelmed or unable to cope in the past year (compared with 67% of men). The other 19% were probably too damn busy, or perhaps just drained by being paid less than the man sitting next to them, to respond. For those of us doing the woman thing day in, day out, this inordinately high figure is about as shocking as misogyny still being rife at Cannes. I am, like most women I know, one of the 81%. There have been moments in the past year when I have felt overwhelmed by what life has hurled at me. Major moments such as my son receiving an autism diagnosis less than a week after I gave birth to my daughter. But also minor moments, because that’s the weirdly indiscriminate nature of stress, including finding out I was only entitled to £27 a week state maternity pay, which, thankfully, turned out to be an error. Or, some days, the hell that can be simply leaving the flat. When I’m on my own with an impatient four-year-old slamming the door repeatedly, a screaming baby on one hip, a dog in the histrionic throes of separation anxiety and a buggy that refuses to open, the stress can momentarily be as overwhelming as when I’m in genuine crisis. It’s not hard to identify the causes, and I’m not talking about hormones or some innate biological sensitivity, both of which are routinely given as reasons why women experience more stress than men. I’m talking about deep and growing inequality, otherwise known as the cause that doesn’t blame women. The gender pay gap, which results in profound workplace stress – alongside increased levels of sexism and harassment – for women. Stress is what happens when we are not supported to do what needs to be done. And women’s work, paid and unpaid, is both structurally undervalued, and, famously, never done. This is why women working in heavily male-dominated workplaces suffer greater stress than in more gender-balanced environments. It’s why women’s stress has been shown to peak between the ages of 35 and 44, my own age bracket, when we are at the apex of juggling work and caring responsibilities. It’s why women are twice as likely to experience anxiety as men. Not because we aren’t coping, but because too much is being asked of us for too little pay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/20/veloscnic-cycle-route-from-paris-to-mont-saint-michel-normandy","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T09:00:53Z","webTitle":"Norman conquest: cycling from Paris to Mont Saint-Michel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/20/veloscnic-cycle-route-from-paris-to-mont-saint-michel-normandy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/20/veloscnic-cycle-route-from-paris-to-mont-saint-michel-normandy","fields":{"headline":"Norman conquest: cycling from Paris to Mont Saint-Michel","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Four regions, eight départements, three parcs naturels, four Unesco world heritage sites and, if you’re lucky, one wannabe Marcel Proust … Welcome to the Véloscénic, the long-distance cycleway from Paris to Le Mont Saint-Michel that opened in 2013 and now, at last, has its very own guidebook in English. Richard Peace’s slim volume, Veloscenic: Paris-Versailles-Mont Saint Michel By Bike, came out in March and splits the 281-mile route into 10 easily rideable sections. Along with detailed mapping and directions, it includes photographs and useful information on bike hire, attractions and accommodation, such as the boutique Hotel Jeu de Paume (doubles from €85 room-only) just around the corner from Versailles, where I spent my first night. At Paris’s Gare du Nord, I picked up a hybrid hire bike, and headed for the starting point at Notre Dame cathedral. With some help from the guidebook, I eventually found the Véloscénic route, a largely traffic-free greenway snaking south-west through the suburbs towards the château at Sceaux. I’d given myself six days to get to Mont Saint-Michel, covering nearly 50 miles a day. That may seem quite a distance, but the course the Véloscénic charts across north-west France is not just picturesque but remarkably flat and cycle-friendly. A full 115 miles of it is on traffic-free greenways, including two extended lengths of disused railway line on which the miles flew by. (Even the most challenging section – a 15-mile stretch between Alençon and Carrouges, which I tackled on day four – is little more than a series of gentle inclines culminating in the very pleasing Château de Carrouges, where I ate a picnic lunch on the terrace.) My second day was spent under a broiling sun amid arable farmland, woods and hamlets. I replenished my dwindling stock of water by working a little rotary pump by the crumbly stone church at Choisel; and indulged my inner-schoolboy at Rambolitrain, the wonderful little model railway museum in Rambouillet, where over a quarter of a mile of tiny track passes through lovingly handcrafted scenery recreating the local area in the 1930s. I still had enough time in the day to fall in love. The Château de Maintenon is on a more human scale than Versailles and was my favourite of the many imposing chateaux on the route. It was built by Madame de Maintenon with the spare change given to her by her lover, Louis XIV. The lush gardens include the picturesque remains of a stone aqueduct, a folly that was intended to take water 50 miles from the Eure river to Versailles but managed only 32 before the Sun King’s finances dried up. The Véloscénic traces a long-established pilgrimage route and, sweeping around a corner, I experienced something of the shock the medieval faithful must have felt at their first sight of Chartres cathedral, a colossus dominating the landscape for miles around. It was a pleasant contrast to find myself in the rather humbler surroundings of La Maison de Tante Léonie, 17 miles south-west of Chartres. Léonie was Marcel Proust’s aunt, and her home in the small town of Illiers-Combray features heavily in A la Récherche du Temps Perdu, the author’s wistful exploration of the mysteries of memory. The museum is a little piece of lost time itself: filled with furniture and objects that Proust himself would have known. The small towns along the Véloscénic all offer good-quality hotels, pensions and chambres d’hôtes. In the village of Thiron-Gardais, for example, I had a room at L’Auberge de l’Abbaye (doubles from €75 room-only) overlooking a delightful walled garden with an abbey behind it. My dinner included some combinations I’d never experienced before: beetroot, crystallised orange and spring onions on pearl barley may never become the new avocado-on-toast but it was surprisingly tasty. At Nogent-le-Rotrou, former capital of the Perche region, Château Saint-Jean is a hulking great Norman affair presiding over a town whose Saturday market I plundered for fresh produce to eat on the banks of the Huisne. Surging into Normandy on quiet country lanes, my way was garlanded with bluebells, cowslips and purple orchids. I scooted through the Andaines forest to spend the night in Bagnoles de l’Orne, where the French come in droves to improve their physical wellbeing in the town’s spas while risking their financial health at its casino. The sight of orchards near Domfront reminded me that the guidebook had promised some time in perry and cider country. The Musée du Poiré is in a former perry-producing farm, and after I’d gawped at some fantastical contraptions from days of yore, I enjoyed a little dégustation. Then came the difficult task of choosing just one bottle from the vast range of local perry, cider and calvados to pack into my pannier. And so to Mont Saint-Michel. Or nearly, anyway. Having ridden 280 miles from Paris, I was defeated on the last stretch. In summer, bicycles aren’t allowed on the controversial new(ish) bridge to the tidal island, so I had to park my steed and walk the final mile. This “Marvel of the West” is more than a tad touristy, but the abbey that dominates the little hill is still something else: a writhing mass of medieval chapels, cloisters and crypts, balancing precariously on each other’s shoulders. I drank in the view of the immense sandy bay from on high as the afternoon sun bathed the entire scene in glory. From somewhere deep within the complex came the timeless sound of nuns singing a mass. • The trip was organised by La Véloscénic.

I mention this simply to remind you, as the wedding season rears up once more, that not all unions end safely and happily. And, perhaps more pressingly, because this means that in 10 years’ time there is a high chance you won’t give a monkey’s about floral arrangements, seating plans or whether or not you served non-GMO seitan in your vegan canapes. Still, at this time of year, and with a royal wedding now tantalisingly close, it is worth considering how much weddings have changed in the past few years. These days, most of us get married later – 35 for women and 37 for men – often after years of cohabitation and frequently after parenthood. We have same-sex weddings, friends as celebrants, male bridesmaids, divorced in-laws, second marriages, pies instead of fruitcake, and weddings on submarines and beaches and the London Eye, all of which demands a new kind of wedding etiquette. Should llamas or other animals be included in the wedding party? Let us consider the cautionary tale of Jeni Arrowsmith and Mark Wood, a couple from Wrexham who recently hired an owl to deliver their wedding rings. Sadly, after Bobby the barn owl had made his flight across the church, the waiting best man struggled to unclip the rings from his claw. Bobby became agitated and, distracted by an arm movement, descended on one of the groomsmen, who happened to have a terrible fear of birds. Despite the chance of such rogue turn of events, an increasing number of couples do choose to involve animals in their weddings, particularly their own pets. “Dogs are very common now, especially at the festival, boho, outside weddings,” says Kat Williams, the founder of the alternative wedding blog Rock n Roll Bride. Williams recalls a bride who walked down the aisle carrying her pet rabbit rather than a bouquet, and tells how her own sister employed a small herd of llamas to greet guests at her reception. But it is important to remember that the wellbeing of your beasts remains the priority – they should be fed, watered and cared for, and, should you be hiring them just for the day, you have a responsibility to investigate the credentials of the company you contract. Finally, keep in mind the solemn words of Anne-Marie Curtis, the editor-in-chief of Elle Wedding: “Introducing animals to a wedding can overcomplicate something that is already quite complicated.” Do bridesmaids have to wear identical dresses (even if it only suits one or two of them)? One of the principal duties of bridesmaids used to be to confuse evil spirits and jealous suitors who might try to snaffle away the bride before she could even say her vows. They did this by cunningly dressing identically to the bride and similarly veiling their faces. Today, they perform the same duty more subtly – by wearing matching satin 50s numbers from Monsoon and mainlining enough prosecco to become incomprehensible by 7pm. Nevertheless, some brides have begun to break with convention here. “Some people do still want to have six child bridesmaids scattering rose petals,” says Curtis, “but you can also just have one friend,” and this could be a male friend. Williams notes the identical dresses are also on the wane, and these days “the mismatched look is really popular. So you might choose the same dress in different colours, or pick a colour and let your bridesmaids choose a dress style that fits their shape.” That should certainly keep the evil spirits on their toes. How risque should the wedding speeches be? In the good old days you knew exactly where you were with speeches: a few tender words, thanks, and compliments to the bridesmaids from the groom, a misty-eyed tribute from the father of the bride, and a kind but fruity performance from the best man with no more than three allusions to previous girlfriends and whatever may or may not have gone on during the stag weekend in Magaluf. It was the point in a wedding day where guests could sit back and wonder at the simple glory of men speaking, very much like a boardroom meeting, or party conference, or a BBC panel game or, well, most situations in life ever. Sadly, since approximately 2014, women have been tiresomely harping on about their right to speak too, and now weddings frequently feature speeches from brides, bridesmaids and brides’ mothers. “Generally, weddings are events where you attend to tradition, but a lot of brides are questioning and challenging that tradition,” says Lucy Hume, an associate director at Debrett’s, which offers a wedding handbook and consultancy service. She advises that, especially if the wedding features more than three speakers, “ideally your speech should last around 10 minutes”. For anyone giving a best man or best woman’s speech, it is best to avoid props. “It’s always the best men who get out the PowerPoint presentation and everyone groans,” says Williams. “I think that’s on the way out.” And as far as risque anecdotes are concerned, she believes most guests are fairly unshockable these days. Still, she says, a good rule of thumb is: “Is the bride or groom going to kill you? Because it’s a fine line between embarrassing them and mortifying them.” Should you ban phones and social media? Getting married in a technological age throws up many conundrums. Should you liveblog your vows? Ought you to invite Alexa to the wedding? Chief among them is the role of mobile phones and social media. Some couples opt for entirely phone-free weddings, while others encourage you to hashtag the hell out of the nuptials. “There’s no official etiquette,” says Hume. “Except when it comes to the ceremony, and then the celebrant may ask guests not to take photographs.” And some of it is plain common sense – what bride wants to see a video of herself dancing to Cardi B on a trestle table at 3am with the caption #helenandsuewed? Williams notes the futility of guests recording the ceremony on their phones: “It’s like being at a gig and there’s a sea of phones and you think, ‘When are you ever going to watch that?’” And it is perhaps best to ignore the whole idea of social media. “I think the pressure to post on the day adds a whole level of stress,” says Curtis. “And you really want to immerse yourself in the day itself.” Still, says Williams, “A social media ban is a bit harsh. It’s not the Met Gala.” Is it acceptable to set up a wedding list if you’re already living together? It is easy to forget that in the olden days couples did not live together before marriage, setting up home together only after the big day. Wedding gift lists hail from this time and were designed to soften the blow when you realised that you had committed yourself to a lifetime with a man who eats with his mouth open, or a woman who sniffs – quietly, perhaps, but with the soul-destroying persistence of a dripping tap. Do gift lists really have any place in the modern world where most couples cohabit before they marry? “It really depends what life stage you’re at,” says Curtis. “It’s not necessarily about needing to set up house, but I think as a rule some kind of list can be helpful to guests.” Asking for cold hard cash is unfortunately still a touch outre. “There is still a resistance to people asking for it,” says Hume, although Williams points out that some wedding-list sites offer a monetary option. “If it goes through a company it feels less like you’re asking for cash in an envelope,” she says. Alternatively, you could suggest guests make donations to charity – although this can bring its own issues. For instance, my ex-husband and I are still joint owners of a small copse in east Lancashire as a result of our effort to hold a carbon-neutral wedding by encouraging guests to give to a tree-planting charity. We have not discussed visitation rights. Should you have an expensive, elaborate stag or hen do? Hen and stag dos are, according to Williams, “more popular than ever”, with some brides and grooms choosing to have more than one – a thought frankly more terrifying for the residents of Blackpool than the prospect of fracking on the Fylde coast. The thing to remember, says Curtis, is that hen or stag dos need not be expensive, elaborative or exclusive. “In this time-poor age, a hen or a stag do can be a nice way to spend time together, but everyone should be in agreement; you have to make sure everybody’s comfortable and everybody’s having fun.” This extends, of course, to those employed to assist your event, be that the model in your life-drawing class, the waitress at your dinner or any member of the Chippendales. Such occasions are not an excuse to act like a boorish wazzock, even if you are dressed as She-Ra and chained to a unicycle. Should you choreograph your first dance? Approximately five years ago, surprise choreography became an almost inescapable part of wedding theatre – brides backflipping down the aisle, flashmobs, first dances where the ballad screeched to a halt and the happy couple suddenly launched into an elaborately well-rehearsed routine to Sir Mix-a-Lot. Indeed, it is now something of a relief for an entire wedding dance to go by without a romantic Uptown Funk breakout. “Maybe we have reached peak first dance,” says Hume, although she adds that there is really nothing wrong with a couple taking a preparatory class or two if they feel nervous about dancing in front of their guests. The performative moments of a wedding are a result of not just our wearisome social media age, but, says Curtis, an increasing pressure for couples to make their weddings feel more personal. “We’re all much bigger showoffs than we used to be,” she says. “And making a wedding more personal can become harder because there are no rules to follow. In some ways, it might have been easier when the bride’s parents paid for everything and you all trundled off down to the local church. But, you know, the best parts of any wedding are always the unchoreographed, unplanned moments.” Is it OK for a wedding to be child-free? Williams says that one of the questions she is most frequently asked by prospective brides is how to tell guests that their wedding will be child-free. “Children get bored, they need entertaining, and having them there can cost as much as having an adult guest.” Child-free weddings are increasingly common, and she advises making sure that this is stated on the invitation, telephoning any guests who might particularly object. For those who do invite children, be prepared to accommodate breastfeeding, potty-training, high chairs and perhaps squalling tantrums of boredom during Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians (although, in many ways, perhaps they will be speaking for everyone). How can you keep all the divorced parents and step-parents happy? Any knotty family matters – divorced parents, old feuds, disapproval of a same-sex union – should be approached kindly and openly well before the big day. “Divorced parents are one of the common challenges people come to us for advice about,” says Hume. “We advocate a frank, open conversation from the outset.” She often suggests couples find a way for step-parents to be involved: one parent walking a bride down the aisle and another giving the speech, for instance. “Weddings are emotional subjects and you can be surprised by how excited people can get about them,” she says. Any guest who doesn’t respect the occasion should be treated in much the same way as that tantrumming toddler stropping their way through the ceremony: take them outside and give them a calm but firm talking to, well away from other guests. Remember that a wedding is about making sure everyone feels welcome, about celebration and love – things that it is sometimes easy to forget amid all the hashtags, wedding lists and barn owls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/14/derby-favourite-saxon-warrior-three-stablemates-aidan-o-brien-ballydoyle","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T14:40:21Z","webTitle":"Derby favourite Saxon Warrior may have three stablemates at Epsom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/14/derby-favourite-saxon-warrior-three-stablemates-aidan-o-brien-ballydoyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/14/derby-favourite-saxon-warrior-three-stablemates-aidan-o-brien-ballydoyle","fields":{"headline":"Derby favourite Saxon Warrior may have three stablemates at Epsom","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Saxon Warrior is likely to be joined by three stablemates when he lines up as the favourite for the Derby next month, Aidan O’Brien said on Monday. The trainer explained he has to have “backups” in case anything happens to his main contender for the Investec‑sponsored Classic but this should not be read as showing any lack of confidence in Saxon Warrior, for whom he was full of praise. While conceding he has yet to discuss it with “the lads” of Coolmore who employ him, O’Brien listed his other likely Derby contenders as The Pentagon, Delano Roosevelt and Kew Gardens. “I’m just trying to pre-empt the way the lads will be thinking,” O’Brien said. “I thought maybe Rostropovich might go to the French Derby. And then something might go with him.” O’Brien expects to run two others, James Cook and Zabriskie, in the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday and conceded they or others could yet come into the Derby reckoning. But perhaps those two colts will serve their trainer better as markers to tell him how good the Dante form is. “Some horses, we hold back for Ascot. But the Derby is the race everyone will be looking at and we have Saxon Warrior. “But we have to have backups in case things don’t keep.” He stopped short of actually verbalising the possibility of injury to the Guineas winner. His rivals may not have noticed but O’Brien, seeking his seventh Derby success, reports that he has had a troubled start to the year, the turf on his grass gallops remaining so sodden that he has been unable to use it. He cannot remember having been restricted to all-weather gallops at such an advanced stage of the season and reckons his horses have been held up in their preparation as a result. That, O’Brien says, was the main source of doubt about Saxon Warrior when he lined up for the 2,000 Guineas. “For him to do what he did, we were delighted. Looking at him, there should have been an awful lot of improvement to come.” Admiring the colt, who grew so impressively over the winter, O’Brien said: “He’s a very sober, relaxed horse but sharp – he reacts to things very quickly. Most horses live in a middle ground. He lives asleep and he lives alive. That middle ground, he doesn’t have that. “It makes him very easy to deal with, because he’s asleep all the time. He’s a big, good-natured horse, really, but he has that quickness and the sharpness that good horses have. He doesn’t have to go from first to second to third to fourth gear, he can go from second to fifth in a flash. It’s an impulse.” O’Brien was happy to contemplate the possibility of Saxon Warrior trying to become the first triple crown winner since Nijinsky in 1970, which would require him to win the Derby and the St Leger. The latter race is not the most commercially obvious target with his future as a stallion in mind, but the trainer does not expect Coolmore to be deterred by that. “It’s kind of a romantic thing rather than a business thing,” he said, pointing out that Nijinksy’s statue guards the gates here. But any horse can be unlucky in a race and O’Brien is now trying to reformulate plans for U S Navy Flag, whose chance in the French 2,000 Guineas on Sunday was compromised when he slipped on the Longchamp turf, which has attracted criticism from jockeys. “It would have been a disaster if he fell,” said O’Brien, who declined to blame anyone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/may/18/the-last-poets-the-hip-hop-forefathers-who-gave-black-america-its-voice","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T05:00:50Z","webTitle":"The Last Poets: the hip-hop forefathers who gave black America its voice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/18/the-last-poets-the-hip-hop-forefathers-who-gave-black-america-its-voice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/18/the-last-poets-the-hip-hop-forefathers-who-gave-black-america-its-voice","fields":{"headline":"The Last Poets: the hip-hop forefathers who gave black America its voice","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You can trace the birth of hip-hop to the summer of 1973 when Kool Herc DJ’d the first extended breakbeat, much to the thrill of the dancers at a South Bronx block party. You can trace its conception, however, to five years earlier – 19 May 1968, 50 years ago this weekend – when the founding members of the Last Poets stood together in Mount Morris park – now Marcus Garvey park – in Harlem and uttered their first poems in public. They commemorated what would have been the 43rd birthday of Malcolm X, who had been slain three years earlier. Not two months had passed since the assassination of Martin Luther King. “Growing up, I was scheduled to be a nice little coloured guy. I was liked by everybody,” says the Last Poets’ Abiodun Oyewole. He was 18 and in college when he heard the news. “But when they killed Dr King, all bets were off.” That day led to the Last Poets’ revelatory, self-titled 1970 debut of vitriolic black power poems spoken over the beat of a congo drum. Half a century later, the slaughter continues daily, in the form of assaults, school shootings and excessive police force. “America is a terrorist, killing the natives of the land / America is a terrorist, with a slave system in place,” Oyewole declares on the Last Poets’ new album, Understand What Black Is, in which he and Umar Bin Hassan trade poems over reggae orchestration, horns, drums and flute. It’s their first album in 20 years, reminding a new generation of hip-hop’s roots in protest poetry. “Ghostface Killah and RZA [from the Wu-Tang Clan] will bow down when they see us,” Oyewole says. “People say we started rap and hip-hop, but what we really got going is poetry. We put poetry on blast.” The Last Poets’ poems have been sampled or quoted by NWA, A Tribe Called Quest, Public Enemy and many more; the rapper Common’s Grammy-nominated 2005 song The Corner features the Last Poets (as well as Kanye West) representing the old-school guys in the neighbourhood who explain how black power rose up from the streets. “The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar,” Bin Hassan says in the song. “Power to the people!” The late Gil Scott-Heron, meanwhile, is often mistakenly believed to have been a member of the Last Poets. Rather, they were contemporaries, the connective tissue between the rap, hip-hop and spoken word genres they helped inspire, and their own direct influences: jazz and Langston Hughes and the words of their slain leaders. “‘I been to the mountaintop!’” Oyewole says, quoting King’s final speech when I visit him. “Ain’t nothing but a poem.” On this Sunday, as with almost every Sunday for the last three decades, Oyewole is hosting the Open House poetry workshop in his Harlem apartment, a 20-minute walk from the spot where the Last Poets once spoke their first words. The door is cracked open for the stream of visitors who will fill the seats all afternoon and evening. Oyewole rarely reads his own work, but instead serves as teacher, leader and cook (“I do this to repair myself,” he says). There are homemade salmon croquettes, shrimp grits and potatoes waiting in the kitchen. Fifty years of vintage posters and framed awards adorn the walls in the corridor – a literal hall of fame – while others are covered with masks from Oyewole’s travels all over Africa and South America. When he was growing up, Oyewole says, his father “raised me to hard work” – weeding the garden in Jamaica, Queens – “and I got love overtime from my mother”. He calls two women mother, including the aunt who raised him and demanded he learn to clearly recite the Lord’s Prayer so she could hear every word in the kitchen. Now 70, wiry, energetic, and having received his chosen name in a Yoruba religious service, Oyewole still uses his voice like an instrument, dramatically dialling it up and down in volume for emphasis in the free-ranging conversations that take place in his living room: basketball, the novels of Chinua Achebe, the backlash election of Donald Trump. “All Barack Obama got to do was clean up the mess made by the Bush administration. Pride was restored, money was restored. But that’s all black folks has ever done, cleaning up. We’ve been the biggest servants this country has ever seen.” In the early 70s, when the Last Poets’ first album began to attain popularity, Oyewole was in prison. He had been studying at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, and robbed a local Ku Klux Klan meeting. “I have a strong distaste for guns now,” he says. “But back then I treated my .38 Special like it was my wallet.” During his three-and-a-half-year sentence, Oyewole’s good behaviour permitted him study leave. On school days, as part of his study, he would visit a radio station and read out entire books on the air, which were then broadcast in the evenings. “I’d come back to my cell after class and guys would holler: ‘I got you on my headphones, New York!’” he says. These days, when he teaches poetry workshops to teenage girls incarcerated at Rikers Island, he exhorts his students to educate themselves. “I tell them: you put a top hat on time and you learn how to get time to serve you!” Last Poets drummer Baba Donn Babatunde drops by and Oyewole introduces him as the heartbeat of the group. Impressively tall, he wears a gold pendant on his dress shirt in place of a tie and speaks in a serious, mellifluous baritone. When he was 11, his activist mother turned him on to the Last Poets; since 1991, when he joined the group that so inspired him, he tries to summon in his drumming “the spirit, the anger I felt when I first heard those poems. What I do is the dramatisation of those words, carrying them rather than fighting them.” By and by others drift in. “Can I play your drum?” a guy called Jason asks as he wanders in. In his early 20s, he smokes some dope and grows quickly impatient. “Check this out!” Jason pleads, pausing to cue up a phone recording of himself playing at home. Oyewole isn’t having it. “I don’t want to hear your damn gadget!” he explodes. He refuses to use a mobile phone. “In 1972, in my poem Mean Machine, I wrote: ‘Synthetic genetics controls your soul,’” he says. “Who would I be if I had one of those things now? Some of them here get up and read their poetry right off their gadgets. I tell them: that thing is a wall between us and you.” He is equally harsh on those who blame their circumstances for their troubles, a philosophy Bin Hassan shares. One of Bin Hassan’s poems on the new record, North East West South, is a moving response to the death of Prince, who was a fan of the group. “I grew up black in the midwest; I had a creative father who could be abusive,” Bin Hassan says a few days after the workshop. “The kid in Purple Rain is named Jerome, and that’s my real name. So when I saw the film, I felt like it was my life story, too. But you can’t get hung up – you have to use that and move on.” Bin Hassan moved to Baltimore several years ago and, in between writing poems, he looks after his grandchildren. “I cleaned up,” Bin Hassan says, having fought a crack addiction, “and I’m thankful I’m still here.” Rain Maker, a 20-year veteran of the workshop, runs through poems for a gig in Albany the next night. Albe Daniel, an actor and poet who calls Oyewole a surrogate father and addresses him as “Pops”, brings his daughter Katie, six. A poet called Miriam strides up to Oyewole’s chair: “This is Ramesses!” she says proudly, and a tiny face peeps out from a carriage. “Well, well,” says Oyewole, smiling. “I just got off the phone with my own son, Pharaoh.” A guy who introduces himself simply as Born brings bags of wine and groceries; soon there’s frying in the kitchen, Lauryn Hill on a mini-stereo by the stove, the happy chaos of a little party in the making. At about 8pm, Oyewole shuts everyone up. “We’re getting ready to do poetry!” he shouts and everyone dutifully lines up. Immediately, a chorus of 15 or so voices – young and old, all persons of colour – recites in bright, powerful unison: “I want to be who I want to be …” This is the “pledge”, committed to memory by every workshop poet, written on the fly by Oyewole years ago when he was doing a school visit in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district and a sharp-eyed student noticed he hadn’t recited the US pledge of allegiance. “I don’t sing no Star-Spangled Banner – that’s a war song!” he responded. “And I tell you what, I got a better pledge than that one.” “I want to feel good about me, and blame no one for my misery,” the poets continue in collective, syncopated rhythm. “I want to say what I know, to make my brothers and sisters grow.” “Baby, that’s a mouthful!” Oyewole says, his eyes lighting up. It’s time for the workshop participants to step up. A guy in his 20s rises, mumbles his name inaudibly. He recites his poem over familiar music, the instrumental of Childish Gambino’s Redbone. “You got a flow,” Oyewole acknowledges, “but I want to see you being totally original.” A discussion about artistic theft ensues. One of the best-known homages to the Last Poets arrived via Notorious BIG’s debut single, Party and Bullshit. Recently, a judge dismissed a lawsuit in which Oyewole alleged that Biggie, Rita Ora and other artists, infringed on copyright and used the lyrics in a “non-conscious” way, corrupting the original message. “When the revolution comes, some of us will probably catch it on TV, with chicken hanging from our mouths,” the Last Poets chant on their debut. “When the revolution comes …!” The line in question is one they say in a rhythmic chorus: “But until then you know and I know niggers will party and bullshit, and party and bullshit …” The rhythm is echoed in Biggie’s recitation of the line. “It’s like prophecy, Pops!” Albe Daniels says. “Y’all called it. The revolution came and they were all partying and bullshitting.” Vanessa, a New York-raised teacher in her early 40s with family back in Haiti, waits through a few protracted rounds of talk before the room shushes again. “May the dust of your slain sisters stick to the soles of your feet when you walk,” she reads midway through her poem and Oyewole stops her. “Do that line again!” he shouts appreciatively. “That was so fucking powerful.” At midnight, the open house is closed. “I tell them all to scatter like mice!” Oyewole says. At seven the next morning, like every morning till 12.30pm, he will return to his desk and write facing east, to Marcus Garvey park. “I look east because that’s where the sun rises,” Oyewole says. “That’s where life begins.” The Last Poets will appear in concert at the British Library, London, on 18 May. Their new album, Understand What Black Is, is out now on Studio Rockers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/14/john-oliver-michael-cohen-donald-trump-giuliani-last-week-tonight","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T14:58:48Z","webTitle":"John Oliver on Michael Cohen: a lawyer so bad 'he made Trump get Giuliani'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/14/john-oliver-michael-cohen-donald-trump-giuliani-last-week-tonight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/14/john-oliver-michael-cohen-donald-trump-giuliani-last-week-tonight","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver on Michael Cohen: a lawyer so bad 'he made Trump get Giuliani'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed a chaotic week at the White House, from chief of staff John Kelly’s comments about immigrants to Michael Cohen’s mounting legal troubles. “We begin tonight with the Trump White House,” Oliver said, “the only home in America where the next occupant will have to ask: ‘What’s the best way to get cum stains out of Abe Lincoln’s ghost?’” Oliver continued, summarizing the events of yet another newsworthy week in the Trump White House: “They got three American detainees out of North Korea, which was great. They pulled out of the Iran deal, which may turn out to be catastrophic. John Kelly said immigrants lack the skills to assimilate, which is ironic coming from someone with the surname ‘Kelly’. The first lady announced her anti-cyberbullying program, appealing to people to be kind, which was a little jarring considering this.” Oliver then mentioned leaked comments attributed to the White House aide Kelly Sadler, who reportedly said that John McCain’s opposition to Gina Haspel, Trump’s nominee to direct the CIA, doesn’t matter because “he’s dying anyway”. “That is shocking, but it’s also not really surprising,” Oliver said. “These days, Trump aide says something awful isn’t really news; it’s just an assumed fact, like gravity, or the fact that Young Sheldon will someday grow up and look nothing like Jim Parsons, and then all hell will break loose because the world can’t handle an inconsistency like that.” Oliver continued: “Tonight, let’s ignore all of that and instead focus on the busy week for one person in particular, Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s personal lawyer and a lawyer so shitty he made Trump say: ‘I need someone good, get me Rudy Giuliani.’” The host went on to briefly summarize the Cohen saga, which most recently involves revelations about a Delaware-based shell company through which Cohen paid off porn star Stormy Daniels and also received payments from Korea Aerospace Industries, pharmaceutical giant Novartis and AT&amp;T. More recently, Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti alleged that Cohen was “selling access” to Trump. “Millions of dollars for access to Trump,” Oliver said, “which is just bizarre because I naturally assumed you gained access to the president by finding a golden ticket in your Maga hat.” Oliver then explained that, shortly after the 2016 election, Trump’s “fixer” Cohen began to make a lot of money. “Cohen’s pitch to potential clients was pretty brazen,” the host added, reading it aloud: “I don’t know who’s been representing you, but you should fire them all. I’m the guy you should hire. I’m closest to the president. I’m his personal lawyer. “That is a little bit weird, because lawyers don’t generally pitch themselves by offering up info on their other clients,” Oliver said. “It’s like a doctor saying: if you hire me, I’ll tell you about all of Larry King’s birthmarks.” Oliver concluded: “Now, we probably don’t know the full significance of these payments but I would argue that, at heart, these companies got exactly what they paid for, because they wanted to understand how the Trump administration worked, and think about it: they put their trust in a political novice who turned out to be a total moron and was actually just bilking them for personal gain.

The report, which was commissioned by the government in Phnom Penh, has been kept secret since it was submitted last year, prompting concerns that ministers are inclined to push ahead regardless of the dire impact it predicts on river dolphins and one of the world’s largest migrations of freshwater fish. The proposed hydropower plant would require an 18km-wide barrier across the river at Sambor, Kratie province. This quiet rural district is best known as a place for watching Irrawaddy dolphins, whose critically low numbers have just shown their first increase in 20 years. To examine the environmental impact of the dam and the 82km-long reservoir that would form behind it, the Cambodian government commissioned the National Heritage Institute, a US-based research and consultancy firm, to undertake a three-year study in 2014. But it has refused to make public the results of the Sambor Hydropower Dam Alternatives Assessment, despite numerous appeals from civil society organisations. A copy has now been leaked to the Guardian. In its key findings the report notes: “The impact on fisheries would be devastating as it would block fish migration from the Tonle Sap (Cambodia’s Great Lake), a vital tributary to the Mekong and the spawning grounds upstream.” The Mekong is the world’s most productive inland fisher y, sustaining the food security of 60 million people. The Mekong River Commission puts the value of wild-capture fish at $11b n, shared between the four member states of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. The stakes are very high for a country where 80% of Cambodians count on fish as their main source of protein. It is also a potential game-changer for other species in the Mekong’s ecosystem. Marc Goichot, WWF’s water resources specialist, said: “After 15 years WWF and our Cambodian partners are finally winning the battle to conserve Mekong dolphins with 15 new calves born since 2015. A Sambor dam would ruin all those efforts. Together with the plight of the dolphins, fisheries, livelihoods and nutrition of rural communities would all suffer, as well as precipitating the sinking of the Mekong delta in Vietnam.” The plan for the dam dates back to a memorandum of understanding signed with China Southern Power Grid in 2006. Widespread opposition prompted the Chinese investor to withdrew from the project in 2008. The country’s chronic energy shortage, high prices and its 50% import dependency prompted the government to revive the Sambor project in 2016, after Laos had already launched two controversial dams upstream - the Xayaburi and the Don Sahong dams. In the executive summary, the report declares “a dam at this site could literally kill the river, unless sited, designed and operated sustainably. The Sambor reach is the worst possible place to build a major dam.” Cambodia’s deputy minister of energy, Ith Praing , said: “It is a very sensitive issue and too early to publish any kind of information on Sambor.” The survey team looked at 10 alternative locations for a Sambor dam site by deploying the world’s most advanced mitigation technology. The project director, Gregory Thomas, said: “Even the most advanced mitigation measures still pose high risks. There is no evidence that any large dam on a tropical river has ever been successful in the use of the latest fish mitigation technology.” In place of a new dam, the study recommends integrating floating solar photovoltaic panels into the already operational Lower Sesan 2 dam , and operating the reservoir as a single integrated hybrid facility. Power capacity would be doubled to more than 800MW. This technique of augmenting existing hydropower facilities with solar photovoltaics plants has been widely developed in China and India. According to the report, “solar energy is the only option with a positive net economic benefit after all costs and benefits are taken into account, and the cost of solar would be cheaper than the best possible mitigated dam”. Cambodia’s Energy Ministry has so far taken only small steps in the direction of solar energy, and has given a tepid response to the 400MW solar proposal, which suggests it is still batting for a mitigated dam. Praing said no decision would be taken until after July’s general election. If the dam is approved, the leading candidate to build it is China’s Hydrolancang International Energy Company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/14/surrey-sam-curran-yorkshire-county-championship-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T13:50:22Z","webTitle":"England captain Joe Root frustrated by lack of form as Test series looms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/14/surrey-sam-curran-yorkshire-county-championship-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/14/surrey-sam-curran-yorkshire-county-championship-match-report","fields":{"headline":"England captain Joe Root frustrated by lack of form as Test series looms","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Joe Root has admitted his frustration at not being able to find form for Yorkshire during their past two County Championship games, although the England Test captain was at least able to take a glimpse into the future having seen Ollie Pope and Sam Curran shine for Surrey during their innings victory achieved on the morning of day four. Root’s brief return to county colours before the international summer has yielded scores of 0, 35, 14 and 23 in a victory against Essex at Chelmsford and defeat here. He will now turn his attentions to squad selection for the first Test against Pakistan a week on Thursday and meet the new national selector Ed Smith on Tuesday. “When you come back to Yorkshire, you want to perform and give a bit back to the side. It’s been a little bit disappointing,” said Root, who led Yorkshire at the Oval owing to Gary Ballance’s illness. “But that’s cricket, it can be challenging. “I didn’t come into these games to get ready for the Test matches. I made sure I did my preparation beforehand to try to perform well for Yorkshire. It’s just not materialised, unfortunately. That’s just how it can go.” Root and the Yorkshire coach, Andrew Gale, bemoaned missed opportunities in the field during the first day as the primary reason for their defeat, with the 20-year-old Pope nearly run out on the way to a career‑best 158 not out as Surrey recovered from 162 for six to post 414 on a pitch which offered help for the seamers all the way through. This was their second win from four matches. Alongside Pope, their other hero was the 19-year-old left-arm seamer Curran, who claimed six wickets in the first innings and finished with his first 10-wicket match haul – 10 for 101. Root said: “Their two young lads were very impressive. On a wicket that offered a bit, Ollie played really well. He has a good all‑round game and put our bowlers under pressure. Sam bowled nicely. To back it up having enforced the follow-on was impressive.” Meanwhile, both of the remaining Division two games ended in draws, despite the best efforts of Mark Wood who, in his first game since leaving the IPL early, took a career-best 6-46 for Durham in Derbyshire’s second innings. Wood reverse-swung the ball with alacrity, but Derby resisted on a dry pitch, finishing on 279 for 9. At Lord’s, 21-year-old wicketkeeper James Bracey saved the game for Gloucestershire with an unbeaten 125 against Middlesex, his third Championship century. “It’s good enough just to play at Lord’s,” he said. “I wanted to enjoy the occasion and I’ve surpassed myself, so I’m really happy.” Bracey, who was born in Bristol and is in the final year of his degree at Loughborough University, signed a two-summer contract with Gloucestershire in March. At the end of the first five rounds of Championship games, Nottinghamshire and Worcestershire top and tail Division One; Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Division Two. The next round of matches begins on 9 June. O’Brien scores another memorable century to give Ireland hope against Pakistan Kevin O’Brien produced another memorable international century to leave Ireland’s inaugural Test with Pakistan fascinatingly poised following the hosts’ spirited fourth-day fightback. Seven years after O’Brien smashed the quickest World Cup ton in a match-winning innings against England, he went into three figures again, making 118 not out as Ireland, who had been made to follow-on, progressed to 319 for seven – a 139-run lead. With showers possible today, all results still appear possible when it had seemed like a Pakistan victory was a foregone conclusion at the start of yesterday play. Resuming on 64 without loss, still 116 in arrears, the sight of Mohammad Amir moving gingerly due to a knee problem would have provided encouragement, particularly when he did not open the bowling. As it was, he was not needed at first. Joyce, with 43, was run out by Faheem Ashraf’s direct hit and there was a pair for Andrew Balbirnie, who was once more trapped in front by Mohammad Abbas. Niall O’Brien and Porterfield could both have been run out but did not make the most of their second lives as Amir produced a brilliant spell. Two of O’Brien’s stumps were uprooted, before Amir finally found Porterfield’s outside edge, with Sarfraz Ahmed taking a smart catch to send back Ireland’s captain for 32. Amir secured his 100th Test wicket with the dismissal of Gary Wilson with Stuart Thompson becoming victim number 101, but he, along with Kevin O’Brien, took 14 off two Amir overs to bring Ireland within touching distance of moving in front. They did so via Kevin O’Brien’s edge through the vacant second-slip region for four and the 34-year-old soon became Ireland’s first male Test half-centurion with a clip through point from his 186th ball.

Mutko pledged to stop all cruelty, and said he had ordered the construction of shelters for stray animals. But activists allege dog killings have continued and that Mutko’s words are meaningless as city governments are not compelled to follow recommendations made at a federal level. “If you put it in plain Russian, they said ‘sod off, we’re going to carry on killing’,” says Yekaterina Dmitriyeva, the head of NGO the Foundation for the Protection of Urban Animals, who was present at the meeting. She set up the popular Facebook group, Bloody Fifa-2018, last year. There are approximately two million strays in Russia’s 11 World Cup host cities and it has been estimated that local authorities will spend up to £119 million on catching, caging, sterilising and euthanising animals this year.But activists warn that image-conscious officials are trying to remove strays from the streets by fair means or foul before the arrival of players and fans next month. While contracts to regulate the number of stray dogs are won by private companies in Russia annually, there is some evidence that the size of these tenders have been increased this year. An online petition launched by Dmitriyeva late last year calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to cancel contracts ahead of the World Cup has almost two million signatures, but there has been no response from the Russian leader, who is known to have several pet dogs and often speaks about his love for animals. Though Russian cities’ policies about stray animals differ, these contracts can be extremely lucrative. In the World Cup host city Yekaterinburg, for example, the state is paying £380,000 for the capture of 4,650 dogs. Some Russians have even advertised their properties online as housing for dogs during the World Cup, hoping for a financial windfall as the companies that won tenders struggle to cope. Russian officials deny euthanasia is state policy, and some NGOs say the same. The allegations of mass extermination are just “gossip”, says Yekaterina Ublinskaya, deputy director of Right to Life, an animal rights NGO operating in the western exclave of Kaliningrad, which won a £21,400 contract to provide temporary accommodation for dogs picked up off the streets for the World Cup. “There are some instances of poisoning, but these are private incidents and there is no mass poisoning.” But even top animal welfare officials have admitted there have been cases of animal cruelty linked to the World Cup preparations. Vladimir Burmatov, the head of the Russian parliament’s committee on ecology and environment protection, was horrified when he visited a dog shelter in Yekaterinburg earlier this year. “The effect from what I saw was very painful. Malnourished dogs and conditions that you couldn’t even call satisfactory,” Burmatov wrote afterwards. He said a “large quantity” of dogs were being put down unnecessarily for £1.20 each – a price strongly indicating the methods used were likely not humane. He also revealed that the company running the shelter was not an animal specialist organisation, but focused on rubbish collection and disposal. Fears about the treatment of animals ahead of the World Cup have been fuelled by activists’ experience of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi when they say homeless dogs were exterminated in a coordinated campaign. The fate of Sochi’s strays became an international scandal before the tournament as photographs appeared of dogs dying in the streets and activists desperately tried to evacuate them from the city. In protest, some Olympic athletes adopted Sochi dogs and took them back to their respective countries and, in one case, dedicated an Instagram account to them. There are fears that what happened in Sochi could be repeated in all Russia’s World Cup cities, as well as in Sochi itself, which is hosting World Cup matches including those of footballing giants Germany and Spain. “We are scared there will be a repeat of what happened before the Olympics when, over a week, there were mass poisonings and shootings,” said Ksenia, a Sochi-based animal rights activist. Documents on the state procurement website show that Basya Service, the company that carried out the culls before the Sochi Olympics, has won four contracts to catch 3,501 stray dogs and cats in 2018. Angry officials in a village in the nearby Tuapse district pledged to tear up a similar agreement with the company earlier this year after the remains of dead dogs were found by the side of the road. The mayor of Sochi, Anatoly Pakhomov, has denied the city has authorised the killing of stray animals and says there are no plans to do so before the World Cup. Basya Service also denies that it uses inhumane methods. But Sochi activists are calling on their local networks to watch out for those targeting stray dogs and to film, obstruct or call the police about any animal cruelty. The situation is less volatile in other World Cup host cities. In the western city of Kaliningrad and the Volga city of Nizhny Novgorod – both due to host the English team during the group stages – local activists say authorities use a “Trap, Neuter, Return” policy . In Moscow, killings are rare. In Kaliningrad, Ublinskaya said clearing dogs from the streets during the World Cup was actually in the animals’ best interests. “During such events, there are a lot of people – not always sober – and it is best to have animals as far away as possible.” But activists point out that euthanasia programmes allow much greater scope for corruption: while it is relatively simple to check whether a stray dog has been sterilised and tagged, it is almost impossible to tell if dogs have been killed and whether corners have been cut. “It’s a catastrophe,” says activist Dmitriyeva. “How do they choose who lives and who dies?” More on life inside Russian cities hosting the World Cup can be found here, or follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/14/decline-club-18-30-sex-thomas-cook-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T13:47:11Z","webTitle":"The decline of Club 18-30 isn’t all about sex, sex, sex you know | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/decline-club-18-30-sex-thomas-cook-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/decline-club-18-30-sex-thomas-cook-holiday","fields":{"headline":"The decline of Club 18-30 isn’t all about sex, sex, sex you know","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hang up your mankinis, turn off the foam machine, silence the DJ Ötzi, let the mourners come, for it looks as though Club 18-30 is approaching its demise and with it, the great British holiday as we know it. Thomas Cook, which owns the raunchy holiday club for young adults, is reportedly considering its future as the “Instagram generation” no longer sees the appeal in necking fluorescent blue fishbowl cocktails at a foam party while a tanked-up rep from Devon gropes their arse through chlamydia-tainted bubbles. According to reports, young people seem more concerned with taking impressive selfies than playing sex-position statues next to a semen-laced swimming pool. There could be some truth in this. I have written before about the tyranny of Instagram when it comes to travel. In some south Asian holiday destinations, locals will even offer to take you to the best “Instagram spots” – for a fee. Your trip now needs to have aesthetic appeal: beautiful views, unique destinations, attractive food. When it comes to social media, wilderness is in and the all-inclusive prawn buffet is definitely out. Attempts to rebrand 18-30 as more sophisticated and urbane have largely fallen flat. First they came for the pub crawls, then they dropped Benidorm; the VIP Saatchi &amp; Saatchi ad campaign followed. Thomas Cook wants to focus its attention now on its Cook’s Club brand. The website is certainly Instagram-worthy: mini-pizzas are out and street food is in. “Cocktails at the Captain Cook Bar have been created by a Berlin-based mixologist to deliver the perfect poolside golden hour.” It’s a far cry from pina colada. I doubt they even do chips. In these days of social media showing off (not to mention stark social inequality), more and more people want a slice of the lux-lifestyle pie. Tastes have changed, aesthetics are determined by influencers, and a basic week in Kavos just doesn’t cut it any more. There are other factors at play here, too. Perhaps most significantly, people don’t need to go on holiday in order to find no-strings-attached sex: we have Tinder. 18-30 used to be marketed under the slogan “It’s not all sex, sex, sex. There’s a bit of sun and sea as well,” and traded off its notoriety for raunchiness. Nowadays, you can sort yourself some sex with one swipe of a finger; much cheaper than an organised singles holiday. And in this age of #MeToo, the highly sexualised culture of 18-30 begins to look old hat. Pushing inebriated young punters into wet T-shirt competitions and public blowjobs begins to look distinctly seedy at a time when we are interrogating sex, consent and power. The public revulsion at the drunk 18-year-old girl who performed a sex act on 24 men in a bar in Magaluf on a different company’s tour four years ago was shaming and misogynist. Post-Weinstein, how much have things changed? At least a little, though still not as much as we can hope. The case also drew attention to how easily antics abroad can end up haunting you back home, thanks to the ubiquity of camera phones. What happens in Malia no longer stays in Malia. Or could it be that 18-30 holidays are just, well, a bit crap, and millennials are seeing the wood for (inflatable palm) trees? Holidaymakers still want to party abroad, but more and more want to do so on their own terms. It’s so easy and reasonable to self-organise a trip these days using Airbnb, low-cost airlines, and Uber. This generation of travellers is more intrepid than ever before: they are not intimidated by foreign travel and don’t need to be shepherded via sweaty coach into a closed compound where everything is arranged for them. Don’t get me wrong, I love a package holiday, I’ve been on several, and sometimes use them for the cheap flights, but browsing what was on offer recently in the hope of a budget trip for me and my mum, I found the lack of choice and rigidity on offer frustrating, not to mention the prices. It seems the golden age of the package holiday is over, and the loss of 18-30 is a symptom of that. Can it evolve? We’ll have to wait and see, but I’m certainly not holding my breath. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/may/14/pope-francis-a-man-of-his-word-review-wim-wenders","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T14:52:21Z","webTitle":"Pope Francis: A Man of His Word review – little grit in Wenders' glossy portrait","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/pope-francis-a-man-of-his-word-review-wim-wenders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/14/pope-francis-a-man-of-his-word-review-wim-wenders","fields":{"headline":"Pope Francis: A Man of His Word review – little grit in Wenders' glossy portrait","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“A smile is the flower of the heart,” says Pope Francis, formerly Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Archbishop of Buenos Aires, in Wim Wenders’s submissively celebratory docu-portrait. And Pope Francis does smile often: a very charming and forthright man with that capacity, noticed in other pontiffs, of combining twinkly eyed kindliness with spiritual firmness and candour. But access to the great man has clearly been provided with an undertaking not to challenge, not even to ask questions, in the normal interview sense. Wenders’ movie outlines Francis’s much noticed attempt at a new liberalism and social engagement, rather different from the conservatism and paternalism of his two predecessors. Here is a pope who talks about poverty, unemployment, compassion for refugees and concern for the environment. Francis has a good line about the modern world and its “globalisation of indifference”. And it would be churlish to deploy the traditional sceptical point that the church is a rich and powerful entity and the pope has no serious intention of changing any of that, despite the humility and Franciscan austerity of his own personal approach to the trappings of office. Wenders’ film is arguably valuable in that it shows Francis’s ethical and moral seriousness and it shows that his visits to the barrios, the prisons and the refugee camps have a passion lacking in secular politicians’ photo ops. They are often very moving. But this is an almost outrageously sugary, platitudinous film, like an ultra-glossy promotional video that might be shown on a loop in some tourist visitors centre associated with the Vatican. There is a very silly silent-movie-type reconstruction of scenes in the life of Saint Francis, whose name the pope adopted in office. It shows a single speech that Francis gave in 1999 in his pre-papal existence, but never talks about his family, his upbringing in Argentina, his attitude to his homeland’s troubled political past, or to the Society of Jesus – despite suggesting the importance of his being the first Jesuit pope. The film suggests that his supposed liberalism has ruffled conservative feathers but never wonders who precisely those conservatives are, or if they might have anything valid to say on camera. And anyway: what liberalism? The pope thoughtfully says some emollient things about gay people and child abuse. But the pope is also shown saying that the “macho and feminist movements are of no use” – because they do not wish for integration. That specious moral equivalence is of “no use” in my view, like affecting to disapprove of both mammon and Christ equally because of their deplorable failure to get along. We don’t get to hear about Francis’s view on abortion and a woman’s right to choose. And most worryingly of all, Wenders has missed out the pope’s staggering comments on the Charlie Hebdo murders: “If my good friend Alberto Gasparri [his travel adviser] says a curse word against my mother, he can expect a punch. It’s normal. You cannot provoke. You cannot insult the faith of others.” Well, Mr Gasparri would naturally turn the other cheek if the pope punched him. But it’s difficult to escape the conclusion that the pope rather sympathises with this kind of murder. Perhaps it was an off-the-cuff remark that Francis now regrets. If Wenders had a bit more grit he would have asked the pope about this directly. A strange film, then: his holiness is shown wisely counselling against proselytising when meeting people of other faiths. But this is a proselytising film, preaching to an imagined choir of believers, complaisant supporters and incurious well-wishers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/may/16/guardian-public-service-awards-2018-success-childs-pay-welfare-state-70-austerity","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T06:00:40Z","webTitle":"Guardian Public Service Awards 2018: Success in the face of cuts is not child’s play | David Brindle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/16/guardian-public-service-awards-2018-success-childs-pay-welfare-state-70-austerity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/16/guardian-public-service-awards-2018-success-childs-pay-welfare-state-70-austerity","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Public Service Awards 2018: Success in the face of cuts is not child’s play","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There will be no shortage of events to mark the 70th birthday of the NHS in July. But another 70th, in many ways just as significant, passed last Sunday with little or no acknowledgment. Few will have paused to reflect on the 1948 National Assistance Act, never mind raise a glass to it. The act was a key pillar of the welfare state structure that still forms the framework of UK public services. It swept away the Elizabethan poor law that for 350 years had made local parishes responsible for the destitute and was symbolised by the hated workhouse. The act legislated “to make provision in lieu thereof for the assistance of persons in need by the National Assistance Board and by local authorities”. As well as establishing the basis of the modern social security system, the act – given royal assent on 13 May 1948 – mandated local councils to provide housing for older and disabled people, take responsibility for the wellbeing of those with physical disabilities and undertake registration and inspection of care homes. The act also made social care means-tested in contrast to NHS care, today still largely free to the individual at point of need, which is the reason politicians continue to struggle to integrate the two halves of the care system. But that’s another story. Overall, the 1948 welfare state settlement has served us remarkably well. Despite the ravages of eight years of austerity, with local government the most ravaged sector of all, there remains much to be proud of in our public services. And the 2018 Guardian Public Service Awards, supported by EY, and launched today, provide the ideal platform to remember and celebrate that. The awards, initiated in 2004, showcase best practice in planning, commissioning and delivery of services across the UK. Entry is largely for teams – with a new category this year for team diversity and inclusion – but there is also an award for the individual public servant of the year, decided by a readers’ vote. Last year’s overall winner, Hertfordshire county council’s family safeguarding service, exemplifies the qualities that the awards seek to highlight. A complete overhaul of child protection work in the county, taking multi-professional services direct to families in their homes, succeeded in halving the time at-risk children spent in care, improving their school attendance by almost 40% and reducing police callouts to domestic abuse incidents by two-thirds. Sue Williams, Hertfordshire’s director of family safeguarding, says winning triggered huge interest in the approach: it felt like every other children’s services authority suddenly wanted to visit to learn what had been done, and how, and the council even had a letter of congratulation from the children’s minister. “It made everybody even more motivated than they were before to show this different way of working and the difference it can make to families,” Williams says. “I think it gave an extra boost to our performance because people worked even harder to show the impact they could have by engaging families differently.” Stephen Smith, voted last year’s public servant of the year by readers for his work over 25 years campaigning for better support for people with learning disabilities in Lancashire, has been similarly overwhelmed. “It has been an important message about people who have a learning disability and what can be achieved,” says Smith, who is himself disabled. As these and other past winners point out, the awards provide an opportunity not just for acclaim, but also for reflection and debate on what produces better outcomes for people who receive services. An award category for service transformation is reintroduced this year. It’s a strong term, but one often used loosely. What it really means and how to set about achieving it is being explored at a conference next week organised by the Public Service Transformation Academy, which runs the Cabinet Office’s programme for transforming public services. In a report to be published at the conference, the academy identifies cultural issues within – and, critically, between – public agencies as both the major enablers of success and the major barriers to it. “Ultimately, we need to reconnect [professionals] with a true role of public services,” the report concludes. “This might include what we’ve coined ‘public service disobedience’ – standing up against what you know to be wrong and counter-productive, even at personal cost.” Looking back on all the winners of the Guardian Public Services Awards over the past 14 years, through austerity and rather better times, an element of disobedience may well be a common thread. If defined as defying convention, it certainly is. • David Brindle is the Guardian’s public services editor.

Age: Brand new. We’re talking cutting-edge technology here. Appearance: Underpants. Underpants? Underpants. Let me ask you a question. How often do you change your underpants? Every day. Every day? My word! Think of all the environmental damage you’re causing by having to wash a pair of underpants every day. Not to mention the needlessly expended energy. Do you know how many hours the average person cumulatively wastes over a lifetime putting on and taking off a fresh pair of underpants every day? No. Me neither, but it’s probably a lot. Now, I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking: “There has to be a better way.” Actually, I wasn’t thinking that at all. You’re right! There does have to be a better way, and that way is the Organics Basics SilverTech 2.0. Would you like me to tell you about the Organics Basics SilverTech 2.0? No. Great! The Organics Basics SilverTech 2.0 is a new type of Kickstarter-funded underwear that uses antimicrobial silver technology to kill 99.9% of all known bacteria – and eliminate odour. Fine, I’ll bite. Why? Because the company is committed to reducing water waste. And buying underwear that you can wear for several days at a time is a terrific first step that we can all make today. That’s why. That’s disgusting. No, it isn’t. You people with your outdated and harmful attitudes to hygiene. You probably still buy toothpaste, don’t you, instead of covering a twig with ash and smacking it against your teeth? Yes. Come on, give these underpants a chance! Would it help if I told you that the underpants use the same anti-microbial silver technology that Nasa uses to purify water on the International Space Station? No, that makes it worse. Really? Because for a lot of customers, the knowledge that their pints and pints of crotch-sweat gets purified with space-age technology is the biggest USP here. Why are we still talking about this? Because imagine the future. A wonderful future where everyone wears all their clothes all year round, until we all stink like morning breath and have damp weeping sores. Doesn’t that sound like a future you want to live in? Emphatically, it does not. Suit yourself. But don’t come running to me when … When what? When, um, you own too many pairs of clean underpants and they all, I dunno, fall on top of you and break your arm or something. Look, I’ve got nothing. Just buy some. Please. I need this. Do say: “I haven’t changed my underpants for a fortnight!” Don’t say: “Now, what’s all this about Organics Basics SilverTech 2.0?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/19/at-royal-wedding-republican-knees-up-hadley-freeman","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T07:59:22Z","webTitle":"I'm thrilled to be at the royal wedding: even this republican loves a royal knees-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/19/at-royal-wedding-republican-knees-up-hadley-freeman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/19/at-royal-wedding-republican-knees-up-hadley-freeman","fields":{"headline":"I'm thrilled to be at the royal wedding: even this republican loves a royal knees-up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"By the time you read this, I will be on my way to Windsor Castle to attend the royal wedding. Of all the sentences I have written in this column that would once have been unimaginable to me – “I have twins”, “I am 40” – this one definitely takes the biscuit. Partly this is because, at the age of 40 (I might have mentioned that before), I thought I was done with weddings, at least until the second ones start rolling around. But it’s also because the royal family and I have a complicated relationship. Admittedly, this relationship only goes in one direction. As far as I know, anyway; I don’t think Harry and Meghan sit around of an evening saying to each other, “Yeah, Hadley’s OK, but sometimes she can be a bit moody, you know?” “And she’s so slow at sending thank you notes!” Although maybe they do – who am I to question the omniscience of God’s representatives on earth? And yet I do question the point of them, often. “But no tourists would come here if it weren’t for the royal family!” cry royalists, which is an excellent point, given that, say, France has been a barren wasteland since they got rid of their royals. Walk down the Champs Élysées and all you see is tumbleweed where the tourists once were. I’m not saying we need to get rid of the royal family in exactly the same way the French did, but I am saying that Charles, not to mention Andrew, surely disproves the royalist contention that the Queen’s holy uterus produces magical people worthy of worship. It is obviously ludicrous that these people, in the 21st century, enjoy such privilege for no other reason than they happen to have been born or got married into a specific family (and an especially low-achieving family, for that matter). And yes, I know I come from the land of the Trumps, the Hiltons and the Kardashians. But those families earned their money and fame, thanks to an exhausting mixture of, in no particular order, reality TV, leaked sex tapes and a friendship with OJ Simpson. That’s the American dream realised right there, dammit! More specifically, I have issues with individual members of the royal family. First, I blame Kate Middleton for persuading me to buy a dress by Issa, a label she used to favour and look enviably elegant in. I, however, looked less like Kate Middleton in my Issa dress and more like the midtown bus, and the only way I could have spent my money less productively is if I’d set fire to it. I also blame Prince Philip for my 20-year struggle with anorexia. Bear with me here: when I was 13, I was told that the following year at school I would have to do the Duke of Edinburgh’s award. But because I would have rather – and would still rather – eat my feet than go camping and map the gradients of Box Hill in Surrey, I decided to make myself ill, and the only way I could think to do this was not to eat. Admittedly, I ended up taking that plan a leeeeetle further than intended but, still, my point stands. Never mind the media guff about how Kate Moss and heroin chic encouraged eating disorders in the 90s – for me the real culprits were Prince Philip and the DofE scheme. So as I said, it’s a complicated relationship, and what’s complicated is that sometimes I hugely enjoy the royal family, and those specific times are when one of them is born, gets married or dies. Then old dudes with titles like “the earl marshal” and “the lord great chamberlain de something de something” suddenly appear, clutching orbs and wearing ermine-trimmed heavy red robes, looking like a pleasing combination of those most British of institutions, panto and Shakespeare. And anyone who doesn’t enjoy this has no sense of the theatrical or enjoyment of the absurd. In other words, the royals can wheel out the full pomp and Britain can pretend it is still a wildly important historical empire instead of the increasingly irrelevant tiny island it actually is. Everybody wins! All soap opera writers know the way to maintain viewers’ interest is regularly to marry or kill someone off. Harry and Meghan’s wedding won’t be as era-defining as Neighbours’ Scott and Charlene’s was (only William and Kate can claim that honour). But it is, I reckon, as interesting as loutish Joe Mangel and hippy chick Kerry Bishop’s was, given how unlikely that alliance was and this one is. Although hopefully Meghan won’t go the way Kerry did soon after, and get shot while protesting against a duck hunt (Neigbours really knew how to maintain my interest). So I’m excited about going to this wedding, even though, because I’m going as a member of the press, and not as Harry and Meghan’s actual friend, I will be forced to stay in what has been described to me as “a pen”. “Like a pig pen?” I asked. Yes, came the answer. And this seems fair enough – where else should an American republican be at a royal wedding but with the beasts of toil? So Harry and Meghan, despite everything, I’ll be sending you good wishes today from my pen. It’s complicated, but on special occasions it’s best to keep things simple."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/14/robert-jeffress-pastor-us-embassy-embassy-donald-trump-mitt-romney","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T16:57:18Z","webTitle":"Pastor who prayed at embassy opening is 'a religious bigot', says Mitt Romney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/14/robert-jeffress-pastor-us-embassy-embassy-donald-trump-mitt-romney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/14/robert-jeffress-pastor-us-embassy-embassy-donald-trump-mitt-romney","fields":{"headline":"Pastor who prayed at embassy opening is 'a religious bigot', says Mitt Romney","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An evangelical pastor who former presidential candidate Mitt Romney denounced as a “religious bigot” delivered a prayer at the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. Praising Donald Trump’s “determination, resolve, courage” in moving the embassy from Tel Aviv despite warnings that the ploy would provoke violent protest, Robert Jeffress said God had “has given us a president” who “stands on … the right side of you, oh God, when it comes to Israel”. In Gaza, health officials said 52 Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces opened fire at protesters rallying against the embassy opening. Officials said more than1,200 were injured, many by live bullets. One Israeli army spokesman told reporters: “We saw more than five explosive devices. We saw shooting at forces.” Another said there had been “concerted, coordinated” attacks on the security fence. Romney criticised the choice of a man who has said all Jews will go to hell to deliver a blessing in Israel. Jeffress is the leader of a Dallas-area Baptist church and a spiritual adviser to Trump. He has been criticised for calling Islam and Mormonism “heresy from the pit of hell” and saying Jews “can’t be saved”. As reported by dallasnews.com, he also said Islam is “a religion that promotes paedophilia”. Romney, a Mormon, wrote on Twitter on Sunday: “Robert Jeffress says ‘you can’t be saved by being a Jew’ and ‘Mormonism is a heresy from the pit of hell’. He has said the same about Islam. Such a religious bigot should not be giving the prayer that opens the United States embassy in Jerusalem.” Trump considered Romney to be his first secretary of state. Since then, Romney has been a consistent and strong critic of Trump’s behaviour in office. Jeffress responded to Romney on the same platform, writing: “Historic Christianity has taught for 2,000 years that salvation is through faith in Christ alone. The fact that I, along with tens of millions of evangelical Christians around the world, continue to espouse that belief, is neither bigoted nor newsworthy.” In his prayer on Monday, he said Israel was “a blessing to the entire world, through her innovations in medicine, technology and energy. But most of all Israel has blessed this world by pointing us to you, the one true God, through the message of her prophets, the scriptures and the Messiah.” He added: “We want to thank you, especially today, for the courageous leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his determination to do whatever it takes to defend his people at all cost. “We want to thank you for the tremendous leadership of our great president, Donald J Trump. Without President Trump’s determination, resolve, courage, we would not be here today. And I believe father that I speak for every single one of us when I say that every day, we thank you that you have given us a president who boldly stands on the right side of history but more importantly stands on the right side of you, oh God, when it comes to Israel.” Trump tweeted about the ceremony on Monday morning. “US embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on [Fox News] &amp; [Fox Business],” he wrote, advertising his favoured TV network. “Lead up to 9am (eastern) event has already begun. A great day for Israel!” The president then addressed the ceremony by video link, saying the US was “a great friend of Israel and a partner in the cause of freedom and peace”. His daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, both senior White House aides, were present. Kushner said: “As we have seen from the protest of the last month and even today, those provoking violence are part of the problem and not part of the solution.” In an Instagram post before the ceremony, accompanying a picture taken at the Western Wall, Ivanka Trump wrote: “We will pray for the boundless potential of the future of the US-Israel alliance, and we will pray for peace.” The Israeli Defense Forces said on Monday a jet had bombed five “terrorist targets” in Gaza, “in response to the violent acts of the last few hours being carried out by Hamas along the security fence”. Tank fire was also used against Hamas targets, the Israeli military said. In a video issued on the eve of ceremonies in Jerusalem, the al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, said negotiations and “appeasement” had failed Palestinians. He urged Muslims carry out jihad against the US. Trump later tweeted: “Big day for Israel. Congratulations!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/may/29/nottingham-trent-leapfrogs-rival-in-university-league-table","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"Nottingham Trent leapfrogs city rival in university league table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/29/nottingham-trent-leapfrogs-rival-in-university-league-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/29/nottingham-trent-leapfrogs-rival-in-university-league-table","fields":{"headline":"Nottingham Trent leapfrogs city rival in university league table","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nottingham Trent University has soared 18 places to overtake its better-known competitor, the University of Nottingham, a member of the elite Russell Group, in the 2019 edition of the Guardian University Guide. The former polytechnic has had a meteoric rise up the table over the past five years. From languishing in the bottom half, Nottingham Trent moved to 53rd place in the 2017 edition, 34th in the 2018 edition; it is now 16th. This year it has overtaken its competitor for the first time by one place in the rankings. The university has improved across every measure, including substantial advances in graduate career prospects and National Student Survey (NSS) results, as well as attaining higher entry standards among its students and a better student to staff ratio. Nottingham Trent, which has 30,000 students, was founded as the Nottingham Government School of Design in 1843 to meet the demands of the textile industry. It scores in the top five for fashion and textiles as well as building, town and country planning in the Guardian University Guide subject rankings, and in the top 10 for design, psychology, accounting, criminology, and film. Prof Edward Peck, vice-chancellor of Nottingham Trent University, said the institution was focused heavily on the student experience. “We describe ourselves is being a teaching-intensive and research-active university,” he said. “We pour enormous amounts of time, innovation and resource into our teaching experience for students in a way I’m sure Russell Group universities pour similar amounts into their research. I think we, with some other universities, are redefining what it means to be an elite university in the 21st century.” The university also has an emphasis on the local economy, focusing its research on benefiting local businesses and equipping graduates with the skills that employers in the surrounding area are looking for. “There’s a virtuous circle between innovation, skills and the university,” Peck said. The top three in the Guardian University Guide are the same as last year: Cambridge, Oxford and St Andrews, though St Andrews closed in on Oxford this year. Leeds has jumped four places to 10th, displacing Surrey (21) and UCL (11). There is little change among the other top 10 universities. Nottingham Trent is not the only example of a newer university outpacing an elite Russell Group institution in the same city. This year, Liverpool John Moores (49), another former polytechnic, has risen 31 places – one of the biggest leaps of any university in the table – to outrank the University of Liverpool (57). Last year, Liverpool Hope and Edge Hill, also in the Liverpool district, pipped the University of Liverpool for the first time. The Guardian league tables focus on the university activities that matter most to young people: quality of teaching, student satisfaction and employability. The guide, produced by the independent company Intelligent Metrix, ranks universities according to: spending per student; the student/staff ratio; graduate career prospects; what grades applicants need to get a place; a value-added score that compares students’ entry qualifications with their final degree results; and how satisfied final-year students are with their courses, based on results from the annual NSS. This year, for the first time, the guide includes a new continuation measure, to reflect students’ chances of finishing their degrees. To accommodate this, spending per student has had its weighting decreased. Nottingham Trent has profited from the new measure, since it has high continuation rates among its students. The university also scored highly for teaching and satisfaction. According to Matt Hiely-Rayner, director of Intelligent Metrix, other universities have gained from the changes to the methodology this year. The narrowing of the gap between Oxford and St Andrews is thanks to the latter’s high continuation rates. It is also the result of the reduced emphasis on expenditure, since Oxford and Cambridge spend considerably more on facilities and services than anywhere else. Other universities to benefit include Chichester (53), which invests heavily in supporting its students, who tend to have below average grades, and Lincoln (47), which has climbed up owing to the strong vision of its vice-chancellor, Mary Stuart. The introduction of a continuation measure has been bad for universities in London, however. This follows their underperformance in the government’s teaching excellence framework, which also includes a non-continuation measure. “The competitive London market, in which several providers have relaxed entry standards in order to expand while others have responded by either contracting or relaxing their standards in order to maintain numbers, could be a factor that links to both the weak performance in the continuation measure and the decline in other measures,” said Hiely-Rayner. • This article was amended on 30 May 2018 because an earlier version said Liverpool John Moores was the highest riser, which rose 31 places.

Which? said Northern rail – which cancelled hundreds of trains this week during the bungled launch of its new timetable – had been blocking passengers after they complained about the service on Twitter. Alex Hayman, managing director of public markets at the consumer body, said: “Train companies should be bending over backwards to help passengers who have been enduring hundreds of cancellations and appalling customer service, not adding insult to injury by ignoring their complaints.” In one example, a Twitter user called Kat Harrison-Dibbits said she had been blocked for complaining “every time [her] train was cancelled, very delayed or too full to get on”. Hayman said Which? regularly heard stories of operators failing to engage with customers or handle their complaints fairly. “Across the country paying passengers are facing unacceptable disruption at the hands of firms that don’t seem to think their views matter,” he said. “The transport secretary must now get a grip on this mess and ensure train companies start treating their passengers with respect.” A Northern rail spokesperson said: “We have a clear social media policy, on our website, that outlines what customers can expect from Northern’s social media team and what we expect in return. “Blocking users is not something we do lightly and something we would never do for those who simply complain about our services. If anyone believes they have been blocked or muted unfairly, we ask them to contact our customer experience centre if they want further clarity on the decision.” It has been a difficult week for the train operator. Northern, which runs trains across the north of England, the east Midlands and Staffordshire, launched its new timetable on Sunday but scores of trains had to be cancelled because of a shortage of drivers. The company described the change as “a significant operational challenge” and told commuters to expect disruption as the new timetable “beds in”. There was further disruption for Northern passengers on Thursday as the RMT staged industrial action over the future role and responsibilities of guards on the train, which was set to be repeated on Saturday. So far, over 1,000 Northern services have been cancelled over the past 14 days. David Brown, managing director at Northern, a subsidiary of Arriva UK Trains, apologised for the cancellations and delays, saying customers deserved better. “We are introducing 1,300 new train services a week, and fitting in these and other train companies’ services has meant that we have had to change 90% of our timetabled trains. This is the biggest modernisation that the Northern railway has had for generations. “The new timetable was planned and delivered in four months compared to the normal nine-12 months because a key improvement – electrification of the Manchester-Bolton line – has been delayed and this meant rewriting our plan and then training drivers at the last minute.” Despite Monday being the first weekday of a new timetable for rail companies across Britain, it was passengers on Northern lines who were hardest hit. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said this was because of a historic lack of investment in the region’s rail infrastructure. “We’ve got to stop running train services on their bare bones, because this is what happens when you do,” he said. “It falls into crisis and then there is huge damage to the economy. Having private operators who simply look at their own bottom line is a false economy.” The minister for transport, Jo Johnson, said the government was investing over £1bn in rail improvements and that commuters would see the benefits once “current teething problems subside”. He said the government had drawn up an action plan with Transport for the North to deal with the problems on Northern lines. In a statement after a phone call with the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, on Thursday, the metro mayors of the Liverpool city region and Greater Manchester, Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham, said their discussion had revealed “a considerable distance between the government’s view of this situation and ours”. “Talk by government ministers of ‘teething problems’ suggests that these are only recent problems linked to the new timetable, when in fact Northern passengers have faced disruption over a much longer period of time,” they said. “Any solution needs to address the endemic staffing shortage in order to avoid any repeat.” The pair said Arriva Rail North’s franchise should be removed if it failed to improve. Burnham has previously demanded an inquiry into Northern’s failing services, before timetabling troubles hit this week. “Chaos on the North’s rail network has been so extreme and so prolonged that as a company Northern have lost the benefit of the doubt,” they said. “They simply cannot be permitted to keep inflicting a miserable sub-standard service on the hundreds of thousands of passengers across our region who have had to endure dire train travel for far too long.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/24/mh17-downed-by-russian-military-missile-system-say-investigators","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T09:39:31Z","webTitle":"MH17 downed by Russian military missile system, say investigators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/mh17-downed-by-russian-military-missile-system-say-investigators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/24/mh17-downed-by-russian-military-missile-system-say-investigators","fields":{"headline":"MH17 downed by Russian military missile system, say investigators","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Russian military missile was responsible for shooting down flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, an international team of investigators said on Thursday, for the first time pointing the finger directly at Moscow. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014. All 298 people onboard were killed. In 2016, investigators announced they had evidence that the BUK system involved in the incident had crossed the border into eastern Ukraine from Russia and returned after the plane had been shot down. At a press conference in The Hague on Thursday, the investigators showed photo and video evidence that they said proved they had identified the specific BUK missile system responsible. They said they had “legal and convincing evidence which will stand up in a courtroom” that the BUK system involved came from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade based in Kursk, in western Russia. Previously, the investigative website Bellingcat has pointed to involvement of the same brigade using open-source information. The joint investigation team (JIT) looking into the incident is made up of Dutch prosecutors and police and others from Australia, Malaysia and Ukraine. They showed photos and video of the convoy that carried the missile system over the border from Russia to Ukraine, and a series of distinctive markings and serial numbers which they said had enabled them to trace the exact system used in the attack, and trace it to the 53rd brigade. Russian officials have denied all involvement in the incident, and on Thursday the defence ministry repeated these denials, claiming that no Russian missile had ever crossed into Ukraine. Kremlin-linked media outlets have floated a range of implausible theories suggesting Ukraine was responsible for shooting down the plane. Russia has used its veto in the UN to prevent an international tribunal from being set up to determine guilt, meaning any eventual trial would be held in the Netherlands under Dutch law. Fred Westerbeke, the chief prosecutor, said the investigation was in its last phase but could not say when he would be ready to file indictments. Two years ago, prosecutors said there were about 100 people under suspicion of direct or indirect involvement. On Thursday, Westerbeke said that number had come down to several dozen, but he declined to name them. He said there was other evidence that would be kept secret until a court hearing began. “We don’t want to tell everything we know because then we are opening our cards to the other side and we do not want to do that.” The big question will be how a future court will operate, given Russia is likely to continue its policy of stonewalling and denial. Investigators had asked Russian authorities for information about the 53rd brigade but had been ignored, said Westerbeke. If specific Russian military personnel or commanders are indicted, Russia is almost certain to refuse their extradition. Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop said the countries that make up the JIT were now “considering options” about how to proceed. “That a sophisticated weapon belonging to the Russian army was dispatched and used to shoot down a civilian aircraft should be of grave international concern,” she said. The JIT stopped short of saying it believed the BUK system was deployed as part of a Russian military mission, saying only that they had identified the base from which it came. In a sign that some evidence is still missing, the JIT repeated a call for those with information about the incident to come forward, including information about the 53rd brigade, promising anonymity. “The next crucially important step is to identify some members of the military in the 53rd brigade ... who can directly say who was involved in the transfer or operation of the BUK,” said Ukrainian army general Vasyl Hrytsak, a member of the investigation team, in comments to Reuters. Bellingcat said it would hold a press conference on Friday to present new findings on MH17. In the weeks before MH17 was shot down, the separatists had shot down a number of Ukrainian military planes over east Ukraine, and intercepted communications between separatist fighters made it clear that they initially believed they had hit another military plane, not a civilian liner. Russia has repeatedly denied it was militarily active in eastern Ukraine, despite an overwhelming body of evidence to the contrary. In 2014, Russian troops and hardware were introduced at key moments to back pro-Russia separatists fighting against Ukrainian government troops. After a series of Russian media claims of Ukrainian responsibility were all shown to be false, Moscow appears to have settled on the idea that it was “impossible to tell” which side was responsible. This week a group of families of the MH17 victims wrote an open letter to the Russian people before the World Cup begins next month. “We are painfully aware of the dark irony that the Russian leaders who will profess to welcome the world with open arms are those who are chiefly to blame for shattering our world,” the letter says. “And that it is these same leaders who have persistently sought to hide the truth, and who have evaded responsibility ever since that dreadful day in July 2014.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/24/scotland-draft-climate-change-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T10:12:01Z","webTitle":"Scotland draft climate change bill sets 90%-by-2050 emission reduction target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/24/scotland-draft-climate-change-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/24/scotland-draft-climate-change-bill","fields":{"headline":"Scotland draft climate change bill sets 90%-by-2050 emission reduction target","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"New targets will set Scotland on course to become one of the first countries in the world to achieve a 100% reduction in carbon emissions, the Scottish government has claimed, although it has stopped short of committing to becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. The draft climate change bill, published on Thursday morning, sets a target of a 90% reduction by 2050 – which the UK Committee on Climate Change states is currently “at the limit of feasibility” – with the aim of achieving 100% reduction, or “net-zero”, as soon as possible. Announcing the targets, Holyrood’s climate change secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, said: “Our 90% target will be tougher even than the 100% goal set by a handful of other countries, because our legislation will set more demanding, legally binding, annual targets covering every sector of our economy. By 2030, we will cut emissions by two-thirds and, unlike other nations, we will not use carbon offsetting, where other countries are paid to cut emissions for us, to achieve our goal.” But Tom Ballantine, chair of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, described the targets as hugely disappointing. “By failing to ally with the global momentum towards zero emissions, led by countries like France, Sweden and New Zealand, Scotland is missing a huge opportunity to end its contribution to climate change in a generation, attract clean investment and retain its position as a leader on the global stage,” he said.

Prisoners could work in sectors likely to be hit by the UK leaving the European Union such as catering, construction and agriculture, David Gauke said. Speaking at HMP Isis, in south-east London, Gauke – who backed the remain campaign in the EU referendum – said migrant workers had been relied on to fill roles but the British public wanted to see that “as many UK citizens are employed as possible”. A wide range of industries have previously voiced fears of a workforce crisis after Brexit. Gauke said: “Leaving the European Union is likely to have an impact on the workforce in sectors such as catering, construction and agriculture. I see an opportunity here for both prisoners and employers, particularly those operating in these sectors.” Gauke was launching an education and employment strategy aimed at improving prisoners’ skills while in custody and increasing job opportunities when they leave. “We’ve got employers struggling to find people. Now is an opportunity to do that,” he said. “Perhaps in the past the answer has always been about migrant workers that have made a big contribution to the economy. But I think the British public expect us to make sure as many UK citizens are employed as possible.” The strategy includes proposals to increase the use of release on temporary licence (ROTL) for work placements, which has fallen in recent years in the wake of a number of high-profile incidents involving criminals offending while on day release. In 2014 an armed robber nicknamed the “Skull Cracker” was jailed for life for raiding a building society branch in Surrey while on the run from an open prison. Michael Wheatley, 55, had absconded while on temporary release. Responding to questions at the launch on Thursday, Gauke said he was open to extending the use of ROTL placements beyond category-D prisoners to higher-risk inmates in category-C prisons or higher. “For prisoners who have earned it and who have been properly risk-assessed, we will get more prisoners out of their cells and into real workplaces,” he said. “We intend to do this by expanding and increasing the use of release of prisoners on temporary licence for work.” The strategy documents state that the number of ROTL placements fell by more than a third between 2013 and 2017, producing nearly 200,000 fewer releases involving 4,000 fewer prisoners. Ministers hope the strategy will help to cut the £15bn annual cost of reoffending, as ex-offenders in employment are up to nine percentage points less likely to commit further crime. At present, just 17% of offenders are in taxpaying employment a year after release. Education and training, work in custody and the availability of employment opportunities in the community also feature in the strategy. Prison governors are to be given the power to commission education and training programmes and tailor them to meet specific labour market requirements within the prison. Peter Dawson, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “This is a welcome strategy full to the brim with good intentions. It could make a big difference to the families and communities to which prisoners return on release. But almost none of those good intentions set a date for when they will be delivered, or how many people will benefit. We have heard many of these promises before.” Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, said: “While prisoners are stuck in their cells for 23 hours a day due to severe understaffing, soaring violence and a prisons crisis driven by Tory cuts, this is yet another prison policy that, sadly, looks set to fail.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/24/venice-architecture-biennale-grafton-yvonne-farrell-shelley-mcnamara","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T15:02:40Z","webTitle":"Venice Architecture Biennale review – take a seat for the 'bench biennale'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/24/venice-architecture-biennale-grafton-yvonne-farrell-shelley-mcnamara","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/24/venice-architecture-biennale-grafton-yvonne-farrell-shelley-mcnamara","fields":{"headline":"Venice Architecture Biennale review – take a seat for the 'bench biennale'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s a nice thing to sit down and admire a good view, no more so than after a day spent traipsing through a biennale. When you reach the far end of the Venetian Arsenale – the sprawling 16th-century naval yard, where the 16,000 workers who once built a warship a day have been replaced by hordes of architecture enthusiasts – the calm of the Gaggiandre is a welcome salve. Rows of brick arches spring from marching colonnades of stone columns, supporting a roof of great timber beams. Low afternoon light floods the scene, reflecting the noble structure of the covered docks in the mirror-calm emerald waters. Five hundred years after the shipyard was built, it is now possible to sit here and take in the view, thanks to a pair of practical Irishwomen who know a good place to put a bench when they see it. “We always want to sit down when we come to Venice,” says Yvonne Farrell, one half of Grafton, the Dublin architects who have curated this year’s architecture biennale. Officially titled Freespace, the 2018 edition could equally be the biennale of benches. Along with the huge chunks of marble that Grafton found in storage and hauled into place beside the docks, there are roughly-hewn tree trunks from Spain, woven rattan divans from Mumbai, polished stone seats from Portugal, leather-upholstered benches from Leeds, as well as Peruvian seating made from concrete formwork (complete with built-in phone-charging sockets) and a bench hand-moulded from dollops of Bangladeshi mud. The welcome proliferation of perches is a direct response to the curators’ manifesto, which emphasises the capacity of architecture to find “additional and unexpected generosity” in each project, stressing the architect’s obligation to provide “gifts” to the wider public beyond the confines of the client’s brief alone. A beautiful wall, in Grafton’s eyes, can give pleasure to a passerby even if they never go inside, as can a glimpse into a courtyard, or a place to lean in the shade or take cover from the rain. It is about harnessing the power of nature’s free gifts too, reminding us how architecture can capture light, a breeze or ripples of water, and exploit the magic of what is already there. Following a succession of biennales that have shunned the iconic in favour of the everyday, the marginal and the provisional, Grafton celebrate the in-between. The result is a rich body of projects harvested from across the world that devote care to porches, lobbies, passages and stairs, making incidental spaces do more than simply take you from from A to B, or separate inside from out. It is an exhibition revealing the added value that architecture can bring – a broad umbrella, which is also the show’s chief flaw. London-based Canadian architect Alison Brooks has constructed a tableau of “habitable totems” that recreate in-between moments from some of her buildings, using a clever combination of plywood and mirrors to conjure a curving colonnade, an infinite cloister and a grand vaulted threshold. They are dreamlike fragments that speak of the potential of housing to create moments of delight beyond the dwellings alone. Los Angeles-based architect Michael Maltzan deploys a similar approach in his intermediate housing project for homeless people, where prefabricated modular units are carefully arranged above an open communal floor. A vast white model reveals the spatial logic behind the design, while intricately furnished rooms depict the apartments as lived-in, with video stories about the lives of the individual residents. There are other inspiring housing projects along these lines, from Talli Architecture’s “open building” in Helsinki, whose five-metre ceiling heights allow residents to modify their own spaces, to Lacaton &amp; Vassal’s work in France, which demonstrates how a combination of deft spatial juggling and judicious consideration of where to spend limited funds makes all the difference to the residents. These are architects who mine additional “freespace” from the depths of the plan and the cells of the spreadsheet. Grafton’s definition of architectural generosity extends beyond space to the use of light, smell and touch, making for a show that can be delightfully sensuous. The musty aroma of a great rope curtain fills the first room in the Corderie, recalling the history of the building and preparing the senses for the scents of Australian eucalyptus and Vietnamese bamboo to come. The olfactory climax comes with a dreamy installation by Portuguese maestros Aireus Mateus, who invite you to poke your head inside their faceted black steel UFO to discover an eerie garden of dried flowers. It is a welcome moment of escapism from the long slog of the Corderie, which feels a little monotonous this year, if not for the quality of the exhibits than for the equivalence with which they are displayed. Each architect has been allotted roughly the same amount of space, corralled either side of a relentless central promenade, giving it all the slight air of a trade show. They would have done better to slash the number of participants and give them each more space and more money; with over 100 architects involved across the two venues, it feels like the resources have been spread too thin. One practice that is used to making the most of a tight budget is the ingenious Catalan pair Flores &amp; Prats. They have erected a huge replica of part of their Sala Beckett in Barcelona, a conversion of a 1920s workers’ club into a theatre. It co-opts a south-facing window in the Corderie to simulate the way that light falls into their building. Visitors are invited through a sculpted top-lit space to a behind-the-scenes display stuffed with an energetic archive of models and working drawings that reveals their archaeological design process of recording and excavating magical spaces out of the existing structure. Theirs is an architecture that extracts its gifts from the accumulated layers of history latent in every site. History is ever-present this year, and it adds a richness to the proceedings. Citing the ancient Greek proverb that “society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in”, Grafton have been keen to highlight the annals of architecture as a treasure trove to be liberally raided. For a show dedicated to contemporary architectural practice, there are a refreshing number of gems from the archives, particularly in the central pavilion of the Giardini, which provides an illuminating insight into what makes the Dublin duo tick. “We think the ability to read the past and make it live in the present is what distinguishes Irish architecture right now,” says Grafton co-founder Shelley McNamara. “We don’t see time as a linear thing, but more like a spiral, where ancient and contemporary coexist.” After walking across a colourful ceramic-tiled floor, made by Granby Workshop, founded in Liverpool’s deprived Toxteth neighbourhood by young architecture collective Assemble, visitors are immersed in a room of architectural fragments made by a range of Irish architects each tasked with interpreting a key building from history. It’s a nice idea, but the gnomic pieces on show don’t shed much light on what the canon has to offer, instead treading close to the treacherous waters of architects trying to be installation artists. The curators’ approach to history is more successful when it is more straightforward. One room is devoted to their Swedish hero Sigurd Lewerentz, where the porticoes of three of his chapels have been erected, alongside original drawings. Ghosts of Venice feature in unrealised plans for the city by Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright and others, while David Chipperfield pays homage to Prussian neoclassicist Karl Friedrich Schinkel, projecting animated drawings of his grand scenographic spaces on Berlin’s Museum Island. These may be familiar touchstones, but there are lesser-known finds too, including a room devoted to the work of Milanese architect Luigi Caccia Dominioni, whose sinuous, serpentine plans, says McNamara, have added a new ingredient to Grafton’s own work. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Hatz’s display of historical architectural drawings is a revelation, having rifled through a few hundred years of architects putting pen to paper and pinned the diverse finds across the walls. Ultimately the Irish architects’ most tangible embodiment of their theme comes out in the very fabric of what they have done in Venice, revealing the special qualities of the historic venues themselves. More than any previous curators, they have looked hard at the rambling maze of the central pavilion and made it better, opening up previously closed routes and revealing hidden windows designed by Carlo Scarpa, which connect the galleries to the water outside for the first time in a generation. “We discovered them by chance, after scratching around and going over all the original plans of the building.” says Farrell. “After all, we are architects, not curators.” The Venice Architecture Biennale runs from 26 May to 25 November"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/24/alexa-say-grace-church-of-england-launches-skill-for-smart-home-devices","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T08:32:51Z","webTitle":"Alexa, say grace: C of E launches prayer skill for smart-home devices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/alexa-say-grace-church-of-england-launches-skill-for-smart-home-devices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/24/alexa-say-grace-church-of-england-launches-skill-for-smart-home-devices","fields":{"headline":"Alexa, say grace: C of E launches prayer skill for smart-home devices","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alexa, who is God?

Other faith organisations are also harnessing technology to allow people to access prayers, readings and worship on the move or in their homes. The C of E’s Alexa skill offers a prayer for the day, as well as morning, evening and night-time prayers and a grace before meals. It answers questions such as: what is the Bible? Who is God?

John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, said the service would “enable regular churchgoers and those exploring faith to connect with God in another way at a time that’s right for them. A quarter of UK households now own a smart device and … this fast-growing area was identified as a priority for development.” Adrian Harris, the C of E’s head of digital, said: “Platforms such as Alexa give the church the ability to connect people with God and to weave faith into daily lives, whether for daily prayers or exploring Christianity.” The skill is compatible with all Amazon Echo and Alexa devices. “We’re prioritising Alexa at this stage to reach as many people as quickly as possible but plan to launch on Google and Apple devices in due course,” Harris said.

On Thursday, Global Road Entertainment confirmed they would be cutting two scenes “that some have deemed not appropriate for children”. The scenes in question are thought to involve Max, a police rottweiler voiced by Ludacris, who has his genitals groped by cop Will Arnett as part of his training to go undercover at dog shows. Initially, Max is upset by the intrusion, but is instructed to “go to a zen place” – which involves dancing happily among stars with Arnett – in order to try to ignore what is happening. Said Global: “The company takes these matters very seriously and remains committed to providing quality entertainment for the intended audiences based on the film’s rating. We apologise to anybody who feels the original version of Show Dogs sent an inappropriate message. The revised version of the film will be available for viewing nationwide starting this weekend.” The controversy erupted at the start of the week, when the scenes in question came to the attention of the US’s National Center on Sexual Exploitation. Their chief executive flagged the similarity of tactics used with Max and abusers grooming children, “telling them to pretend they are somewhere else and that they will get a reward for withstanding the discomfort”. On Tuesday, Global Road defended their film on the basis that such practices were standard at dog shows and accurately depicted within the film. They stressed their sense that the scenes had been misread, describing it as simply “a comedic moment in the film, with no hidden or ulterior meaning”. In a statement released on Wednesday, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) appeared to concur, saying “the scenes in question are entirely innocent and non-sexual and occur within the clear context of preparation for and judging in a dog show. We regard the comments made about the film as suggesting ‘grooming’ as a misinterpretation of the scenes in question.” The film’s UK distributors Entertainment One have said they are sticking to the version already cleared by the BBFC, which passed it uncut, giving it a PG certificate. A spokesperson said: “We are taking the BBFC/IFCO guidance on this matter in the UK and Ireland and will be releasing the original version that has been censored and reviewed.” Yet the film’s chief credited writer came to the support of those who felt it could be interpreted more dangerously, claiming the scenes were the product of extensive rewrites in which he had no involvement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"careers/2018/jun/11/starling-bank-anne-boden-diversity-financial-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T10:15:11Z","webTitle":"Starling Bank founder: improve diversity in banking to avoid another financial crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/jun/11/starling-bank-anne-boden-diversity-financial-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2018/jun/11/starling-bank-anne-boden-diversity-financial-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Starling Bank founder: improve diversity in banking to avoid another financial crisis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When she was growing up in Wales, Anne Boden’s career ambitions amounted to “a job in an office with a briefcase”, she says. Transforming the financial industry wasn’t part of the plan. “I probably wouldn’t have expected to have founded my own bank. But it needed to be done.” Before launching online bank Starling in 2014, Boden had worked in the finance sector for more than 30 years. She held top jobs at UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland, but in the aftermath of the financial crisis she decided banking needed a revolution. In 2012, she was drafted into Allied Irish Bank (AIB) as chief operating officer to help return the debt-stricken Irish bank to profitability. Her experience at the bank, which had been taken over by the Irish government, helped spur her into action. “What I found in Ireland was pretty horrible. The banks had taken big bailouts, the people had been really bruised by a financial system that had gone wrong and everyone was desperately trying to put it back together again,” she says. “We returned the bank to profitability, but I knew very well that I had to go further.” Her idea to launch a new digital bank that would be an alternative to the big established players was initially met with scepticism from her peers. Now, Starling, which has no physical branches and offers an app-only current account, has more than 100,000 customers and was recently voted Best British Bank at customer review site Smart Money People’s British Bank Awards. In March this year, Starling launched mobile-only current accounts for businesses. “Most people thought [launching a new bank] couldn’t be done, but I had to do it. I experienced the crisis, the legacy systems and bureaucracy of the big banks. I’d experienced people trying to replace the existing system and it taking too long and costing too much. I wanted to start from scratch.” Challenger banks such as Starling are giving customers some much-needed choice, in her view. “If you look at the big banks, the only difference between them is the colour of the carpet in the branches,” she says. Boden, who studied computer sciences at university, started her career at Lloyds Bank on a graduate programme, working in the tech department as well as on the counter. At the time, the gender divide was stark. “The branch was very much divided into people who made decisions and managed things – the men – and the people who looked after the detail were women.” It was unusual for a woman to rise through the ranks, but Boden succeeded and went on to become one of the creators of Chaps, the same-day payments system. Following executive positions at Standard Chartered Bank and UBS, she headed up global transaction banking across 34 countries for ABN Amro and RBS. Despite the work done to get more women on boards by organisations such as the 30% Club, Boden believes gender diversity hasn’t really improved in the 35 years she’s been in finance and technology. She puts this down to the system being harder on women. “Women have to achieve more, work harder, and be much more perfect to get the job compared with a man. As long as we have the majority of promotions and appointments being made by men, it’s going to be harder for women to get through,” she says. Boden, who does not have children, also points to the pressure professional women with kids are put under. “It’s not the children holding them back, it’s the perception of other people and the standards they’re held to,” she says. Starling was the first UK mobile-only current account when it launched. While challenger banks are more common now, only a few provide current accounts, including Metro and online bank Monzo. Starling received £48m in investment in 2016 and aims to raise another £40m this year to fund a launch into Europe, starting with the Irish Republic. It’s a move Boden is bullish about, even with the uncertainties presented by Brexit. “We’re very ambitious,” she says. She has also forecast that the bank will reach profitability by 2019. Starling has 180 employees, all based at the bank’s London office, and Boden says she takes pride in creating a diverse and creative working environment. The ratio of men to women on the senior team is currently 60:40. “I’d love it to be 50:50, but we’re not there yet.” Diversity in banking is crucial to avoid another financial crisis, in her view. “The financial crisis was caused by people thinking the same. It was people not really being challenged,” she says. “I think that diversity of thought and diversity of people, who reflect the overall population of the customers they serve, can only do good things for business.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/2018/may/24/court-finds-spain-ruling-party-pp-benefited-bribery-luis-barcenas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T13:41:36Z","webTitle":"Court finds Spain's ruling party benefited from bribery scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/court-finds-spain-ruling-party-pp-benefited-bribery-luis-barcenas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/24/court-finds-spain-ruling-party-pp-benefited-bribery-luis-barcenas","fields":{"headline":"Court finds Spain's ruling party benefited from bribery scheme","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Spain’s ruling party has suffered a major blow after one of its former treasurers was jailed for 33 years for fraud and money laundering, and the party itself was found to have profited from an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme, in a case that has become emblematic of political corruption in the country. Luis Bárcenas, once a close ally of the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, was sentenced to prison for his part in the conspiracy and fined €44m (£38.5m), while the People’s party (PP) was fined €240,000 after judges at Spain’s highest criminal court ruled that it had benefited from the racket. The so-called Gürtel case centred on Francisco Correa, a businessman with close ties to the PP who was accused of paying bribes to party officials between 1999 and 2006 in return for contracts to carry out public works and organise events. The investigation was codenamed Gürtel, the German word for correa (belt). Correa was sentenced to 51 years in prison, and his lieutenant Pablo Crespo was jailed for 37 years and six months. Bárcenas’s wife, Rosalía Iglesias, was jailed for 15 years, and Correa’s ex-wife, Carmen Rodríguez Quijano, for 14 years and eight months. Iglesias’s sentence has prompted speculation that Bárcenas may now be prepared to divulge potentially damaging information about the PP’s internal finances. In July last year Rajoy became the first serving Spanish premier to testify in a criminal case when he was called to give evidence to the Gürtel trial about his time as the PP’s vice-secretary general. Rajoy said his duties during the period in question were exclusively political and not financial, and said suggestions that a slush fund was used to pay illegal bonuses to senior party officials were “absolutely false”. In their ruling, the national court judges hearing the case confirmed the existence of a slush fund known as “box B”, describing it as “an accounting and finance structure that ran in parallel with the official one and which had been in use since at least 1989”. Twenty-nine of the 37 defendants in the case were given prison sentences, while the remainder were acquitted. The judges said Correa had created “an effective system of institutional corruption by manipulating the awarding of central, regional and local government contracts through his close and lasting relationship with influential members” of the PP. They said these party members were able to “influence decisions made on the handing out of public contracts to certain public bodies and entities that they presided over or directly controlled through third parties”. The PP said it would appeal against the decision to fine it, saying the party itself had not been on trial and pointing out that the penalty imposed was a civil rather than criminal one. “The People’s party has shown, and will continue to show, its commitment to the fight against corruption and none of those sentenced today in this trial is still in the party,” it said. “No member of the current leadership or past leaderships has been charged in relation to this case. Some attended court as witnesses, which demonstrates that they had nothing whatsoever to do with [these] crimes.” The socialist PSOE party called an emergency meeting of its executive committee for Friday morning, raising the prospect that it could move to hold a no-confidence vote in Rajoy. The anti-austerity Podemos party renewed its calls for a motion of no-confidence. “Democracy can’t tolerate criminals in charge of government,” its leader, Pablo Iglesias, wrote on Twitter. Albert Rivera, the leader of the centre-right Ciudadanos party, which is riding high in the polls and attracting disillusioned PP voters, said the court’s verdict “marks a before and an after in this legislature”. He said it put Spain in a delicate position as it faced the challenge of Catalan separatism, and his party would take the necessary steps to make sure “our democracy isn’t damaged”. When news of the scandal first emerged nine years ago, Rajoy dismissed it as “a plot against the PP”. He initially offered Bárcenas his support in a series of texts, telling his friend: “Luis, we are doing what we can” and “Luis, be strong”. In the past few years, the PP has been increasingly mired in corruption scandals. In April the PP president of Madrid’s regional government resigned after accusations that she had faked her master’s degree and after video footage emerged of her apparently stealing face cream."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/24/birds-had-to-relearn-flight-after-meteor-that-wiped-out-dinosaurs","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T16:58:05Z","webTitle":"Birds had to relearn flight after meteor wiped out dinosaurs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/24/birds-had-to-relearn-flight-after-meteor-that-wiped-out-dinosaurs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/24/birds-had-to-relearn-flight-after-meteor-that-wiped-out-dinosaurs","fields":{"headline":"Birds had to relearn flight after meteor wiped out dinosaurs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Birds had to rediscover flight after the meteor strike that killed off the dinosaurs, scientists say. The cataclysm 66m years ago not only wiped out Tyrannosaurus rex and ground-dwelling dinosaur species, but also flying birds, a detailed survey of the fossil record suggests. As forests burned around the world, the only birds to survive were flightless emu-like species that lived on the ground. “Looking at the fossil record, at plants and birds, there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the forest canopies collapsed,” said Regan Dunn, a member of the team from the Field Museum in Chicago, US. “Perching birds went extinct because there were no more perches.” The six to nine-mile-wide meteor struck the Earth off the coast of Mexico, releasing a million times more energy than the largest atomic bomb. Hot debris raining from the sky is thought to have triggered global wildfires immediately after the impact. It took hundreds or even thousands of years for the world’s forests of palms and pines to recover. Fossil records from New Zealand, Japan, Europe and North America, all show evidence of mass deforestation. They also reveal that birds surviving the end of the Cretaceous period had long sturdy legs made for living on the ground. They resembled emus and kiwis, said the researchers whose findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. “The ancestors of modern tree-dwelling birds did not move into the trees until the forests had recovered from the extinction-causing asteroid,” said Daniel Field, from the University of Bath and a co-author of the paper published in Current Biology. “Today, birds are the most diverse and globally widespread group of terrestrial vertebrate animals – there are nearly 11,000 living species,” he added. “Only a handful of ancestral bird lineages succeeded in surviving the mass extinction event 66 million years ago, and all of today’s amazing living bird diversity can be traced to these ancient survivors.” The team are now focused on reconstructing the recovery of bird populations and how new species emerged and thrived in the ecological niche left by the extinction of dinosaurs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/24/qa-mh17-investigation-russian-missile-aircraft-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T13:20:18Z","webTitle":"Q&A: What we know and don't know about the downing of MH17","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/qa-mh17-investigation-russian-missile-aircraft-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/24/qa-mh17-investigation-russian-missile-aircraft-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Q&A: What we know and don't know about the downing of MH17","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What do international investigators say?

Specifically, it originated with the 53rd anti-aircraft brigade based in the western city of Kursk.

The Buk missile launcher was part of a Russian military convoy that set off from Kursk in June 2014. At the time, Moscow-backed separatists, and undercover Russian troops, were fighting against Ukrainian government forces in eastern Ukraine. The launcher was seen on numerous occasions between 23-25 June, as the convoy made its way south. The Buk was smuggled across the border into Ukraine and transported on a red low-loader with a white Volvo cabin. It was spotted in rebel-held territory. On 17 July it fired a Buk 9M38 series missile from a farm near the village of Pervomaisk, investigators said. The missile struck the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board. Afterwards, the Buk launcher crossed back into Russia. The findings presented on Thursday confirm research published almost three years ago by the open source investigative website Bellingcat. The investigators’ conclusions were reached independently, and form part of an exhaustive and ongoing criminal inquiry. How was the investigation conducted? An international team has been sifting and compiling evidence for almost four years. It includes dozens of detectives, public prosecutors and experts. They have carried out an extensive comparative investigation, looking at different Buk launchers belonging to Russia and Ukraine. The joint investigation team (JIT) found that the Buk missile system that shot down the civilian plane had a “fingerprint”. It identified seven distinctive features, such as vehicle number, transport marking and a white spot. The Buk’s second running wheel was missing spokes – a highly unusual feature. Dozens of curious motorists shot video footage of the convoy as it travelled through western Russia. Investigators were able to match specific locations with features from Google Earth, plotting its progress. They were further helped by testimony from witnesses and intercepted phone calls made at the time by separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine. What don’t we know? The JIT previously said it had identified about 100 people involved in the downing of MH17. On Thursday, Wilbert Paulissen, head of the Dutch national police crime squad, said that number had come down to several dozen, but he declined to name them. They could be named in court during a potential future criminal prosecution. The JIT is still investigating whether Russian soldiers actually fired the missile. It is seeking further details on who was responsible for the military deployment, which Russian soldiers were part of the third battalion Buk team, what instructions were given to them and by whom. They have offered witnesses anonymity and – if necessary – protection. How has Russia reacted? The Kremlin has always denied responsibility, with Vladimir Putin pointing the finger at Ukraine. State media in Moscow has floated dozens of conspiracy theories, among them: a Ukrainian jet shot down MH17; the plane was already full of dead bodies and deliberately crashed; a Buk missile downed the plane, but it wasn’t Russia’s. How have relatives reacted? On Wednesday relatives of the 298 people killed published an open letter to the Russian people, ahead of this summer’s World Cup, hosted by Moscow. It described Russia’s “shocking, disturbing and contradictory stories” as “distressing” and said they were part of an attempt to “create an alternative reality in which all truth is relative and no information can be trusted”. They added: “We appeal again for the Russian government to cooperate fully with the international investigation into MH17. It will not bring our families back, but the truth does matter, the truth does exist and we want those responsible for MH17 to be identified and held accountable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/29/can-millennials-save-unions-in-america","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-29T09:00:33Z","webTitle":"Can millennials save unions in America?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/can-millennials-save-unions-in-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/can-millennials-save-unions-in-america","fields":{"headline":"Can millennials save unions in America?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last year Dae Dae Motley-Gibson was struggling. The 23-year-old was juggling an exhausting work schedule at her job in a kitchen at Newark airport, alongside parenting duties and a family medical crisis. She needed support. She found it in a union. Young people like Motley-Gibson are starting their work lives at a time when activism has been mostly absent from low-wage industries. In the airline workforce, unions have long represented flight attendants and other professionals. But the labour movement hasn’t penetrated the precarious airport-catering sectors, staffed mostly by low-wage immigrants and people of colour. Things began to stir at the Newark airport kitchen when the service workers’ union, Unite Here, recruited Motley-Gibson to help organise her colleagues to demand better working conditions. Last month she helped arrange a rally on behalf of 2,700 fellow catering workers at United Airlines kitchens around the country, calling for fair contracts and the right to form a union. The campaign has bridged social and racial divides. “This is the most that we’ve all come together,” said Motley-Gibson, a first-time organiser. “Each department, each race, each age group … [Companies] want us to be against [each other]; now we talk to each other.” Motley-Gibson isn’t the only young American talking about unions for the first time. Last year, bucking a long trend of decline, union membership in the US grew by 262,000 members. Three in four new recruits were, like Motley-Gibson, under 35. That’s a major upheaval considering the wilting of unions’ political clout over the past two decades. From about 20% of the workforce in 1983 (the earliest year for strictly comparable data), union membership declined to just under 11% last year. On Wednesday, the supreme court dealt another major blow to unions by ruling that non-union members in the public sector no longer have to pay for union representation in collective bargaining negotiations. The hard hats and smokestacks of yesteryear are making room for tablets and tweets as the labour movement gets a millennial upgrade. One in four new hires was unionised last year, of nearly 860,000. An era of inequality, insecure work and Donald Trump has begun to galvanise frustration among a generation often dismissed as self-absorbed. Now hyper-networked millennials are rediscovering the potential of organised labour to seed economic empowerment at work. Young workers have realised that “a generation of corporate-driven policy choices have decimated the rights and economic security of working people”, according to Liz Schuler, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the largest federation of US labour unions. “The millennial and Gen Z generations are more civic minded and acutely in tune with the power of collective action … a union card helps them leverage their power.” Even the ivory tower is embracing worker solidarity. Graduate students at Columbia University recently staged a week-long strike for official recognition of their new union of teaching and research assistants, historically not treated as regular employees. Though the administration has resisted contract negotiations, organisers are building momentum on campus, while a nationwide movement to organise student workers is growing. “Income inequality and disparities are at one of the peaks since the recession,” said Ian Bradley-Perrin, a Columbia graduate worker. “It could be a moment when people are looking for solutions. And the solution [that] has been in existence for a long time, that maybe people haven’t given credit to, is unionisation. Cultural perceptions of unionisation and unions have changed.” Entrepreneurial and creative opportunities have expanded for some in an era of instant global communication and commerce. But millennials dreaming of careers in traditional white-collar professions such as finance and publishing are facing the hamster wheel of temp gigs and unpaid internships. Unions offer a ballast as they navigate an uncertain economy: a boost in wages, especially for women and workers of colour, as well as insurance benefits; steady schedules; and an advocacy network to challenge exploitation, sexual abuse or discrimination in a post-#MeToo era. About two-thirds of professionals responding to a recent AFL-CIO survey said they “would support a proposal for a union at their current job” if they had an opportunity to join one. Despite usually having spent more time in formal education than their parents did, young workers cannot bank on the financial and social security their parents’ generation enjoyed. About 11% of young US college graduates are unemployed or lacking full-time work, and gender and racial income disparities are growing for millennials. The re-energisation of labour parallels other youth-powered activism. Young community activists have bolstered worker-driven protest movements from Occupy to the Fight for $15 to #MeToo, linking issues of living wages, labour protections and social justice. And younger “gig” industries have spawned organising campaigns and legal battles to expand labour protections in sectors such as ridesharing apps, retail and computer programming. Some fresh blood is long overdue for a union movement grown anaemic since the 1970s, strafed by globalisation, automation and rightwing rollbacks on union protections. “Right to work” laws have helped deplete union coffers in many states by restricting their ability to collect fees from all workers at unionised firms, while Wednesday’s supreme court ruling imposed similar barriers on public sector unions. At the media website Curbed NY, editor Amy Plitt’s beat is high-class real estate. As a young journalist, Plitt had never seriously considered unionising. “It didn’t seem like something you could do,” said Plitt. But office murmurings about workplace concerns eventually crystallised into a union drive, and within months a collective bargaining committee was established representing each outlet of Curbed NY’s parent network, Vox Media. In January, the management officially recognised the union as part of Writers Guild East, which represents several other digital news outfits. Last week (6 June) staff at the New Yorker joined the growing list of media workers forming unions. Now embarking on her first contract talks, Plitt said she was attracted to “the possibility of joining together with colleagues and really having a voice at the table”. “The more people in this industry come together and do this, and demand certain rights and different priorities … I think it’s only going to make the industry stronger,” she said. And as long as the old story of bad bosses and angry workers persists in the “new economy”, the union promise will age well: a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work.

Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT), the parent company of Mail Online, the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, saw its share price tumble by 7% as investors reacted to the forecast of a revenue slowdown in the second half of its financial year because of tough advertising and property markets. The company said Mail Online lost almost 1.5 million daily global unique browsers in the six months to the end of March, to 13.6 million, a fall of 9%. The fall in traffic led to Mail Online’s revenue growth dropping to 2% year on year to £61m. Revenue growth was running at 28% year on year, according to DMGT’s results for its last financial year to the end of September. Mail Online says that a fairer measure is underlying revenue performance, which has fallen from 20% to 5% growth, which strips out factors including foreign exchange fluctuations. Mail Online is one of many websites to feel the impact of a major overhaul of Facebook’s news feed algorithm in January. Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, said Facebook, the world’s largest social media site, needed to refocus on “meaningful social interactions” and prioritise content shared by friends and family, reducing the amount of content appearing from publishers and brands that were “crowding out the personal moments”. In September, DMGT lauded a successful broadening of the reach of Mail Online, most notably through Facebook and Snapchat, saying the site hit operating profitability in the final quarter of its last financial year. On Thursday, the company said its focus was on growing direct visitors to Mail Online but that “indirect traffic, notably via search and social platforms”, had reduced significantly. “There has been a reduction in indirect traffic via the likes of Facebook and Google,” Tim Collier, the chief financial officer at DMGT, said at a presentation to analysts. “This is an industry-wide issue but we continue to outperform the market. Mail Online has an excellent track record and a clear strategy to prioritise direct traffic to both the homepage and the app, and this continues to grow and is a key reason for our outperformance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/24/ireland-votes-no-abortion-vote-campaigners-panel-referendum-eighth-amendment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T12:23:58Z","webTitle":"What happens if Ireland votes no to abortion?

Views from both sides","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Katherine Zappone: We will be denying pregnant girls our compassion We have a sad history in Ireland of sometimes treating children very badly. While we are now finding ways of coming to terms with that history, terrible things still happen to children. I spend every day of my working life trying to prevent them, but unfortunately the constitution ties my hands when those terrible things result in girls becoming pregnant. Under the eighth amendment, those girls have only three options. They can stay pregnant, they can travel abroad for an abortion, or they can illegally self-administer an abortion, having ordered pills online. As a state we can only support that girl properly when she stays pregnant. Even then, all the eighth amendment requires is that we make sure she is not dead by the end of the pregnancy. Even if pregnancy will lead to catastrophic ill health, she cannot access lawful abortion in Ireland. That is not a just law. The eighth amendment means we cannot provide compassionate, supportive care for a pregnant teenage girl in her GP’s surgery if she decides that ending the pregnancy is right for her. This is profoundly wrong. If we vote no, it will not and cannot change. Advocates for the no vote tell us this is about children’s rights. In some ways they are right. It is about the rights of our born and pregnant girls to healthcare, to support, and to their childhood. • Dr Katherine Zappone is Ireland’s minister for children and youth affairs John Bruton: A no vote will help the state protect unborn babies Who is human? Is a baby, before birth, human; and if so, ought the baby have any human rights? To admit that an unborn baby is human but to deny it all human rights is both illogical and dangerous. That is the issue at the heart of the referendum. The right to life is the primary human right, because without a right to life one cannot exercise other human rights. It is hard to argue that a baby before it is born is anything but human. It is not a random collection of cells. Ultrasound enables us to see its human characteristics, and to see that it can move autonomously. If it is not human, what is it? Some say that a baby, before birth, is totally dependent on its mother, and thus can have no rights of its own. This is a dangerous argument. Dependency is part of life, and not a sound ground for denying humanity, or any human rights. The taking of the life of another, without its consent, can never be a purely private matter, for a woman or for a man. It is not enough to say we should “trust women” on an abortion decision. This is because the ending of the life of another human is inherently a matter of public policy. Indeed, if human rights are to have any meaning, their vindication is necessarily a matter for the state. Surely if the state has a right and obligation to step in to protect a one-month-old baby from abuse, it also has a right, four months earlier, to protect it from being “terminated”. Abortion ends a life. Once it has happened, there is no going back, no recovery. It is final. The proposed amendment to the constitution is far-reaching. It does not attempt to limit, or qualify, the present constitutional right to life of the baby before birth. It proposes to abolish it completely. If the Irish people vote no on Friday, the government will be forced to reconsider this radical approach. It may then either attempt a more modest constitutional change or leave things as they are. Either way, fewer babies will be denied the right to be born, and will be allowed to make their own choices in life. That is why I am urging people to vote no. • John Bruton was the Irish taoiseach from 1994 to 1997 Fiona de Londras: This inhuman and degrading treatment will carry on Abortion is illegal in almost all circumstances in Ireland. The eighth amendment to the constitution means that it has to be. It says that the state recognises the right to life of the “unborn” as being equal to the right to life of the “mother”. In real terms that means that abortion is allowed only where there is a real and substantial risk to a woman’s life. This is an absolutist and uncompromising provision. There are no exceptions. Under it, all women who are pregnant have the obligation to continue with that pregnancy in Ireland. Since 1992 we paradoxically also have the right to travel abroad in order to access abortion, and a (heavily restricted) right to receive information about abortion (although only when we also receive information about adoption and parenting). The UN human rights committee has found (in the cases of Amanda Mellet and Siobhán Whelan) that criminalising abortion in cases of fatal foetal anomaly caused hurt and suffering of such intensity as to violate the right to be free from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment. Adolescent girls have a right to reproductive healthcare under the convention on the rights of the child; that is denied them under the eighth too. If Ireland votes no on Friday, this cannot change. Even if there were 1,000 adverse decisions against Ireland in international human rights bodies, we could not legalise abortion in cases of fatal foetal anomaly, rape or risk of serious harm to health. Any law passed to do so would be unconstitutional, and the constitution can be changed only by a referendum of the people. • Fiona de Londras is professor of global legal studies at Birmingham Law School, the University of Birmingham. She was born and grew up in Ireland. Laoise Ní Dhubhrosa: Ireland will remain a culturally pro-life country The eighth amendment to the Irish constitution is a powerful and progressive human rights statement. Abortion campaigners say it endangers women, but according to the World Health Organization Ireland is the joint sixth safest country in the world in which to give birth. The organisation that I cofounded last year (London Irish United for Life) has contributed to the no side in the referendum by organising a Home to Vote No campaign. We encourage Irish emigrants in the UK who are eligible to vote to return home and vote no. One of the referendum-related trending hashtags is #TooFarForMe. It has become popular among people who support abortion access in “hard cases” but who feel the Irish government has over-reached and proposed an abortion regime that simply goes too far. Some voters also voice discomfort at the possibility that Ireland might, if it repeals the eighth amendment, end up with a similar “abortion culture” to that which prevails in the UK. Irish voters hear that there have been nearly 9 million recorded abortions since the 1967 UK Abortion Act was introduced. That’s twice the population of the Republic of Ireland. Abortion on vague mental health grounds is another cause for alarm. Some 97% of abortions in England and Wales occur under ground C of the act (a risk to physical and mental health). But in 2016, of the 180,794 abortions performed under ground C only 60 were for physical health reasons. Many worry that the mental health provisions are de facto abortion on demand. The Irish government has tried to allay concerns over privatised abortion chains such as Marie Stopes setting up stall in Ireland. It says Irish abortion will be a GP-led service. However, in an already overstretched health service, health professionals are concerned about where the extra resources and time will come. Irish voters may very well cause an upset on Friday and reject the abortion proposals before them. I would contest that Ireland is still a culturally pro-life country and one in which people have deep misgivings about abortion. The right to life of the unborn may prove harder to get rid of than abortion campaigners and their allies in government anticipated. • Laoise Ní Dhubhrosa is the cofounder of London Irish United for Life Mary Higgins: If this fails, we will continue being unable to truly care for our patients I am one of many obstetric specialists who have turned to a happy couple and said to them, “I am so sorry” as I start to gently break the news that their much wanted baby has a fatal foetal abnormality. The anticipated birth is now associated with a funeral. If she wishes to end her pregnancy earlier, we cannot help her. I am one of many doctors who have seen young girls and women attending an early pregnancy unit, hoping that they would be diagnosed with a miscarriage so they would not have to get on a plane or a boat the next day to travel abroad for an abortion. I have been the doctor on duty at 3am when a woman comes in bleeding heavily, crying that she is having a miscarriage, but something makes me think she has taken illegal abortion pills and stayed at home until nearly too late. Under current laws, abortion is illegal unless there is a “real and substantial” risk to her life, I won’t ask her directly in case my question risks her prosecution. I will wonder, but she may not tell. I am one of many doctors in many specialities who watch a woman risking her health for a pregnancy, but cannot intervene unless it is her life that is at risk. For many years we have thought we have shown great empathy to these women, their partners and their families. For many years they thought that we, their doctors, had abandoned them. True compassion combines empathy with action. I am proud to be one of more than 1,500 doctors who support repealing the eighth amendment. If it fails, we will continue being unable to truly care for our patients in the way they deserve. • Prof Mary Higgins is a consultant obstetrician working as a specialist in maternal foetal medicine"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/24/sites-block-eu-users-before-gdpr-takes-effect","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T16:59:31Z","webTitle":"Sites block users, shut down activities and flood inboxes as GDPR rules loom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/sites-block-eu-users-before-gdpr-takes-effect","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/24/sites-block-eu-users-before-gdpr-takes-effect","fields":{"headline":"Sites block users, shut down activities and flood inboxes as GDPR rules loom","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dozens of websites shut down their activities completely, others forced users to agree to new terms of service, and inboxes have been flooded with emails begging customers to remain on mailing lists as the GDPR rules come into force on Friday. The biggest update in data protection laws since the 1990s is posing major challenges for developers and businesses – while giving substantial new powers to consumers. Margot James, the digital minister, told the Guardian: “Of the eight guiding principles that governed the use of personal information under the old act, we have made an important addition – accountability. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, UK citizens more than ever need reassurances their data is as safe as it can be and that organisations are accountable for it.” She said businesses would now have to prove they had been given permission to use a individual’s information, including contact details. “Except in certain, limited instances, organisations now must demonstrate they have our explicit consent to process our sensitive personal data. Generally, we’ve also given greater control to the British public over how their data is used. No doubt like me you’ll have received a flurry of emails in recent weeks from the organisations currently holding your data, and perhaps some you weren’t even aware did, asking for you to re-submit this consent.” The cascade of emails from businesses has become the most visible consumer-facing effect of the new regulation, sent by firms who want users to actively give their consent to remain on a mailing list. But, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office, such emails aren’t necessary to comply with the law. “Some of the myths we’ve heard are, ‘GDPR means I won’t be able to send my newsletter out anymore’ or ‘GDPR says I’ll need to get fresh consent for everything I do’,” Steve Wood, the deputy information commissioner, wrote on the organisation’s website earlier this month. “I can say categorically that these are wrong … You do not need to automatically refresh all existing consents in preparation for the new law.” Campaign groups and political parties who have come to rely on large email mailing lists to contact supporters could find they lose one of their main ways of communicating with the public. It has been suggested that businesses could be forced turn to more traditional methods – such as targeting customers with direct mail through the postal system – to reach customers. As the GDPR deadline neared, some websites and services started to push users to agree to onerous new terms of service before they could continue on to their destination. Websites run by Oath, the media firm formed through the merger of Yahoo! and AOL, received a blanket request on Thursday morning, asking users for consent “to use your … data to understand your interests and personalise and measure ads”. Users could click OK to move on, or follow a chain of further links to discover that the consent granted involved sharing data with more than a hundred ad networks. Another Oath site, Tumblr, placed a similar clickthrough before users. The blogging platform did offer some links to understand “how our partners use this data”. However, even this background information was hosted on Tumblr blogs, meaning users had to accept the terms in order to read information about the terms they were accepting. The US media network NPR took a simpler approach. Users could either agree to the new terms, or decline and be taken to a plain-text version of the site, looking for all the world like it had last been updated in 1996. It wasn’t just websites. PC hardware maker Razer issued an update to one of its computer mice, warning that users may find their devices weren’t working if they didn’t update; Chinese smart-home manufacturer Yeelight disabled inter-connected lightbulbs because of the data protection regulation. And a growing number of companies are taking the nuclear option to ensure compliance: blocking all European users from their servers. Instapaper, a service owned by the US firm Pinterest which enables users to save articles to read at a later date, became the latest to disconnect European customers on Thursday. It said the cutoff was temporary while it made the required changes, and told users: “We apologise for any inconvenience, and we intend to restore access as soon as possible.” Pinterest did not respond to a request for comment. Other companies have taken a more permanent approach. Unroll.me, an inbox management firm, announced it was completely withdrawing services for EU companies due to an inability to offer its product – which is monetised by selling insights gleaned from reading users’ emails – in a way that was compatible with EU law. “We are truly sorry that we are unable to offer our service to you,” the company told EU users. American media network A+E has blocked EU visitors from all its websites, including History.com, and some multiplayer online games, including Ragnarok Online, have switched off their EU servers. Other firms have not gone so far as to blame the new regulation but have closed EU operations with convenient timing. Crowdpac, a political fundraising organisation set up by David Cameron’s former advisor Steve Hilton, announced it was closing its UK wing “for business reasons” until further notice. The company, which was still raising funds in the UK as recently as Sunday, now says it “hopes one day to be back”. Klout, a social media analytics service, and Super Monday Night Combat, an online game, will shut down on Friday. Lithium, the owner of Klout, said: “Klout no longer made sense as a standalone service. The upcoming deadline for GDPR implementation simply expedited our plans to sunset Klout.” Brian Honan, a data protection expert, said he viewed the shutdowns as a reasonable consequence of the new law. “The GDPR’s primary goal is to enhance the protections around the gathering and processing of the personal data belonging to individuals residing within the European Union,” he said. “Companies have had well over two years to prepare for the enforcement date and to be ready.” Unfortunately, even going to the extremes of blocking every user based in the EU might not be enough to inure companies from the consequences of GDPR: the law applies to data processed on EU citizens wherever they are based in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/24/nottingham-has-lowest-household-disposable-income-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T11:36:07Z","webTitle":"Nottingham has lowest household disposable income per head in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/24/nottingham-has-lowest-household-disposable-income-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/24/nottingham-has-lowest-household-disposable-income-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"Nottingham has lowest household disposable income per head in UK","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nottingham is the city with the lowest incomes in the UK, where residents’ take-home pay is only one-fifth of the disposable income enjoyed by people in west London. The average household income per head, once taxes and benefits are taken into account, is only £12,232 in Nottingham, compared to £58,816 in Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fulham in west London. The average for the whole of the UK is £19,432 per head, according to official government figures that reveal the vast gulf in living standards across Britain. The data reveals not only large differences between regions but also the disparity within those regions. A few miles east of Hammersmith and Fulham, household disposable incomes per head plummet by two-thirds to £19,261 in Newham and Hackney. In the north-west, incomes are lowest in Blackburn, at £12,450, little more than half of those in wealthy Cheshire East (£22,025). In the south, incomes are lowest in Southampton (£14,797) and Luton (£14,889), while the East and West Surrey districts make up Britain’s most well-off county, with incomes averaging above £28,000. The reasons behind Nottingham’s ranking as the lowest-income city in the country are complex. The east Midlands city had a strong and prosperous textile industry during the Industrial Revolution but it declined rapidly during the 1950s and 60s. In 2014 it was named the city with the highest proportion of workless households in the UK. More than a third of children in the city live in poverty, according to a report by End Child Poverty earlier this year, with 52% of children in the Arboretum ward living below the breadline. The figures issued on Thursday are for 2016, the latest available data at a local authority level. They also reveal that while average incomes rose marginally on a national level, in many parts of the country they fell. The biggest fall in incomes in 2016 was in Tees Valley in the north-east, a byword for heavy industry, where they fell by 1.6% in real terms after inflation. Meanwhile, real incomes rose by 1.6% in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, at the heart of Britain’s hi-tech industry. The Office for National Statistics said that during 2016 “gross disposable household income per head grew in all regions except the north-east and north-west, which fell by 0.6% and 0.2% respectively.

We launched in May 2013 as a tiny startup desperately trying to appear bigger than we were. (Our launch editor, Katharine Viner – now the Guardian’s global editor-in-chief – our first managing director, Ian McClelland, and I reminisce a little about that exhilaratingly mad time in this podcast chat.) Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Then – just as we were finding our feet – the entire news media felt the full blast of Google and Facebook’s domination as they swallowed the ad market and swamped readers with a torrent of “news”, regardless of its quality or even veracity, warping financial incentives in the process so that the best journalism was often rewarded the least. The existential questions for the media, and for society, posed by that disruption are being debated and investigated around the world, in Australia most importantly via an inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Meanwhile, those of us in the news business have had to find a way to get on with it. Some put up paywalls, but we took a different path. We asked you – our readers – for your support and tens of thousands of you are making voluntary contributions. We crowdfunded some of the journalism we really wanted to do. Most recently we have expanded our investigative capacity using philanthropic grants. And, one way or another, we are bigger than we thought we would be at five – 80 staff across editorial and commercial rather than the 50 we had planned – and on track to make an operating profit this year, which will go straight back into our journalism. But none of that answers the most important question. Are we doing our job as well as we could be? That’s a much tougher question than it sounds. Last year Viner published a deeply thoughtful essay seeking to define our purpose and chart a path for Guardian journalism in this time of technological and political disruption. I recommend reading it in full, but here are some of the markers she set for our reporting. We will ask the questions that people are asking, and the questions that no one is asking. If people long to understand the world, then news organisations must provide them with clarity: facts they can trust, information that they need, reported and written and edited with care and precision. If people long to create a better world, then we must use our platform to nurture imagination – hopeful ideas, fresh alternatives, belief that the way things are isn’t the way things need to be. We cannot merely criticise the status quo; we must also explore the new ideas that might displace it. We must build hope. But how to translate that ambition to our small just-out-of-startup Australian business when we have to stay in “the race” at least enough to cover the news of the day sufficiently that readers don’t feel they need to go elsewhere to get an overview, but still find the resources to interrogate the most important things with the persistence to have an impact. How should we balance those competing priorities? It’s a vexing question when the national conversation seems incapable of holding a thought for longer than a single news cycle and when the disconnect seems wider than ever between the topics hogging mainstream debate and things about which people care. Part of the answer lies in setting our own path, our own clear priorities, which have from the start included policy-focused reporting on politics, asylum, Indigenous affairs, the environment, social inequality and welfare. Of course we can always do better and we can never do enough. As we grow we’ll take on some of the really important stories I so wish we could be reporting on now. Another part of the answer comes from listening to what you want. Every day I start our morning news conference by asking the audience editor,“What did our readers like yesterday?” These analytics give us real time feedback, sometimes thrilling, sometimes brutal. We hear which stories you viewed the most – important to know because a story has no impact if it’s not being read, but not an answer in itself because if we published meaningless clickbait that was turbocharged through social media, it could top the charts. We also hear which stories held your attention for longest – a better measure of what you value. The best indication of all is when we hear from you directly and, happily for us, you seem to want the kind of reporting that Viner describes. You like it when we ask our own questions and set different priorities. Earlier this year, for example, we ran a crowdfunding appeal so we could do more serious investigative environmental reporting, the kind that had fallen away as newsrooms contracted and that we could do only in a limited way with our single environment reporter. You were not just financially generous, you also responded in your hundreds with useful information and excellent ideas, and – according to our analytics – you are enjoying the series of investigations we call Our Wide Brown Land. Just last week you were enthusiastic about another series, Life on the Breadline, in which we will hear directly from a group of Australians living below the poverty line, rather than simply reporting what is being said about them. Our data suggests you love long essays about toxic masculinity, deep investigations into a deadly virus disproportionately affecting central Australian Indigenous communities and tough analyses calling out politicians’ nonsense with an unassailable wall of facts. And our blow-by-blow politics live blog has a large and loyal following. Being increasingly reliant on reader donations anchors our financial future to the same foundations as our journalism. But listening cannot mean always agreeing, and it remains our job to present diverse and challenging views. We certainly don’t want to follow a model some use to survive in a world where an audience can splinter away to an almost infinite number of online news options; creating a loyal, hyper-partisan community by dialling up outrage and manufacturing dissent in opposition to a confected rival “tribe”. “You need to be radical in order to gain market share,” Sam Lessin, a former vice-president of product management at Facebook was quoted as saying in an essay on Wired that discussed this trend. “Reasonableness gets you no points.” Guardian Australia readers certainly get outraged at times, often with good reason. And you do tend to click on stories about the figures that outrage you the most. It would be easy to just feed that outrage but that would be doing you, and ourselves, a disservice. Our job is to provide facts, context, background, solutions and sometimes an opposing view. And, contrary to Lessin’s opinion, many of you seem to crave the “reasonable” approach. So, with that rough mud map for the next phase, I’m going to raise a glass this weekend, to all the rushing and striving and hard work by everyone on the Guardian Australia team, to all those who’ve helped and supported us and, most importantly, to you, our readers. If you happen to have a few seconds to pause and think about the news you want to read over the next five years, I’d love to hear your ideas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/24/belgian-battle-re-enactor-badly-injured-as-sword-slips-through-visor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T09:25:38Z","webTitle":"Belgian battle re-enactor badly injured as sword slips through visor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/belgian-battle-re-enactor-badly-injured-as-sword-slips-through-visor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/24/belgian-battle-re-enactor-badly-injured-as-sword-slips-through-visor","fields":{"headline":"Belgian battle re-enactor badly injured as sword slips through visor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man in his 20s has been left partially paralysed after being struck by a sword that passed through the visor of his helmet during a medieval re-enactment event in Belgium. The man was warming up for a sword fight in the grounds of ‘t Hooghuys Castle in Berlaar, near Antwerp, when the incident occurred. Joël Dumont, the organiser of the event, told the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad that the injured man knew his opponent in the duel well and there was no suggestion of any blame. He said: “Obviously it is intense, but of course it is not a fight for life or death. The sword fighters are also completely wrapped in a heavy armour for safety. There is only a narrow visor to look through. “The two sword fighters were warming up when a sword through the visor landed in the eyes of the swordsman. His eye was touched, but the sword also penetrated further into the underlying tissue of the head. This caused a brain haemorrhage.” He added: “It was just brutal bad luck. Such a visor is very narrow and yet the sword has got through. If you accidentally go towards the eyes, then the narrow visor will normally stop the swords. But the angle was apparently identical, as a result of which the sword slipped in. You are more likely to win the lotto than this occurring.” The rules of the sword fight encourage participants to touch the body of their foe to score points. The swords are blunt but heavy. The incident occurred at Quondam, an annual two-day spectacle featuring re-enactments of bloody battles, archery contests, jousting tournaments, medieval markets and banquets. Hundreds of members of historical associations attended the event along with thousands of spectators. The victim, part of the recently formed Den Yzeren Beer historical association, is said to have been left paralysed on one side of his body. Doctors are uncertain whether the damage will be permanent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/06/el-salvador-devastating-epidemic-femicide","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"'Police never turned up': El Salvador's devastating epidemic of femicide | Jo Griffin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/06/el-salvador-devastating-epidemic-femicide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/06/el-salvador-devastating-epidemic-femicide","fields":{"headline":"'Police never turned up': El Salvador's devastating epidemic of femicide","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The day before she was found dead in a garden in a suburb of the El Salvadoran capital, Graciela Eugenia Ramírez Chávez had gone to buy shoes for her wedding. Her fiance was later arrested and charged with her murder – she had been stabbed 56 times – in a case that briefly made headlines in a country where femicide is a grisly daily reality. The death of 22-year-old Ramírez on 13 February came less than a month after Dr Rosa María Bonilla Vega, 45, died in hospital after being found injured at the foot of the stairs at her home in the city of Santa Ana. Two months later Karla Turcios, a 33-year-old journalist, was found, strangled and suffocated, on a road near the western town where she lived. The partners of both women have been charged with their murders. These were just three high-profile cases among 152 murders of women between 1 January and 1 May in El Salvador, according to the National Women’s Development Institute (Isdemu). The statistics mark an increase from last year, when 123 women were murdered from 1 January up to 30 April in the Central American country, considered one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman. As the rate of femicide has increased, so have demands for the government to act. Last month the attorney general’s office responded by launching a new unit to combat the crisis. Four officials will coordinate nationwide efforts to halt violence against women, children and adolescents, the LGBT community and other vulnerable groups. Graciela Sagastume, who led the investigations into the murders of Bonilla and Turcios, will head up efforts to stop violence against women. “The goal of this new unit is the standardisation, creation and coordination of criteria, strategies and guidelines that permit the attorney general’s office to pay integral attention to the process of investigation and victims of violence,” said the attorney general, Douglas Meléndez, as he inaugurated the unit. “We have confidence that this will get results and make a difference,” said Silvia Ivette Juárez Barrios of Ormusa (the Organisation of Salvadoran Women for Peace). “This integrated approach is what we asked for in the strategy we developed.” She said the crisis was linked to impunity and tolerance by authorities and police. “When the authorities don’t react, that sends out a message that nothing will be done.” Meléndez said that in the case of Ramírez, police had failed to act on warnings in the months leading to her murder. “On repeated occasions neighbours called the [emergency number] to report the victim was being attacked but the police never turned up.” The main reason that women did not report violence was that they found it difficult to access public services, said Vanda Pignato, the secretary for social inclusion, adding that women were often disbelieved if they did manage to report it. Accounts of violence did not match surveys that found, for example, that four in 10 women had experienced sexual violence in their lifetime. The new unit will focus on better allocation of resources and will prioritise prevention, including mobilising civil society to raise awareness, said Salvador Martínez, at the attorney general’s office. “We won’t just be working on cases where murders have occurred, but on prevention. We have found many women are not even aware they are being abused and schools and other institutions will be mobilised to educate people.” He attributed the rise in femicide to “a total social breakdown – a lack of values, a lack of education, a lack of respect and tolerance”. Pressure to tackle the femicide epidemic has been mounting. In March the UN office in San Salvador called for government action to strengthen special tribunals for women and specialist services at PNC (national civil police) branches. A month later women’s rights organisations protested outside the attorney’s general’s office, with banners reading: “It’s not a crime of passion, it’s a crime of patriarchy”, and “We demand the state guarantee the right to a life free from violence”. According to the UN, Latin America and the Caribbean is the most violent region in the world for women, with femicide occurring on a “devastating scale” in Central America, where two out of three women who are murdered die because of their gender. In El Salvador 468 femicides occurred in 2017, one every 18 hours, according to the Institute of Legal Medicine. For Graciela Ramírez, whose family released photographs of the wedding dress she planned to wear, her murder ended a life long marred by violence. She had fled to a new area of the country to escape a former partner who had abused her. Police had simply advised her to “take justice into her own hands” when she reported those attacks, her mother told reporters. “It never stops. People talk about violence against women, but when you look for help, nothing happens.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/may/25/australian-story-feels-the-squeeze-as-abc-refuses-to-cut-corners","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T00:26:18Z","webTitle":"ABC news feels the squeeze but refuses to cut Corners | The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/25/australian-story-feels-the-squeeze-as-abc-refuses-to-cut-corners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/25/australian-story-feels-the-squeeze-as-abc-refuses-to-cut-corners","fields":{"headline":"Australian Story feels the squeeze as ABC refuses to cut Corners","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The ABC may be in dire financial straits as its budget gets squeezed even further by the Coalition but there is one program that has had its budget increased. It was the ABC news director, Gaven Morris, who told the Melbourne Press Club after the $84m federal budget cut was handed down, “Make no mistake, there is no more fat to cut in ABC news. From this point on, we’re cutting into muscle.” But it is also Morris who has delivered an unprecedented boost to the budget of Four Corners, amid widespread squeezing of program budgets and redundancies across the news division. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon While 22 journalists are to be made redundant within days, the flagship investigative program has received a boost to its $4.5m budget of as much as $1.5m, sources told Weekly Beast. A spokeswoman for ABC news said the ABC did not comment on program budgets. However, Morris did tell the press club he was adding four locally made episodes to the Four Corners season, making a total of 44 programs a year. “EP Sally Neighbour is also already recruiting some digital producer roles so we can ensure this incredible reporting isn’t just shown once on a Monday night but goes on to have an equal digital life as well,” Morris said earlier this month. “That means taking our best journalism and massively amplifying its audience, impact and value by giving it proper treatment on digital platforms as well as broadcast.” Budget cuts will be seen elsewhere, however. The ABC is pulling one of its most beloved programs, Australian Story, off-air for eight weeks for a “winter break”, Weekly Beast understands. Monday will see the first episode of a two-part true crime story, Blood on the Tracks, an investigation by Allan Clarke into the death of Mark Haines, a 17-year-old Gomeroi teenager whose body was found on the Tamworth train tracks in 1988. But after that the show will go off air for the month of June and July. That is a first for Australian Story. The look of love Now out of parliament, Jacqui Lambie is finding other ways to stay in the public eye. The former Tasmanian senator will appear on Channel Seven’s Sunday Night this weekend in a story about her love life titled Lambie in Love. The cameras will follow her as she uses dating apps, shops for sexy lingerie and is injected with botox. At 47, she is “unemployed and dateless” and “looking for true love”, according to Seven. “But with Sunday Night in tow – and a little help from her friends – Jacqui has begun a new campaign. She’s going all in, throwing herself back into the dating game and on the hunt for her Prince Charming.” It will be Lambie’s classiest media appearance since she told a radio station what she liked in a man. “They must have heaps of cash and they’ve got to have a package between their legs, let’s be honest,” she said on Heart 107.3FM in 2014. Maiden voyage Sky News Australia boss Angelos Frangopoulos won’t be drawn on the future of star political reporter and presenter Samantha Maiden. The Canberra press gallery was awash with speculation on Monday after it emerged Maiden was on leave following complaints about her behaviour in the workplace. Lawyers are involved, sources say. But a Sky News spokeswoman would not be drawn: “We do not comment on internal staff matters.” A political reporter for two decades, Maiden made a name for herself as a news breaking force for the News Corp Sunday tabloids before quitting to join Sky. No shrinking violet, Maiden wrote in 2016 that the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, had inadvertently sent a text message describing her as a “mad fucking witch” directly to her. Since joining Sky News last year, she has won some new fans for her strong interviewing skills and her refusal to mimic the political views of most of the Sky News presenters – and her takedown of the Australian’s associate editor and Sky colleague Chris Kenny on Twitter. Burying the lede Great excitement this week as Fairfax Media announced the recruitment of 20 trainee journalists to join the newsrooms of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Canberra Times, the Australian Financial Review, Brisbane Times and WAtoday. To an industry that has lost 3,000 jobs in five years, the news was welcome. At the same time as they’re hiring, Fairfax management is trying to undermine the conditions the existing journalists at Fairfax have worked under for many years, according to the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance. “Fairfax management today put its bargaining position forward – an aggressive agenda of cuts to current conditions and no guaranteed pay rises for staff,” the MEAA told members. Some of the longest-serving journalists who took redundancy in recent years walked away with a lot of money because Fairfax did not cap the payout like News Corp does. But now they want to change the agreement to cap redundancies at a maximum of 52 weeks. The journalists’ traditional six-week holiday period is also under fire as management want to drop holiday entitlements from six to four weeks for some journos. Seven’s heaven The ABC copped a lot of flak for daring to send a Sydney-based team of Jeremy Fernandez and Annabel Crabb to cover the royal wedding in London. We told you last week that claims by News Corp that they flew business class were hogwash. But sadly, once on the ground in London, Fernandez and Crabb continued to slum it in economy class. The ABC was corralled in a “holding pen” with a very dreary background that made it look like they were broadcasting from an empty park. Meanwhile Seven’s Melissa Doyle and Michael Usher had a prime spot at the centre of the action. In terms of ratings, Seven also won the day with 2m viewers while the ABC had less than one-quarter of that. But the poor ratings and lacklustre set did not stop the ABC’s intranet site boasting about the “distinctive coverage” that drew 1.6m viewers. Headlined “Audiences Turn to ABC’s First Class Royal Wedding Coverage”, the Pravda-style article failed to disclose how the 1.6m figure was reached. Markle debacles One sour note of the night was the constant referral to the race of Meghan Markle. It was left up to ABC presenter Stan Grant to express disdain for the way commentators kept referring to the bride as “mixed race” or “biracial” – even on the ABC. In an online piece about the world’s obsession with Markle’s race, Grant said: “One British commentator who was part of ABC’s coverage even wondered ridiculously about the future children of Meghan and Harry who, in her words, could be ‘all sorts of colours’.” The less said about SBS’s coverage the better but co-host Ray Martin shocked many watching by pointing out that Prince Philip had once used the N-word on a visit to Nigeria. SBS edited it out of the SBS On Demand version."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/24/sainsburys-presses-ahead-with-pay-cuts-averaging-400-a-year","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T14:52:02Z","webTitle":"Sainsbury's to cut pay by £400 a year on average for 9,000 staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/24/sainsburys-presses-ahead-with-pay-cuts-averaging-400-a-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/24/sainsburys-presses-ahead-with-pay-cuts-averaging-400-a-year","fields":{"headline":"Sainsbury's to cut pay by £400 a year on average for 9,000 staff","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sainsbury’s could face legal action from the union Unite after the supermarket said it was pressing ahead with a plan to cut paid breaks, annual bonuses and premium pay for Sundays, leaving thousands of workers out of pocket. After weeks of consultation with staff and pressure from unions and MPs, the supermarket on Thursday pledged extra pay for online delivery drivers, those on night shifts and those in outer London boroughs, adding £10m to its pay settlement. Sainsbury’s said it was investing £110m in a pay rise for 93% of its 130,000 shop workers, taking pay from £8 to £9.20 an hour, or £9.80 in London, to give an average pay rise of 9.3%. However, the removal of paid breaks, the annual bonus and Sunday and bank holiday pay means 7% of Sainsbury’s staff, or about 9,000 people, will suffer an average pay cut of £400 a year. The supermarket said it would make up the difference in their earnings for 18 months and pledged to review its policy in March 2020. Unite said it had anticipated that a consultation about the new pay arrangements would run until 4 June and feared staff who did not sign up to new contracts enshrining the pay changes could be made redundant in September when they come into effect. The union said it was seeking legal advice over whether Sainsbury’s had failed to meaningfully consult workers. It also claimed Sainsbury’s was attempting to harmonise its contracts with those of Asda workers before a planned merger, which was announced in April. Joe Clarke, the union’s national officer for food and drink, said: “Bosses have cut short the consultation extension over the plans, which will leave thousands out of pocket while still holding a gun to workers’ heads with the threat of sign up to the new contract or be out of a job.” A spokesperson from Sainsbury’s said the company had informed Unite on Wednesday that there were no grounds to continue the consultation and was “disappointed with this reaction from Unite as they have had a seat at the table throughout the consultation process”. They said there was no legal merit to Unite’s proposed claim. “This consultation relates to Sainsbury’s stores only and has nothing to do with the proposed merger with Asda,” the spokesperson added. Usdaw, the shopworkers’ union, said it remained concerned that some workers would lose out but said it was pleased to have persuaded Sainsbury’s to make some concessions after “extensive consultation”. Sainsbury’s has previously been accused by unions of “robbing Peter to pay Paul” and more than 100 MPs signed a letter to the prime minister this week calling for her to intervene. The MPs, led by Labour’s Siobhain McDonagh, criticised the retailer for a “whole array of deplorable decisions that will hit hardest their most dedicated, loyal and long-term staff”. Sainsbury’s said the new deal was “intended to rectify the unfairness of colleagues working side by side in store, doing exactly the same job but being paid different amounts depending on when they started working for Sainsbury’s.” Simon Roberts, the retail and operations director of Sainsbury’s, said the supermarket had tried to minimise the negative impact of the changes and denied that the majority of those affected by pay cuts would be longer-serving staff. “We are trying to do the right thing and to protect our business and grow our business, and protect jobs going forward,” Roberts said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/24/spotify-to-pay-out-112m-in-royalties-to-songwriters","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T09:53:16Z","webTitle":"Spotify to pay out $112m in royalties to songwriters after settlement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/24/spotify-to-pay-out-112m-in-royalties-to-songwriters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/24/spotify-to-pay-out-112m-in-royalties-to-songwriters","fields":{"headline":"Spotify to pay out $112m in royalties to songwriters after settlement","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Spotify will pay out $112m (£83.5m) in a settlement agreement, following two lawsuits that claimed songwriters hadn’t been paid enough in royalties for their work being streamed on the service. The class action, a combination of the two lawsuits, originally came from David Lowery, an musicians’ rights advocate from the band Camper Van Beethoven, and Melissa Ferrick, a songwriter and owner of a music publishing company. They each asserted that Spotify had failed to obtain proper licences to songwriters’ work; Ferrick accused them of “wholesale copyright infringement”. The victory means Spotify will pay $43.5m in cash, with the rest committed to ongoing payment of artist royalties. Judge Alison Nathan, at New York’s southern district court, described the amount as a “significant recovery” for the artists involved. It’s also a win for Spotify, which was pushing for the judge to approve the settlement, previously agreed upon in May 2017. The agreement has met with dissent from music publishing company Wixen, which collects royalties for artists including Janis Joplin and Neil Young. The company filed its own $1.6bn lawsuit in January, arguing for damages of $150,000 per song for more than 10,000 songs; it described the settlement decision as “a 98.7% discount for non-wilful infringement” and “a practical free pass on wilful infringement”. Wixen added that the settlement “offers [songwriters] an unfair dollar amount in light of Spotify’s ongoing, wilful copyright infringement of their works”. Spotify has two other outstanding copyright lawsuits, Bob Gaudio, a founder member of the Four Seasons, and country music publisher Bluewater Music Services Corporation. The suits are a perhaps inevitable bit of friction for Spotify, as the music publishing industry moves from a copyright structure based on radio and record sales, to one that also takes in streaming services. The new US Music Modernization Act, already approved by the House of Representatives in April, is designed to smooth the legislation around copyright. Republican Robert Goodlatte, who sponsored the act, said the existing legislation “seems to generate more paperwork and attorneys’ fees than royalties”. Opponents are concerned the act won’t change the currently low royalty rates paid by streaming companies, and that it favours the major publishers over smaller outfits and independent songwriters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/may/25/did-you-work-for-the-nhs-during-its-first-years","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T08:34:27Z","webTitle":"Tell us about when you first started working for the NHS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/25/did-you-work-for-the-nhs-during-its-first-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/25/did-you-work-for-the-nhs-during-its-first-years","fields":{"headline":"Tell us about when you first started working for the NHS","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The NHS turns 70 in July and we’d like to hear from staff who worked for the service over the last seven decades.

The request comes after ministers in Malaysia’s newly-elected government gave mixed messages about their plans for the future of the search. On Thursday, the new transport minister, Anthony Loke, signalled he wanted to abandon looking for the plane and seek “closure”. Malaysia’s newly elected prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, had earlier announced he would review the necessity of the search and terminate it if it was “not useful”. But on Saturday, prime minister-in waiting Anwar Ibrahim told the Australian newspaper he was “not ruling out further searches” if a re-examination of Malaysia’s own information brought up new findings. Family members of those on board the plane said the search would cost the government very little money, if only they “stepped up to the plate”. In January, the Malaysian government signed an agreement with the US-based company Ocean Infinity to commission a new search in the Indian Ocean. The Australian government had previously searched for the plane between 2014 and 2017 without success. Ocean Infinity was given 90 days – not including time spent refuelling – to find MH370 on a “no-find, no-fee” basis. A payment of between $20m and $70m was promised, with the fee rising depending on the area searched. The search was always scheduled to end on Tuesday, due to the onset of bad winter weather in the southern Indian Ocean, but Loke’s comments have cast doubt on whether it would be renewed next spring. Grace Nathan, whose mother was on MH370, said the government had broken an election promise and failed to give a clear reason why the search should be abandoned. “There was a lot of mention of it in the run-up to the election, and immediately when the new transport minister was appointed, the first statement he made was that MH370 would be his top priority,” she said. “Then a mere two or three days later, after the first cabinet meeting, he said we’re not extending the search anymore. I was really shocked.” KS Narendran, whose wife was on MH370, said Loke’s offer of closure was “simply closing the case file, not resolving the case because someone got tired.” “I am barely able to contain my deep sense of betrayal. It is barely possible to conceal anger at a decision taken without the courtesy of a meeting and consultation with affected families.” Nathan said the “no-find, no-fee” condition meant Malaysia was not spending any money unless the plane was found. She said Ocean Infinity had already offered to continue the search next year under the same conditions. “Are they now cutting off offers from private companies who are willing to conduct the search at their own expense, and only be paid if the plane is found? They’ve already put the money aside. My question is why can’t they keep that money there? “People say that it’s expensive, but the search up to now has not cost more than a brand new Boeing. If Malaysia thinks the money has to be utilised somewhere else, they need to step up to the plate and ask if other countries are willing to contribute.” MH370 was carrying 152 Chinese nationals, 50 Malaysian nationals, and passengers from India, Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Iran, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine and the US when it vanished 40 minutes into a flight from Malaysia to China. Military radar and satellite data suggested the plane suddenly turned around and flew south towards the Indian Ocean, crashing and claiming the lives of all 239 crew and passengers on board. Nathan and Narendran said China and India should contribute to a new search for the plane. “This is an incident that if unresolved, could happen again,” Nathan said. “They could also ask companies like Boeing or Airbus to contribute. They stand to benefit immensely from safer air travel, are highly profitable and make billions and billions. “People might think: ‘Why are these people still harping on about this, it’s been four years’. It’s important for people to remember that MH370 is not history,” she said. “This Ocean Infinity search raises more questions than it answers. If this amazing new state-of-the-art tech can’t find it, do we need to go back to the drawing board? The current status is that MH370 vanished. That’s not something you can say is an acceptable conclusion in this day and age.” • This article was amended on 2 June 2018 to correct the name of the airline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/24/deutsche-bank-slashes-7000-jobs-with-city-likely-to-take-hit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T15:18:43Z","webTitle":"Deutsche Bank slashes 7,000 jobs, with City likely to take hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/24/deutsche-bank-slashes-7000-jobs-with-city-likely-to-take-hit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/24/deutsche-bank-slashes-7000-jobs-with-city-likely-to-take-hit","fields":{"headline":"Deutsche Bank slashes 7,000 jobs, with City likely to take hit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender, is to cut more than 7,000 jobs globally, with its investment banking business in London likely to be hit. Deutsche said one in four equities sales and trading jobs, which are mainly located in New York and London, would be axed. The bank’s global headcount is expected to fall from just over 97,000 to well below 90,000. The firm said it would not provide a breakdown at this stage but that all regions would be affected. Deutsche’s largest investment banking operation is based in the City of London. It employs about 8,500 people in the UK – mostly in London, with smaller operations in Birmingham and Bournemouth – and is one of the largest employers in the City. Deutsche’s new chief executive, Christian Sewing, said: “We remain committed to our corporate and investment bank and our international presence – we are unwavering in that. We are Europe’s alternative in the international financing and capital markets business. However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well.” The move is part of a plan to scale back its global investment bank and refocus on Europe after three consecutive years of losses. Last month the bank said it would pare back US bond trading, global stock trading and its business serving hedge funds. The news came a few hours before the group’s annual shareholder meeting in Frankfurt, where Paul Achleitner, who has chaired Deutsche since 2012, faced a no-confidence motion over the company’s poor performance. When Sewing, the former co-head of the bank’s retail banking arm, was appointed to replace his British predecessor, John Cryan, in April, he vowed to take “tough decisions” to return the bank to profitability. Cryan was criticised for being too slow in pushing through cost-cutting measures. Sewing told shareholders gathered at Frankfurt’s Festhalle that the job cuts were already under way and that 600 investment bankers had left in the last seven weeks. He said the bank wanted a better balance between business divisions. He also warned of a tough outlook: “In the second quarter, the revenue situation remains challenging, particularly for the corporate and investment bank.” At the meeting, where shareholders were served Frankfurter sausages, pretzels and cake, Achleitner denied claims he had botched the change of CEO last month. Cryan’s ousting came after a two-week boardroom battle and the Deutsche chairman insisted that Sewing was the best man for the job, rather than a company outsider. Shareholders called on Deutsche to speed up the recovery after months of internal turmoil.Hans-Christoph Hirt of Hermes Investment Management, a Deutsche Bank shareholder, told Achleitner – who has presided over four CEO changes – he should be replaced and called for more “effective” leadership of the supervisory board. “Unfortunately, the results of your work are not convincing.” Klaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW said: “It is high-time to … end the years-long and still-popular ‘Deutsche Bank bashing’ and get to work finally getting our bank back on its feet after six long years of restructuring.” However, Brian Scott-Quinn, the director of banking programmes at Henley Business School, said Deutsche was trapped in a “spiral of decline” that started 20 years ago. “We really no longer need Deutsche Bank. There are already plenty of retail banks in Germany to provide competition and a good service to consumers. In investment banking it is the same as there are still good European investment banks which can provide a good service to German industry. It is almost impossible now to recover from years of mismanagement.” The cutbacks will mean Deutsche stepping back from several decades of global expansion in which the bank vied with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Redundancy packages and other restructuring costs will result in charges of up to €800m this year, hitting profits. Deutsche’s shares fell almost 6% on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/24/abortion-laws-bill-to-establish-exclusion-zones-around-nsw-clinics-passes-upper-house","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T09:13:54Z","webTitle":"Abortion laws: bill to establish exclusion zones around NSW clinics passes upper house","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/abortion-laws-bill-to-establish-exclusion-zones-around-nsw-clinics-passes-upper-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/24/abortion-laws-bill-to-establish-exclusion-zones-around-nsw-clinics-passes-upper-house","fields":{"headline":"Abortion laws: bill to establish exclusion zones around NSW clinics passes upper house","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A bill to establish exclusion zones around abortion clinics in New South Wales has passed the state’s upper house. The bill, which establishes 150m protest exclusion zones around abortion clinics in the state, passed through the legislative council without a division after several hours of debate. It will now go to the state’s lower house where the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has indicated that she is likely to support it. The Guardian reported on Wednesday that the legislation appeared certain to pass after the governing Liberal-National party coalition gave its MPs a conscience vote on the bill. The bill was co-sponsored by Labor’s Penny Sharpe and Trevor Khan from the Nationals, and it was a group of Nationals MPs who assured its passage through the council. Sarah Mitchell, a Nationals MP and the minister for early childhood education, gave an emotional speech in which she told the House that she had two miscarriages between giving birth to her two daughters. “I was in shock,” she said. “It was a day that started with us hoping to see our baby’s heartbeat for the first time to emergency ultrasounds, to a surgical procedure that afternoon to remove the baby as that was the best clinical option for me. “On that day it was a traumatic enough experience [and] I can’t imagine what it would have been like to be entering a place for treatment after losing my baby and to be harassed, called names, shown pictures or filmed or even handed pamphlets or prayed for by people who may have genuinely been doing it because they were well meaning. “It would have pushed me over the edge at my most fragile.” She said the reality it is “not and will never be immediately evident to anyone standing outside as to why someone [is] walking through the front door” of a health clinic. Another Nationals MP, Bronnie Taylor, a former nurse, spoke with her 22-year-old daughter in the gallery. She said that former patients of hers had been harassed outside of medical clinics. “I want to make sure today that my daughters, my friends, whoever I know and care about, will never ever be harassed and will be free to make their choice,” she said. “And they can remember today that we stood here and stood up for them to protect them, to honour them, and to give them the dignity they so deserve.” Catherine Cusack, a moderate Liberal party MP, opposed the bill because, she said, it would impinge on freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, which she called “cornerstones of all of our freedoms”. “The reason we can call it a freedom is because those rights are accessible to all irrespective or their political or religious creed,” she said. She said that there were situations where speech was “repugnant to our personal values” but that “that in itself is not enough to make a law”. During the debate the ultra-conservative MP Fred Nile from the Christian Democrats party claimed that sewage pipes at an abortion clinic had become blocked by “baby body parts”. “Little arms, little legs,” he said. In her address in reply, Sharpe rebuked the claim and said it was “completely false”. She read a statement from the clinic stating that the blockage had been caused by a broken pipe elsewhere in the building. Sharpe called the bill a “small but important change for women in NSW”. “What is happening outside clinics is not protest, it is harassment, even if it is well-intentioned,” she said. “Women should be able to go to the doctors and not have to explain themselves on the street.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/may/24/senior-tory-tells-may-any-nhs-funding-increase-worth-less-than-4-could-be-disastrous-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T15:17:04Z","webTitle":"Being excluded from EU Galileo satellite system creates 'irreparable security risk' for UK, say ministers - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/may/24/senior-tory-tells-may-any-nhs-funding-increase-worth-less-than-4-could-be-disastrous-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/may/24/senior-tory-tells-may-any-nhs-funding-increase-worth-less-than-4-could-be-disastrous-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Being excluded from EU Galileo satellite system creates 'irreparable security risk' for UK, say ministers - Politics live","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Brexit department has said that excluding the UK after Brexit from military aspects of the EU’s Galileo satellite navigation project, as the EU currently intends, would create an “irreparable security risk” for the country. (See 3.33pm.) The government should urgently set out whether it plans to extend the UK’s transitional membership of the customs union beyond 2020, given the likelihood that no replacement plan will be ready in time, the Commons Brexit committee has said. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has refused to tell MPs when the EU withdrawal bill will return to the Commons for MPs to vote on amendments passed in the Lords. (See 12.01pm.) She announced the business for the week beginning Monday 4 June, which does not include the bill. But sources later said the bill would get debated the following week, which begins on Monday 11 June. Jeremy Corbyn has rebuffed claims he will seek a united Ireland if he becomes prime minister during his first visit to Belfast since becoming the leader of the opposition. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has announced new legislation to allow Windrush citizens to have their British citizenship applications processed faster and free of charge. Offenders could fill the workforce gap left behind by Brexit, David Gauke, the justice secretary has said, as he launched a strategy to boost prisoners’ employment prospects. A duo of Russian pranksters with suspected links to the country’s security services managed to get through to the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and held an 18-minute phone conversation with him by pretending to be the Armenian prime minister. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Ipsos MORI has released some polling today. The Sun’s Nick Gutteridge thinks the government is playing up the threat of a Corbyn government in the economic partnership paper (pdf) published today by the Brexit department. The Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns has resigned as a parliamentary private secretary attached to the ministry for housing. In a blog on her website, she explains that she is doing this so that she has more time to support the pro-Brexit minority on the Commons Brexit committee, of which she is a member. She says: Currently, there are 21 members on the Brexit committee, only 7 of which voted to leave the EU. It is my opinion that the reports produced by the committee have been unbalanced in favour of us either remaining in the EU, the customs union or delaying our departure. I, therefore, feel I need to spend more of my time doing all I can do to correct this imbalance and be a robust voice for the benefits of Brexit. The title, Technical Note: UK Participation in Galileo (pdf), sounds rather dry, but the contents are anything but. It is not often that you can feel the anger coming through in bureaucratic documents, but you can with this one. Galileo is a €10bn satellite navigation system being developed by the EU. It will be used commercially - your smartphone will end up talking to it - but, crucially, its encrypted public regulated service (PRS) will be used by the military. Galileo will be safer (less vulnerable to hacking) and more accurate than the American GPS version currently used by the armed forces, and the government says access to Galileo is a matter of national security. Here are the main points from the document. The government says it objects strongly to the fact it is already excluded from security-related Galileo planning for the post-Brexit period. The UK therefore has a strong objection to its ongoing exclusion from security-related discussions and exchanges pertaining to the post-2019 development of Galileo and the PRS, which serves to limit UK assurance in the programme and discourage UK industrial participation. It says excluding Britain from the project creates “an irreparable security risk”. From a security perspective, any gap in UK involvement in the design and development of Galileo and PRS, whereby the UK is unable to manufacture components or assure those manufactured by member states at any point, will constitute an irreparable security risk. It will mean the UK will not be able to rely on the system for our own security and defence needs. It says if the UK is not allowed to participate in the security aspects of Galileo, it will cut all its future involvement in the project. It confirms that it is considering setting up its own alternative. If agreement cannot be reached on the future balance of rights and obligations, and UK security and industrial requirements consequently cannot be met, the UK could not justify future participation in Galileo. In parallel, the UK is therefore exploring alternatives to fulfil its needs for secure and resilient position, navigation and timing information, including the option for a domestic satellite system. It says Europe as a whole, not just the UK, would lose out from Britain being excluded from the project. The UK wants to continue participating in Galileo. This is in the mutual interests of the UK and EU, benefitting European competitiveness, security, capability development and interoperability. An end to close UK participation will be to the detriment of Europe’s prosperity and security and could result in delays and additional costs to the programme. It says excluding the UK from the full participation could delay the project by up to three years and add €1bn to the costs. Excluding industrial participation by UK industry in security-related areas risks delays of up to three years and additional costs of up to €1 billion to the programme. It will not be straightforward to effectively fulfil all Galileo security work elsewhere. It says the UK’s share of Galileo was not taken into account when the Brexit “divorce bill” was being calculated because it was assumed the UK would retain full access. If this is not the case, the Brexit financial settlement should be reopened, it says. Paragraph 66 of the [December joint report] states that “union assets relating to union space programmes (EGNOS, Galileo &amp; Copernicus) are not part of the financial settlement”. The exclusion of these UK sunk costs was agreed on the basis that the UK would retain full access. Should the UK’s future access be restricted, the UK’s past contribution to the financing of space assets should be discussed. The Brexit department has now published four position papers today: A 21-page framework for the UK-EU economic partnership (pdf) A 6-page technical note on Galileo (pdf) A 20-page technical note on security, law enforcement and criminal justice (pdf) A 6-page technical note on consultation and cooperation on external security (pdf) It is not just the DUP that has been attacking Jeremy Corbyn over his stance on Northern Ireland. (See 1pm.) The Labour MP Ian Austin, a former minister and former aide to Gordon Brown who is on the right of the party and who has repeatedly criticised Corbyn before, has published an article today on PoliticsHome arguing that Corbyn is more leftwing than any of his predecessors and that he has turned Labour “from a mainstream social democratic party into something very different”. Quite a lot of the evidence cited by Austin to back his case relates to Corbyn’s record on Ireland. Austin says: On Northern Ireland, they were both completely outside the mainstream of the Labour Party. It might be ancient history for lots of the party’s new young recruits, but lots of older people will never forget what they said about the IRA during a brutal war which saw bombs planted and people murdered in shopping centres, hotels and pubs. A few weeks after the IRA blew up the Grand Hotel in Brighton and murdered five people at the Tory party conference in 1984, Jeremy Corbyn invited two suspected IRA terrorists to the House of Commons. When the man responsible for planting the bomb was put on trial, he demonstrated outside the court. As recently as 2003, John McDonnell [the Corbyn ally and shadow chancellor] said “those people involved in the armed struggle” should be honoured - people who he said had used “bombs and bullets”. Let’s be really clear about this. It is not true to claim as John McDonnell does, that he did “everything I possibly could to secure the peace process in Northern Ireland”. It is just not true. People like him and Jeremy Corbyn were campaigning for a victory for the republican cause, not working for a peaceful agreement between the two bitterly divided sides. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn was amongst a handful who voted against the Anglo-Irish agreement in 1985 and why John McDonnell opposed setting up a power-sharing assembly which eventually became the Good Friday agreement because “an assembly is not what people have laid down their lives for over thirty years … the settlement must be for a united Ireland.” Austin concludes his article by suggesting that “mainstream social democrats” should not support Corbyn. He says: The truth is that Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left have taken over the Labour party and want to turn it from a mainstream social democratic party into something very different. It’s got a different leadership, different policies and different values. They want to create a different party. That’s why mainstream social democrats do not support Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Corbyn’s supporters would no doubt point out that lots of mainstream social democrats in the party do back his leadership. They might disagree with him on foreign policy (the main focus of Austin’s article), but on domestic policy even the centrists broadly support Corbyn, and there is also a recognition that his leadership is legitimate because he has the clear support of members. Opposition parties have reacted with derision after it emerged that Nicola Sturgeon will not personally launch a long-awaited and much-hyped Scottish National party report setting out a prospectus for independence, including the country’s currency options. (See 11.11am.) The 458-page “Sustainable Growth Commission” report, first started some 20 months ago by Andrew Wilson, a former SNP MSP turned expert lobbyist, will only be published online on Friday without any press conference. Sturgeon insisted during Thursday’s first minister’s questions at Holyrood the report would provide “the positive debate that we look forward to leading is how Scotland raises its game even further, matching the best in the world.” She said: We will do that with our current powers and we will look to equip this parliament so it is even stronger to deliver on behalf of the people we represent. Murdo Fraser, a Scottish Tories’ shadow finance secretary, accused the first minister of cowardice. “It’s telling that Nicola Sturgeon is too scared to face questions on the matter,” he said. A leader in the Scottish edition of the Sun, a longstanding supporter of the SNP as a devolved government, said: Nicola Sturgeon is not normally one for dodging the limelight. Earlier this week she appeared in person to announce extra funding for regeneration in Dalmarnock, Glasgow. She personally launched a community shares scheme to fund the revamp of the city’s Govanhill baths. Yet the long-awaited growth commission report “will be published on the internet tomorrow with no fanfare and, crucially no opportunity to question Sturgeon or the report’s authors,” it said. A duo of Russian pranksters with suspected links to the country’s security services say they managed to get through to the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and hold an 18-minute phone conversation with him by pretending to be the Armenian prime minister, my colleague Shaun Walker reports. The government should urgently set out whether it plans to extend the UK’s transitional membership of the customs union beyond 2020, given the likelihood that no replacement plan will be ready in time, the Commons Brexit committee has said. In an often damning latest update on the progress of departure, the cross-party committee of MPs said it was “highly unsatisfactory” that nearly two years after the referendum, ministers had not even set out what post-Brexit trading and customs arrangements they hoped to make. The report (pdf) – which was agreed by all the committee’s members, including Conservative Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg and Peter Bone, and the DUP’s Sammy Wilson – also issued a warning over progress on citizens’ rights. It said the Windrush scandal had “undermined trust in the ability of the Home Office competently to register EU citizens living in the UK” and process their status. It added that, while planning for this was under way in Britain, in many other EU states where UK citizens were living little work had been done on what they would need to do to keep their residential status. It said the government should “seek urgent clarification from the EU27”. Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said the “clock is now running down” and MPs would need considerably more clarity before being asked to vote on a draft withdrawal agreement in the autumn. He said: Twenty-three months after the referendum and 14 months since the triggering of article 50, we still don’t know what the UK’s future relationship with the EU will be on trade, services, security, defence, consumer safety, data, broadcasting rights and many other things. Here is a link to text of Corbyn’s speech in Belfast. The Labour party has also accused the Telegraph of misrepresenting Cobryn’s views. In a comment on a tweet linking to the Telegraph splash (see 12.16pm), it said: But the DUP has criticised Jeremy Corbyn for not meeting the victims of IRA violence during his trip to Northern Ireland. Labour told the Belfast Telegraph that Corbyn’s trip was arranged some time ago and that when the DUP MP Gregory Campbell proposed a meeting with victims, it was too late to set that up. But Campbell says he will published emails later showing that Corbyn’s office did have enough time to reorganise his schedule. In a statement Campbell said: Jeremy Corbyn is well known for having avoided specific issues relating to terrorism in Northern Ireland. His answer that he “condemns all bombing” when asked about IRA terrorism is somewhat reminiscent (if different in scale) to his comments that he “condemns all racism” when asked about antisemitism. This would have been a very useful opportunity for Jeremy Corbyn to demonstrate just how willing he is to meet people who live and work in border areas, but whose views he may not have heard face to face befor Unfortunately having emailed the invitation on the morning of 14 May, hand delivered that invitation and personally invited him in a face to face interaction yesterday, I am still without any substantive reply. Yesterday afternoon Mr Corbyn’s office emailed me asking for my direct number. I supplied it but I have never received a call. This appears to be a blatant and deliberate snub to innocent victims. The SDLP, Labour’s sister party in Northern Ireland, says Jeremy Corbyn should commit itself to keeping the UK fully aligned with the single market after Brexit. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in response to the final question, which was about whether he would back border poll as prime minister. He said: That would be a decision that could be made within the terms of the Good Friday agreement. If that is the wish, then clearly such a poll would happen. I’m not asking for it, I’m not advocating it. What I’m asking for is a return to the fullness of the Good Friday agreement which would open up the opportunities and possibilities for the future of Ireland as whole. That is the point of the Good Friday agreement - not direct rule, not imposition of a political view from Westminster, but devolution of powers to Stormont here and of course the relationship with the Republic. And it is quite clear that it’s there for a poll on both sides of the border, should that be something that is demanded. Corbyn is a longstanding supporter of Irish reunification, although since becoming Labour leader he has said little on this subject. His comment today, stressing that he would not be pushing for a border poll, seemed intended to correct a story on the front page of today’s Daily Telegraph. At a briefing yesterday Corbyn’s spokesman was asked if Corbyn still supported a united Ireland, as he did when he was a backbencher. The spokesman said that Corbyn had not changed his view, but that he accepted that unification would only happen in accordance with the procedure set out in the Good Friday agreement (which said the people of Northern Ireland would have to vote for this in a referendum.) By the time this ended up as the Telegraph splash, it became: “Corbyn calls for a united Ireland.” In what is becoming a regular ritual, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced another week of business with no news about the return of the EU withdrawal bill, or indeed anything else related to Brexit. With the Commons in recess next week, Leadsom was announcing what was happening for the week beginning on Monday 4 June, which include the Ivory bill, and general debates on Nato, TB and human rights in Turkey. Leadsom added: “With regards to important Brexit legislation, I’m confident I will be able to update the house on these bills shortly, in the usual way.” This brought some open laughter from opposition MPs. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, pointed to reports which claimed Tory MPs had been told the EU withdrawal bill – where MPs must consider 15 amendments made in the Lords – would return the following week, 11 June, with the long-delayed trade and customs bill to follow as well. “It is unprecedented to treat parliament in this way – business is announced in the media and not in the house,” Vaz said, saying Leadsom was part of a government “limping from one week to the next”. Q: I’m tempted to ask if you have read the Good Friday agreement (a reference to the immigration minister Caroline Nokes, who hasn’t), but I know you will have done. Do you think there should be special arrangements for Northern Ireland? Corbyn says Labour does not want a hard border. If a special arrangement is made for Northern Ireland, then there will have to be a border somewhere. Will it be between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland. Labour’s priority is to avoid a hard border on trade with the EU. He says when he and Keir Starmer went to meet Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Ireland was the first subject Barnier brought up. They are very conscious of the needs of Northern Ireland, he says Q: If you become PM, will you hold a border poll on Irish unity? Corbyn says that would be a decision that could be made within the terms of the Good Friday agreement. If that was the wish, it would happen. But he is not asking for it or advocating for it, he says. The Good Friday agreement allows for this if it is something that is demanded, he says. Corbyn says he will not push for a referendum on Irish unification if he becomes prime minister. A border poll would only happen if there was a demand for it, he says. Corbyn has finished his speech. He is now taking questions. Q: [From the president of the students union] What role do you see for students? Corbyn praises the work done on civil rights at Queen’s University. Any conflict in the world starts with an abuse of human rights, he says. He says Labour strongly supports the private member’s bill from the Labour MP Conor McGinn to allow same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. But he is not sure what chance of success it has, he says. He says the problem was not so much that young people were not interested in politics. It was that politics was not interested in young people. That was one of the messages of last year’s election, he says. He urges students to go on campaigning. He says he does not want to bring back direct rule from Westminster. He has seen that before, and does not want to return to that. Young people should never be afraid to say the unsayable, or to campaign on any issue of human rights. Human rights legislation never came from above. It came from pressure below. He says he has been reading the UN report on human rights in the UK. It is uncomfortable reading. But that is okay - provided politicians respond. Q: Wouldn’t it be better just to stay in the single market and the customs union? Corbyn says he recognises the results of the referendum. But he wants to maintain a good trade relationship with the EU. Labour is proposing a customs union, which would give the UK a say. It is not proposing that in a threatening way. Some ministers are talking about trade deals as if they could be used to undermine the EU, he says. He says he and Keir Starmer have worked very hard on Labour’s plans. He says, after the EU referendum, Labour proposed in the Commons guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals in the UK. The government still has not done that. Labour would legislate for that from day one. Corbyn says Labour would support ship building in Northern Ireland. We are committed to supporting manufacturing in Northern Ireland and Labour’s recent pledge to reverse the decision to put the £1 billion contract to build the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships out to international tender will keep jobs and prosperity in Britain’s shipyards and could benefit Belfast. Corbyn says he will be visiting the Irish border tomorrow. Avoiding a hard border is not just a matter of avoiding customs checks, he says. An open border is more than that. It is a symbol of peace. Corbyn turns to Brexit. Driven by the free-market fantasists within their ranks, the reckless Conservative approach to Brexit is a very real threat to jobs and living standards here in Northern Ireland and risks undermining and destabilising the cooperation and relative harmony of recent years. Labour will not support any Brexit deal that includes the return of a hard border to this island. But we are also clear there must be no border created in the Irish Sea either. That is why Labour has put forward a plan that would go a long way to solving this issue, a plan for which I believe there is a majority in Westminster. Let’s not give up years of hard fought cooperation and stability for the pipe dream prize of race-to-the-bottom free trade deals with the likes of Donald Trump. Opposition to the idea of bringing back a hard border to this land isn’t just about avoiding paperwork or tariffs, important though that is, it’s about deep rooted cultural and community ties. An open border is a symbol of peace, two communities living and working together after years of conflict, communities who no longer feel that their traditions are under threat. Corbyn claims there is a majority in the Commons for Labour’s Brexit plan, which would involve the UK staying in a customs union with the EU for good. Corbyn says it is not inevitable that peace will always continue. The Westminster parties need to do more, he says. Devolution and power-sharing have given every community a voice and helped maintain the peace process. If the current stalemate in Stormont cannot be sorted out in Belfast, I call on the UK government to reconvene the British-Irish intergovernmental conference. We must step up to find a creative solution, in the spirit of the Good Friday agreement, that avoids a return to direct Westminster rule and lays the ground for further progress for all communities. Corbyn is now talking about the need to re-establish power sharing in Northern Ireland. Look back at the sacrifice and courage shown at all levels of society that paved the way for something that had once seemed impossible. That was the spirit of the Good Friday agreement. We all need that spirit again - Stormont and Westminster parties, the British and Irish governments, business and unions, UK and EU negotiators - if we want to secure 20 more years of peace and greater prosperity for the many not the few. Jeremy Corbyn is delivering his speech in Belfast now. There is a live feed on the Queen’s University Belfast Facebook page. He has just told a story about voting on one occasion in the House of Commons with teh late DUP MP Ian Paisley. That illustrated the importance of being able to talk to people from all sides, he said. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just delivered the business statement in the Commons. But she has still not announced a date for when MPs will debate the Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn reports. There are quite a few interesting Brexit stories in the papers this morning. Here is a round-up. The Times (paywall) says Theresa May will ask the European Union for a second Brexit transition period to run until 2023 to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Britain will propose another transition covering customs and trade that will follow the period already agreed, scheduled to last until the end of 2020, The Times understands. The prime minister’s new proposal has not yet been tabled in Brussels and faces opposition from EU negotiators and Brexit-supporting Conservatives. The transitional deal already agreed will last from next March to the end of 2020. Britain will ask for a customs and regulatory alignment implementation period from 2021 to at least 2023 to avoid the need for infrastructure or checks on the border. John Stevens in the Daily Mail says there is a £5.6million plan to thwart Brexit. Leaked papers apparently show that a pro-Remain group has launched a six-month plan to stop Britain leaving the EU. Backed by billionaire financier George Soros, Best for Britain aims to spend nearly £6million on the campaign, according to the documents. They allegedly reveal that the group will contradict whatever final agreement Theresa May strikes with Brussels – arguing it is ‘not what we voted for’. Tom McTague at Politico Europe says the UK will threaten to set up a rival to the EU’s Galileo satellite navigation system if the EU continues to insist that it will not be allowed to fully participate after Brexit. There is growing fury in London at what it sees as Brussels’ uncompromising stance in negotiations over a project that the British government see as a test case for how close the U.K.’s future security relationship with the Continent will be. Harry Cole in the Sun says cabinet inisters and backbench Brexiters have forced Theresa May to confront rebel MPs in the Commons and end her “bedwetter” Chief Whip’s dithering. One cabinet minister told The Sun that Chief Whip Julian Smith was being too cautious in delaying the votes, giving the impression Downing Street are running scared. They dismissed him as a overly nervous “bedwetter” and insisted Mrs May had the numbers to defeat a handful of pro-EU diehards. Addressing the backbench 1922 Committee Mr Smith confirmed that Tory MPs would be heavily whipped to oppose the Lords amendments next month. The “growth commission” set up by Nicola Sturgeon to sketch out the economic advantages of independence will claim tomorrow that every Scot could be £4,100 better off if Scotland were able to match the growth rates of other smaller wealthy nations. The long-awaited report by the policy adviser Andrew Wilson, some 20 months in the writing and re-writing, makes the familiar case an independent Scotland would be able to tailor its tax, investment and economic strategies to better suit the country’s needs. He admits that could take at least a generation. That ought to allow Scotland to match GDP growth by countries such as Denmark, Finland and New Zealand, and another nine small nations it studied. Scotland’s economy is stuttering, however, and has lagged behind the UK’s growth rate for several years. It had a current account deficit of £13.5bn in 2016 or 8.3% of government spending, more than three times larger than the UK’s as a whole. Wilson said comparable small nations had seen their GDP rise by 0.7% on average over the last 25 years: larger nations’ growth rates were lower. Scotland needed more migration; fiscal discipline; a “flexible workforce”; a competitive inward investment policy; and a focus on innovation, he said. After several stop-start efforts to reinvigorate Sturgeon’s campaign for Scottish independence since losing the 2014 referendum by 10 points, Sturgeon wants the latest iteration to be founded on “optimism”. Wilson, a former SNP MP who now runs Scotland’s most influential lobbying outfit, Charlotte Street Partners, said he believed his report was the most substantial yet produced. “Our sincere hope is that this can raise the content and quality of debate at a time such a focus is sorely needed,” he said. Opposition parties were immediately dismissive. With its uncanny echoes of the promises and threats made by yes and no, leave and remain camps in the 2014 vote and the 2016 EU referendum, it also echoes Alex Salmond’s ill-fated “arc of prosperity” claim some 10 years ago. He said an independent Scotland could easily emulate the vibrant economies of Iceland and Ireland, before both crashed violently in the 2008 banking crisis. Britain must face reality on post-Brexit trade rather than continue the “buccaneering blather” of hard Brexiters, the UK’s former chief EU diplomat Sir Ivan Rogers has said in a hard-hitting speech. My colleague Jessica Elgot has written it up here. And you can read the full, 11,000-word text here. Scotland is to legislate for tougher action on climate change, with ministers proposing new laws that would require emissions to be cut by 90% by 2050, the Press Assocation reports. At the moment the commitment is to reduce emissions by 80% by that date, a move hailed as world-leading when it was first introduced. The new target is “at the limit of feasibility”, according to the advisory body, the UK Committee on Climate Change. But environmental campaigners were pressing for a 100% reduction in emissions - known as a “net zero” target - to be in the new Climate Change Bill. Announcing the move, the Scottish government’s environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: Our 90% target will be tougher even than the 100% goal set by a handful of other countries, because our legislation will set more demanding, legally-binding, annual targets covering every sector of our economy. By 2030, we will cut emissions by two-thirds and, unlike other nations, we will not use carbon offsetting, where other countries are paid to cut emissions for us, to achieve our goal. The Brexit department is publishing more position papers relating to the negotiations today. The BBC’s Adam Fleming has a quick preview. I’m sorry the blog has been quiet for a while. My posts have been appearing in the wrong place due to an old-fashioned fuck-up. I’ll put them all here now. David Gauke, the justice secretary, was on the Today programme this morning talking about his plans to improve education and employment opportunities for prisoners. But he was also asked about the HMRC claim yesterday that the “max fac” customs plan favoured by cabinet Brexiters would cost businesses up to £20bn a year. He did not reject the assessment, telling the programme: We obviously want to ensure any costs are kept to a minimum but we are considering the options, the pros and cons. At this point, it is speculation and it will depend precisely how it is designed and so on. [The HMRC boss, Jon Thompson] set out a range, that is the top end of it. We have to look very carefully at the options, we need to keep friction to a minimum in our trade with the EU. It’s speculation as to what the precise number would be. I have no doubt that is Jon Thompson’s best assessment from where he is but we need to continue to look at ways to keep that number as low as possible and keep it as frictionless as possible, consistent with our ability to do trade deals with the rest of the world. In an article in this week’s Spectator Fraser Nelson, the magazine’s editor, and James Forsyth, its political editor, claim the government is planning to announce a 3% increase in NHS spending around the time of its 70th anniversary in July. They say: [Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive] is about to get what he demanded. Theresa May plans to give the NHS a present, ahead of its 70th birthday in July — a settlement of 3% extra a year, which would mean that by the next election NHS spending would be £350 million a week more than it is today. This means, much to [Philip] Hammond’s rage, that the famous Brexit bus pledge is to be honoured — though not of course with money saved by leaving the EU. Stevens, ever wily, now wants the figure to be closer to 4%, and for the next decade. Hammond, a political realist, has accepted the case for giving significantly more money to the NHS. But the Treasury prefers an increase of around 3% and for five years, not ten. Nor has Hammond agreed that this sum ought to be dressed up as an NHS birthday present. According to the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg, this increase has not yet been agreed, and there is talk of the increase in NHS spending being as low as 2% a year. But even if the Spectator is right, and 3% is on the cards, May has been told this morning that this would not be enough. In fact, Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP and GP who chairs the Commons health committee, suggested on the Today programme that any increase less than 4% could be “disastrous”. She said: The difficulty would be if [the government] make a funding announcement that is way below expectations, I think that would be disastrous. The figure we are hearing touted today, of 3%, that simply wouldn’t be high enough. If we look at the long-term average since the start of the NHS, that’s been around 3.7%. And what we are hearing very clearly from today’s report is that we need a longterm average of 4%, and if possible more in the short term, to make up for the eight long years where we’ve had the longest squeeze in the NHS’s history. By “today’s report”, she was referring to the report (pdf) from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Health Foundation saying the NHS needs a funding increase of around 4% just to secure “modest improvements”. We’ve splashed on the report. And here’s our story. On the Today programme Wollaston said that a 3.3% increase in NHS funding (what the Specatator says is being planned) would just be enough to “stay where we are”. She went on: If we want to improve services, we’re looking at 5% in the immediate few years, and 4% as a longterm average. And I think the government should look very seriously at these figures. She also said she thought the public would be willing to pay more in tax to fund an increase in NHS spending. Wollaston’s demand for a 5% increase in spending in the short term echoes what the IFS/Health Foundation report says. Here is an extract from the news release summarising its findings. (Their bold type, not mine.) To secure some modest improvements in NHS services, funding increases of nearer 4% a year would be required over the medium term, with 5% annual increases in the short run. This would allow some immediate catch-up, enable waiting time targets to be met, and tackle some of the underfunding in mental health services. This would take spending in 2033–34 to 9.9% of national income, an increase of 2.6% of national income relative to 2018–19. At the same time, pressures on social care spending are increasing and, if we continue with something like the current funding arrangements, adult social care spending is likely to have to rise by 3.9% a year over the next 15 years taking an extra 0.4% of national income, relative to today. Put these figures together and health and social care spending is likely to have to rise by 2–3% of national income over the next 15 years. I expect there will be more on this as the day goes on. But there is a lot else around, including Brexit developments. Here is the agenda for the day. After 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, will make her weekly business statement. She is expected to announce when MPs will debate the Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech at Queen’s University, Belfast. As Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot report, he will call on Theresa May to reconvene the British-Irish intergovernmental conference, set up under the Good Friday Agreement, to help restore the power-sharing government to Northern Ireland. 1pm: The Commons Brexit committee publishes a report on the Brexit negotiations. 4.15pm: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives a speech at the European Business Summit in Brussels. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today’ top 10 must reads.

But it's still too bold for some","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I went to Bondi’s famous Icebergs to have a cheeky beero on the one day in January it was under 30 degrees (28 I think). I was being introduced to a much hyped new friend, and knowing full well I had to impress, I hazarded my electric blue Adidas SST (superstar tracksuit for all you rookies). Raging. Success. Not just with Scasey, who turned out to be a lord, not just with the bar staff, but with a group of rich folks out for their daughter’s 21st. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday We blew the froth off a couple outside and the temp was starting to drop; there was that sweet salty breeze coming off the ocean. Keeping an eye on the tables inside – and after clocking a rare sighting of NRL Roosters’ Jake Friend in his natural environment of the ‘Berg – we noticed the back end of this 21st wrapping up in the packed interior. It was decided it was I who had to go ask the New Money if we could claim their sought-after table when they bounced. I moseyed on over to the scene as they rose to their feet collecting the last of their effects and asked, “Mind if we grab this table when you guys scootch”? “OOOOOOOOOHHHHHH WE’VE BEEN WATCHING YOU ALL AFTERNOON,” said the obvious drunk mum of the party. She then proceeded to zip my jacket down and, as soon as it was borderline inappropriate, she would swing the momentum of the zip to up and continued in this motion for five or six swings. It was pretty funny. “Can I get a photo with you?” Pfft. Sure thing. “Get your phone out luv, it’s the tracksuit guy!” So while the rest of the crew pulled up their fresh new seats, for me, the next frenzied 15 or so minutes were absorbed by posing for photos with the drunk mum, the begrudging dad, the mystery brother (I’m not sure where this guy fell into the picture), the birthday girl, the mum (again), all of them, then all of the them minus the brother (fuelling speculation he wasn’t the brother). It was all nice enough and oddly flattering. End of the day, we got the table. The first time I was interested in wearing a tracksuit was when I was living up the coast with a mate and he had just picked me up for a surf. On the drive we were talking about the 1974 World Cup and how the West Germans got the job done over the Dutch. I was talking about George Best being the finest footballer to grace a football field, and equally the biggest dude off it, and he angled his argument towards Beckenbauer, simply because of the Adidas tracksuit, “The Beckenbauer”. Following the conversation, he joked we should get tracksuits and wear them to get coffee when we’re living in Sydney. Now we wear tracksuits when we get coffee while living in Sydney. The trick to wearing the tracksuit was the purchase. You couldn’t just walk into a shop and be like, “I’m getting one of these for the craic!” No, sireee. A moment had to be created or presented to me, out of dire circumstance, of course. It happened last October. I was feeling pretty bummed about myself on my last international trip, which doesn’t happen often, so I took myself to a sports shop. Initially looking for the new Celtic kit I stumbled upon something that could sooth my ails in a way the iconic hoops couldn’t. I found my electric blue SST tracksuit. It was immediately cool and equally comical. Something you could wear to be funny or ironic but also hold the “far out” factor. My first and only taste of retail therapy. And it tasted good. Last month Esquire published an article by Jonathan Evans called “It’s Time for You to Wear a Tracksuit. Specifically, This Tracksuit.” Evans touches on the versatility of tracksuit, such as being able to use the jacket with jeans, which is a give-away, and using the trackpants with a shirt. I would probably ning the denim jacket recommendation in that instance. The fact it’s a classic is what I like most about it and in the article, Evans concludes: “it just looks cool”. When you tear it down to its bare bones, he’s right. It’s cool as shit. I mean, it holds well enough to make Ben Stiller’s grief-stricken, father-hating, former child genius in the Royal Tenenbaums look as cool as hell while his life is falling apart. And hell, it makes Ben Stiller look cool, which is no mean feat in itself. But it’s still too bold in some necks of the woods. The old codger at the Ulmarra pub, in regional New South Wales, certainly took this view. Returning home recently for a family event, I touched base at Dad’s to find the house dry for the first time in my 28 years. Seeking to rectify this inconvenience, I popped down the road for a carto and packet of Port Royals. Jumping out of the car, I zipped past a well-weathered regular in the front bar resting what remained of his right leg on his prosthetic left leg. I had barely stepped on to the pool table green carpet when I made eye contact with another codger still perched up at the bar. He was in the process of drawing his schooner for what could have been his first thirst-busting jar of the arvo or his sloppy 30th, it was hard to tell. But just as he brought the amber contents of his glass to his mouth, he caught sight of me and paused. Time seemed to slow down as he gravely looked me dead in the eye. Then down. Then up. Then, in an unhurried gesture of utter disdain, placed his schooey back on the coaster. Undrunk. Unimpressed. Message received, I purchased my carton of beer, turned and walked past the other bloke, and it all made sense. Either you get it. Or you most definitely do not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/14/county-cricket-surrey-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-hants-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T16:29:23Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Somerset draw with Hants, Surrey thrash Yorkshire – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/14/county-cricket-surrey-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-hants-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/14/county-cricket-surrey-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-hants-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Somerset draw with Hants, Surrey thrash Yorkshire – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Close of play round-up Division 1 Surrey v Yorkshire: Surrey 414 beat Yorkshire 229, 168 (S Curran 4-47, Virdi 3-52) by an innings and 17 runs. Somerset v Hampshire: Somerset 506, Hampshire 231, 432 for 4 dec (Vince 201 not out ). Match drawn. Division 2 Middlesex b Gloucestershire: Middlesex 455-8 dec, Gloucestershire 210 and 326 for 4 dec (Bracey 125 not out; Harris 3-60) Match drawn. Derbyshire v Durham: Derbyshire 427 and 279 for 9 dec (Wood 6-46), Durham 520. Match drawn. A sweet end to these spring rounds of Championship games. Today Surrey’s youth policy paid off, and 21 year old James Bracey saved the game for Gloucestershire. Mark Wood’s flight from the IPL proved fruitful and James Vince pulled it out of the bag spectacularly when all seemed lost. Thanks for your company this past month and a bit - see you again when the days have grown even longer. May Ed Smith’s squad provoke enjoyable and fruitful discussions BTL. That’s it folks, everyone has shaken hands. Scores to follow. And I know there are mixed feeling about All Stars cricket below the line but this (below) must be good news. Anecdotally, I feel sure I’ve seen a few more kids in the park with cricket bats than I have done in previous years. And the gear is branded All Stars stuff. https://twitter.com/allstarscricket/status/995980777195298817 And Kevin O’Brien is three-quarters of the way there - 75 not out off 141 balls. Their first (male) fifty too. Ireland 254 for 6. “Hands have been shaken at Taunton: Vince 201 not out. Somerset shrewdly avoid the glare of being Championship leaders for a month. Good afternoon all.” Gower on Vince as the teams shake hands with Hampshire 434 for 2 declared, and Vince 201 not out, an innings to remember however kind the pitch today. Whatever the names copper-plated onto Smith’s envelope tomorrow morning, Vince can go to bed tonight with the happy knowledge he gave it all he had. Oh Lord, Vince has only gone and done it. 201 not out, the day before the Test team is announced. Enough.?! Another for Wood: this time Duane Olivier goes, caught behind again. Derbyshire 248 for 9, leading Durham by by 155. A timely five-fer fer Mark Wood - his latest victim is Daryn Smit, caught behind for 34, leaving Derbyshire 242 for 8, leading Durham by 149. Still time for a result there? Colin Graves shouting his mouth off prematurely, is it...? Gloucester are into the lead against Middlesex - ten runs into the lead, in fact: they’ve just lost Jack Taylor for 41, but in brighter news young James Bracey has reached his century. They’re 256 for 4 at Lord’s. Hampshire are now 361-4 on this chameleon of a pitch with Vince unbeaten on 167 after 7 hours and 42 minutes at the crease. Eddie Byrom has just bowled three overs of loopy leg breaks alongside Dom Bess. So handshakes are likely at 16.50 on a day of disappointment for Somerset, the greatest of which is the injury to Leach. They love him down here. “We don’t want to lose you but we think you ought to go” was the mentality before he broke his thumb. Now it will probably be about six weeks before he plays again. Someone might have stolen his Test spot by then. No matter that the pitch has been sedated by the sun Vince has played a superb innings to save the match for his side. We wait to see whether he will be around the county circuit for much longer this summer. Must solemnly report that James Vince has now reached 167, Hampshire onto 316 for 4, 87 in the lead over Somerset. Another wicket down for Derbyshire, another wicket up for Mark Wood: Hardus Viljoen goes, leaving Derbyshire 225 for 7 and building a respectable lead, of 132. Here’s a report from Graham Hardcastle to keep you ticking over, in which Joe Root speaks: When you come back to Yorkshire, you want to perform and give a bit back to the side. It’s been a little bit disappointing,” said Root, who led Yorkshire at the Oval owing to Gary Ballance’s illness. “But that’s cricket, it can be challenging. I didn’t come into these games to get ready for the Test matches. I made sure I did my preparation beforehand to try and perform well for Yorkshire. It’s just not materialised, unfortunately. That’s just how it can go.” A 50 for Kevin O’Brien! That, as you will no doubt not need reminding, is Ireland’s first Test half-century. Hats off to the larger of the O’Brien brothers. And perhaps more tangibly important, they’re now in the lead, albeit only by 11 runs but they’ve at least avoided an innings defeat after being made to follow on. 191 for 6 at the moment. Good news for Cameron Bancroft: he’s been cleared to play club cricket in Australia, meaning he’ll turn out for Willetton while serving his nine-month ball-tampering ban. More here... That was Amir’s hundredth Test wicket by the way. It took him 31 Tests. It took Wasim Akram 30! “James Vince has moved on to 130 with great serenity, Rossouw has 22 and Hampshire now lead by 35. There is no spin for Bess; Overton is trying some off-cutters and the game seems to be drifting towards a draw. This is objective analysis; I don’t really believe in jinxing. In any case in my experience games of cricket only undergo technicolour transformations after I’ve written the match report.” Derby on the slide at 184 for 6 - Critchley for 40 and Godleman for 25. Another wicket for Steel 2-30 and one for Weighell. They lead Durham by 92 Another wicket for Amir as Ireland look wobbly at 160 for 6, still 20 behind. A harsh attack to face in your first Test. Vince moves to 130 off 330 balls, which brings a strange pattern to an innings that must mean something. But what? Lessons learnt? Fortitude at the last? Too little too late? Whichever, Ed Smith isn’t a man to leave his homework to the last moment - he had picked the team before today - hadn’t he? Another 21 year old, Matt Critchley, demi-slaying the Durham attack at Derby. Five fours so far in his 34 not out. Derby 167 for 4, lead by 74. Not enough yet, but might a last-session run-chase be on the cards? Bravo to 21 year old James Bracey, 60 not out for Gloucestershire in their steadfastness today against Middlesex. Currently 174 for 3, still 71 behind but less than two sessions to bat. I think Rob Key is in mischievous mood. A wicket at Malahide - Stirling lbw for 11, a second wicket for Mohammad Abbas. Ireland 129 for 5, trailing by 51. And at Lord’s: Roderick has gone, after an unflappable 48. A second wicket for Harris. Gloucs 160 for 3, trail Middlex by 85. And Vince has moved on to 119 not out, with three fours since he reached 100. “Jack Leach has a broken left thumb, which means that he will not be available to resume his Test career against Pakistan in the forthcoming two Test series. Before the start of play at Taunton in Somerset’s match against Hampshire Leach was batting in the nets against Jason Kerr, the first team coach, and his dog ball thrower. The ball rose unexpectedly and struck his thumb; Leach immediately headed for the pavilion. The worst fears of Leach and his Somerset colleagues were later confirmed. This is a cruel blow for Leach, who impressed in his debut Test in Christchurch at the beginning of April and it comes on the eve of the announcement of England’s squad for the Lord’s Test. With Liam Dawson currently unfit there is not another left-arm spinner on the horizon. The selectors will no doubt reconsider Moeen Ali, who is currently in India, as well as two extremely raw off-spinners, Leach’s colleague at Somerset, Dom Bess, and Surrey’s Amar Virdi.” Ponder Ed Smith’s mind over lunch. Good news for 30-year olds Malan and Stoneman? Lunchtime round-up Division 1 Surrey v Yorkshire: Surrey 414 beat Yorkshire 229, 168 (S Curran 4-47, Virdi 3-52) by an innings and 17 runs. Somerset v Hampshire: Somerset 506, Hampshire 231, 260 for 4 (Vince 100 not out ). Hampshire trail Somerset by 15 runs. Division 2 Middlesex b Gloucestershire: Middlesex 455-8 dec, Gloucestershire 210 and 149 for 2 (Roderick not out 48, Bracey 42 not out) Gloucestershire trail Middlesex by 96 runs. Derbyshire v Durham: Derbyshire 427 and 114 for 4 (Wood 3-29), Durham 520. Derbyshire lead Durham by 21 runs. A collapse by Yorkshire gave Surrey victory in the first session of the day. Surrey’s young team rise to second in the table, with a game in hand over Notts. Vince is playing beautifully, patiently, and with most fortunate timing at Taunton, to stay Somerset’s hopes of a third consecutive win at home. A fascinating session on the card there after lunch. As Vic reported, Jack Leach is currently off the field with a dog-ball-thrower related thumb injury. At Lord’s, Gloucestershire have not lost a wicket this morning to frustrate Middlesex; and Mark Wood has made important inroads into Derbyshire’s batting. Lunch scores to come v shortly. Meanwhile some swotting up on Amir, whose patella tendonitis in the knee has been hampering him in Malahide. “Vince has reached his hundred, one of his best. Perhaps the most telling statistic is the number of balls faced, 277. The pitch has been at its best for batting yesterday and today but there has been no flightiness from Vince. I’m informed that this has been the slowest hundred in the Championship this season, so the slowest and one of the best - that must confuse them at ECB towers - where are the sixes to keep the women and children entranced? “Anyway Somerset then disposed of Tom Alsop fairly quickly, caught at second slip off Tim Groenewald for 12. So there is still life in this game. Still no sightings of Leach and no updates either. At lunch Hampshire are 260-4, 15 behind. Just before the break Rilee Rossouw edged his first runs and then fell to the ground; he summoned the physio so there was a six minute delay, followed by a bit of time wasting, which prompted two of the wiliest, old umpires (Lloyds and Evans) to race into position at 12.59.” And on the stroke of lunch, Derbyshire lose another, Alex Hughes, c Stuart Poynter b Cameron Steel for 17. With a lead of just 21, Derby must dine timorously. Alsop holds the position but unfortunately he’s still out, for 12, Hampshire 256 for 4, still trail Somerset by 19. Vince 100 not out. A third wicket now for Mark Wood as Slater is caught by Cameron Steel for a careful 42. 103 for 3 with a lead of ten. Careful now. And a HUNDRED for VINCE! 325 minutes, 277 balls, and still 13 fours. And a second wicket for Mark Wood at Derby, Madsen for 32. Derby 94 for 2, leading by one run. Maybe it was worth racing back from the IPL after all. https://twitter.com/DurhamCricket/status/995991780649832448 We know cricketers are not immune to the black dog. This terrific little video from Accrington Stanley striker Billy Kee is a reminder of what a struggle life can be if you are suffering from depression, anxiety or other mental-health complaints. Go well this mental health awareness week, and every week. Ooops, after a period of steadiness, Ireland lose 2 for 1. N O’Brien b Amir 18 and Porterfield c Sarfraz b Amir 32; 96 for 4 still trailing by 84. Seems Ireland could be in more trouble if Pakistan took all their chances... “No sighting of Ed Smith here...it’s a long way from home and he may have some notes to make. Finally Somerset have a wicket. Amla caught behind off Gregory for 107, flapping at a wide long-hop, or surprised by a quicker off-side bouncer, depending upon your disposition. If Smith was here he would be presumably be dismayed by Leach’s absence, lukewarm about Craig Overton’s bowling (tho pleased to see that his brother is fit enough to be the sub fieldsman), and mightily impressed by Vince who has played one of his most disciplined innings (unless he has already decided to drop him).” And Amla falls, c Davies b Gregory, after 245 minutes of concentration for 107. Hampshire 233 for 3, still trailing by 42. Vince, so near, on 89. The drawbridge has fallen. A minute’s watching for anyone pondering pencilling Sam Curran into their Test team, due to be announced tomorrow. Here are his ten wickets in the game against Yorkshire. Meanwhile, Gloucestershire are pottering along at Lord’s, adding 49 in the first hour. Roderick 38, Bracey 19. They still trail Middlesex by 130. … losing their last five wickets for just 26 this morning, including wickets seven, eight and nine without addition on 164. Sam Curran finishes with 10 wickets in the match. Full points for Surrey. Surrey getting all excited, for those of you who like that sort of thing. Has anyone spotted Ed Smith today? Vic? And at the Ageas Bowl James Vince is still on 72. You’ve got to admire his tenacity here. And it is all over at The Oval - Surrey win by an innings and 17. Leaning the last man out, lbw Clarke 28. And here’s a huge well done to Surrey and their exciting, and brave, youngsters. Derbyshire now in on the act: 33/1, still 55 behind. Reece b Wood for 12. Yorkshire are losing wickets more quickly than I can type -164 for 9 now. Curran has ten wickets in the match, 4 for 47 in the innings and something special this morning. More woe for Yorkshire comes in the form of Sam Curran’s eighth wicket of the match. He has removed Tim Bresnan, caught behind for one. They are still 21 runs behind and seven down. Jack Leaning has 28 and Steve Patterson is yet to get off the mark. If and when Surrey wrap this up, it would be their second win from three at home so far this season - a huge boost given struggling for results here has been their recent downfall. Hashim Amla has just reached his century with an effortless cover drive - from 177 balls - and Hampshire are 207-2. Jack Leach is sitting glumly on the dressing room balcony. They say he is “being assessed” and we await updates. It does not look good for him with the Test squad being announced tomorrow. The new ball is due in an over. And a hundred for Hashim Amla, 206 mins, 179 balls. Patience personified. Hampshire must be thanking their lucky stars, and their healthy bank balance, every time he walks out to bat. And here is an fascinating little Twitter snippet: Yorkshire tipping into the abyss. 164 for 7, with Bresnan gone for 1. Another catch for Foakes and another wicket for Sam Curran. Jonny Bairstow has gone. Huge blow for Yorkshire. He’s been undone by extra bounce and feathers behind off Rikki Clarke for 29. You feel avoiding defeat is a task beyond Yorkshire now unless Tim Bresnan can return to his glories of 2016 with the bat. He has joined Jack Leaning, who has 26, at the crease. Yorkshire 160/6 and still 25 behind. And here’s a little story: Bairstow out for 29 c Foakes ( !) b Clarke. Yorkies in much bother now 163 for 6, still trailing by 22. And as I check back, I see that Ireland have lost 2, Joyce run-out (no!!) for 43 and Balbirnie lbw for a duck. Ireland 69 for 2. Fifteen minutes gone and not a wicket fallen - has summer truly arrived? Amla moves on to 92 not out, who not so long ago was playing through this ... https://twitter.com/amlahash/status/991372252498325504 Oh dear, this does not bode well. More from Vic: “Jack Leach is not on the field. Jamie Overton is his substitute.” Good morning, Tanya. Good morning everyone and greetings from a sunkissed Taunton, where the home side is concerned not only by the scoreboard, which shows that Vince and Amla were in fine form yesterday on the way to wiping out a deficit of 275 - it is now 97. Before the start Jack Leach, potential matchwinner here today, potential Test player next week, was in the nets, practising his batting. Jason Kerr, the first team coach was hurling balls with the dog ball thrower. Leach was struck on the left hand, clearly in considerable pain and promptly departed to the pavilion. The home supporters are anxiously waiting to see whether he takes the field in a few minutes. Will let you know. Hello! Welcome to the final day of this round of Championship games - the last for a while. Of course the sun is out, the elderflower nearly in bloom and the season off to a flyer. Four games remain in play today: Surrey v Yorkshire: Surrey 414; Yorkshire 229 and 142 for 5 (Bairstow 25, Leaning 13; Virdi 3-52) trail Surrey by 43 runs. All eyes are on Jonny Bairstow after reports that Ed Smith has his eye on handing the gloves to Ben Foakes and moving YJB up the order, which may have contributed to Bairstow’s furious hitting in the first innings. But he’ll do well to extricate Yorkshire from this mess. Yesterday there were three wickets for off-spinner Amar Virdi including Joe Root for 23, who had been out earlier the same day for 14 – both times to 19 year olds. Sam Curran was awarded his county cap after taking 6-54 in Yorkshire’s first innings, becoming the fourth youngest Surrey player to be capped, and the fourth youngest to 100 wickets after Waqar Younis, Martin Bicknell and Jack Crawford Somerset v Hampshire: Somerset 506; Hampshire 231 and 178 for 2 (Vince 63, Amla 86) trail Somerset by 97 runs This could be a thriller, watching Vince - in his last innings before the Test team is chosen - and Amla try to bat out the day. Middlesex v Gloucestershire: Middlesex 455-8 dec; Gloucestershire 210 and 66 for 2 (Roderick 6, Bracey 5)trail Middlesex by 179 runs. Gloucestershire will do very well to escape here and Derbyshire v Durham: Derbyshire 427 and 1-0 (Slater 0, Reece 1); Durham 520. Derbyshire trail Durham by 92 runs which has draw written all over it. Five games finished yesterday: A thriller at New Road where Essex came from behind to win by 32 runs, with Worcester now cut adrift at the bottom of the table. Lancashire beat Nottinghamshire by an innings and 67 runs to register their first win of the season, with nine wickets for Graham Onions and six for Jimmy Anderson. In Division two, Warwickshire beat Northants by six wickets, thanks to a century from Will Rhodes, and already look a pretty safe bet to bounce back to Division one at the end of the season. Northants can already taste the grain of the wooden spoon . And in two relatively low scoring games, Leicestershire beat Glamorgan by three, yes three, runs for their third Championship win since 2012, and Kent beat Sussex by 58 and kicked them out of second place. Matt Henry took ten wickets in the match. In other news: Ireland are following on in their first Test against Pakistan at Malahide where the weather is an unhelpful grey today and where Mick Jagger was spotted yesterday. Jos Buttler hit an unbeaten 94 for Rajasthan Royals – his fifth consecutive IPL fifty since being promoted to open, which equals Virender Sehwag record. And Yorkshire are considering broadcasting live from Scarborough for the match against Surrey next month. Tanya will be here shortly, in the meantime here are the live scores from day three: Division One Hampshire (231 &amp; 178-2) trail Somerset (506) by 97 runs with eight wickets remaining. Yorkshire (229 &amp; 142-5) trail Surrey (414) by 43 runs with five wickets remaining Division Two Derbyshire (427 &amp; 1-0) trail Durham (520) by 92 runs with 10 wickets remaining Gloucestershire (210 &amp; 66-2) trail Middlesex (455-8d) by 179 runs with eight wickets remaining Test match Ireland (130 &amp; 64-0) trail Pakistan (310-9) by 116 runs with 10 wickets remaining"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/14/cannes-film-festival-unveils-equality-charter-in-push-for-gender-parity","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T14:27:13Z","webTitle":"Cannes film festival unveils equality charter in push for gender parity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/cannes-film-festival-unveils-equality-charter-in-push-for-gender-parity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/14/cannes-film-festival-unveils-equality-charter-in-push-for-gender-parity","fields":{"headline":"Cannes film festival unveils equality charter in push for gender parity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A new charter aimed at improving gender parity at the Cannes film festival, and which is expected to be adopted by other leading film festivals, has been unveiled. Under the charter, the Cannes film festival will record the gender of the cast and crew of all films submitted, make public the names of selection committee members and work towards gender parity on the Cannes board. However, the festival stopped short of promising to introduce gender parity in terms of directors of films selected, confirming festival director Thierry Frémaux’s long-held position that the selections should be based on “artistic merit” alone. The clause was signed by Frémaux, Cannes’ Director’s Fortnight artistic director Édouard Waintrop and Critics’ Week artistic director Charles Tesson at an event held jointly with the French culture ministry and the country’s 5050x2020 equality movement. In attendance was this year’s festival jury, which includes president Cate Blanchett, as well as Kristen Stewart and Ava DuVernay. Speaking at the event, Frémaux said that Cannes needed to question its own “practices, traditions, habits, and history. Cannes has stats that speak for themselves – and in a negative way,” he admitted. Frémaux said that by being transparent Cannes would respond to issues of diversity and parity while still using “its own editorial and strategic judgment” in selecting films. “The festival can commit to changing things by signing this charter … We hope that this will reinforce this realisation that the world is no longer the same,” Frémaux added. Cannes has sought to defuse criticism over a perceived lack of equality in its lineup at this year’s festival. Only three of the 21 films in the running for this year’s Palme d’Or were directed by women, while Jane Campion, for her 1993 film The Piano, remains the only woman to have won the Palme. On Saturday, with the support of the festival, 82 women in film, including Blanchett, DuVernay and Jane Fonda, silently walked the Cannes red carpet to represent the 82 female film-makers whose works have appeared in the festival’s official competition since the festival’s founding. Some 1,645 male directors have seen their films selected in competition in that time. The announcement of the charter was preceded by a discussion featuring gender equality movements including Time’s Up, UK organisation Women in Film &amp; TV and the Greek group Greek Women’s Wave. Among the topics covered were the lack of compelling roles for women in film, the gender imbalance among film critics and the need for better guidelines around the filming of sex scenes. Speaking to the Guardian at the conclusion of the event, Women in Film &amp; TV chief executive Kate Kinninmont said that the pledge was a “fantastic starting point”, but added that the wider film industry needed to do more to increase the number of women working within it. “If there were equal numbers of men’s and women’s films to choose from it would make the job of festivals a lot easier,” she said. “By the time we come to the festivals that’s just an endpoint. There a lots and lots of women directors who haven’t had a chance yet. In the next couple of years we will see them and then I think the festival will have no trouble doing 50/50 selections.” It is believed that the transparency charter will be adopted by other international film festivals such as Sundance, Venice and Berlin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/14/bafta-tv-awards-2018-peaky-blinders","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T12:01:23Z","webTitle":"'Peaky Blinders deserved its crown' – the verdict on the 2018 Bafta TV awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/14/bafta-tv-awards-2018-peaky-blinders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/14/bafta-tv-awards-2018-peaky-blinders","fields":{"headline":"'Peaky Blinders deserved its crown' – the verdict on the 2018 Bafta TV awards","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The one rule of awards events is that you can never please everyone. For every gong that has people nodding in ecstatic approval, there will be one that has everyone spluttering about how so and so was robbed or another show should have won. This year’s Baftas seem more likely than most to provoke debate. Where last year’s event was accused of taking an interesting shortlist and then rewarding the safest show on it, this year saw some genuine shocks. Chief among those was the victory for Peaky Blinders. Steven Knight’s gaudy gangster drama saw off The Crown, Line of Duty and End of the F***ing World to claim best drama in a moment that appeared to surprise everyone at the event including Knight himself. Was it deserved? On balance, I’d argue yes. End of the F***ing World was arguably the most inventive show on the list (and in a more risk-taking world would have won). The meticulously written Line of Duty always thrills and the elegant, expensive The Crown remains sleekly seductive. But Peaky Blinders has always had ambition and swagger to spare and never more so than in this fourth series, which saw Adrien Brody chewing the scenery into tiny pieces as an American gangster set on bringing retribution to 1920s Birmingham. It’s not a show that will ever win prizes for subtlety, but it was arguably the most purely entertaining drama on the shortlist, and sometimes that’s what you need. That said Peaky Blinders’ victory will have come as a blow to Netflix, which had high hopes of landing its first Bafta with its drama of royal intrigue. While that did come when Vanessa Kirby won best supporting actress for her performance as the unlucky-in-love Princess Margaret, there remains the sense that Bafta, like the Emmys in America, may be keener to reward actors in Netflix shows than the series themselves. There was the sense, too, that, regardless of shocks on the night, the shortlists had already weighted things in favour of the BBC in particular. Two categories: single documentary (won by Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad) and specialist factual (in which Basquiat: Rage to Riches surprisingly beat the juggernaut that is Blue Planet II) had shortlists composed entirely of BBC programmes, with Channel 4’s touching and informative Epidemic a particularly notable omission. It was a bad year for diversity, too, with few BAME actors nominated and no awards won, a step backward from last year where Adeel Akhtar and Wunmi Mosaku were both victors. This was partially a shortlist issue – both the excellent Asim Chaudhry and the moving Anupam Kher were competing in particularly strong categories in which it’s hard to make a case against the eventual winner – but also, more importantly one of commissioning and casting with too many shows only casting BAME actors in major roles in true life stories. The most welcome victory of the night saw Sean Bean winning for Broken (a series that really should have had a best drama nomination). Bean’s performance as a priest grappling with both his faith and his role in a changing community was quietly devastating, a piece of acting that needed no pyrotechnics to make you feel the force of his pain. A similar piece of understated power saw Molly Windsor take home the leading actress award for Three Girls. This could be called a shock but in fact Bafta has form in rewarding relatively unknown actors in this slot – Georgina Campbell beat of a host of bigger names for Murdered by My Boyfriend in 2015 – and Windsor’s confident handling of difficult material was worthy of recognition. That said Claire Foy was desperately unlucky to be twice looked over for her subtle take on Queen Elizabeth in The Crown. Elsewhere Brian F O’Byrne, heartbreaking in Little Boy Blue, beat Adrian Dunbar (consistently the best thing in Line of Duty) to win best supporting actor and Toby Jones was rightly rewarded for his lovely turn as the bemused Lance in Detectorists. The night’s other big comedy awards went (deservedly) to the acutely observed This Country, which won both best scripted comedy and best female performance in a comedy for Daisy May Cooper. Overall it was a strong night for BBC Three, which also saw Murdered for Being Different pull off a surprise victory over the inventive King Charles III. Meanwhile the night’s least surprising result saw the much-garlanded The Handmaid’s Tale win best international series (yes, I am still sulking about Twin Peaks: The Return failing to win a nomination) while the bleak Three Girls beat the even bleaker The State to win best mini-series. If the BBC was dominant in the drama and comedy categories, Bafta did their best to spread the love in the factual awards. Love Island correctly steamrollered the competition to win best reality, Sky took news coverage thanks to their reporting on events in Myanmar, Britain’s Got Talent won a somewhat over-familiar entertainment category and ITV won the sport category for their hyperactive but enjoyable coverage of The Grand National. A decent enough year then and one with some pleasing surprises, although if there is one hope for next year it’s that the Bafta judges cast their net more widely both in terms of programmes and actors nominated. There is some stellar drama and comedy on the BBC, but equally there is outstanding and inventive work being made elsewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/14/ligeti-in-wonderland-review-pierre-laurent-aimard","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T13:49:03Z","webTitle":"Ligeti in Wonderland review – full of wonderful things","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/14/ligeti-in-wonderland-review-pierre-laurent-aimard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/14/ligeti-in-wonderland-review-pierre-laurent-aimard","fields":{"headline":"Ligeti in Wonderland review – full of wonderful things","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Few composers in history have undergone such a radical change of stylistic direction mid-career as György Ligeti. The music he composed in the 1960s and 70s is remarkable for its rejection of prevailing musical dogma and its delight in the sheer beauty and sensuality of sound. What then emerged from the early 80s until his death in 2006 is just as remarkable in an utterly different way, absorbing elements from a huge range of traditions, from Europe, Africa and the new world, to create music that remains unclassifiable. Ligeti in Wonderland, the Southbank Centre’s weekend-long festival curated by artist-in-residence Pierre-Laurent Aimard, focused on these late, often marvellously strange works. Almost all the major scores from this final phase of Ligeti’s career were included, for which Aimard was joined by violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja, horn-player Marie Luise Neunecker and, in the closing concert, the Aurora Orchestra conducted by Nicholas Collon. With performances as fine as anyone could have hoped for, it was full of wonderful things – confirmation, if any was still needed, of Ligeti’s place among the greats of 20th-century music. The Aurora programme contained the three large-scale orchestral works composed during that last period, all of them concertos – for piano, violin, and horn. Collon prefaced them with a reminder of the enchantment of Ligeti’s earlier soundworld in a glittering performance of his 1970 work Chamber Concerto. The soloists in the concertos were all in their different ways exceptional. Aimard, who had performed 18 of Ligeti’s solo-piano Études the previous evening, has become the definitive interpreter of this technically fearsome keyboard writing. He coolly negotiated the torrential polyrhythmic writing of the Piano Concerto as it snares the orchestra in its tangled webs. The Hamburg Concerto, in which the solo horn is partnered by a quartet of natural horns, creating all manner of microtonal tuning effects, is dedicated to Neunecker; its final movement was the last thing Ligeti wrote. And then there was Kopatchinskaja in the violin work, an astonishing force of nature, powering her way through its hair-raising difficulties as the orchestra conjured a half-remembered world that seems gradually to be slipping beyond recall, and throwing in a cadenza of her own for good measure, one totally consistent with Ligeti’s surreal world. In the opening concert, Kopatchinskaja had joined Neunecker and Aimard for an equally searing performance of the work that had introduced the new Ligeti – the 1982 Horn Trio. It is a homage to Brahms that delights in the microtonal ambiguities of the natural horn while incorporating rhythmic ideas from the Balkans, Africa and the Caribbean (as well as the motto from Beethoven’s Les Adieux sonata), and packs an enormous and tragic emotional punch for good measure. There was also the transitional two-piano Monument-Selbstportrait-Bewegung of 1976 – played by Aimard and Tamara Stefanovich – in which, like a conjuror explaining some of his tricks, Ligeti reveals how his style connects with the early minimalism of Steve Reich and Terry Riley, and even with the finale of Chopin’s B flat minor sonata. That programme had opened with Poème Symphonique, the 1962 piece for 100 ticking metronomes that all run down at different rates, creating unpredictable patterns. It was a reminder that, alongside the immense sophistication of Ligeti’s music, there was always his childlike delight in the absurd, and a wicked sense of humour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/14/labour-ken-livingstone-jackie-walker-antisemitism-row","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T07:59:09Z","webTitle":"Labour must expel Livingstone and Walker over antisemitism, says Jewish leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/14/labour-ken-livingstone-jackie-walker-antisemitism-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/14/labour-ken-livingstone-jackie-walker-antisemitism-row","fields":{"headline":"Labour must expel Livingstone and Walker over antisemitism, says Jewish leader","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The new president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews has demanded the expulsion of Ken Livingstone and Jackie Walker from the Labour party by the end of July. In her first broadcast interview since being elected to the role on Sunday, Marie van der Zyl pledged that under her leadership the Board of Deputies would continue to press Jeremy Corbyn to take more action against antisemitism in the party. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Van der Zyl said she expected Labour to throw out Livingstone, the former London mayor who is suspended from the party after comments he made about Adolf Hitler’s support for Zionism; and Walker, a former vice-chair of Momentum who is suspended over critical comments she made about Holocaust memorial day. Van der Zyl said: “Enough is enough and we now need to see actions and not words … which include a swift action in relation to the outstanding disciplinary cases … There’s Ken Livingstone and there’s also the case of Jackie Walker. We are expecting and hoping that that will be resolved by the end of July.” She said the Board of Deputies would continue to protest and demand inquiries and debates in parliament if no further action was taken. Her remarks increase the pressure on Labour to expel the pair. On Sunday, Shami Chakrabarti hinted she may quit the Labour frontbench if Livingstone was not expelled at his next disciplinary hearing. Her frontbench colleagues Emily Thornberry and Nia Griffith have made similar calls. But Corbyn has said the party’s disciplinary process must be allowed to take its course without interference. In speeches before her election, Van der Zyl was highly critical of Corbyn. She was quoted as saying that he was “infested by his bigotry” and that the Labour party did not belong to him. However, in her interview she was more conciliatory. “We want to see Jeremy Corbyn lead the Labour party and carry out his pledge to root out antisemitism and all forms of racism within the party,” she said. “We are not saying don’t vote Labour, but as we’ll be seeing from the results, especially in Barnet [in local elections earlier this month], the voters have spoken. “What the Board of Deputies wants is to see Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party be accountable and to root out antisemitism and all forms of racism – that’s what we want.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/14/shoplifters-review-family-of-thieves-steals-moral-high-ground-and-hearts","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T11:21:03Z","webTitle":"Shoplifters review – family of thieves steal moral high ground – and hearts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/shoplifters-review-family-of-thieves-steals-moral-high-ground-and-hearts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/14/shoplifters-review-family-of-thieves-steals-moral-high-ground-and-hearts","fields":{"headline":"Shoplifters review – family of thieves steal moral high ground – and hearts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hirokazu Kore-eda is now an established Cannes heavyweight and he shows why with this complex and nuanced family drama in the classical Japanese style that he has personally extended and modified over 20 years, and on which he has put his own distinctive signature. It is a contemporary view of middle-class, parochial Japan: shrewd, realistic, as clear and untroubled as a glass of cold water. But there is also a strong streak of sentiment, if not sentimentality. (In an interview, he told me that the director he believes he resembles is not Ozu, but the more sentimental and populist Naruse.) Lily Franky (from Kore-eda’s earlier film Like Father Like Son) plays Osamu, a man with a shifty, wheedling grin. He is effectively the Fagin-like head of an extended family of dodgy types who are all up to no good in their way. This household appears to be a middle-aged husband and wife, a teenage daughter, her kid brother and a grandma – all living together in a cramped apartment rented from an equally dodgy landlord who has to keep changing the names on his properties’ title deeds as part of his tax dodge of “flipping” notional ownership. Theoretically a casual labourer on construction sites, Osamu actually makes his money selling the things he steals on daily shoplifting expeditions with his boy, Shota (Kairi Jyo). His wife Noboyu (Sakura Andô) works in a laundry and she too steals things left in clothes’ pockets all the time; she is a very sensuous woman who is still keen on her conjugal rights. The teenage daughter is Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) who brings in her share to the family finances by taking part in a soft-porn peep show in town. Hatsue (played by veteran Japanese character actress Kirin Kiki) is the grandma, an addict of the pachinko slot machines. One day, coming home on a freezing night after a hard day stealing from supermarkets, Osamu and Shota come across a little girl of perhaps six or seven shivering in the cold. Impulsively, Osamu decides to take the poor homeless little waif in for a few days. She appears to have marks on her body consistent with abuse and she wets the bed – another classic sign. Osamu’s wicked old heart is evidently melted, and he says that they will keep this little girl, Juri (Miyu Sasaki), and train her up in the ways of shoplifting, which includes making odd little hand gestures to your thief-partner to indicate when and what you intend to steal. And this despite the TV news broadcasts about this little girl going missing. But it is not just a question of Osamu finding a heartwarming redemption in doing good, nor is it a simple irony in Osamu’s dodgy crook-family fulfilling the function of the social services and the caring state – the state that would disapprove of and indeed prosecute Osamu if they knew what he was up to. The point is that Osamu has, in his cheerfully amoral way, stolen Juri in just the same way as he steals everything else. And it isn’t the first time he’s done it. His ambiguously benevolent abduction of little Juri is part of a larger pattern of concealment that the whole family unit are involved in. Nothing is what it seems. And finally Shota, badly hurt by Juri supplanting him in his dad’s affections, deliberately makes a mess of a shoplifting spree, so that the authorities will catch him and the whole rickety and self-deceiving house of cards will come tumbling down. It is a movie made up of delicate brushstrokes: details, moments, looks and smiles. It is a beguiling touch when Osamu and Noboyu have sex for the first time in a long while and they languorously recline around afterwards in their tiny flat, stark naked, looking between 10 and 20 years younger: you can imagine them as a young couple. It is another heart-rending moment when the proprietor of a convenience store impassively offers to make Shota a present of the sweets he was going to steal – as long as he doesn’t corrupt little Juri by teaching her these thieving scams that he has seen through long ago. And there is a subsidiary poignancy in this man thinking that young Shota, though only a boy, is now a fully corrupt individual who just has to be written off. Shoplifters is the story of a group of frightened, damaged people who have made common cause with each other, banded together under the flag of family, under the radar of the law, making the best of things from day to day, until they realise they have been making the worst of things.

Washington’s top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, said on Sunday private companies may be allowed to invest in North Korea’s power grid and agricultural sectors if the country abandons its nuclear weapons program. But he specified the US government would not be pouring money into the North. While questions remain over whether US firms would want to pour money into North Korea given the many uncertainties, South Korean companies are far more eager to begin investment should sanctions be relaxed. Hyundai Group, a South Korean conglomerate, has set up a working group to explore how it can invest in the North while there have been numerous requests to the South Korean government about restarting the Kaesong industrial complex, according to local media reports. Kaesong was opened in 2004 and over 50,000 North Korea workers filled the site making goods for South Korean firms. The site lies just across the border in North Korea but was closed in 2016 after a nuclear test and rocket launch. Hyundai is also exploring restarting a tourist site at Mount Kumgang, which has been closed to foreigners since 2008 after a South Korean visitor was shot and killed by a North Korean soldier. “We are currently very discreet as nothing is certain, such as whether local or foreign businesses can open businesses there,” an unnamed Hyundai official told the Yonhap news agency. Efforts are being lead by the group’s chairwoman Hyun Jeong-Eun. Previous estimates by the South Korean government have stated it could cost as much as $500bn (£370bn) to rebuild the North’s moribund economy. South Korea and China would need to help Pyongyang establish policy and commercial banks, the South’s financial regulator said in a report on Monday. Outside help would be required to shore up confidence and minimise risk, it said. During last month’s historic Inter-Korean summit, South Korean president Moon Jae-in reportedly handed Kim a USB flash drive containing economic development plans. It included charts and videos detailing rail infrastructure and power plants that could be built if Pyongyang denuclearises. When Moon mentioned to Kim he hoped to travel to a famous mountain in North Korea, Kim made a rare admission about the dismal state of the country’s transport network. He said he would be embarrassed for Moon to make the journey, adding “our transportation, honestly, would be uncomfortable”. In the next breath he praised South Korea’s high speed rail network."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/14/indonesia-car-bomb-surabaya-police-station-attacked","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T16:26:00Z","webTitle":"Surabaya blast: family of five carried out bomb attack on Indonesia police station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/14/indonesia-car-bomb-surabaya-police-station-attacked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/14/indonesia-car-bomb-surabaya-police-station-attacked","fields":{"headline":"Surabaya blast: family of five carried out bomb attack on Indonesia police station","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A family of five including an eight-year-old child have carried out a bomb attack on a police headquarters in Indonesia’s second largest city, a day after another family killed 13 people in coordinated suicide bombings. Police said the five approached the gates of the headquarters in Surabaya on two motorcycles and detonated the explosives at a security checkpoint at 8.50am on Monday. Four police officers and six civilians were injured, along with the eight-year-old child. The four adult perpetrators died in the blast. Police said the child was receiving treatment in hospital. “We hope the child will recover. We believe she was thrown 3 metres (10ft) or so up into the air by the impact of the explosion and then fell to the ground,” said Frans Barung Mangera, a spokesman for East Java police. “Clearly it’s a suicide bombing,” he added. “We can’t open up all details yet because we are still identifying victims at the scene and the crime scene is being handled.” Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, said: “This is the act of cowards, undignified and barbaric.” He vowed to make sure parliament passed new anti-terrorism laws by next month to combat networks of Islamist militants. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the Islamist militant group’s Amaq news agency said, without providing evidence. On Sunday morning a family of six – a couple and their four children aged between nine and 18 – conducted consecutive suicide bomb attacks on three churches in Surabaya. Hours later an explosion at an apartment building in Sidoarjo, south of Surabaya, killed three people. Residents reported hearing multiple blasts from the fifth floor of the building at about 9pm on Sunday. In all, 31 people have died in attacks and explosions since Sunday, including 13 suspected attackers or would-be attackers and 14 civilians, police said. Sunday’s church attacks, the most deadly terrorist strike in Indonesia in more than a decade, and revelations that a family with young children were behind it, has shocked the country. After some successes in tackling Islamist militancy since 2001, there has been a resurgence in recent years, including in January 2016 when four suicide bombers and gunmen attacked a shopping area in the capital, Jakarta. Police suspect the attacks on the churches were carried out by a cell of Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a group that is thought to have recruited hundreds of Indonesian sympathisers of Isis The father of the family involved in the attacks was the head of the cell, police said. Police initially said the family were among 500 Isis sympathisers who had returned to Indonesia from Syria, but they later said this was incorrect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/16/essendon-have-regressed-but-the-answer-is-not-to-offload-john-worsfold","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T18:00:28Z","webTitle":"Essendon have regressed but sacking John Worsfold not the answer | Justin Robertson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/16/essendon-have-regressed-but-the-answer-is-not-to-offload-john-worsfold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/16/essendon-have-regressed-but-the-answer-is-not-to-offload-john-worsfold","fields":{"headline":"Essendon have regressed but the answer is not to offload John Worsfold","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Bombers, now sitting on a plebeian two wins and six losses, weren’t supposed to be in rebuild mode. But based on their uninspired output so far this season, they have looked streaky, panicked, and more like a development team headed for a wooden spoon. Most critics positioned Essendon as a finals hope for 2018, and were high on the Bombers’ from an unlikely 2017 campaign that netted 12 wins and an elimination finals berth. The Bombers also added what was believed to be some game-changing talent in Jake Stringer, Devon Smith and Adam Saad. This was a team expected to be contenders this year after they took their game on last season and produced brash and exuberant football. But things have changed. The Bombers have boasted an average losing margin of 26 points and have now lost five of their last six games — their latest failure to the winless Blues by 13 points at the MCG on Saturday. Sometimes with baffling losses it’s hard to put your finger on what the issue could be. But the Bombers’ six defeats have all had the same problem: skill-riddled turnovers, third-quarter capitulations and awfully sluggish and dated movement of the ball from end to end. Since John Worsfold took over as coach at the end of the 2015 season, his record stands at 14 wins from 31 matches, not including the 3-22 season of 2016 – the year of the Asada suspensions. After the hulking loss to the Swans in last year’s knock-out final, Worsfold promised better defensive mechanisms and additional midfield grunt. Neither of those things have transpired yet and the Bombers seem to be regressing in all areas of the ground. And now, from left field, Mark Neeld has resigned from his position as assistant coach. His manager Liam Pickering spoke to SEN Radio on Tuesday and was adamant the decision was mutual by both parties. However it played out, Neeld seems to be the fall guy for the Bombers’ and Worsfold’s football inadequacies on the field and in the box, and has been pinpointed as a potential cause of friction among the coaches — although this sentiment was later denied by Brendon Goddard. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day It’s been an erratic resurgence from the supplements saga by the Bombers who are desperately trying to rebuild and move away from the from the wreckage that involved 34 banned players. In a week where the Bombers lost to a club which had made its worst ever start to the season, and farewelled assistant coach Neeld, former AFL chairman Mike Fitzpatrick also took aim at the Bombers in an interview that aired on Tuesday night on Open Mike. Fitzpatrick sensationally claimed that substances injected into players in 2012 were “almost certainly performance enhancing”, an allegation sure to re-open deep wounds. The last four weeks have been heralded as do-or-die affairs and line-in-the-sand matches, only for the Bombers to revert to their new middling existence, with paltry scorelines. Making matters worse, after the loss to the Blues on the weekend, Worsfold admitted his team lacked identity: “This is a group that hasn’t created something that people look at and say ‘this is who they are’. It’s a great opportunity to work out what we want to stand for and what we want to be.” Something has got to give because the gloss of the 2017 finals campaign and the potential to repeat that feat has well and truly worn off. If the talent is there — and it is, if you look at last year’s results with largely the same list — then the alterations to defensive systems should be quick fixes. As an example, their current defensive floating zone seems unaccountable, which doesn’t give fans much hope they can tighten up the back half. Goddard and Michael Hurley have looked out of place during games as an extra man, sitting in holes where body-on-body contact is needed instead. Why not go man-on-man? Get Hurley to lock down. And move Goddard to a place where he can roam freely, like the wing. With Conor McKenna, Saad and Andrew McGrath, there’s plenty of natural run and playmaking, but only after a defence-first mentality. Consider this: the Bombers are ranked 18th in the AFL for one percenters, 16th for stoppage clearances and 18th for inside 50s (an average of 48.4 entries per game). The message is simple: other teams have worked the Bombers out and they aren’t creating enough scoring opportunities to win them games. For those that think winning a flag is easy, and that each passing season with a new coach should be met with an upward trajectory in wins, let’s remember it took Damien Hardwick and Mark Thompson seven years to win flags with the Tigers and Cats. And there were some hard years for both: Hardwick’s record was 6-16 in his first year at the Tigers (2010) and 8-14 in the year before the won the premiership. Likewise, it took Thompson years at the Cats before consistency came. His first four seasons recorded wins of 12, nine, 11 and then seven. Sometimes you need to go backwards to eventually figure things out. And perhaps 2018 is the year things go backwards for the Bombers until they figure it out. The Bombers have had five coaches in 11 years, so sacking Worsfold right now would be counterproductive. He’s also more than just a stability hire. He’s a premiership player and coach. He’s seen success. And, from all reports by the club, he clicks with the playing group and took this same group to the finals last year. Apart from tweaking the game plan, now is the time for Worsfold to test his depth chart and see which promising young players from the VFL can step into a role next year, or even as early as this year. Dylan Clarke has been making a name for himself as a ball magnet, averaging 32 disposals per game and nine tackles. He’s been credited largely for his contested, in-and-under, grunt work. Aaron Francis made it through his second full game on the weekend and was mentioned in the best. Matt Guelfi should be considered again. Jordan Ridley and Mason Redman are also two defenders who could push out the likes of Patrick Ambrose or Mark Baguley. The Bombers have had some passengers in the first two months, so it’s time to vet the playing list to see who is worthy by picking the in-form rookies. You only need to look at the two wins against the Crows and Power to know the Bombers can play a good style of football. It’s a team that boasts three All-Australians (in 2017), and a rising star winner. It’s time Worsfold reverted back to parts of their fast-paced 2017 style where mastery meets sensibility. However they’re choosing to move the ball now — side to side, slow, overusing handballs — it’s not working. If wholesale changes aren’t made within the next few matches, the Bombers could very well be sitting on two wins and 10 losses with their season over – and there is no punter that would have predicted that. This weekend the Bombers take on an in-form five-and-three Cats at the MCG without injured key defender Hurley and spearhead forward Joe Daniher. Looking ahead, they take on the Giants at Spotless, Tigers at the MCG and Lions at the Gabba, which looms as their best chance for a win in the next four weeks heading into the mid-season break."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/15/the-margaret-river-shooting-shows-that-we-must-stay-vigilant-about-gun-access","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T00:59:34Z","webTitle":"The Margaret River shooting shows that we must stay vigilant about gun access | Denise Cullen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/15/the-margaret-river-shooting-shows-that-we-must-stay-vigilant-about-gun-access","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/15/the-margaret-river-shooting-shows-that-we-must-stay-vigilant-about-gun-access","fields":{"headline":"The Margaret River shooting shows that we must stay vigilant about gun access","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hope Forest, South Australia, 6 September 1971 Heather Bartholomew was sleeping when her estranged husband Clifford Bartholomew crept into their farmhouse south of Adelaide and struck her in the head with a mallet. Instead of rendering her unconscious, as he later claimed to have intended, his wife awoke, screaming. He shot her in the head with a .22 rifle. Then he shot his seven children, who were between four and 19 years old, his sister-in-law and his 18-month-old nephew. What happened in Hope Forest claimed 10 lives, making it Australia’s worst familicide on record. High victim counts were also recorded in the Majka (1957), Darnley (1964), Ross (1982), May (1996) and, now, the Miles (2018) family murders. In each of these cases, seven people died, including the perpetrators who completed suicide. In all but one of these crimes, guns were involved. The deaths of three generations of the Miles family at a rural property south of Perth on Friday is the country’s worst mass shooting in 22 years. Following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, prime minister John Howard introduced controversial restrictions on the use and ownership of guns. After each mass shooting in the United States, Australia is held up as a shining example of the benefits of gun control. So with a hint of tit-for-tat, some in the US have suggested the Miles murder-suicide proves gun control doesn’t work. In an article for the Washington Examiner, Siraj Hashmi said that “while some data suggest that super-strict gun control has cut down on gun violence and gun-related deaths in some cases, there’s still no guarantee that you’re safe.” Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday But you’re certainly safer. A paper published in March 2018 in the Annals of Internal Medicine examined Australian firearms deaths between 1979 and 2013 to see whether gun law reform had any effect. It showed that while 13 mass shootings took place in the 18 years leading up to and including the Port Arthur massacre, none had occurred in the 22 years since. The authors calculated that the odds of this happening by chance were one in 200,000. (In other words, it was no coincidence.) Yet it wasn’t just public mass shootings which declined post-1996. Shootings of multiple family members in a single event did as well. The annihilation of an entire family by one of its adult members has always been seen as something unspeakable. Coroners delivered sparse, stripped-back findings, as if the whole business was simply too distasteful for words. Barriers to better understanding of familicide include its statistical rarity, and the fact that such events typically leave behind few survivors to help shed light on what happened. Because of these challenges, researchers working in this area frequently use newspaper articles as source materials. So it was that I, too, found myself trawling through 67 years of Australian newspapers for a Master of Psychology (Forensic) dissertation. I identified 141 Australian cases of familicide from 1950 to 2017, which involved 416 deaths in total. While the purpose of the study was the creation of a typology of perpetrators, the data did yield some interesting facts about gun-related familicides. Overall, shooting was the most common method of killing one’s family, with stabbing second, and gassing third. Yet only 12 of the 47 total gun-related events occurred after 1996. A closer look at the balance of events pre- and post-1996 revealed that while guns were used by more than half (56.7%) of all perpetrators prior to 1996, they were used by only 16% of perpetrators thereafter. From 1996 onwards, stabbing overtook shooting as the most common method of killing and was used by more than one-third (35.8%) of perpetrators. When you consider that Australia’s population roughly trebled over that period, from eight million in 1950 to almost 25 million in 2017, the shift in methods becomes all the more remarkable. Recognition is growing in Australia and the US that the majority of mass shootings happen behind closed doors. The dominant media narrative features a disgruntled loner indiscriminately spraying bullets at whomever happens to cross their path. However, Everytown for Gun notes that 54% of mass shootings in the US are related to domestic or family violence. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence claims the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk of homicide by 500%. And almost always, the shooter is a man. Watch Hill farm, New South Wales, 9 September 2014 Disability support worker Lorraine Bourke arrived at the Hunt family farmhouse to start her shift. A car accident two years earlier had left Kim Hunt with lingering physical injuries. As Bourke walked along the path leading to the house, she found Kim lying on the ground, blood pooling around her head. Attending police located the bodies of the three children in separate bedrooms in the house. A day later, the body of Kim’s husband, Geoff Hunt, was located. After murdering his family, he had driven half a kilometre to a dam on the property, staggered into the water and put the muzzle of the gun in his mouth. This murder-suicide amply demonstrates that guns aren’t just dangerous in homes marred by domestic violence. An inquest into the Hunt case revealed that there was no known history of domestic violence. Rather, the coroner determined that the murder-suicide was driven by Geoff Hunt’s depressive beliefs. His primary intent was suicide. Yet his wife and children were also killed due to an “egocentric delusion” in which he believed he was ending his wife’s misery, and that the children “would be better off dying than living without him”. So how could something like this happen in gun-averse Australia? As a farmer, Geoff Hunt had access to firearms. So too did Peter Miles, the grandfather who is suspected to have shot his wife, daughter, grandchildren and himself on Friday. In their method, and the scale of their lethality, these two murder-suicides most resemble pre-1996 events. Though greater awareness of the risks of gun access in rural areas has helped reduce deaths, ongoing vigilance is required. For example, Kim Hunt’s disclosure of suicidal ideation a year before she died led police officers to confiscate two long arm rifles. The weapons were returned two months later, after Kim Hunt’s mental health had improved. Fountaindale, New South Wales, 1 February 2015 Truck driver Colin Cooper was travelling along a winding section of Enterprise Drive when he noticed a silver Toyota Corolla ahead of him. Cooper watched the car arc to the left and crash into a tree. A subsequent inquest determined that the driver of the car, Darren Milne, had not only deliberately driven the car at high speed into a tree. An engineer, Milne had meticulously planned the event, filming 10 practice runs on his dash cam, visiting the site two days before the crash, and wiring canisters with fuel at points throughout the car, so if the crash didn’t kill the car’s occupants, the subsequent inferno would. Killed along with Milne was his wife, their unborn baby of 30 weeks’ gestation, and his 11-year-old son. His younger son survived with serious injuries. There is the argument that family murderers, deprived of easy access to firearms, will simply resort to other, more creative, and potentially messier methods. It’s true. Like Milne, some will. But shifting away from case specifics and towards aggregate data, there is no evidence to suggest that taking away firearms results in people substituting other means. A 2016 article published in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) specifically addressed this question by comparing Australian firearm versus non-firearm suicides and homicides from 1979-2013. The authors found that firearms deaths were already declining prior to gun law reform, but that this rate of decline accelerated from 1997 onwards. Meanwhile, suicides and homicides undertaken via alternative means had been increasing prior to gun law reform, but began to decrease post-1996. The authors point out that factors other than gun laws, such as improved emergency care, and speedier means of accessing it courtesy of mobile phones, may have contributed to these results. But they concluded that there was “no apparent substitution to other lethal methods, or if there was substitution, it may have been into less lethal methods”. For lethal methods matter. According to the Monash University Accident Research Centre, the lethality rate of suicide via firearms is approximately 85%, which exceeds all other methods. A 1998 paper published in the Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry identified that less lethal methods reduce suicide rates in several ways. They decrease the odds that attempts progress to completion. They provide a greater opportunity for those pondering a dark pathway to change their minds, or for bystanders to intervene. Restricting gun access is analogous to constructing barriers at notorious suicide jumping-off spots. It provides a life-saving pause between impulse and action. About one-third of perpetrators in my study used multiple methods to kill their victims. Sometimes, they did so to guarantee the victims’ deaths, or because their initial attempt failed. Firearms perpetrators sometimes resorted to additional methods, but for different reasons. Several shooters lit fires, perhaps in misguided attempts to destroy the evidence of their crimes. But perpetrators who shot their families were less likely to use additional methods to kill their victims. Armed with a gun, they didn’t need any backup. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

Media and government policy has not always been kind to Australians on welfare.

While some politicians asserted it was possible to live on $40 a day, economists, business leaders and even the former prime minister John Howard all agreed it is time to increase benefits. Guardian Australia’s Life on the breadline project is designed to give an unfiltered voice to the people behind the headlines. Rather than experts and politicians and commentators talking about them, this platform is theirs alone. The only prerequisite is that they live below the poverty line, defined by the Australian Council of Social Service as $343 a week for a single person to live on after housing costs, and $720 a week for a couple with children. According to the latest Acoss poverty report, in 2014 there were 2.99 million Australians living below the poverty line. Of those, 731,000 are children. Over the coming months some of these people will share with you the most personal details of their day-to-day lives as they move through the world and come up hard against society’s judgments of them. They will open up their inner lives – their hopes and their dreams as well as the humiliations and deprivations – and hopefully challenge stereotypes and biases on the way. I will keep editing to a minimum so that the rawness of their experience comes to you unpolished. Every two weeks we will publish a new writer until you have met the whole group, and then they will take turns to keep us up to date about their lives. With me, you will come to know their characters, to see complex and multi-faceted humans and not cardboard cutouts designed to dovetail with a particular world view. I don’t know, yet, how their stories will unfold. It’s a frightening leap for an editor to launch a series like this without knowing what will happen in each of the stories we plan to publish. We all lead messy lives in an uncertain world; these writers have the added, onerous layer of a relentless and exhausting struggle to make ends meet. I would like to think that I will have to write to you at some stage soon and say, I’m so sorry, but we’re bringing this project to an unexpectedly early close because Mick, Amethyst, Nijole and Tara are no longer living on the breadline. That their health has improved, that they have landed a great job, that the support they receive from their government now lifts them above that line – that they are no longer stricken by poverty. Let’s wish this for them. But at this, the starting point, it’s all unknown. I hope you stay with me on this journey. It’s a privilege to introduce you to these brave and strong people.

Maclaren, who has five international caps to his name, is Australia’s most in-form striker, most recently scoring three times for Scottish Premier League side Hibernian – where he is on loan from German second division club SV Darmstadt 98 – in a 5-5 draw with Rangers on Sunday. But the former Perth Glory and Brisbane Roar player hinted post-match that he already knew his season was over. “Hat-trick on the Final day! Loved being apart of this special group of lads... time to switch off from Football and enjoy a holiday,” he wrote on Twitter. Van Marwijk informed players late last week whether they will be included in a 26-strong group to prepare for the tournament at a camp in Turkey. The Dutchman will then select his final squad of 23 for the tournament in Russia by a deadline of 4 June. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day The omission of Maclaren gives Australia fewer options up front and raises questions as to where they will find goals from once their campaign gets up and running against France on 16 June. Tomi Juric – who has found the back of the net for FC Luzern just twice this year, and seven times all season – is likely to lead the line while veteran Tim Cahill – who is lacking both goals and playing time since leaving Melbourne City and landing at Millwall – is set for a bench role. Bailey Wright and Alex Gersbach were also axed along with Apostolos Giannou, Mitchell Langerak and Aleksandar Susnjar as Van Marwijk confirmed his selections on Tuesday. The dependable Wright, who was a regular member of Ange Postecoglou’s squads, can also feel hard done by. The Bristol City captain played in 12 of Australia’s 22 qualifiers, including both play-off legs against Honduras. But having done the hard grind, he has been overlooked in favour of more mobile options after struggling badly when employed as a right-back in the 4-1 loss to Norway in Oslo. Van Marwijk admitted the decisions were not easy. “It is always a challenging task to reduce a squad, however this is the nature of professional sport at the highest level,” he said. “Overall, I believe we have named a strong and ambitious squad.” Daniel Arzani, Dimitri Petratos, Josh Risdon, Josh Brillante and James Troisi are the only A-League players to be included. But for every hard luck tale there is a feel-good story. Danny Vukovic can look forward to a first World Cup at the age of 33, while 36-year-old Brad Jones will also attend after pulling out of the 2010 tournament after his son was diagnosed with leukaemia. Those free of club commitments will head to the Turkish resort of Antalya where they will begin an intense training camp, which includes a friendly with Czech Republic in Vienna on 1 June. Australia’s last pre-tournament hit-out will be against Hungary in Budapest on 9 June. Should they make the final cut, Cahill and fellow veteran Mark Milligan are in line to attend their fourth World Cup – with Cahill scoring at the previous three. “I am sure that in training in Antalya, and in our match against the Czech Republic, we will see players pushing to go to a higher level as they compete for a place in the final squad,” Van Marwijk said.

Derefore we cry. Our grief so heavy look lak we cain stand it.” That’s a man called Cudjo Lewis describing his kidnapping from Africa and subsequent enslavement in Alabama, in the just-released book Barracoon. We think of slavery as an evil from another age, an injustice rendered almost unimaginable by the temporal gulf separating now from then. In reality, the South’s “peculiar institution” wasn’t an ancient anomaly but an important contributor to the development of American capitalism. Furthermore, in historical terms, the war that brought slavery to an end didn’t take place so very long ago. After all, as of last year the American government was still paying out a Civil War pension, with Irene Triplett receiving a monthly stipend of US$73.13 because of her father’s service for both the South and the Union. Lewis told his story in the 1920s, when he sat down with the anthropologist and novelist Zora Neale Hurston (an extraordinary woman in her own right). The belated publication of her phonetic transcription offers spine-chilling access to one of modernity’s great crimes, an atrocity that, when described by a victim, suddenly becomes far less distant. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Obviously, Barracoon tells an American story. But the shocking sense of historical immediacy it provides should remind us to think about our own past and its ongoing influence today. For instance, Lewis describes his struggle to understand the other slaves in Alabama, since captivity in America destroyed language and culture. “Everybody lookee at us strange,” he says. “We want to talk wid de udder colored folkses but dey doan know whut we say.” In Australia, the cultural destruction wrought by colonisation was just as savage as that effected by slavery. In 1835, settlers arrived in the place that they eventually called Melbourne. By 1839, the missionary Joseph Orton described the local indigenous people as “almost in a state of starvation”, since, already, the colony had destroyed their crops and driven away their game. Within the blink of an eye, a way of living established over tens of thousands of years had been rendered impossible. Last year, Tony Abbott launched a centre for the study of “Western Civilisation”. Those who, like Abbott, valorize their so-called “Judeo-Christian” traditions might ponder how they were cope if that culture were violently and systemically shattered almost overnight. If, in the US, conservatives dismiss slavery as a regrettable business from the far off past, their co-thinkers here make the same argument about the brutality of colonisation. Yet, in reality, even the most extreme violence occurred remarkably recently – many years after the horrors documented in Barracoon. The last large-scale, official massacre of Indigenous Australians took place in 1928, with people of the Warlpiri, Anmatyerre and Kaytetye hunted down and murdered by an expedition led by a police officer. That’s not 1728 or 1828 but 1928, a date that brings the murders both historically and geographically closer to us than the exploits of the Anzacs during their invasion of Turkey in 1915. Australians obsess over Gallipoli – but how many have even heard of the Coniston massacre? History, Fredric Jameson said once, is what hurts. Because the culture wars racking the English-speaking world take place in the permanent “now” of the media, they’re often governed by a strange historical amnesia. The presence of the past – and the injuries that belong to it – barely register, even when that history is remarkably close to us. Let’s take another, quite different, example. During the recent plebiscite on same-sex marriage, opponents of equality denounced reform as a wrenching break from the traditional understanding of matrimony. In some respects, they were right. Certainly, savage homophobia persisted in the Australian legal code until far later than most people think. In Victoria, for instance, the law classified anal sex as a crime punishable by death until 1949, while homosexuality remained illegal in Tasmania until 1997. Yet, as the academic Lisa Featherstone points out, there’s another aspect of traditional marriage that its champions don’t like to acknowledge: namely, that, in some parts of the country, up until 1994 a man could legally force a woman to have sex with him, so long as they were married. “[The] arguments in opposition to marriage equality,” she writes, “mirror debates that went on in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Australian state governments began to legislate to criminalise rape in marriage.” That sounds like hyperbole but it’s not. Traditionally, Australian law followed the British model, where, in 1736, the eminent jurist Sir Matthew Hale decreed: “A husband cannot be guilty of rape upon his wife for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind to her husband which she cannot retract.” Law reform in Australia began with the criminalisation of marital rape in South Australia in 1976. Queensland was the last state to amend its laws in 1989 – and the NT only followed five years later. Furthermore, the struggle to end rape in marriage was long and difficult, precisely because so many conservatives defended the “rights” of the husband, using rhetoric that sounds remarkably familiar. During the debate in the NSW parliament in 1981, for instance, Liberal MP Jim Cameron denounced anti-rape reform on the basis that it “touched directly on the traditional standing of marriage as the foundation of our community”, while the religious lobby group, the Festival of Light, claimed that the new laws dealt marriage “a crushing blow”. Today, it’s difficult to believe that respectable politicians could passionately defend the right to rape as fundamental to their traditions. But it happened – and it happened within living memory. “History,” said James Baldwin once, “is not something you read about in a book, history is not even the past—it’s the present. Because everybody operates, whether or not we know it, out of assumptions which are produced and produced only by our history.” Baldwin had in mind, at least in part, the kind of events documented so shockingly in Barracoon. But the argument is just as relevant in Australia. Unless we recognise the past, we will struggle to understand the present – and reshape the future. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/15/super-rugby-player-drain-looms-as-new-zealands-biggest-foe","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T18:00:36Z","webTitle":"Super Rugby player drain looms as New Zealand's biggest foe | Bret Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/15/super-rugby-player-drain-looms-as-new-zealands-biggest-foe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/15/super-rugby-player-drain-looms-as-new-zealands-biggest-foe","fields":{"headline":"Super Rugby player drain looms as New Zealand's biggest foe","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee, New Zealand. Recent commentary in the New Zealand media that Australian rugby is sinking into oblivion may have some truth to it, but it would be wise for the Kiwis to appreciate they are in the same leaky boat in these troubled southern waters. Make no mistake, there is no immediate threat to New Zealand’s dominance of Super Rugby, particularly Trans-Tasman competition, which has stretched out to 39 consecutive wins against Australian opposition. But a few tiny weaknesses are starting to appear in New Zealand rugby. The NSW Waratahs should have beaten defending Super Rugby champions, the Crusaders, in Christchurch on Saturday after racing to a 29-0 lead in 29 minutes. There was a feeling the Crusaders were capable of coming back and winning, which they did, 31-29, but their victory was tainted by Joe Moody’s elbow to Kurtley Beale’s throat just before the All Black prop scored a crucial try in the 34th minute to ignite the Kiwi comeback. Moody escaped punishment on the day, but was subsequently suspended for two games, cold comfort for the Waratahs and if Moody’s foul play had been detected by the all-New Zealand officiating panel, the Waratahs may have led 29-12 at half-time instead of 29-19 and the Crusaders would have played the rest of the game with 14 men. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Whether the Crusaders could have come back from that scenario is problematical but it raises this question: does the result show New Zealand sides are fallible or does it just reinforce their aura of invincibility? It’s perhaps a bit of both. The Waratahs should have gone on with it and didn’t, which suggests they did not really believe they could beat the Crusaders. But other recent results indicate the New Zealanders are not invincible. In previous weeks the Jaguares beat the Blues (the first Kiwi team to lose to the Argentines) and the Chiefs on New Zealand soil, while the Highlanders were hammered 38-12 by the Sharks in Durban. These results show that the New Zealand teams, which follow a policy of resting All Blacks during Super Rugby, are vulnerable when they are not at full strength or mentally switched on. And this should be an area of concern moving forward. The biggest threat to Super Rugby in New Zealand is the potential removal of one of their greatest advantages against Australia and South Africa – the ability to retain talent. There is a dark cloud on the horizon for New Zealand if talented Kiwi players continue to join the player drain to Europe which has undermined Australian and South African Super Rugby teams. New Zealand has always relied on the lure of the All Blacks jersey to keep top talent in the country, but this is starting to change. All Blacks at the peak of their careers such as Aaron Cruden and Malakai Fekitoa have already left, while others such as Lima Sopoaga are going at the end of the year. While these players may not be first-choice All Blacks, they are still important to their Super Rugby teams. New Zealand has more depth than Australia and a much greater capacity to cover losses, but a mass exodus has the potential to adversely affect the standard of Super Rugby in New Zealand. The tipping point for New Zealand would be losing a player such as star playmaker Beauden Barrett, who has reportedly been offered $3.4m a season by a French club. The player drain is one of the main reasons Sanzaar has searched for an El Dorado, firstly in Japan and now possibly in the US, to enable the southern hemisphere nations to compete with rich clubs in Europe. With a new broadcast deal about to be re-negotiated Sanzaar must find a way to generate the revenue to compete with Europe or the player drain will continue. South Africa has just announced it will select overseas-based players for the Springboks. How long before Australia, who already have a 60-Test cap eligibility rule, and New Zealand follow suit? What would that mean for Super Rugby? If the competition is relegated to the B-League of the southern hemisphere, the bell will toll for everyone, including New Zealand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/16/indias-reluctance-to-play-pink-ball-test-no-historical-surprise","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T18:00:27Z","webTitle":"India's reluctance to play pink-ball Test no historical surprise | David Schout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/16/indias-reluctance-to-play-pink-ball-test-no-historical-surprise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/16/indias-reluctance-to-play-pink-ball-test-no-historical-surprise","fields":{"headline":"India's reluctance to play pink-ball Test no historical surprise","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There was a sense of déjà vu with last week’s decision by Indian cricket chiefs to stonewall a bid to play the Adelaide Test under lights. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) are not convinced by the day-night format, and doubt its place in the future of the game. We’ve been here before. In the early 1980s, India had no time for the new craze that was one-day cricket. Officials scorned Kerry Packer’s cricket circus, and even the players – using Sunil Gavaskar’s defiant 36 off 174 in the 1975 World Cup as their rallying cry – showed scant regard for the new format. The BCCI chairman of selectors maintained the format was “irrelevant” and “artificial”, but after Kapil Dev’s side defied all odds to win the 1983 World Cup, things changed. They did so swiftly. The BCCI pitched successfully to host the next tournament (1987) and, for the home Test series against the West Indies later that year, cut Test matches from five to four to accommodate two extra ODIs. White-ball cricket became a venture the BCCI now wholeheartedly embraced. It was just a decade later than everyone else. Fast forward 20 years, and much the same negative rhetoric was directed towards T20 in its infancy. Cricket writer Gideon Haigh details the feeling at the time in his book Sphere of Influence. “The real resistance to Twenty20 at this (early) stage, however, was not from purists, but from the guardians of the status quo ante, chief among them BCCI president Pawar”. As Haigh records, Pawar argued that Twenty20 “dilutes the importance of international cricket,” while secretary Niranjan Shah quipped: “Twenty20? Why not Ten-10 or Five-5 or One-1?” Historically, conservatism fills the BCCI’s Mumbai headquarters like few offices in world sport. Their habitual resistance to innovation means few were surprised at the decision last week to reject the chance to play the Adelaide Test under lights. Despite three largely successful pink ball fixtures against New Zealand, South Africa and England at the venue, Adelaide fans will have to settle for day-time cricket at India’s behest. It’s their prerogative, mind – both the hosts and visitors must agree upon changes to playing conditions before a series, and Virat Kohli’s side is loth to give Australia any advantage in their quest to win their first Test series on these shores. In a purely on-field sense, it is logical. But, at a time when Test cricket is crying out for innovation, it is much more than that. And, as was the case after initially slandering ODIs and laughing off T20s, it’s entirely likely that in a decade’s time the BCCI will be espousing day-night Tests as the shot in the arm Test cricket required. The irony of Shah’s derogatory quip about T20 during its infancy isn’t lost on anyone in world cricket; the seven-week IPL season now accounts for up to 95% of the BCCI’s total profits. India was one of the last nations to initiate a domestic T20 competition, but since doing so, the IPL has delivered astronomical success, healthily lining their pockets along the way. They have mastered the art of being late to the party, then reaping the hefty rewards of the very ideas they denigrate. India’s reluctance to embrace change – especially in the format where it is most needed – significantly impacts world cricket given their authoritative position at board level. In this instance it certainly hampers Cricket Australia’s traction on a budding format, after strong crowds in their first foray indicate it is worth further investment. More importantly, however, it further delays the required intervention in the game on the subcontinent. Images from last year’s gripping Border-Gavaskar series (which India went on to win 2-1) revealed a contest played in front of largely empty stands. Whatever way their PR machine spun the series’ success, the vacant seats (versus the packed houses at IPL games) reveal a disconnect between fans and the traditional form of the game. And while it remains to be seen whether day-night Test cricket is the propping up proponents claim it is, at the very least it is a low-risk endeavour for Indian cricket executives to explore. It is also an endeavour they need to invest in soon. Former captain Sourav Ganguly disagrees with the board’s current position. “Day-night Tests are the way forward,” he said. “Every country has to play day-night Tests. India has reservations but it’s a long-term future for Test cricket”. History tells us, however, that they will wait. They will wait until all risk has been mitigated and they are sure it is a worthwhile endeavour, irrespective of the urging of other cricket boards for years previous. It is only then they will agree to it, and discover they are yet again late to the party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/13/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-future-daniel-levy-spending-transfers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T20:02:06Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino hints Spurs future hinges on commitment of transfer funds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/13/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-future-daniel-levy-spending-transfers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/13/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-future-daniel-levy-spending-transfers","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino hints Spurs future hinges on commitment of transfer funds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino appeared to suggest that his future at Tottenham Hotspur is linked to how the club approach the summer transfer window, as he called upon the chairman, Daniel Levy, to “be brave and take risks”. The manager has been permitted to spend £40.25m in net terms on permanent transfer deals across his four seasons at Tottenham and he has delivered a third consecutive top-three finish and Champions League qualification. From a position of strength, Pochettino sent a message to Levy that sounded suspiciously like an ultimatum: if the club want to take the next step to the biggest trophies, they have to invest more lavishly in top signings. Pochettino was asked whether he would definitely be at the club next season. He had been asked the same question last Friday and, once again, he gave an ambiguous answer. “I repeat from my last press conference – today, 100% I feel that I am here,” he said. “But the most important thing is that tomorrow all can change because it’s not in my hands.” Pochettino needed no second invitation to enter into great detail about how the club could improve. “I have very clear ideas of what we need to do,” Pochettino said. “I don’t know if the club will agree with me or not. We are going to talk next week to create the new project. It is a little bit up to Daniel and the club to agree with us. “If we want to be real contenders for big trophies, we need to review a little bit the thing. We need to create dreams that will be possible to achieve. Maybe we are a bit disappointed and frustrated because now we are close [to trophies]. “I think Daniel is going to listen to me, of course. You need to be brave. Being brave is the most important thing and take risks. I think it’s a moment that the club needs to take risks and tries to work, if possible, harder than the previous season to be competitive again, because every season will be more difficult. It’s not only the big clubs. The clubs in behind us like Everton, West Ham or Leicester – they are working so hard to be close to the top six.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/13/man-stabbed-near-royal-festival-hall-hours-before-bafta-tv-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T18:37:09Z","webTitle":"Man stabbed near Festival Hall London hours before Bafta TV awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/13/man-stabbed-near-royal-festival-hall-hours-before-bafta-tv-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/13/man-stabbed-near-royal-festival-hall-hours-before-bafta-tv-awards","fields":{"headline":"Man stabbed near Royal Festival Hall hours before Bafta TV awards","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A man has been stabbed outside the National Theatre on the Southbank, London several hours before the Bafta Television awards began at the Royal Festival Hall nearby.

One day after Fox cancelled the sitcom, it was snapped up by NBC. For those of us who don’t live in the US, or for those of us who pay scant attention to traditional broadcasters, it’ll be like nothing has changed. The Nine-Nine lives on, and it’s all because of us. The story is already legend. Brooklyn Nine-Nine was brought back to life by its legion of devoted fans, who came together as one to tweet devastated GIFs and use devastated hashtags and generally yell “Like yeast!” to one another in a vaguely devastated way until a new network felt our misery and saved the day. The fans, the true beating heart of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, are what saved the show. It was us and nobody else. A great story, but not necessarily a true one. After all, plenty of other shows have marked their demise with a similar online outcry. When ABC cancelled Agent Carter in 2016, 127,000 people signed a campaign asking Netflix to save it, but it still died. When Hannibal wasn’t renewed three years ago, a petition was started that people are still signing every few hours, but it hasn’t been enough to get it rescued. Nobody stepped in to save Angel, nobody stepped in to save Sense8 and no amount of bereft gnashing will convince anyone to save Designated Survivor. But Brooklyn Nine-Nine is different. Because it has better fans? No. Because it’s a better show? No (although yes). The truth is a little more complicated, because NBC always had first dibs. Initially, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was pitched to NBC as part of a development deal that Mike Schur had with the network following the success of Parks and Recreation, although it was eventually sold to Fox. Robert Greenblat, the NBC Entertainment chairman who passed on the show, has already expressed contrition at letting it slip through his fingers. “Ever since we sold this show to Fox I’ve regretted letting it get away, and it’s high time it came back to its rightful home,” he said in a statement this week, adding that “Mike Schur, Dan Goor, and Andy Samberg grew up on NBC”. Indeed, when you think of NBC comedy, you increasingly think of Mike Schur’s feelgood sensibility. It’s where Parks and Recreation grew from an anaemic Office spin-off into an unbelievably charming entity in its own right. It’s where The Good Place is fast redefining what a half-hour comedy can achieve. With this in mind it has always been downright strange that Brooklyn Nine-Nine – a broadly optimistic sitcom starring a Saturday Night Live alum from the Parks and Rec people – was never on NBC to begin with. Plus, don’t forget that the writing was on the wall for a long time with Brooklyn Nine-Nine – there was talk that it might not last beyond its fifth series a full year ago – so NBC had plenty of time to see this coming and figure something out. As nice as it is to think that NBC revived the show because Mark Hamill was sad something like this has probably been lined up for months. Whether it will be any good on NBC, though, is another thing entirely. If history can teach us anything about fan campaigns, it’s that we should always be careful what we wish for. When Scrubs jumped from NBC to ABC in 2009, it immediately became a harrowing shadow of its former self. The Mindy Project was never quite the same when it jumped from Fox to Hulu. The campaign to revive Futurama took what one of the all-time great television finales and buried it in a swamp of inferior product. You’ve seen what Arrested Development is like on Netflix. It’s enough to make you wonder why anyone ever brings anything back at all. But, nevertheless, it’s worth holding out hope for Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It’s one of the smartest, silliest, most absurd, most human comedies of the last decade, and there’s too much talent involved for it to be ruined so easily. Ideally, it’ll continue its incredible run of no-fail episodes. But if not, we’ve got thirteen more episodes anyway. And that’s thirteen more cold opens than we would have had. Surely that alone is worth celebrating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/13/uk-and-european-intelligence-more-vital-than-ever-warns-m15-head","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T21:30:10Z","webTitle":"MI5 chief: UK and EU intelligence sharing ‘never more important’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/13/uk-and-european-intelligence-more-vital-than-ever-warns-m15-head","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/13/uk-and-european-intelligence-more-vital-than-ever-warns-m15-head","fields":{"headline":"MI5 chief: UK and EU intelligence sharing ‘never more important’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Cooperation between the UK and other European intelligence services has never been as important as it is now in facing up to twin threats posed by terror groups such as Islamic State and states such as Russia, Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, will warn on Monday. In the first public speech delivered overseas by a head of MI5, Parker will say that intelligence sharing within Europe is now at an unprecedented level and that an effective security partnership between the UK and the rest of Europe is more operationally vital than ever before. “In today’s uncertain world we need that shared strength more than ever,” he will tell his audience in Berlin, according to a draft. MI5 and the other two main UK intelligence agencies, MI6 and GCHQ, are all anxious to maintain a close working relationship with their European counterparts after Brexit. When Theresa May in March 2017 appeared to make intelligence-sharing a bargaining chip in Brexit negotiations, she was forced to backtrack after intervention from the spy chiefs. Parker will warn that although Islamic State has been expelled from Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq, it is still seeking to “direct devastating and more complex attacks” in Europe, which has already suffered 45 attacks since 2016. Speaking publicly for the first time since a nerve agent was used against Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, he will directly blame the Kremlin for “flagrant breaches of international rules”, accusing it of being behind “aggressive and pernicious actions by its military and intelligence services”. He will describe the Salisbury attack as a “deliberate and targeted malign activity” which risks leaving Russia “a more isolated pariah”. The UK government and intelligence services were wrong-footed by the scale of a Russia media campaign following the attack. Parker called for more action “to shine a light through the fog of lies, half-truths and obfuscation that pours out of their propaganda machine”. Parker, speaking to an audience made up of fellow intelligence officers, will say European intelligence partnerships have never been more crucial in combating the threat posed by Russia and by the “intense and unrelenting international terrorist threat”. He will say: “European intelligence cooperation today is simply unrecognisable to what it looked like five years ago”. He will cite the work of one of the main platforms for intelligence sharing, the Counter Terrorism Group, which is made up of all 28 EU members along with Norway and Switzerland. He will describe the Counter Terrorism Group as the “largest multinational counter-terrorism enterprise in the world” where “real-time intelligence sharing” involves “thousands of exchanges on advanced secure networks every week”. Britain, with its access to much of US intelligence, is a prized partner for other European intelligence agencies, but the UK also benefits from shared intelligence with Germany and France and also some of the smaller European countries where the UK has minimal presence. Apart from common European platforms such as the Counter Terrorism Group, much of the intelligence sharing is bilateral. The UK and the other European spy agencies work on the assumption that intelligence sharing will continue after Brexit. But leaving the EU will throw up some problems, with the UK, in order to continuing sharing data at a European level, almost certainly needing new legislation to ensure it stays in line with the European legal framework on privacy and data sharing. Parker will use the Berlin speech to thank the European security agencies for the support they provided in the investigation after the Manchester attack in May 2017. According to Parker, the UK intelligence services and police have disrupted 25 potential attacks in the UK since 2013. Parker, who came under pressure last year after a series of terrorist attacks including Manchester and three in London, was due to retire this year but May has granted him an 18-month extension. He will say that he is confident about tackling terrorist threats because of “ the strength and resilience of our democratic systems, the resilience of our societies and the values we share with our European partners”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/13/british-architect-will-alsop-dies-aged-70-after-short-illness","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T18:23:45Z","webTitle":"British architect Will Alsop dies aged 70 after short illness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/13/british-architect-will-alsop-dies-aged-70-after-short-illness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/13/british-architect-will-alsop-dies-aged-70-after-short-illness","fields":{"headline":"British architect Will Alsop dies aged 70 after short illness","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The British architect Will Alsop has died aged 70, his practice confirmed on Sunday. He died on Saturday after a short illness, said Marcos Rosello, director of aLL Design, which Alsop set up in 2011. “Will has inspired generations and impacted many lives through his work. It is a comfort to know that due to the nature of Will’s work and character, he will continue to inspire and bring great joy,” Rosello said. “He had an exceptional ability to recognise particular strengths in individuals which he would draw out and nurture. His design ethos, essentially to ‘make life better’, is evident in the architecture of his buildings and their surrounding communities. We will miss him greatly.” Creator of avant garde, modernist, and occasionally controversial architecture, Alsop was best known for designing buildings such as the bright green L-shaped Peckham Library. Designed alongside the German architect Jan Störmer, it won the 2000 Stirling prize, thanks to its double-height reading room and trademark columns. Other far-fetched proposals included turning Barnsley into a Tuscan hill town and flooding the centre of Bradford with a huge lake. Amanda Baillieu, founder of the architecture platform Archiboo, tweeted in tribute to Alsop: The architect Anthony Powis also tweeted: “Will Alsop has been one of my reference points for ambitious thinking ever since I heard him talk about Barnsley as a Tuscan hill village when I was a young student. It was amazing.” Born on 12 December 1947 in Northampton, Alsop left school at 16 but completed his A-levels while working for a local architect. He graduated from the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London in 1973 and prior to his death he was a professor of architecture at the Vienna University of Technology and Canterbury School of Architecture in Kent. He opened six different firms over four decades and was responsible for, among many other buildings, creating a gigantic blue regional government building nicknamed “the big blue” in Marseille in 1994, and the North Greenwich tube station in 1998. He was awarded an OBE the following year. In 2004 Liverpool city council cancelled his proposed Fourth Grace, a glass cloud on stilts which had been described as a “diamond knuckleduster” and, less generously, a “cow pat”. Alsop, dismissed as a dreamer by some, was eternally optimistic about the potential of architecture. “Architects are the only profession that actually deal in joy and delight,” he had said. “All the others deal in doom and gloom.” He is survived by his widow, Sheila, and his three children, Oliver, Piers and Nancy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/16/killing-wolf-denmark-migrants-eu-polarisation-of-politics-pack-mentality","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"They want a wolf-free Denmark.

Will migrants be next?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A wolf was killed last month, not far from where I live. Some years ago I moved from Copenhagen back to west Jutland, on Denmark’s North Sea coast. I settled where my grandmother comes from, among hardy Jutlanders in the beautiful, desolate countryside not far from the village of Ulfborg. The wolf showed up around that same time. Once wolves had given Ulfborg – literally “Wolf Castle” – its name, but they had long disappeared. The last Danish wolf – before their recent return – had been shot in 1813, and the species was not welcomed back: farmers worried about their animals, parents about their kids, and politicians about their votes. Experts sent out to observe Denmark’s new wolves and reassure the population that these animals pose no danger to people have a tough time getting their message across. Fear quickly gathers pace on social media. People share fake stories about wolves and start seeing them everywhere. Facts give way to emotions. Local politicians saw their chance and tapped into the fear. People were agitated. Recently in Ulfborg, an association was formed called Wolf-Free Denmark. Then came 16 April: the killing. It was a classic scene: a couple of “wolf-spotters”, as they’re called, had gone into the forest. They’d been sitting there since early morning, filming a pair of wolves playing in a field. Just after noon, a big tractor arrived. Witnesses later claimed it was pursuing one of the wolves. Meanwhile the driver filmed the scene on his mobile phone. The animal didn’t act aggressively, but eventually lay down to rest, a safe distance from the tractor. Soon afterwards, an SUV showed up. The man in the vehicle rolled down his window. At first the spotters thought he was filming the wolf too. The creature trotted away from the SUV, glanced over at it, and then suddenly: a shot. The wolf collapsed. It tried to get on its feet again, but died there in the field. The wolf-spotters filmed it all. Hunting from a motor vehicle is illegal, and the wolf is a protected species in the European Union. That the man in the tractor happened to be a local politician with, at the time, his eye on a seat in parliament (he’s since stepped down, in the aftermath of the scandal) – and that the man later charged with poaching is a close relative (though he denies any wrongdoing) – is not as surprising as it ought to be. Public support for wolf hunting runs high around here. What was shocking was the way the killing occurred, as well as the local reaction. Many thought the shooter should get a medal. Some called the two spotters cowards. Some locals felt they had undermined something, but what? Not just the battle against wolves. There are pragmatic and reflective voices in the wolf debate. People and animals should be able to co-exist. It requires solutions. But the debate’s loudest voices speak of a Denmark that is too small for the wolf. They say it’s the European Union’s fault that the wolf even arrived – and also the EU that says we can’t shoot it. One day I heard somebody say we could outlaw burqas and wolves at the same time. Burqas and wolves! There’s also talk about strengthening the Danish-German border. To secure it against anyone who comes across to take our things. Gangs of eastern European thieves, for instance. Thieves, yeah! And wolves! The wolves infringe on property rights too. The land belongs to us. And so the battle lines are clearly drawn: on one side, apparent wolf-haters; and on the other, a wolf and wolf-spotters, equipped only with a vacuum flask of coffee and a camera. The Danish Broadcasting Corporation decided to broadcast the film of the killing on prime time. Viewers were shocked, and found it chilling. The following day, reporters visited a supermarket in Ulfborg. Some west Jutlanders declared that they didn’t like vigilantism, but the wolf had to go. A couple of older women didn’t mince their words: the shooter was a hero, and the remaining wolves should be captured, loaded on to a lorry and driven to Copenhagen. It all has to do with the relationship between the periphery and the centre. If the wolf had been German, it ought to have been transported to Berlin; and a wolf recently spotted in Belgium should soon be put on a lorry bound for Brussels. People who live far from our capital cities feel overlooked and victimised by globalisation. They are suspicious of experts, they don’t like change – and now they want to be heard. They shout out for easy solutions. Politicians seize on the popular mood. And there’s momentum in populism: Donald Trump, Brexit, Alternative für Deutschland, the far-right Danish People’s party; and big lorries that can cart away everything we don’t think belongs. The day after the killing of the wolf was broadcast, I went for a long walk down by the sea, saddened and afraid. It wasn’t merely a wolf that had been harmed; peace of mind had suffered as well. Thoughtful voices were being squeezed out by extreme positions. The wolf has adapted to a Europe in peacetime. It crosses borders, and we now have to find a way to co-exist with it. The only viable option is to take practical precautions and allay fears. That requires a willingness to learn about the habits of wolves, and to listen – at a time when so many people would rather shout in social-media echo chambers. The last time that wolves were eradicated from Jutland, the few trees left had all been bowed to the ground by the western wind. Everything was heath. People, sheep and wolves all starved. The land was impoverished. Things are different now. The land has been cultivated, while broad forests and heaths are home to vast numbers of red and roe deer. My grandmother told me of her love for the magnificent, rugged place she grew up in. She’d been born in 1905, and she called Ulfborg “Uldborg”, or “Wool Castle”. I don’t know whether that was the west Jutlandic dialect, and its way of blurring what it really wanted to say – or the language itself trying to wipe out the wolf. • Dorthe Nors, a Danish writer, is the author of Mirror, Shoulder, Signal • This article was translated from Danish by Misha Hoekstra"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/may/13/brain-cancer-to-get-more-funding-and-better-tests-says-no-10","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T21:30:10Z","webTitle":"Brain cancer to get more funding in tribute to Tessa Jowell, says No 10","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/13/brain-cancer-to-get-more-funding-and-better-tests-says-no-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/13/brain-cancer-to-get-more-funding-and-better-tests-says-no-10","fields":{"headline":"Brain cancer to get more funding in tribute to Tessa Jowell, says No 10","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brain cancer research will have its government funding doubled to £40m and gold standard tumour diagnosis tests will be rolled out to all NHS hospitals, in tribute to Dame Tessa Jowell, Downing Street announced on Sunday. No 10 announced it would fulfil two key campaign aims of the late former Labour cabinet minister, including a national rollout of a brain cancer diagnosis test, gold standard dye, used to identify tumours. The method is only used in half of brain cancer centres in England. “It must be extended to all of them,” Jowell said in her final speech in the House of Lords. Theresa May and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, also announced an annual Tessa Jowell global symposium, which will host the best clinical, scientific and academic minds on brain cancer to to identify gaps, best practice and research priorities. Downing Street said it hoped the first symposium would take place by the end of the year. The work to fulfil the commitments will be led by health minister Lord O’Shaughnessy. “My aim is to boost research into treatments – even cures – for brain cancer and transform care for patients in the way that Tessa called for,” he said. Jowell met May and Hunt in Downing Street in February where they unveiled a new £45m brain cancer research fund, with new government funding of £20m over five years. That has now been doubled with more new money to £40m, which will bring the total research fund to £65m, including £25m from Cancer Research UK and £13m of regular funding. The government also said it would commit to accelerate the use of adaptive trials – another key ask by Jowell during her House of Lords speech. “New adaptive trials can test many treatments at the same time,” she said. “They speed up the process and save a lot of money.” Traditional clinical trials test only one drug or treatment at a time and can take several years to produce results, whereas adaptive trials allow researchers to test new drugs or combinations of therapies in response to a patient’s condition. May said she had been privileged to host Jowell at Downing Street to speak about her illness. “I hope that the actions we are taking now and in the future to improve care and research for those confronting a terrible disease will form part of the lasting legacy of an inspirational woman,” she said. Hunt said he had been “moved by her bravery and selfless campaigning in her final months, and determined to honour her life and memory with the action on brain cancer that she fought so hard for”. About 11,400 people are diagnosed with a brain tumour every year in the UK, with survival rates of just 14% for 10 years or more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2018/may/25/why-the-vegas-golden-knights-are-already-the-best-expansion-team-in-sports","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T09:00:43Z","webTitle":"Why the Vegas Golden Knights are already the best expansion team in sports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/may/25/why-the-vegas-golden-knights-are-already-the-best-expansion-team-in-sports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/may/25/why-the-vegas-golden-knights-are-already-the-best-expansion-team-in-sports","fields":{"headline":"Why the Vegas Golden Knights are already the best expansion team in sports","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/16/australian-millennials-faith-in-politics-and-big-business-collapsing-poll-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T18:00:27Z","webTitle":"Australian millennials' faith in politics and big business collapsing, poll finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/16/australian-millennials-faith-in-politics-and-big-business-collapsing-poll-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/16/australian-millennials-faith-in-politics-and-big-business-collapsing-poll-finds","fields":{"headline":"Australian millennials' faith in politics and big business collapsing, poll finds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australian millennials increasingly think big businesses and politicians do more harm than good, a new survey has found. The annual Deloitte survey of Generation Y, roughly defined as those born between 1983 and 1994, found they were increasingly sceptical of politics but surprisingly more personally optimistic than last year. Of the 337 Australian millennials surveyed, only 45% believed business had a positive impact on society, down from 72% last year. Almost half – 44% – believed businesses behaved ethically, down from 54%. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The scorecard for politicians was even worse – 63% of Australian millennials believed politicians have a negative impact on society. Only 23% said they had a positive impact. But compared to last year, Australians were much more optimistic about their personal futures, when measuring against their baby boomer parents. More than a third (39%) believed they would be better off than their parents, and 35% said they would be happier. While this was still below the global average (51% and 41% respectively), it was a huge upturn from last year, when only 8% thought they would be better off than their parents. The top five issues of personal concern were: terrorism (31%), climate change and the environment (30%), income inequality (24%), unemployment (23%) and war (22%). This year’s survey adjusted the birth range of who it defined as a millennial, which may explain the shift. Last year’s survey defined it as those born between 1982 and 1999. This year it was between 1983 and 1994. This year’s survey also became the first to include data on the tentatively-named Generation Z – the generation after millennials – surveying 307 people born after 1995 and before 2012. Compared to millennials, the younger generation was slightly less optimistic about the impact of automation, AI and technology on their work. Among millennials, 45% said automation would improve and support their work, 27% said it would have no effect, 18% said it would replace at least a part of their job, and 10% didn’t know. Among Generation Z, 32% were positive, 24% were negative and 31% thought it would have no impact. Compared to their global counterparts, Australian millennials also said a good workplace culture was more important than salary when choosing where to work. Workplace culture was deemed important by 67%, and salary by 63%. Globally, the same 63% chose salary, but only 52% chose culture. About half (53%) of millennials said they would consider joining the gig economy instead of a full-time job, and 67% of Gen Z said the same. Of the 337 millennials surveyed, 38% had children and all were in full-time employment. Of the 307 in Generation Z, 46% were in full-time education, 36% worked part time, 10% worked full time and 9% were unemployed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/16/rocky-mountain-glaciers-melting-climate-change-photos-garrett-fisher","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T10:00:57Z","webTitle":"One man's race to capture the Rocky Mountains glaciers before they vanish","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/16/rocky-mountain-glaciers-melting-climate-change-photos-garrett-fisher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/16/rocky-mountain-glaciers-melting-climate-change-photos-garrett-fisher","fields":{"headline":"One man's race to capture the Rocky Mountains glaciers before they vanish","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After hearing that the glaciers of the Rocky Mountains are rapidly vanishing, financial consultant Garrett Fisher took a novel course of action – he flew a light aircraft, built in 1949, low and alone over the mountains in order to photograph them. Fisher spent much of his summer in 2015 flying over places such as Yellowstone, Glacier National Park and Grand Teton National Park, taking stunning pictures of retreating glaciers for a new book. Fisher said the enormity of the loss was apparent from his plane, where he took in whole ecosystems such as the Wind River Range in Wyoming, which contains several major rivers that provide water for a large surrounding area. “I’m completely resigned that they will all disappear; I was basically racing to see them before they are gone,” Fisher said. “There’s a bit of bleakness that our planet is going into unchartered territory.” Glaciers, which are vast masses of snow and ice that move under their own weight, are receding at varying rates around the world due to rising global temperatures. Glacier National Park in Montana has seen some of the most dramatic recorded losses, with glaciers set to disappear from the park as early as 2030. Globally, glaciers have lost around 400bn tons in mass a year since 1994, which is raising concerns for the millions of people and animals that rely upon glaciers for melt water. The retreat of huge glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland is also driving sea level rise. The decline of glaciers has previously been illustrated by comparative pictures showing how the modern ice masses looked several decades previously, and more recently. But individual images of modern glaciers can also contain evidence of retreat, according to Lisa McKeon, a physical scientist at the US Geological Society. “Pictures don’t really show the loss in ice volume but they can show the loss of area,” she said. “You can see previous moraines, which are rocks pushed by a glacier’s movement, far from the current edge of the glacier.” McKeon has previously exhibited her own collection of comparative photos of glacier retreat at various galleries, where she left a comment book for visitors to log their thoughts. “I’ve perused the comment book for the past two years or so, there’s a lot of sadness there,” she said. “It’s change. It evokes a sense of loss.” Fisher’s book contains 177 pictures, many of them taken in precarious conditions, as the wind tossed the 69-year-old Piper PA11 plane that Fisher’s grandfather refurbished after he found it in a dilapidated condition in a North Carolina barn in the 1980s. “I learned to fly in this plane,” said Fisher, who is from New York state but has spent a lot of time in Colorado and studied Rocky Mountain National Park there. “There is no heat, the door had to be open when taking pictures so there was an ungodly cold. The plane only has 100 horsepower but when you get to 15,000ft it only has around half of that. I would just go off on my own and hope the engine didn’t fail.” Flying over Glacier National Park, in Montana, was the most challenging because of the “most absurd terrain, the extreme wind, the concentration of grizzly bears if I did have to land – I really didn’t want to go down there,” Fisher said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/14/melania-trump-kidney-surgery","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T20:17:15Z","webTitle":"Melania Trump undergoes kidney surgery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/14/melania-trump-kidney-surgery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/14/melania-trump-kidney-surgery","fields":{"headline":"Melania Trump undergoes kidney surgery","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The White House reported on Monday that Melania Trump has been admitted to hospital, probably for the rest of the week, after undergoing a procedure to treat a benign kidney condition.

Facebook and Google have largely responded by promising to hire thousands of moderators and improve their artificial intelligence tools to automate content removal. Twitter’s approach, which it outlined to reporters in a briefing on Monday, is distinct because it is content neutral and will not require more human moderators. “A lot of our past action has been content based, and we are shifting more and more to conduct,” Dorsey said. Del Harvey, Twitter’s vice-president of trust and safety, said that the new changes were based on research that found that most of the abuse reports on Twitter originate in search results or the conversations that take place in the responses to a single tweet. The company also found that less than 1% of Twitter accounts made up the majority of abuse reports and that many of the reported tweets did not actually violate the company’s rules, despite “detract[ing] from the overall experience” for most users. The new system will use behavioral signals to assess whether a Twitter account is adding to – or detracting from – the tenor of conversations. For example, if an account tweets at multiple other users with the same message, and all of those accounts either block or mute the sender, Twitter will recognize that the account’s behavior is bothersome. But if an account tweets at multiple other accounts with the same message, and some of them reply or hit the “heart” button, Twitter will assess the interactions as welcome. Other signals will include whether an account has confirmed an email address or whether an account appears to be acting in a coordinated attack. With these new signals, Harvey explained, “it didn’t matter what was said; it mattered how people reacted.” The updated algorithm will result in certain tweets being pushed further down in a list of search results or replies, but will not delete them from the platform. Early experiments have resulted in a 4% decline in abuse reports from search and an 8% drop in abuse reports in conversations, said David Gasca, Twitter’s director of product management for health. This is not the first time that Twitter has promised to crack down on abuse and trolling on its platform. In 2015, then CEO Dick Costolo acknowledged that the company “sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls”. But complaints have continued under Dorsey’s leadership, and in March, the company decided to seek outside help, issuing a request for proposals for academics and NGOs to help it come up with ways to measure and promote healthy conversations. Dorsey and Harvey appeared optimistic that this new approach will have a significant impact on users’ experience. “We are trying to strike a balance,” Harvey said. “What would Twitter be without controversy?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/15/morning-mail-gaza-death-toll-business-renewables-lois-lane-actor-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T21:02:29Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: bloodiest day on Gaza Strip since 2014","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/morning-mail-gaza-death-toll-business-renewables-lois-lane-actor-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/morning-mail-gaza-death-toll-business-renewables-lois-lane-actor-dies","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: bloodiest day on Gaza Strip since 2014","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 15 May. Top stories Gaza has had its bloodiest day since 2014 after Israeli forces shot and killed 52 Palestinians and wounded at least 1,200, as tens of thousands protested along the frontier against the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem. Ivanka Trump celebrated the opening to clapping and cheering from American and Israeli VIPs, while 60 miles away Gaza’s hospitals were teeming with hundreds of casualties. Medics said the dead included a 14-year-old boy and there were reports that a man in a wheelchair had also been killed. Fury and desperation at Trump’s December declaration on the embassy helped to ignite the six-week protest movement. To international condemnation, Israeli snipers have regularly fired on demonstrators in past rallies. Monday’s shootings raised the total deaths close to 100. Despite the toll, Hamas has encouraged and funded the protests and said it would not stop people from attempting to break the metal border fence. Donald Trump tweeted that Monday was a “great day for Israel” and did not mention the shootings. Last week’s budget has been more positively received by Australian voters than the Turnbull government’s 2017 offering, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll, and more people think the major measures will be good for working people. But there is also resistance to providing tax cuts to higher income earners, and substantial resistance to the government’s controversial plan to flatten the income tax scales, as well as a degree of cynicism about the Coalition’s motives. The poll finds that 44% of a sample of 1,027 respondents approved of the Coalition’s fifth budget, while 28% disapproved – which is a rosier reception than in 2017. Almost half of Australia’s large businesses are actively transitioning to cheaper renewable energy, including many going off the grid by building their own generators and battery storage, as power bills threaten their bottom line. A new report by the Climate Council details the increased speed of a business-led transition to renewables as power bills have increased. The average household and small-business energy bill is more than 80% higher than a decade ago. In one case study, the general manager of AustChilli at Bundaberg, Ian Gaffel, said the decision to invest in solar panels was a “no-brainer”. Solar now accounts for about a quarter of the business’s power usage. Housing costs alone are responsible for pushing a further 229,000 Australian children below the poverty line, new analysis shows. Researchers on Tuesday released the first longitudinal analysis of homelessness in Australia. The report confirms trends seen in the most recent census data: rough sleeping is up by 20% in the five years to 2016, overall homelessness has spiked 14%, and demand for homelessness service has increase 22%. The cost of housing caused an additional 613,000 people to fall below the poverty line including 229,000 children. Tony Keenan, the chief executive of Launch Housing, described the situation as a national disgrace. Margot Kidder, whose best known role was Lois Lane in the 1978 Superman movie, has died aged 69. After the success of the first Superman movie, Kidder worked steadily in Hollywood throughout the 1980s, though issues with bipolar disorder resulted in a tumultuous personal life and a highly publicised breakdown in 1996 during which she disappeared for four days. She subsequently turned to social and political activism. Scientists have discovered a new chemical compound that ‘stops the common cold in its tracks’ – but a cure is still a long way off. The cold is predominantly caused by the rhinovirus, and scientists say they have discovered a way to nobble the virus that could one day help those with conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis, for whom a cold is not merely a nuisance but a serious health risk. The trick, the authors say, is to develop drugs that interact with an enzymes within human cells – an approach that makes it harder for the virus to become drug-resistant.

Thirty-six-year-old Serena Williams has her eyes on a win at the French Open, according to her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. Williams has played only a handful of matches since winning the 2017 Australian Open when seven weeks pregnant. “Can she do it? Serena can achieve anything. After being her coach for six years, I’m even more sure of that statement,” he says. Williams pulled out of Madrid last week, then Rome, to build on her fitness at his academy in Nice. Thinking time What happened to R&amp;B singer Chris Brown? Ten years ago he was frequently topping the charts, had Rhianna on his arm and was the toast of the music industry. Now, a new set of legal issues for the singer join almost a decade’s worth of allegations that might finally derail his career. “If you truly do love Chris Brown, then you’ve felt everything that’s gone on with him,” says fellow R&amp;B star Usher. Dr Kendall Ackley pushes her fist into the universe: purples and pinks and flashes of yellow, two black holes spin across the screen. Part of the team of scientists who discovered gravitational waves in 2016, Ackley’s work is now displayed in a tactile, interactive form at Scienceworks’ new exhibition, Beyond Perception: Seeing the Unseen. The exhibit has been curated in collaboration with teenagers to bring to life the invisible elements of the world and encourage young people’s interest in science, technology, engineering and maths subjects. But it also makes visible the invisible elements of the world, in a way that is playful and mesmerising. The first woman elected to parliament was a Liberal, so was the first female president of the Senate and the first female foreign and defence ministers. But the current rate of Liberal women in parliament is the same as it was in 1993. And that looks set to get worse since Jane Prentice lost her preselection over the weekend. The reason Robert Menzies, Malcolm Fraser and John Howard were able to reign for as long as they did was because they were the preferred choice of female voters. This is something the branches don’t seem to understand, writes Conrad Liveris. What’s he done now? Donald Trump does one thing about 20 times a day, according to a report by the Washington Post. And that’s complain about the Robert Mueller investigation into potential links between his campaign and Russia.

The West Australian reports that more than a quarter of fly-in, fly-out workers from remote mining and construction sites report high psychological distress in a new study.

On Tuesday night, Chelsea will be crowned champions with one game to play if they avoid defeat at Bristol City. That is not a conclusion everyone had seen coming. At the end of January the top tier looked very much like the men’s Premier League. Manchester City were dominant, having won all seven league games and 17 in a row across three competitions. Although Chelsea had dropped two points, it felt as though the title was City’s to lose. Since then, however, Nick Cushing’s City side have picked up 11 points from a possible 27, fewer than Birmingham, Chelsea, Reading, Arsenal and sixth-placed Liverpool. They lost the League Cup final against Arsenal and, whereas Chelsea remain unbeaten in the league, City have lost four games, crumbling at the business end – three of those coming in their past five matches. Now, with two games to play, they sit six points below Emma Hayes’s Chelsea. So where did it go wrong? It is fairly simple. Whereas Chelsea have built a deep and experienced squad capable of competing on all fronts, City have not. Both sides have lost players to injury, some long-term, yet Hayes has still been able to rotate and has always had someone capable of stepping into the breach – most notably Maren Mjelde moving into the back four from midfield with ease. Whereas the average age of defenders used by Chelsea is 26, City’s is 24. The midfield average age gap is even bigger, Chelsea’s 27 to City’s 24. City’s team is young and their squad is younger. So while Chelsea have been able to rely on experience in their backline (players range from 24 to 33 outside their most-used back-four) City have had the talented but less experienced Mie Jans, 24, Megan Campbell, 24, and Esme Morgan, 17, to fall back on. Chelsea’s more experienced regular defence have this season played 13 fewer games between them than City’s over-relied-on back four of Jen Beattie, Abbie McManus, Demi Stokes and Steph Houghton. In midfield the problem is the same: four Chelsea players have played fewer than 28 games this season (only the veteran Katie Chapman reached 29) as Hayes has rotated to deal with the fixture pile-up caused by the team’s progress in two domestic cups and to the Champions League semis. At City, three midfielders have played more than 28 games, with 21-year-old Kiera Walsh playing 34 across all competitions. No wonder City players have started to show signs of fatigue. Both sides have a wealth of attacking talent but City have lacked a real goalscorer. Fran Kirby has 25 goals for Chelsea as part of a potent frontline, all of whom have chipped in. But City have not had a stand-out player up front. They brought in German forward Pauline Bremer from Lyon in exchange for arguably the world’s best right-back, Lucy Bronze, in the summer, but three games in, and after she had scored her first goal, Bremer suffered a horrific leg break. As the margins City were winning by began to shrink, Cushing turned to the Portland Thorns and Denmark forward Nadia Nadim in the January transfer window. After scoring six minutes into her debut against Reading, then the winner in City’s Continental Cup semi against Chelsea, she looked to have settled in well. But she trailed off disappointingly, making six starts and scoring two goals in 14 appearances. City allowed Toni Duggan to leave for Barcelona in the summer and with the striker finishing as Barça’s top scorer, with 14 goals in all competitions, their failure to recruit suitable back-up or to deepen the squad seems to have been costly. Chelsea won the FA Cup final this month and if they wrap up the double on Tuesday, or at Liverpool on Sunday, they will be worthy winners. Their exciting, interchangeable attack has been anchored by a rock-solid defence, and City have struggled to play with as much verve. Even if Chelsea seal the title on Tuesday there will be much to play for behind them. The restructure of the pyramid means there will be no relegation but at the top end three points separate second and fifth. If City continue their slide they run the risk of finishing without a trophy and outside the two Champions League places, with Arsenal on their heels and Reading still with an outside chance. Anyone pining for football now the Premier League season has finished could do a lot worse than watching a gripping WSL1 term reach its conclusion. Talking points • Doncaster Rovers Belles won Women’s Super League Two after Durham put four past title-chasing Brighton. Belles celebrated with a win against third-place Millwall, Jade Pennock’s strike taking a heavy deflection to inflict Millwall’s first home defeat since February 2017. Belles’ striker Jessica Sigsworth is on course to finish as WSL2’s top scorer; she has 11 goals, one more than team-mate Kirsty Hanson and Durham’s Beth Hepple with a game to play. • Lyon secured the Division 1 Féminine title for a record 16th time and 12th in a row. They sealed the title without dropping a point, scoring 98 goals and conceding five, a 7-0 win against Marseille pulling them out of reach of Paris St-Germain. Lyon face PSG in their final game before travelling to Kiev to play Wolfsburg in the Champions League final as they aim for another treble. • Atlético Madrid saw off Barcelona to retain their La Liga Iberdrola title by one point. Atlético beat Zaragoza 6-1 on the final day while Barcelona put five past Levante. Barcelona, having recruited hard, including Toni Duggan from Manchester City and the Euro 2017 winner Lieke Martens, were favourites to pip Atlético to top spot. Atleti have announced the signing of this season’s top scorer Charlyn Corral from Levante. • New Zealand Football and the NZ Professional Footballers’ Association have negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that gives the women’s national team equal pay, equal prize money, equal rights for image use and, crucially, travel parity when representing the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/20/jane-campion-unconventional-film-maker-macho-force","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Jane Campion: ‘Capitalism is such a macho force.

I felt run over’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Twenty-five years ago this month, Jane Campion became the first, and so far the only, female director to win the Cannes film festival, with her wild gothic tale of repression and obsession, The Piano. When Campion broke through and was recognised as an auteur by her male peers – with the Palme d’Or and three Oscars in her handbag – feminists assumed that more women artists would follow in her wake. They were wrong. There was no great bursting of the financial and cultural dam that held back women film-makers. Instead their work filtered through in drips, excluded from directing blockbusters, and excluded from competition at Cannes and other festivals. “I think we got caught in a complicated supplicancy, a very sophisticated supplicancy,” says Campion. But now, a quarter of a century later, Campion feels that time is up for supplicancy as the #MeToo movement reverberates in the film industry and beyond. “Right now, we’re in a really special moment. I’m so excited about it. It’s like the Berlin wall coming down, like the end of apartheid. I think we have lived in one of the more ferocious patriarchal periods of our time, the 80s, 90s and noughties. Capitalism is such a macho force. I felt run over.” Dipping croissants into coffee in Soho on a trip from her home in New Zealand to London, Campion seems the last person anyone would dare to run over, with her iron will, silver hair and ready laugh. But even after The Piano’s success, Campion’s journey was never easy, and her insistence on a stubbornly female gaze in her work did not translate into big box office returns. She made The Portrait of a Lady (1996) with Nicole Kidman, Holy Smoke (1999) with Kate Winslet, and In the Cut (2003), with Meg Ryan no longer playing the bubbly creature of romcoms but instead handcuffing a detective and having sex with him. That film is experiencing a renaissance; back then it was too much for the mainstream male critics. As Campion recently noted: “There’s this sort of mountain of corduroy you have to get through.” So after In the Cut she took a break to look after her daughter Alice Englert, and reappeared in 2009 with Bright Star, the poet Keats’s story from the point of view of his lover Fanny Brawne. It was not until the massive success of the two television series of Top of the Lake (2013 and 2017) that the world caught up with Campion’s point of view again. In 2017, Cannes premiered Top of the Lake: China Girl to acclaim. It was also the 70th anniversary of the festival and Campion joined all the male Palme d’Or-winners on stage. She was the lone woman. “I hadn’t ever really thought about the numbers of women and men that had won the Palme d’Or. I still really hadn’t taken it in. That was the most shocking thing I’d ever been involved in. If there had been no women it wouldn’t be an issue, but man after man came up. I thought, ‘Oh my God! What is going on?’” Money, was the answer. The female talent is there, but the financial backing is missing in film, less so now in television. “I guess at this age I expect to make Top of the Lake as I want it, without any concern for other people’s opinions and taste. I just do what I want, and weirdly people love it.” Many of the themes of Top of the Lake were hatched in The Piano. Wilderness; madness; colonial and immigrant stories, from the Maori community of New Zealand to Asian immigrants in Sydney; and above all, strange, bolshy women unbowed by life’s struggles. “Rewatching my films is like digging up buried bones,” says Campion, who is 64. Yet when she saw The Piano again recently (she laughs that she could only find a French dubbed version, but at least the heroine played by Holly Hunter is mute), “I really felt excited by it. I thought, my God, this is a film told from a female point of view and nowadays that’s still so rare. Even when a story appears to be from a female point of view, it’s often an apology for it.” The Piano is now a classic, unforgettable, with its powerful, surreal imagery, soul-scarring amputation scene, silent heroine, and above all, the erotic electricity played out note by note between Harvey Keitel and Hunter, seated at the carved rosewood piano in a hut deep in the bush. Each watching of the 1850s drama reveals more riches. There is the mute but emotionally devastating performance by Hunter as Ada McGrath, a Scotswoman sent like baggage with her piano to New Zealand to marry a man she has never met. Hunter and Anna Paquin – who plays her young daughter – both won Academy awards, as did Campion’s screenplay. The musical score from Michael Nyman often takes the place of dialogue and the cinematography from Stuart Dryburgh shifts from the epic to the intimate. In writing and directing, Campion set herself a series of challenges: a wordless protagonist, a hostile landscape, a colonial conundrum; and then allowed the film to burst out of its own carefully constructed corset. The image of a piano stranded with a woman and child on a volcanic beach beneath glowering cliffs epitomised Ada’s predicament in an isolated Maori and British community in the bush. But the necessary interior nature of Ada’s world, only allowed an outlet through music, sign language and facial expressions revealing contempt or wilfulness, subverts the male-controlled world. Sam Neill plays her husband Alisdair Stewart, who is silently outmanoeuvred by Ada, until his frustration turns to violence. Eventually, the axe falls, but until then, “Ada was experiencing things for herself in her own body and she could close the patriarchy out,” says Campion. “It was really strong for me to see that, and also the intimacy, sexuality and sensuality from a more female point of view.” Surprisingly for the time, when Keitel’s Baines is eventually given permission by Ada to freely make love to her, his first move is to kneel down and disappear beneath her crinoline, favouring her pleasure over his own. The power is also shown to be literally in Ada’s hands; she strokes her husband’s naked buttocks with the caresses she also lavishes on the piano keys, but refuses to allow him to touch her in return. Stewart is humiliated. As Campion notes, “This is a very sexual story, and to see him overwhelmed and unable to control what’s happening … that’s quite sexy.” Campion’s taste for wild passion in the wilderness was partly inculcated by the Brontës when she was growing up in Wellington, New Zealand, the daughter of theatrical parents. “I always loved Emily Brontë’s imagination. I feel like she saved my life, in the sense of giving me powerful female stories. To have that model for how a woman and an artist could be was very involving to me.” Speaking of Wuthering Heights, Campion noted Catherine’s strength. “She was not pliant. She was firm of mind and conviction.” For the director, Heathcliff “was a dark metaphor for sexual drive, and Emily had a sexual drive, obviously, and she rode it like a horse.” Campion roars with laughter. “My psyche understood that at a time when it wasn’t being much explored in literature and film.” Sealing these moments on screen, often more with pictures than words, is one of Campion’s great skills. “The most powerful experiences we have as humans are a combination of psyche, love and erotica, which can really lock you in an extraordinarily powerful way to experiences beyond what you know and beyond what you can control,” says Campion. “If you look back at those moments, they are often powerful awakenings, way beyond your comfort zone. There’s a sort of calling against decorum, against what’s best.” She has always championed the unconventional, from her first feature Sweetie (1989), a punkish and ultimately devastating family drama about two sisters, one of whom is mentally troubled. Her second film, An Angel at my Table (1990), was a three-hour television biography of writer Janet Frame, which was so cinematic that it was given a theatrical release. Campion was also fearless about tackling a film with a large cast of Maori actors, and while a few of The Piano’s scenes border on embarrassing in retrospect, she made the effort to find a Maori film director and advisers to work with her. “I had an easier time because I had been out of the country for a long time, so I was desensitised to this feeling that a white person couldn’t have a Maori character. I thought that was crazy when there was a chance for different roles.” There were complexities: some of the Maori actors did not speak their native language. “They felt shame about it, but they learned it. What they really found offensive was the pidgin English we had written, so we changed that and the problem went away. They wanted to work with me – they don’t like people charging in and creating ‘blackgrounds’.” While The Piano has become a landmark of Antipodean cinema, it was in fact financed by a French company, encouraged to take a punt on Campion by the Cannes film scout Pierre Rissient, who died earlier this month just before this interview. “I’m a little bit subdued today because of Pierre,” says Campion. “He brought all my films to Cannes.” Rissient discovered her film Peel, which won best short in 1986. Thanks to Rissient’s championing, The Piano was made and edited while Campion was pregnant with her first child by her husband Colin Englert (second unit director on the film). She flew out to Cannes in May 1993 to the premiere, but she was unable to stay until the end of the festival to pick up her Palme d’Or. “I had to fly back before I couldn’t fly. I was there for the screening but it wasn’t really a good time because my blood pressure was shooting up, with interviews and managing the pregnancy. So I was back in Sydney and I heard that we’d won, which was amazing. Then really shortly after I found out my baby was seriously in trouble – born alive, and died at 11 days. That was the worst time of my life. I really didn’t enjoy any of the success. It almost felt like ‘at the cost of’, weirdly.” Campion still wears her scars painfully close to the surface. “For that time, it felt like that. I did six months of suffering and grieving intensely.” Then she got pregnant with Alice, who now stars in Top of the Lake. Campion says the loss of her son, Jasper, changed her forever. “I am incredibly grateful for having that whole experience of that baby that did not live, because it put me in touch with that kind of suffering. It just changed my perspective forever. When you’ve had a death like that you become part of a club you never leave, and because of the love you feel for them, you never resent it.” The experience resonates in her more recent work in Top of the Lake, in which Robin (Elisabeth Moss) reveals that in the past she was raped and gave the baby away for adoption. She searches for her lost child, and other stories feature surrogacy, miscarriages and loss. “This whole area of female experience is so unknown, but it’s like the equivalent of going to war, except no one makes movies about it,” says Campion. But everyone is making television about it, from Big Little Lies to The Handmaid’s Tale, and Campion’s favoured actresses, Nicole Kidman and Moss, seem to be everywhere. “Hero stories are wearing thin. We have lived a male life, we have lived within the patriarchy. It’s something else to take ownership of your own story.” Ever the iconoclast, Campion is going against the trend by writing her first male lead in her new (untitled) film. “Because at last I feel I can.” The Piano is re-released in cinemas on 15 June and on DVD, Blu-ray and download on 16 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/14/margot-kidder-superman-movie-lois-lane-dies-aged-69","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T19:34:57Z","webTitle":"Margot Kidder, Superman's Lois Lane, dies aged 69","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/margot-kidder-superman-movie-lois-lane-dies-aged-69","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/14/margot-kidder-superman-movie-lois-lane-dies-aged-69","fields":{"headline":"Margot Kidder, Superman's Lois Lane, dies aged 69","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Margot Kidder, whose best known role was as reporter Lois Lane in the 1978 Superman movie has died aged 69. The Franzen Davies funeral home in Montana confirmed her death on Sunday. Kidder was born in Canada in 1948, and broke into film acting in the late 60s. Her first significant role was in the Gene Wilder comedy Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx in 1970. Brian DePalma cast her as conjoined twins in the cult horror Sisters (1973) before she graduated to a major Hollywood production opposite Robert Redford in The Great Waldo Pepper in 1975. After she was cast as Lane by director Richard Donner opposite newcomer Christopher Reeve in the long-gestating Superman adaptation, in what was then considered a groundbreaking treatment of a comic book material, Superman became a massive hit and its studio Warner Bros’ biggest earner at that point. She would appear in three sequels: 1980’s Superman II (filmed at the same time, though with Donner replaced by Richard Lester), Superman III (1983) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) – though her roles in the latter two were little more than cameos. After the success of the first Superman movie, Kidder gained the lead role in another cult classic, The Amityville Horror, supposedly based on the real-life paranormal experiences of the Lutz family and their possessed house. Kidder worked steadily through the 1980s, though issues with bipolar disorder resulted in a tumultuous personal life and a highly publicised breakdown in 1996 in which she disappeared for four days. She subsequently turned to social and political activism, becoming an organiser for the Progressive Democrats of America and writing numerous articles for left-leaning publications.

I used to think that I was already, basically, a vegan. I share their outlook on animal rights and the environment; I just happen to eat a lot of meat and cheese. I figured the meat and cheese wasn’t core to my identity, and I could easily fix it. That must be annoying for vegans: I’m sure they know we all think that. Having tried it, I realise now how hard it would be. I had a huge hand, too, with a week of supplies from Nosh Detox – soups, smoothies, bean salads laced with the tastiest non-animal protein they could find, including a truly spooky dish of cabbage and tofu whose colouring was like the moon. I also had a gigantic, five-kilo tub of pickled vegetables, because I always do, though it turns out I only like them on top of cheese. But the real problem came with all the food I had to source and prepare myself. It’s much harder than simply going into Pret and rejecting everything with duck in it. In a processed environment, whenever you get halfway near something that looks OK, it turns out someone has put feta in it. I spent hours in Holland &amp; Barrett, choosing between roasted peanuts and chana mix (hard chickpeas). I was constantly at checkouts, Googling stupid things (“Is yoghurt vegan?”; “What’s in bombay mix?”). Many restaurants have one vegan thing on the menu, but almost none have two, so anywhere you go regularly, you’ll have had their butternut squash and quinoa salad many times, and soon you’ll be ploughing into it gracelessly and without relish, because you know all its secrets – and also the relish contains fish sauce. It would have been OK if I’d been prepared to be hungry, or at least not full, but I wasn’t: so I was constantly having to order chips as a chaser, and buy veggie Percy Pigs as a stopgap (until I realised they contain beeswax). Even though it had more pulses in it, this was probably my least healthy week since a period of mad appetite in adolescence when I used to stop and get a Marathon bar at every shop between school and my house. God, the vigilance! I’d get through 48 hours of smoothies, mung beans and chips, only to absent-mindedly add milk to my tea. So in short: no weight loss, no glowing skin, no improved digestion, no surge of energy, only improved ethical status. I now realise I should have planned the transition better; restocked my entire cupboard, lined up vegan snacks for between meals, postponed all the plans that revolved around food (which is most of them) and maybe been a bit more attentive to the habits of the vegans I know, beyond making them a beetroot in puff pastry every six months since for ever. Done sloppily, veganism is Gillian McKeith’s worst nightmare – beige crunchy food that’s all the same and made of potato. Yet I cannot write off the possibility that it’s good for you if you do it right. I’ll be back, vegans. I’ll bring more respect next time.

That’s 25 for every person in the country, the highest numbers since the first world war. One article predicted that in 2020 there would be more trees in England than in 1086, when 15% of the country was cloaked in woodland. Part of the reason for this buoyant outlook was the country’s response to the great storm of 1987. We mourned for our ancient yews and the beeches of Chanctonbury Ring. Petitions were drafted, many thousands of saplings were planted. We rebuilt our woods with solemn and impassioned dedication. The predictions will not fall short. Across the UK, the number of trees has sharply increased. In 2015 there were 3bn trees, the equivalent of 47, a sizeable copse, for every person, around twice as many as in 2001. These statistics might evoke a bosky eden where the wild wood is reclaiming the land, yet recent years have also seen a return of large-scale felling, with Network Rail’s plans to cut down millions more trees the latest example. Network Rail’s view of trees is understandable. Leaves on the line can cause trains to overshoot stations, and branches and entire trees falling on to tracks cause delay or halt journeys. Between March 2016 and March 2017, 233 trains collided with fallen trees. The effect on customers cost the company hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation per year. But it is unlikely that Network Rail or Sheffield council – which has felled around 6,000 trees as part of a project to “improve the condition of the streets” of the city – have considered the impact on humans caused by the removal of so much verdure. Research shows that time spent among trees causes levels of the stress hormone cortisol to decrease, lowers blood pressure, increases the number of active natural killer cells, so boosting immune function – and improves mood and concentration. In Japan, shinrin-yoku, or “forest bathing”, is a widespread approach to improving physical and mental health. Many of these beneficial effects are delivered by both phytoncides – volatile oils released by plants and trees to fend off infection – and by contact with beneficial soil bacteria. Peer-reviewed research shows that spending time among trees has favourable effects on several of our body systems, but there is evidence that simply seeing trees can confer beneficial neuronal and physiological changes. Patients recovering from surgery have shorter post-operative stays and need fewer potent analgesics if their room has a window overlooking trees. The incidence and severity of mental health conditions is increasing in the UK, and elements of our environment that can benefit mental health are more important than ever. What a pity there will be fewer green vistas as a consequence of trackside felling. Pollarding is a tree-pruning technique that can prevent individual specimens from outgrowing their allotted space or obstructing electric wires and streetlights in an urban setting. Many of the trees felled in Sheffield were mature limes, a species particularly suited to pollarding. This approach would temporarily diminish leaf cover in the streets, but in the longer term would conserve habitats for birds and insects and ensure that the mental health benefits of trees could be maintained. Meanwhile, traditional hedgelaying or coppicing techniques could be applied to several deciduous species that skirt rail tracks. If hedgelaying techniques had been deployed before the nesting season began in February, birds would still have been able to raise their young in the areas of trackside where felling has taken place. If even a small proportion of the felled lineside timber was left in situ it would create a habitat for wood-boring insects, which in turn would provide food for birds. The response to the Network Rail leak was swift. On Friday, Bromley council issued tree preservation orders to protect stands of mature ash, sycamore and oak specimens growing along the main lines in that borough; the rail minister, Jo Johnson, called a halt to felling to prevent more nests being harmed during the breeding season, and ordered a review. We are a sylvan nation, enchanted by trees; they instil awe and wonder in us, and this biophilia confers an intense urge to be near them. Half a million people attended marches or signed petitions against the privatisation of 258,000 hectares of publicly owned woodland in 2011: within months the government withdrew its plans. The outcry against these latest tree-felling plans shows something similar. Our nation’s need for woodland and green spaces has never been greater. It transcends partisan considerations and the quest for profit. It is perhaps our biochemical and corporeal connection with trees, the subconscious knowledge that they bring balm to body and mind, that fuels such protests. There are more sensitive ways to use chainsaws that would permit the preservation of both urban specimens and the green vistas viewed from trains. Keeping these trees in place would benefit humans as well as ecological systems. • Emma Mitchell is a naturalist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/may/14/margot-kidder-death-superman-lois-lane-defied-convention","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T22:18:36Z","webTitle":"Margot Kidder: the Hollywood star who defied convention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/margot-kidder-death-superman-lois-lane-defied-convention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/14/margot-kidder-death-superman-lois-lane-defied-convention","fields":{"headline":"Margot Kidder: the Hollywood star who defied convention","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Margot Kidder, who has died aged 69, will be remembered best for one defining performance. It’s her sterling and witty turn as Lois Lane in the Christopher Reeve-led Superman movies of the late 70s and early 80s, in which she was every inch Clark Kent’s equal in wit and moxie, if not in Kryptonite superpowers – and which set the standard for any other actor playing the role since. If one neglects to dig more deeply into her fascinating life, then column inches will also be dominated by a bout of depression in 1996, when she was found wandering confusedly in a Los Angeles backyard after a four-day disappearance, having lost the caps of her teeth after an apparent rape attempt. She immediately sought treatment for her bipolar disorder and by her own account, in 2016, she never endured another episode. But in an earlier incarnation, Kidder, an itinerant blue-collar Canadian kid born in remote and frigid Yellowknife to an engineer father and a schoolteacher mother, was there at the dawn of the era of the Hollywood movie brats in the early 1970s. It was at her infamous beach house north of Malibu – shared with fellow actor Jennifer Salt – that a number of crucial meetings occurred between some of the figures, mostly male, who remade Hollywood film-making in their own movie-crazy image during what is now known as the Hollywood Renaissance. There it was, in a cloud of pot smoke that later segued into a blizzard of cocaine, that Brian De Palma met Steven Spielberg, where Martin Scorsese met Paul Schrader, and where on any given day one might spy Scorsese sitting fully-clothed on the beach watching macho man John Milius surfing the waves alongside the skinny-dipping Kidder, Salt and Janet Margolin, as Spielberg repeatedly refused all offers of joints and coke straws. It was, as Spielberg later related to Peter Biskind in Easy Riders and Raging Bulls, “a little bit of Woodstock on Nicholas Beach Road”. If Salt was its calm center, then Kidder was its wild child, hilariously witty and smart as a whip. “There was a Frances Farmer quality about her,” wrote Biskind, “and she struck her friends as not altogether stable.” Their neighbors were the Didion-Dunnes along the beach, Blythe Danner and Bruce Paltrow, and Michael and Julia Phillips, who would later produce landmark movies for Scorsese (Taxi Driver) and Spielberg (Close Encounters of the Third Kind). There one might bump into, alongside the movie-geek insurgents of the coming revolution, figures like actors Bruce Dern, Jill Clayburgh, Peter Boyle and Richard Dreyfuss, writer-directors Walter Hill and John Landis, actor-producer Tony Bill and a rotating cast of pushers, producers and aspirant screenwriters. This was before they attained Oscars and honors and entered the Hollywood pantheon, when Spielberg was still an overgrown teenager who could barely dress himself, Scorsese was bloated by the cortisone he took for his asthma, Schrader was still a confused misogynist, De Palma was still plausible as a studly cocksman counting the notches on his bedpost, and Milius was still the over-the-top blowhard-surfer-raconteur he remains to this day. Kidder’s moment in the sun began on Christmas 1971, when De Palma left the scripts for Sisters and The Phantom of the Paradise gift-wrapped under the Christmas tree for Kidder and Salt to read. The pair were both cast in Sisters. Kidder played conjoined twins, one of whom is given to murderous rages. Hitherto Kidder had played small roles in TV shows like Janacek and Harry O, and in forgotten movies like Quackser Fortune has a Cousin in the Bronx. Thereafter she became one of the more interesting and accomplished actors of the era, always with an enlivening dose of comic expertise. Her Lois Lane was straight-up screwball-comedienne gold dust, sweet-sour, quick-witted and sharp-tongued, reliable in a crunch and, with her arched eyebrows and odd beauty, the idol of every teenage comic book fan who laid eyes on her. Her career choices were impulsive and not conducive to a lasting career at the top. She had starring roles in The Reincarnation of Peter Proud and The Great Waldo Pepper, and worked twice with writer-director Paul Mazursky. Later in life she admitted to Advocate magazine in 2008: “I’m not choosy at all. I’m the biggest whore on the block,” and she remained busy in small TV parts and guest roles (including alongside Reeve in two episodes of Smallville). She was always frank about the quality of the movies she made, calling one of her biggest hits, The Amityville Horror, “a piece of shit”. Her most interesting roles seem to be in movies that are vanishingly obscure or almost forgotten, including 92 in the Shade and the Terrence Malick-scripted The Gravy Train, with Stacy Keach and Frederick Forrest. But as she grew older she spent less time on the screen and more time living. As she once said: “Acting’s fun, but life’s more important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/14/norway-style-option-after-brexit-cant-be-considered-corbyn-tells-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T06:40:13Z","webTitle":"Norway-style Brexit option can't be considered, Corbyn tells MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/14/norway-style-option-after-brexit-cant-be-considered-corbyn-tells-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/14/norway-style-option-after-brexit-cant-be-considered-corbyn-tells-mps","fields":{"headline":"Norway-style Brexit option can't be considered, Corbyn tells MPs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has told Labour MPs that a Norway-style option cannot be considered by the party, but faces a party split after rebel Lords passed an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill which would keep membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) as an option. Speaking at a private meeting of MPs in parliament, Corbyn told them there were significant issues with the Norway-option, which could leave Britain as “rule taker” without influence at EU level. He emphasised the need to unite both leave and remain supporters, according to a senior Labour source. EEA membership, often described as the Norway option gives countries full access to the EU’s internal market, allowing it to trade goods with EU states without customs fees, except food and drinks which are subsidised by the EU. Iceland and Liechtenstein are also members of the EEA, but the terms mean accepting freedom of movement and, as a non-EU state, the UK would have to accept EU regulations with no seat at the table in Brussels. MP John Mann warned that Labour would lose seats like his in Bassetlaw if it was perceived that the party had “watered down” its Brexit position. Other Labour MPs also cautioned against any option which would mean retaining free movement. Sources said MPs warned colleagues that consideration of an EEA option would leave Labour vulnerable not just with leave voters, but the large percentage of remain voters who also wanted changes to free movement. Others at the meeting made passionate speeches in favour of keeping an open mind about a Norway-style option. One source said Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit select committee, said Corbyn should not take options off the table. Several Labour MPs in the room said Corbyn had not been definitive in his opposition to EEA membership, and did not categorically rule it out, but Mann said the strength of feeling in the room from other speakers against the option had “killed it off”. “It was more than half the people that spoke, it was quite a significant moment in my view,” Mann said. “It was people who have not spoken out before, from areas like mine. They have never voted in favour of Brexit before, they voted remain.” A senior Labour source said whipping arrangements for the EEA amendment passed by the Lords had not been discussed for when the EU withdrawal bill returned to parliament, but said Corbyn had made his opposition to a Norway-style deal. “Jeremy made clear that from our point of view, we have set out our priorities for the Brexit negotiations, including negotiating a new customs union with the EU with Britain having a day in trade details, and a new and strong relationship with the single market, retaining the benefits ... we’ve set that out since the beginning,” the source said. “The EEA packages that are currently in existence do not meet the needs and priorities that we’ve set out and the Norway option is not appropriate and will not work for the kind of Brexit we want to see.” Separately, Labour sources said MP Wes Streeting challenged Corbyn in the meeting about the party’s local government election result in Barnet, where Labour failed to take the council amid accusations of antisemitism in the party. A Labour source said Corbyn “does think antisemitism played a role in the Barnet election result ... Jeremy made clear as he set out in public statements, he is determined to eradicate anti-semitism in the party and will not tolerate it”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/17/beautiful-dream-the-beirut-lgbt-centre-offering-an-oasis-of-tolerance","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"Everyone is welcome: the only gay hangout in the Arab world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/beautiful-dream-the-beirut-lgbt-centre-offering-an-oasis-of-tolerance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/17/beautiful-dream-the-beirut-lgbt-centre-offering-an-oasis-of-tolerance","fields":{"headline":"Everyone is welcome: the only gay hangout in the Arab world","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood of Beirut, Helem, the first community centre for LGBTQI+ people in the Arab world, opens its doors every day from midday to evening. Everyone is welcome. Inside, in a study bathed by the afternoon sunshine, Wael Hussein, a 24-year-old gay man, is chatting with Naya, a transgender woman, ahead of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOTB) on Thursday. Behind the two is a bookcase filled with donated titles, including Les Amantes by French lesbian writer Jocelyne François. “This is my other home, I consider people here as my family,” says Wael. “Many come to find friends – outside, they find it difficult to be accepted.” Compared with other countries in the Middle East, such as Iran where homosexuality is punishable by death, Lebanon has a relatively thriving LGBT community. During a recent dinner at Em Nazih, a trendy cafe in Beirut’s Gemmayze district, stereos blared the indie rock band Mashrou’ Leila, whose frontman is Muslim and openly gay. But life is not without its hazards. On Wednesday Hadi Damien, the organiser of Beirut Pride, the only event of its kind in the Arab world, announced the festival had been suspended after authorities interrogated him and threatened him with prosecution. A roster of events that would have featured poetry readings, a storytelling night and a talk on sexual health had been cancelled, he said. For those still facing discrimination, obstruction, and even violence, Helem is a lifeline. “I’ve been coming here for a year now. I’m alone and I come here to talk to people,” says Suzy, a 41-year-old trans woman with a bruised left eye sitting on the organisation’s balcony. “Two weeks ago, I was in the disco. Two people riding on a motorbike stopped and punched me in the eye, stole my bag, money and my phone.” Wael joined Helem (which means “dream” in Arabic) two and half years ago as a volunteer before becoming one of only three paid staff seven months ago. He is a case worker, dealing mainly with those who have fallen foul of Lebanon’s infamous article 534, which criminalises “unnatural sexual acts”. In his bag he now carries a mobile phone that serves as a 24-hour emergency hotline. But the work is not all about crises. Wael also runs makeup workshops. “Some people have just found out about their gender identity, and they are intrigued to use makeup to intensify it, like trans women,” he says. “It makes me smile. When they see themselves in the mirror, their eyes start shining and what they can see in the mirror, they feel this person looks much more like the way they see themselves.” Helem was set up as an underground movement nearly 20 years ago and, despite never having received official registration by the authorities, has clung to life. The authorities neither rejected nor approved the request, said Genwa Samhat, Helem’s executive director, in a sign that meant “‘we won’t reject you but we will make your work really hard that you’d eventually stop’. But on the contrary we just kept on working.” Since then Helem’s reputation has spread beyond Lebanon throughout the Arab world and several similar organisations have been set up, including the NGO Shams in Tunisia, fighting for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Afsaneh Rigot of British human rights group Article 19 said Helem was “an important and necessary LGBTQ oasis in the Middle East and North Africa region” and “a refuge for some of the most marginalised people in Lebanon”. But progress has not been straightforward. When Samhat, 31, joined four years ago, the organisation was almost moribund. Her arrival coincided with a Lebanese security forces raid on a local bathhouse, the Hammam al-Agha, which resulted in the arrests of 36 people. “When I joined, it was a trial to see if things would work again or not. Helem had lost its community centre, its offices, all of its funds. It had zero dollars in its bank account,” says Samhat. “It felt impossible at one point to get this going again, but with the Hammam Agha raid it was my first incident with such an arrest file … and it was a major push to try to do something about it.” Most of the people rounded up in the raid were sent to the Hbeish detention centre, and Helem’s ensuing work highlighted torture there. Such physical mistreatment appears now to have stopped. Today, at least 17 people are detained in Hbeish, mostly transgender people. “Trans people face the most discrimination – they’re visible,” Samhat said. “They were mostly arresting trans women who never ever got the opportunity to find a job, who were kicked out of their family houses, they were homeless for a long period of time, who actually dropped out of school because they were bullied at some point. We believe in personal freedoms and if people choose to be sex workers, it’s their right and we will defend them, but we do have to realise a lot of people do it out of survival reasons.” Naya, 21, heads Helem’s seven-member trans committee and says it is serving as an umbrella that makes people like her “feel stronger and let us make things we couldn’t do before – like offering hormones”. The organisation also provides more essential help. Aside from the study, there are places to sleep, a bathroom and a kitchen with basic appliances – a fridge, a gas stove and a washing machine. Its sister organisation, the sexual health clinic Marsa, provides free HIV tests, and charges $100 (£74) for comprehensive screening including for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Nearly 260 people visit Marsa each month – of whom two or three on average test positive for HIV. “A lot of people don’t seek medical assistance, because they can’t tell doctors [about their sexual orientation]. If they look effeminate, they’d get humiliated, kicked out of hospital,” says Diana Abou Abbas, 36, who runs Marsa. “Marsa is a safe place, free of judgment and discrimination, people can talk about their practices without worrying that they would be judged.” Back at Helem, Joseph Aoun, 33, is busy working on Helem’s campaigning week before IDAHOTB. He used to be the manager of Bardo, Beirut’s most famous gay bar, before joining Helem, an experience he says has opened his eyes to the discrimination faced by those from deprived social backgrounds. “It’s a constant struggle against the odds,” he says. “You have a lot of frustration but when you look back you see you’re impacting people’s lives and this is beautiful.” This year, IDAHOTB coincides with Ramadan, and Dana Darwish, a transgender lesbian, plans to go to Helem for iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily fast during the holy month. “Islam is the religion of peace,” said the 31-year-old. “Helem makes iftar every week and it’s a wonderful feeling that this year Ramadan falls on the same day as IDAHOTB.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/14/trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-real-madrid-cristiano-ronaldo-prospect","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T21:30:40Z","webTitle":"I would love to face Cristiano Ronaldo for real, says Trent Alexander-Arnold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/14/trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-real-madrid-cristiano-ronaldo-prospect","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/14/trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-real-madrid-cristiano-ronaldo-prospect","fields":{"headline":"I would love to face Cristiano Ronaldo for real, says Trent Alexander-Arnold","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Trent Alexander-Arnold has said it would be an honour to face Cristiano Ronaldo in the Champions League final having grown up watching him on YouTube but he says he is not overawed by the challenge against Real Madrid. Stopping Ronaldo and Madrid’s formidable attack on 26 May will be the final task of a highly impressive season with Liverpool for the right-back, who is also in Gareth Southgate’s thoughts for England’s World Cup squad. The 19-year-old, named Liverpool’s young player of the year at the club’s awards ceremony last week, admits the five‑times Champions League winner and the competition’s leading goalscorer will pose the biggest test of his career in Kiev. But he insists Ronaldo will not be Liverpool’s sole focus. “Real Madrid are a very strong team,” Alexander-Arnold said. “No matter who you’re going to play against it’s going to be one of the best players in the world because that’s the nature of the team they have. With Ronaldo being one of the greats, probably one of the best players ever, it’s going to be an honour to hopefully play against him. I’m looking forward to it. “I want to challenge myself and test myself against the best players in the world and there’s not many people better than Ronaldo. It will be a huge test for everyone and hopefully we come out on top.” Alexander-Arnold idolised Steven Gerrard as a young Liverpool fan while also admiring Lionel Messi and Ronaldo. “Not when he was playing for Man United, though,” he said of the Portugal international. “You have to admit he’s an unbelievable player and he’s done exceptional things in the game. The numbers that he does season in, season out are absolutely unbelievable. “I know a lot about him and the likes of Messi because I watched them on YouTube growing up. You always watch those type of players. But you’ve just got to focus on the game and, if he’s a direct opponent, you have to see what the strengths and weaknesses are and use them to your advantage. Come May 26, we’ll be looking to stop him and the rest of Real Madrid.” Alexander-Arnold has made 32 appearances for Jürgen Klopp’s team this season and finished the last of them, against Brighton on Sunday, by inviting a young Liverpool fan, Louis Henry, on the club’s lap of honour. The eight‑year‑old has cerebral palsy and was pushed around Anfield in his wheelchair by Alexander‑Arnold, whose mother delivered match tickets and players’ lounge passes to the Henry family the night before the game. The right-back will become the youngest player to appear in a European Cup final for Liverpool if he is selected in Kiev."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/14/trump-jerusalem-killing-palestinians-netanyahu","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T18:13:09Z","webTitle":"Trump threw a match into Jerusalem with no plan to put out the fire | Rachel Shabi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/trump-jerusalem-killing-palestinians-netanyahu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/trump-jerusalem-killing-palestinians-netanyahu","fields":{"headline":"Trump threw a match into Jerusalem with no plan to put out the fire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The images coming out of the region today said it all. In one frame there is the Israeli president, Benjamin Netanyahu, looking like the cat who got the cream, sitting next to Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, at the opening of the new US embassy, which has just relocated to Jerusalem. And in the second frame, there is Gaza, suffused in teargas smoke during protests in which 52 Palestinians were killed, and 1,200 wounded by Israeli fire. Perhaps reflecting on these images, the former US peace negotiator Martin Indyk bizarrely noted that the contrast was a “bittersweet moment”. But this is not the usual duality of experience on the eve of the day that is both the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Israeli state and the concurrent Palestinian nakba – by which some 700,000 people were either forced from or fled their homes in the war that led to Israel’s creation. This is a violent escalation that was foretold, the result of a deliberate upturning of international conventions. It is the US presidency striking a match and throwing it into the tinderbox of Jerusalem, half of which is deemed by the international community to be occupied by Israel and intended as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Amid widespread condemnation of both the US embassy move and Israel’s deadly, disproportionate response to unarmed protesters, rightwing agitators are already pushing their usual with-us-or-against-us binaries, suggesting such denunciations are by definition anti-Israel. Don’t fall for it. The Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem has issued a statement condemning Israel’s use of live ammunition in Gaza as showing “appalling indifference to human life”. Daniel Seidemann, founder of the Israeli NGO Terrestrial Jerusalem, had warned about the US embassy move that “there will be blood”, adding: “Utter hopelessness is the great destabiliser.” And Chemi Shalev, a senior columnist for Israel’s Haaretz newspaper, notes the “current bedrock of US-Israeli relations: fundamentalists, messianics and avid fans of end times” – referring to Trump’s evangelical Christian supporters who cheered the US embassy move, based on an Armageddon prophesy that does not end well for Jewish people. Netanyahu had long been asking the US to move its embassy and ditch the Iran nuclear deal. In the past week Trump has delivered both, decisions that have rocked an already volatile region. Yet these dangerous shifts are not the sign of a new US policy. Letting the grinding Israeli-Palestinian conflict drift on, even while Palestinians are suffering the everyday realities of occupation, would be bad enough, but no worse than the default international stance has been for some time. But with the embassy move, Trump has deployed that far-rightist trick of disruption for the sake of it. There is no follow-up, no renewed talks in the pipeline, no international diplomacy, just the usual, multipurpose mumblings from Trump about sealing a good deal. This is no Middle East policy, unless you count as policy the practice of being a fire-starter and appearing to sanction overwhelming Israeli violence. And as we are seeing today, it is those living in the region who will suffer the punishing consequences of his folly. • Rachel Shabi is an author and broadcaster"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/kirsty-wark-we-should-work-a-four-day-week-and-on-the-other-day-learn-another-skill","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"Kirsty Wark: ‘We should work a four-day week and on the other day learn another skill’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/kirsty-wark-we-should-work-a-four-day-week-and-on-the-other-day-learn-another-skill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/kirsty-wark-we-should-work-a-four-day-week-and-on-the-other-day-learn-another-skill","fields":{"headline":"Kirsty Wark: ‘We should work a four-day week and on the other day learn another skill’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I can tell I’m getting older (I’m 63), because I can’t see without my glasses.

When kids have sex education at school, it’s never discussed. No one says there will be a cycle in your life when you’re no longer fertile and you will get symptoms such as joint pain and forgetfulness. I was on HRT. I’m not on it now, but I’m about to start taking it again. Sleep is the biggest problem for me. There’s nothing wrong with HRT, but quite often doctors will put women on antidepressants. So many women I’ve met have been offered them for no good reason. They’re fine if you’re struggling with depression, of course, but they are not for the menopause. We should try and teach our daughters that they can do whatever they want. Though it’s very difficult for kids these days to figure out what they’re going to do.

The casualties were described as banana farmers by local inhabitants, and appear to have been shot while trying to flee the site of the operation, which officials say targeted commanders of the al-Shabaab extremist group. Somali intelligence officials say three men detained in the raid on a village in the Lower Shabelle region were senior militants. Mohamed Sheikh Mohamud, a farmer in the village of Ma’alinka, 37 miles south of Mogadishu, told the Guardian the operation started at about 1am last Thursday when “forces came down from a helicopter and started shooting the people in the farm”. Mohamud said he knew the five men killed. Two were tractor drivers at a banana farm, and three were cattle farmers. Anisa Abdullahi, a mortuary attendant who inspected the bodies when they were brought into the Medina hospital in Mogadishu the day after the raid, said four of the men died from fatal bullet wounds to the back and one was killed by a wound to the chest. “After checking, we found all died because of gun shots. The type of the weapon is one type, as the wound holes have similar sizes,” Anisa Abdullahi told the Guardian. There are no accounts of any sustained resistance to the special forces during the raid. Four Somali security officials and a senior officer with the Amisom regional force based in Mogadishu said they did not believe any weapons had been seized during the operation. A second resident in the area said he just left the farm when he heard the first shot. “It was past midnight and all was peaceful when the shooting began. Nobody fired at them as the people there were not armed. They shot the victims from close range and killed them,” said Hassan Muhidin, a farmer. An account in the Daily Beast said that at least one villager fired a number of shots at the special forces in the belief that they were from a rival clan milita before being wounded and throwing his AK-47 away. The US has ramped up military efforts against al-Shabaab, the deadliest Islamic extremist group in sub-Saharan Africa, under the Trump administration. The exact role of the US forces during the raid last week is unclear. There are several hundred US troops in Somalia whose primary role is to enhance the local military’s ability to fight al-Shabaab, which is affiliated to al-Qaida. Ali Mohamed Moalin, a traditional elder close to where the alleged raid took place on Wednesday night, told the AFP news agency that “two military helicopters” were involved, as well as “some foreign special forces”. A spokesman for Somalia’s internal security ministry, Abdiasis Ali Mohamed (better known as Abdiasis Hildhiban), confirmed the raid saying troops “including Somali government forces and their friends raided an enemy target … and killed al-Shabaab members.” US troops routinely accompany their Somali charges on operations. One special forces soldier was killed during a raid on a village last year, the first US soldier to die in Somali since the 1993 Black Hawk Down debacle. A spokesperson for the US defence department’s Africa Command said that “US forces, in an advise-and-assist capacity, partnered in a Somali-led operation to disrupt and degrade al-Shabaab’s terrorist network near Bulcida, Somalia, on 9 May.” Earlier this year the Guardian revealed that dozens of civilians have been killed and wounded in Somalia as airstrikes assisted or executed by the US against Islamist militants have increased to unprecedented levels. Many raids and airstrikes occur in remote locations and al-Shabaab have a long history of exaggerating civilian casualties. But US forces frequently struggle to identify targets in a complex and dynamic environment. Hassan Abdi Jim’ale, an elder from Ma’alinka, claimed “the Americans” were responsible for Thursday’s shooting. “They do not kill al-Shabaab. They only kill civilians.” he said. A statement from Africom said the reports alleging civilian casualties were being taken seriously. “As with any allegations of civilian casualties we receive, US Africa Command will review any information it has about the incident, including any relevant information provided by third parties. If the information supporting the allegation is determined to be credible, Africom will determine the next appropriate step,” the statement read. “The Department of Defense is fully committed to countering the threat of global terrorism, and will continue to support capable partners in the region.” A series of offensives has failed to dislodge al-Shabaab from its strongholds. Intelligence documents, transcripts of interrogations with recent defectors and interviews with inhabitants of areas in the swath of central and southern Somalia controlled by al-Shabaab have shone a light on the severity of its harsh rule – but also revealed significant support in some areas. The group has put to death dozens of “criminals”, inflicted brutal punishments on gay people, conducted forced marriages, and used civilian populations as human shields. Earlier this month a woman was stoned to death after being convicted of bigamy and adultery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/mexico-education-reform-controversy-presidential-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T08:46:28Z","webTitle":"Mexico’s education reforms flounder as more spent on PR than teacher training","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/mexico-education-reform-controversy-presidential-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/mexico-education-reform-controversy-presidential-election","fields":{"headline":"Mexico’s education reforms flounder as more spent on PR than teacher training","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was a flagship policy of Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto: an ambitious reform programme that would revolutionize the country’s education system, improve standards, tame an all-powerful teachers’ union and crack down on rampant corruption – such as wages for non-existent “ghost teachers”. Five years after it was launched, the plan has barely affected standards: Mexico still ranks last in education among the 35 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. And the ministry overseeing the reform has now been plunged into controversy after an investigation by the news website Animal Político revealed that last year, the public education secretariat (SEP) spent more money on communications than on teacher training. A separate exposé in the newspaper Reforma found the SEP spent nearly 2,700% more on communications last year than was budgeted – even as rural schoolhouses were commonly left without roofs, electricity or water connections. “This undermines the credibility of the reform,” said Marco Fernández, a professor in the school of government at Tecnológico de Monterrey. Fernández added that the SEP did not spend what was budgeted last year for teacher development, but has exceeded its communications budget by a factor of 10 between 2013 and 2017. The controversy has once again implicated the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in a scandal at a time when educational reform has become an electoral issue before the presidential vote on 1 July. The current frontrunner Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised to kill the reform as he seeks to secure the support of teachers – important election organisers in rural Mexico where schools are often used as polling stations. Former education minister and the current PRI campaign manager Aurelio Nuño defended the spending on communications, telling MVS Radio: “We launched a successful communication campaign that allowed [people] to better understand this great transformation.” He added: “The education of Mexico’s children and young people is one of the main fights of this election.” López Obrador has promised to increase public education spending, provide more stipends to students and introduce school lunch programs. He also said any future education policy would be made with input from teachers. A poll published Monday in the newspaper El Financiero showed López Obrador receiving 46% support, 20 points over second place candidate Ricardo Anaya of a left-right coalition. Only 20% of respondents opted for PRI candidate José Antonio Meade. Politics and education are intertwined in Mexico, where teachers were sent after the revolution to provide a state presence in remote rural areas and counter the influence of the Catholic church. Just before the education reform was introduced in 2013, Elba Ester Gordillo, the powerful boss of the teachers’ union, was arrested on corruption charges, but she was released to house arrest in December – on the day the PRI forged an electoral alliance with a small party previously controlled by Gordillo and her union."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/14/grenfell-rally-demands-urgent-removal-of-flammable-cladding","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T17:48:40Z","webTitle":"Grenfell rally demands urgent removal of flammable cladding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/grenfell-rally-demands-urgent-removal-of-flammable-cladding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/grenfell-rally-demands-urgent-removal-of-flammable-cladding","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell rally demands urgent removal of flammable cladding","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have urged ministers to urgently strip flammable cladding from hundreds of tower blocks across the country, saying it is unacceptable that people still live in homes wrapped in materials similar to those that burned so fiercely on 14 June 2017. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died in the blaze, and Natasha Elcock, who escaped from the 11th floor, made the demand at a rally in Parliament Square attended by people who escaped the blaze and the families of victims. “They should ban the cladding full stop,” said Mussilhy. “We still have death traps out there in London. Let’s make those changes now and give people the assurance they are safe in their homes. Sprinklers need to be added and the cladding removed.” Elcock said: “We don’t want the people who died a year ago to have died in vain. There are also people still living in blocks with this cladding. We want to ensure that people in social housing don’t get treated like we did.” There are 306 residential blocks more than 18 metres in height that are clad in aluminium composite panels similar to those at Grenfell and that have failed government fire tests. The cladding remains in place on 54 social housing blocks and dozens more private apartment towers across England. The cost of replacement has been put as high as £1bn. The government has said it is the responsibility of landlords to replace failed cladding, but it is keeping this position under review. Many blocks remain untouched because of legal disputes between freeholders and leaseholders over who should pay. The government has ordered a review of building regulations from Dame Judith Hackitt, who is expected to report back this week. There is widespread concern at Westminster and among survivors that Hackitt will not recommend a ban on the use of combustible cladding and will say materials of “limited combustibility” should still be allowed to be used. A public inquiry into the Grenfell blaze is due to begin next week. Survivors successfully lobbied Theresa May to widen the inquiry panel to examine the broader reasons behind the disaster. Monday’s rally showcased continued distrust of the authorities among some in the Grenfell community. Speakers described officials as “aliens” and “androids”, and the crowd chanted: “No justice! No peace!” In the Commons, MPs debated proposed measures to increase community confidence in the public inquiry. Many voiced concern that parliament and government had already lost the confidence of the Grenfell residents. David Lammy, who lost two friends in the fire, said 72 households from Grenfell were still living in hotel rooms and 64 remained in temporary accommodation. Referring to the survivors’ campaign for an inquiry panel, he said: “I regret that people who are in grief and in so much pain have had to organise and campaign to ensure their voices have been heard. “Theresa May talks about burning injustices, but this injustice burned. I remind the government of the words of Neville Lawrence [the father of Stephen Lawrence] in 2012: ‘The loss itself combined with the lack of justice means I have not been able to rest all this time.’” Kwasi Kwarteng, the Conservative MP for Spelthorne, said his party had to do more than “give the impression” it cared about the people affected by Grenfell. Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yarley, said: “I ask the government to be a parent to these people. We have failed in the past to stop people feeling like they are a bother. There is a class issue where people feel they recognise hierarchy and can’t speak up. We have to make sure we never act supreme over these people.” Her speech was greeted by a round applause from the public gallery, which was filled with survivors of the blaze. • This article was corrected on 17 May 2018 because the original gave Jess Phillips’ surname as Philips and her constituency as Yardley Wood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/may/14/exercise-is-good-for-you-unless-its-part-of-your-job","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T22:30:40Z","webTitle":"Manual labour linked to greater risk of early death, study suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/14/exercise-is-good-for-you-unless-its-part-of-your-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/14/exercise-is-good-for-you-unless-its-part-of-your-job","fields":{"headline":"Manual labour linked to greater risk of early death, study suggests","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Men who work as labourers or in other physically demanding roles have a greater risk of dying early than those with more sedentary jobs, researchers say. The finding, from scientists in the Netherlands, reveals an apparent “physical activity paradox” where exercise can be harmful at work but beneficial to health when performed in leisure time. Pieter Coenen, a public health researcher at VU University medical centre in Amsterdam, said the reason for the disparity is unclear, but he believes it may reflect the different types of exercise people get at work compared with those in their free time. “While we know leisure-time physical activity is good for you, we found that occupational physical activity has an 18% increased risk of early mortality for men,” Coenen said. “These men are dying earlier than those who are not physically active in their occupation.” Other researchers say the finding may simply reflect a greater likelihood for people in manual labouring jobs to have unhealthier lifestyles in which diet, smoking and alcohol consumption all conspire to reduce life expectancy. But Coenen believes other factors are at play. “If you go out for a run for half an hour in your leisure time,” he said, “that increases your heart rate and you feel well afterwards, but when you are physically active at work, it’s a very different type of activity. You are working for eight hours a day and have limited rest periods. You are lifting, doing repetitive movements, and manual handling. “Our hypothesis is that these kinds of activities actually strain your cardiovascular system rather than help you to improve the fitness of your cardiovascular system.” International public health guidelines encourage people to spend half an hour a day on moderate to intense physical activity to keep healthy, but previous research has shown that those who work in construction and other physically demanding jobs are the least likely to exercise in their leisure time. “They are in double trouble,” said Coenen. “They don’t benefit from the good aspects of leisure-time activity, and they are exposed to the risk of occupational physical activity.” To investigate the effects of exercise on health, the scientists combined the results from 17 published studies, giving them data on nearly 200,000 people. Most of the studies they included took lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol intake, into account, but Coenen concedes that not all of the studies completely ruled out their harmful effects. In light of the findings, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Coenen believes more should be done to encourage people in manual work to follow the standard guidelines on exercise, and not be fooled into thinking that they got enough at work. “Even if you are physically active at work, that doesn’t mean you don’t have to be physically active in your leisure time,” he said. Mark Hamer, who studies exercise as medicine at Loughborough University, believes the findings can be explained by manual and office workers having very different lifestyles. He points to a study last year of half a million people in China that found physical activity had health benefits whether it was at work or in leisure time. “The message I would give is that people should try to follow the physical activity guidelines regardless of what they do for a job,” Hamer said. “And people should be thinking about their lifestyles more generally, because that is likely to be at the root of this.” • The headline and standfirst on this article was amended on 24 May 2018 to more accurately reflect the findings of the study."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/14/the-guardian-view-on-gaza-shootings-stop-killing-unarmed-civilians","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T17:28:51Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Gaza shootings: stop killing unarmed civilians | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/the-guardian-view-on-gaza-shootings-stop-killing-unarmed-civilians","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/the-guardian-view-on-gaza-shootings-stop-killing-unarmed-civilians","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Gaza shootings: stop killing unarmed civilians","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is inexcusable for soldiers of a military, especially those under democratic civilian control, to shoot and kill protesters, almost all of whom were unarmed, and who pose no credible threat. Yet at the boundary between Gaza and Israel today Israeli soldiers seem to have done just that. It should make Israelis quail that demonstrators were sprayed with live ammunition with apparent impunity. There were dozens of deaths and hundreds of maimings among the Palestinians who had marched to the border to make a point about their right to return to their ancestral homes. Israel’s army evinced no shame in committing what looks like a war crime. These are serious accusations. Yet they were greeted with little more than a shrug. By blockading Gaza, Israel imprisoned 2 million people behind barbed wire and military towers. Israel treated the violence as a jailer might a prison riot: a tragic fault of the inmates. This is a dangerous mindset for Israelis to embrace. Yet they have done so because the extreme right in Israel, and most of the present government ministers, nurture the idea that Israel can, through its vastly superior military force, end the national aspirations of the Palestinians. These politicians take succour from US president Donald Trump, who has made good on his promise to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Today Mr Trump’s ambassador, who gave money to Jewish far-right groups in Israel, opened his nation’s new embassy in Jerusalem. This is a reckless and provocative step that will harm the prospects for peace. Like the issue of refugees, settlements and borders, the status of Jerusalem is unfinished business. No state is internationally recognised as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Its status was meant to be determined through negotiations. In siding with Israel Mr Trump signalled the end of any pretence that his administration might be an honest broker in the conflict. Any peace talks overseen by Mr Trump’s team are likely to fail before they begin. The US president will learn what happens when the facts he has created on the ground collide with reality. What will happen to the 300,000 Palestinians living in east Jerusalem? Are they all to be herded into enclaves and deprived of their human rights, their land confiscated? Will this be done because of the “truth, peace and justice” that Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel believed in as he welcomed the US ambassador to Jerusalem? Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu have galvanised a people who had been steeped in despair. In taking Jerusalem off the table, the only inviolable demand Palestinians feel they have left is the right of return. Palestinians see the flight or expulsion of refugees at the time of the creation of Israel 70 years ago this week as their catastrophe or nakba. Israelis retort that implementation of the right of return is incompatible with the survival of a democratic Jewish majority state. The issue is now on the lips of every Palestinian. The conflict in the Holy Land is not a zero-sum game, where there is just one winner. The opposite is more likely to be true. Either both will fail – and continue with one civilian population humiliating and terrorising the other. Or they find a way to live side by side in two states, one that affords each people their own independence and security. If happily such an outcome was achieved, it would make sense for west Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel and east Jerusalem to be the Palestinian capital. This is obvious to everyone but Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu, who instead have capitulated to a vision of brutal domination over a benighted people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/15/uk-police-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-failure","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T23:01:42Z","webTitle":"UK police use of facial recognition technology a failure, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/15/uk-police-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-failure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/15/uk-police-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-failure","fields":{"headline":"UK police use of facial recognition technology a failure, says report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police attempts to use cameras linked to databases to recognise people from their face are failing, with the wrong person picked out nine times out 10, a report claims. The report from Big Brother Watch, published on Tuesday, warns that facial recognition technology turns innocent British citizens into “walking ID cards”. It says the technology, whereby computer databases of faces are linked to CCTV and other cameras, was used by the Metropolitan police to spot people on a mental health watch list at the 2017 Remembrance Sunday event in London. It was also used by South Wales police at protests against an arms fair. Police plan to use it at music festivals and other events. Some in policing see facial recognition as the next big leap in law enforcement, akin to the revolution brought about by advances in DNA analysis. Privacy campaigners see it as the next big battleground for civil liberties, as the state effectively asks for a degree of privacy to be surrendered in return for a promise of greater security. But for now the Big Brother Watch report says the benefits are missing, because the technology does not work. The Met used facial recognition at the 2017 Notting Hill carnival, where the system was wrong 98% of the time, falsely telling officers on 102 occasions it had spotted a suspect. The technology failed to pick out any suspects during the Met’s trial at the previous carnival. South Wales police have been given £2.1m by the Home Office to test the technology, but so far it gets it wrong 91% of the time. It was used at at a festival to celebrate Elvis, a Kasbian concert in Cardiff, a royal visit by Prince Harry and a Liam Gallagher concert, among other deployments. On 31 occasions police followed up the system saying it had spotted people of concern, only to find they had in fact stopped innocent people and the identifications were false. In its report, Big Brother Watch says: “Automated facial recognition cameras are biometric identification checkpoints that risk making members of the public walking ID cards. “It is plainly disproportionate to deploy a technology by which the face of every passerby is analysed, mapped and their identity checked.” The report says US research shows the technology is particularly inaccurate identifying minority ethnic women. It is extremely unlikely that police attempts to harness the power of facial recognition will cease as officers believe the benefits are potentially massive. The ability, as police see it, to track suspects anywhere there is a camera, offers a big leap in crime fighting ability from finding vulnerable people or missing persons, to hunting terrorism suspects or keeping track of one-time suspects for whom there are not the resources to keep under surveillance by officers. The big opportunities come about because of two technological changes being married up – the big increase in computer power and increase in quality of CCTV, with high-definition cameras decreasing in price and increasing in coverage. Silkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch, said: “Real-time facial recognition is a dangerously authoritarian surveillance tool that could fundamentally change policing in the UK. Members of the public could be tracked, located and identified – or misidentified – everywhere they go. “We’re seeing ordinary people being asked to produce ID to prove their innocence as police are wrongly identifying thousands of innocent citizens as criminals. “It is deeply disturbing and undemocratic that police are using a technology that is almost entirely inaccurate, that they have no legal power for and that poses a major risk to our freedoms. “This has wasted millions in public money and the cost to our civil liberties is too high. It must be dropped.” Ch Con Mike Barton, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for crime operations, said: “Facial recognition technology has the potential to help us disrupt crime networks and identify people who pose a threat to the public. A number of forces are conducting trials and working with legal experts to better understand how it could be deployed. “The public would expect the police to consider all new technologies that could make them safer. Any wider rollout of this technology must be based on evidence showing it to be effective with sufficient safeguards and oversight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/14/uk-russian-mi5-putin-moscow","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T17:20:36Z","webTitle":"The UK’s obsession with the Russian bogeyman doesn’t stack up | Mary Dejevsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/uk-russian-mi5-putin-moscow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/uk-russian-mi5-putin-moscow","fields":{"headline":"The UK’s obsession with the Russian bogeyman doesn’t stack up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Today’s speech by the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, has been presented as a first – the first time the head of the UK’s domestic intelligence service has delivered a speech abroad, specifically at a conference of security heads in Berlin. But this is the only respect in which it is a first. It might as accurately be described as the latest in a series of public utterances by UK intelligence chiefs and top brass, which began last autumn and continued with the head of GCHQ addressing a cybersecurity conference in Manchester last month. In part, this reflects a deliberate decision by the intelligence services and the government that they should be more open about what they do, with a view to gaining greater public understanding – and expanding recruitment at a time when they face competition for tech-savvy graduates from richer and less restrictive employers. But this season of intelligence and military speeches has also facilitated the communication of an apparently co-ordinated message. As a country, the UK now sees Russia as its prime adversary. The poisoning of Sergei Skripal, the former Russian spy, and his daughter in Salisbury took the UK’s official anti-Russia stance to new heights. And its diplomatic success in persuading so many other countries to expel Russian diplomats in protest – the biggest ever “collective expulsion of security agents”, we were told – seems to have emboldened London to view itself as the potential leader of an international anti-Russia front, as the Guardian recently reported. The invective produced by Parker today – and heavily sold to the media – was, in its way, extraordinary. In tone, it was quite different from the cold war register, which was formal and, well, cold. This attack was populist, direct, and far outside the diplomatic register. Here is just a sample. The Kremlin was engaging in “deliberate, targeted, malign activity intended to undermine our free, open and democratic societies”. The west had to “shine a light through the fog of lies, half-truths and obfuscation that pours out of their propaganda machine”. Russia, he said caustically, had as one of its “central and entirely admirable aims to build Russian greatness on the world stage”. But it had repeatedly chosen “to pursue that aim through aggressive and pernicious actions by its military and intelligence services”. In so doing, it risked becoming “a more isolated pariah”. Now, it is hard to know what to make of all this, other than to point out that he was speaking to fellow security chiefs. Maybe, among themselves, they find it more morale-boosting to demonise an old enemy than to take on adversaries that have emerged more recently, are more complicated and against which they have so far perhaps had less success. There is a sense too, for the UK at least, that relations with Russia have been so bad for so long that magnifying the supposed Russia threat is a cost-free enterprise in diplomatic terms. It might also be worth considering whether there are budgetary and Brexit angles. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US and the UK, in particular, scaled back their government-backed research on Russia and lost a great deal of expertise, which they are now trying to rebuild. That means they have to make a case for more taxpayers’ money, and scare tactics are one way to do that. For the UK, there may also be the fear that it will find the European Union less inclined to keep London in the intelligence loop, and – at a time when the US is looking a far less reliable ally – it might make sense to play up the Russian bogeyman, not least as Vladimir Putin begins his fourth term in office. Nothing like starting as you intend to go on. Yet it is still difficult to see the sense in this. Russia has become inured to UK scolding of this kind, and treats it with contempt – as its social media response to Parker’s speech shows. What is more, so long as the UK maintains its silence on the Skripals’ fate and refuses consular access to Yulia Skripal, Russia can – with some justification, I would argue – ask just who has a monopoly on a “fog of lies”. Nor will the tone necessarily chime well with official views of Russia in Germany and France, which are not necessarily less tough in practice, but certainly more nuanced, and better informed. The UK seems intent – despite recent legislation about dubious money in London – in keeping its diplomatic and business relations with Russia in separate boxes. Germany, for one, does not have that luxury. The UK’s rhetorical onslaught on Russia is even more puzzling when you examine the security services’ own priorities. “Is terrorism the biggest threat facing the UK?” visitors to the MI5 website are asked in a pop-up called “fact or fiction”. Click no, and this is the response: “The biggest threat we currently face comes from international terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them. Terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland also continue to pose a serious threat.” Now it is true that the threat from terrorism and Islamic State was also broached by Parker in his speech, but this was not the section spun in advance to the media; it was not the aspect MI5 wanted above all to be noticed. So the conclusion has to be that Russia is considered a “safe”, useful, and almost eternal enemy by the UK’s powers-that-be. Some of us may hope for something better, but it seems a long way away. • Mary Dejevsky is a former foreign correspondent in Moscow"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/14/gareth-southgate-england-week-off-before-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T21:30:39Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate gives England players week off before World Cup preparations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/14/gareth-southgate-england-week-off-before-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/14/gareth-southgate-england-week-off-before-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate gives England players week off before World Cup preparations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate will have his full squad available for only one pre‑World Cup friendly, against Costa Rica in Leeds on 7 June, with the England manager determined his players should have a week off after the domestic season. Southgate submitted a 35-man provisional squad to Fifa on Monday and will make public his 23-man party for the finals on Wednesday. No major surprises are anticipated with Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who played in the November internationals and has recovered from an ankle problem to impress at Crystal Palace, and the uncapped Trent Alexander-Arnold likely to feature. Newcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey is not expected to be involved. Southgate decided this year that his players should be allowed to go on holiday before the World Cup, a switch in policy from his predecessor, Roy Hodgson, who had requested clubs release members of his squad for a pre‑Euro 2016 training camp on the conclusion of the Premier League season. Players were asked to hand over their passports two years ago to demonstrate their commitment with Hodgson wary some had returned unfit after being permitted to go on family breaks before preparations began for previous tournaments. Those not involved in the FA Cup or Champions League finals have been allowed to take this week off before gathering at St George’s Park on Monday. The contingent from Chelsea and Manchester United will be granted next week off and Liverpool’s Champions League finalists will not be expected to link up until 4 June, missing the Wembley send‑off against Nigeria and ensuring Southgate will have his full complement of players available only for the game against Costa Rica. The decision to grant time off has been welcomed. “A week is the perfect time,” said Harry Kane, who has departed with his family for the Bahamas. “You stay in shape and look forward to meeting up and training hard and getting ready for the friendlies. It’s not enough time to lose a lot of fitness but it’s a good time to refresh mentally. “I’ll spend a bit of time on the beach with the family, chill and I will do a bit in the gym, not too much, and when we meet up we have got plenty of time until the World Cup to get into top shape. “We go through a lot in the season, with your clubs and countries, so you have got to switch off, maybe for me stay away from everything, leave the phone indoors and just chill and spend time with loved ones.” The Football Association will also honour individual players’ fitness and recovery programmes with England departing for St Petersburg on 12 June. The staggered nature of the returns will mean Phil Jones, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford and Ashley Young join up on 28 May. It remains to be seen whether Gary Cahill’s late burst of form at Chelsea will earn him a recall but the former vice-captain and Everton’s Michael Keane are far from certain of their inclusion given Southgate may select Jones, John Stones and Harry Maguire as centre-backs, with Kyle Walker and Eric Dier also capable of playing there. Alexander-Arnold trained with the senior England setup while at St George’s Park with the Under-21s this year and could be picked even with the news positive on Kieran Trippier’s knee injury. Liverpool’s Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain and Joe Gomez have been ruled out through injury but Southgate has made checks on their club-mate Adam Lallana, whose campaign has been severely interrupted by thigh problems. The 30-year-old came off the bench for the last 16 minutes against Brighton on Sunday, his first involvement in six weeks, and he made a solitary league start all season. If selected, he could waive his week off and go straight into training with the squad once Liverpool have returned from Kiev. There had been calls for Shelvey, capped four times, to return to the fold for the first time since September 2015 after some impressive displays as Newcastle secured a top-half finish in the Premier League. Southgate is understood to be less inclined to pick the midfielder with doubts over the 26‑year‑old’s temperament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/14/introduce-mental-health-checks-for-new-mothers-experts-urge","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T17:22:03Z","webTitle":"Introduce mental health checks for new mothers, ministers told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/14/introduce-mental-health-checks-for-new-mothers-experts-urge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/14/introduce-mental-health-checks-for-new-mothers-experts-urge","fields":{"headline":"Introduce mental health checks for new mothers, ministers told","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"New mothers should receive a mental health checkup six weeks after giving birth to help tackle possible postnatal depression and other problems related to having a baby, ministers have been told. A cross-party group of 60 MPs and peers have written to Steve Brine, the minister for public health and primary care, demanding that all mothers in England have an assessment of their emotional and mental health carried out by a GP, practice nurse or health visitor. They say that making such checkups mandatory would reduce the damage experienced by women, children and families caused by mothers suffering psychological problems associated with pregnancy and birth, which often go undetected. About half of mothers in the UK develop a mental health problem of some sort during that time, such as postnatal depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and postpartum psychosis, according to the parenting charity NCT. The MPs and peers are lobbying for checks to become automatic as members of the all-party parliamentary group for prevention of adverse childhood experiences. It is jointly chaired by the Labour MP Dr Paul Williams, who is a GP, and Dr Alex Burghart, a Conservative MP who is a former teacher and former adviser to Theresa May in Downing Street. In their letter they tell Brine that there is “significant harm caused to mothers and children by low rates of diagnosis of maternal mental health problems. These unseen and untreated mental health conditions create great suffering for mothers. But, crucially, they also erode parents’ ability to create healthy bonding with and support for their children.” Babies and mothers are both meant to have their health assessed by a GP at the six-week postnatal check. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) recommends that both should happen. However, research last year by NCT found 42% of mothers said that their perinatal mental health problems were not picked up at those appointments. Many mothers miss out because while checking the baby’s health is a stipulation under the GP contract, doing the same for the woman is not, according to the MPs and peers. “As a result, mothers report that while baby checks are routinely carried out, the maternal check, including a discussion about the mother’s emotional and mental wellbeing, is often either not done at all or is done in a hurry at the end of the baby-check appointment,” the letter says. They are urging Brine to ensure that all mothers start to receive a checkup of their own health, at a separate appointment to their baby’s, also six weeks after the birth. Such checkups should include “open questioning about her mental health”. The scheme would cost about £20m a year to operate but would more than pay for itself because perinatal mental health problems cost an estimated £8bn, they say. “It’s profoundly unfair that some women get excellent care while others aren’t even asked about how they are feeling by health workers. I hope to persuade the government to commit to come fully around to our view that a universal six-week perinatal mental health check for all women needs to be written into all GPs’ contracts,” said Williams. The NCT backed the move. “It’s crucial that new mums’ mental health problems are picked up early and the six-week postnatal checkup is the ideal opportunity to do so. At the moment many mothers are suffering in silence and this can have a huge emotional impact on women, as well as devastating consequences for families,” said Abi Wood, the charity’s head of campaigns. Jackie Doyle-Price, the mental health minister, last week hinted in parliament that ministers were considering obliging GPs to conducts six-week checks on mothers’ mental health. Replying to a question by the Labour MP Jenny Chapman, she said: “Nice recommends postnatal checks for mothers and NHS England expects commissioners to undertake that those guidelines are being met. As for any further support by GPs, she will be aware that there is a renegotiation of the GP contract [starting in July] and it will be covered there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/14/pupil-poverty-proof-give-children-dignity-schools-teachers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T17:31:31Z","webTitle":"As a pupil, I was not ‘poverty-proof’.

At least give children their dignity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The most recent novel by the Nobel laureate JM Coetzee, The Schooldays of Jesus, begins with a couple fleeing the law after taking their child out of school because he hates the lessons and community so much. It’s an extreme example, but one millions will find it easy to empathise with. Fewer people than you might think seem to have truly enjoyed their formative education and, for those who did not, one theme in particular recurs: the breathtaking cruelty of children. Bullying leaves permanent psychological scarring and young people become adept at learning what hurts, verbally and psychologically. Looks, personality and status are all easy targets, and particularly difficult to change. It’s this knowledge that makes a recent initiative to “poverty-proof” schools in the north-east of England so brilliant. The toolkit proposes small changes in schools, such as banning designer pencil cases, and encourages teachers to think about how seemingly small things, such as asking children to report to their class what they did at the weekend, can mark out those living in poverty and further stigmatise youngsters. Jeremy Cripps, the chief executive of Children North East – the organisation behind the initiative – told BBC radio how the toolkit was formed. In each visited school they asked each child: “Is anyone poor in your school?” Each child knew precisely who was poor, and reported how they knew: differences in behaviour, clothing and social life were all very obvious indicators. Schools can do many things to mask this, but can also exacerbate the issue. Cripps told of one example, where a poor child who couldn’t afford ingredients for home economics lied and said they’d forgotten. The school supplied the ingredients, but the teacher tossed the finished dish into the bin as a punishment, while other children took theirs home. I almost wept at the injustice and the notion of a teacher, perhaps unwittingly, reinforcing to that child their worthlessness in a society obsessed with eliding social and financial capital and worth. These aren’t the lessons one would hope to see imparted. Growing up poor is precisely as demeaning as you’d expect, and while forgiving bullies is easy, reliving those experiences emotionally is deeply upsetting. Teachers couldn’t do anything about the fact I couldn’t invite friends to my house for dinner or host birthday parties. But they might have refrained from asking me every Monday to reply “free dinners” after my name on calling the register. All the while, my friends were marked out as different to me. And as they replied that they had brought in sandwiches or would be paying for their lunches, everyone could see that difference. They weren’t to blame, neither were the teachers. It was the system; a system designed by clever people for practicality without a shred of emotional intelligence. We even had a separate canteen till for children taking free school meals. We know better now. We should do better. Memories endure. In one of my secondary schools, the single kindest thing I remember was a teacher who quietly offered to wash the uniform of a friend who was being hounded by children saying he “stank”: his mother was unemployed and couldn’t always afford to take his clothes to the launderette. That single act stays with me in a way that textbook learning and blackboard teaching never could. Children brought up in poverty may never escape it. Some estimates say seven out of eight children stay trapped, and some of those shackles are psychological. According to Children North East, 28% of the region’s children live in poverty. The problem can feel insurmountable, but stopping children from feeling singled out for the crime of being poor is essential to combating this cycle. And everyone benefits. Cripps says they know that poverty-proofing schools works because, where the practice has been applied, attendance has increased. That makes perfect sense to me. I was a horrendous truant, but I would have attended more regularly if I hadn’t felt so marked out, or had been able to afford school trips and the various expenses that enrich the school experience. The suggestions now being discussed are all incredibly straightforward. They need almost no money to implement; but still there are detractors. Why try to shield children from the reality of poverty when they will have to face the real world soon anyway, they say. But that’s to accept that trajectory as a given. We shouldn’t; we should be seeking the big solutions to change it. And while we are doing so, a little dignity for those involved can’t be too much to ask. • Dawn Foster is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/14/letter-tessa-jowell-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T15:48:38Z","webTitle":"Letter: Tessa Jowell obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/14/letter-tessa-jowell-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/14/letter-tessa-jowell-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Tessa Jowell obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tessa Jowell was a member of the Mental Health Act Commission set up in 1983 to safeguard the interests of patients formally detained in mental hospitals, which included visiting and monitoring their care.

As evidence of how much that year did not achieve there is very little being made of this half-centenary. If it had been a year that had shaped our futures there would have been a mass of academic reflection on its significance. Instead, what we have had this week is Joan Bakewell on BBC2 reminiscing about a year when she was a young television personality fronting Late Night Line-up, John Harris making a neat summary of what happened (Revolution in the air, Review, 12 May) and David Edgar challenging us to defend the legacy (The legacy of 1968 is under attack. We must defend it, 11 May). What legacy? Between 1968 and 1979 I was in a state of grief for the year in which every political hope it was possible to have was aroused and then dowsed within a few fleeting weeks. I waited for us to get back on track again before a decade of Thatcherism brought home to me that, at 20, I had deceived myself into believing that 1968 had represented the true path and not a brief if inspiring and elating deviation. David Evans Exeter • Everyone can feel that the world is crumbling and that another ‘68 might be on its way. It’s vital therefore not to indulge what happened then with a nostalgia for its desires, which were too often taken for reality. Or dismiss it as “froth” (as some did on the recent BBC Jeremy Vine show I was on). David Edgar suggests that I’m guilty of a different simplification: “From the British left, Anthony Barnett argues (in his Brexit book The Lure of Greatness) that 1968 led to a renewal not of socialism, but of capitalism.” Not so. I think the spirit and hopes of 1968 were defeated, which is quite different. My book’s first chapter opens by saluting 1968 as a year of revolution. 1968 was beaten by “the 60s”, to use shorthand. Yes, it was a decade of wonderful, emancipating energy. But Edgar can hardly deny that a renewed capitalism exploited this freedom to the hilt. Feminism, the greatest progressive achievement of that moment, was also a reaction against 68, its macho sexism, vanguard groups and indulgence of violence. We need some complexity here. But where he and I agree is that any politics of the left worth having must embrace a spirit of radicalism and connectedness, to breathe life into politics and free it from confinement in establishment routines. Anthony Barnett Botley, Oxfordshire • We’re delighted to hear that David Edgar is updating Maydays – a great play. Post-1968, for some of us, was a time of “small deeds communism”. We hoped change could be achieved via creating exemplary pockets of a better lifestyle inside the rubbery and unexpectedly resilient fabric of capitalism. The word “alternative” was heard in the land. It was a time of interregnum between that revolutionary, beautiful, but doomed spring and summer of ‘68 and the political amnesia instigated by Thatcher and continued by governments of both right and centre-left. Our contribution was to found an educational community in an abandoned terrace of railwaymen’s houses in the middle of the South Yorkshire moors. Lots of work and lots of fun! Going into the communal stewpot, along with the beans, was respect for the environment, organic farming, shared use of energy, transport and childcare, home-schooling, work and money sharing as well as concern for the individual psyche. It’s still there today, 44 years later, and thriving.

There are infinitely cheaper ways of reducing oneself to the state of angry, snarling, mouth-foaming maniac over the course of two hours, as anyone who has ever been put on hold by [insert pertinent energy/airline/mobile/insurance company name here] will readily testify. So on a fairly pointless final day of the league season that had about it an air of “School’s Out”, The Fiver’s c0ckles were warmed by almost unprecedented scenes at Huddersfield, where a Premier League football match was staged and almost every single person present seemed deliriously happy. Terriers fans were happy, because their club is staying in the Premier League, having pulled off the admittedly not-quite-as-impressive-when-you-look-at-it feat of not being as rubbish as Swansea, Stoke and West Brom. Arsenal fans were happy because they’re finally getting rid of Arsène Wenger, who in the course of 22 years at the club brought them unprecedented amounts of silverware, but whose most recent triumph at the club involved successfully zipping up his padded overcoat. Wenger was happy, because he would no longer have to contend with the abuse and cat-calls of various ingrates, many of whom have recently been tying themselves in knots in an effort to point out that wishing somebody well for the future having spent three years verbally abusing him in the nastiest possible terms does not make one a hypocrite. And finally, local light aircraft pilots were happy as there were so many planes trailing banners that the sky over the stadium resembled a scene from Dunkirk. In other unprecedented scenes, Wenger engaged in much unWengerlike behaviour: milking applause from all four sides of the ground, bowing with a flourish and gambolling across the pitch and down the tunnel, giving it a McCartney-esque two-thumbs aloft for the last time as Arsenal manager. “I should have announced every week I retire,” he said. “People are so nice since I said that. I think what will remain is the formidable human aspect of the last 22 years – that is special and I will cherish that. I had fantastic human experiences at the club, above the results, it was a human adventure.” On Sunday Wenger found himself drenched in the milk of universal human kindness. It was uncharacteristically warm, gloopy, civilised behaviour unbecoming of a football match and The Fiver didn’t like it.

FIVER LETTERS “Now that Ailsa from Home and Away has failed in the attempt to get two sides relegated from the Premier League in a single season, I think it’s only fair to turn attention towards Phil Brown’s achievements at an entirely different end of the spectrum. Kudos to him for stringing together a series of results to safely steer two clubs away from the play-offs. At Southend, he was sacked after a mid-season run of one win in 10; had we had the foresight to get rid just two games earlier then his successor, Chris Powell, would almost certainly have got the same squad into the League One top six. Dropping down a division, Phil was brought in by a Swindon side on the cusp of the play-offs but his two wins in 10 meant they avoided a highly stressful climax. Understandably, Phil has been rewarded by Swindon with a new contract so I guess he can relax in the sun this summer and reflect on two jobs [not] well done” – Bryan Matthews. “In these saddest of times for Stoke City, perhaps the management team can learn from a local 13-year-old, who felt a need and went shopping on the internet.

That’s how we imagine Mauricio Pochettino’s meeting with Daniel Levy will start, the Tottenham manager is apparently insistent he wants extra bunce or he’s going to load himself into the Do One cannon and fire himself somewhere less parsimonious. For some mysterious reason, it sounds like West Ham fans aren’t happy about being called “keyboard warriors and malcontents” by the club’s vice-chair. As such, its been suggested Karren Brady might want to give her Sun column the elbow. The season is over so the more important business of transfers can now commence and first off the rank is Pablo Maffeo, politely invited by Manchester City to journey in the direction of Stuttgart. Ailsa fancies sticking around at Southampton, but will they fancy that? “The club will make a quick decision one way or the other,” he parped. “If it involves me, I will be delighted but I was given a short-term contract to come and do a job and that’s what I’ve done.” The tension is entirely bearable. And Tranmere Rovers are back, baby. “We’ve suffered, people have lost their jobs and to get the club back into the league is an unbelievably proud moment for me,” cheered Micky Mellon after their preposterous win over Boreham Wood.

Sitting calmly in the wheels near the front of a large group full of big names, he waited until the finish line was 1.5km away. Then, with a quiet smoothness, he accelerated out of the bunch and simply glided away. Ahead lay only his team-mate Esteban Chaves, who had escaped with 25km to go. As he rode up to the Colombian, Yates knew he had done enough to put himself in the leader’s pink jersey. Crossing the line first would bring a bonus of 10 seconds, against six seconds for second place. With the end of the final stage in Rome still more than a fortnight away, those four seconds may turn out to be crucial. But then Yates did something remarkable. He dropped back half a bike’s length, watching his team-mate take the stage win. The gesture showed he respected Chaves’s great effort, demonstrated he is a team player and honoured the history and etiquette of his sport. At 25, he was showing a mature appreciation of the bigger picture. His second great moment came on Sunday, on another mountain. The Gran Sasso d’Italia dominates the Abruzzo region and again Yates found himself approaching the climax of an exhausting 225km stage in the company of the race’s big favourites. As the leading bunch surged towards the finish, Miguel Ángel López, Thibaud Pinot and Domenico Pozzovivo launched individual attacks but on the last long left-hand bend Yates simply rode around them, sailing clear with the aplomb he had shown three days earlier. By taking the bonus he increased his lead to 32 seconds over Chaves and 38 over Tom Dumoulin, the defending champion, with Chris Froome, who struggled over the line in 23rd place, now more than two minutes in arrears in the overall classification. You could only wonder what certain other British riders were thinking as they watched Yates take his win with a calmness that suggested it was he, rather than Froome, who had several grand tour wins under his belt. Eight years ago, Geraint Thomas, Ben Swift and Peter Kennaugh opted to join the new Team Sky programme, their hearts full of hope and ambition. Each is a talented racer and Thomas even held the yellow jersey for a few days at last year’s Tour de France. But he is 31, while Swift is 30 and Kennaugh 28. Thomas will support Froome at this year’s Tour while Swift is in his second season with UAE Abu Dhabi and Kennaugh his first with Bora-Hansgrohe. Yates, along with his twin brother, Adam, chose a different path. When their time to make a big call came five years ago, they opted to join an Australian team then called Orica-GreenEdge. The team are now known as Mitchelton-Scott and its sporting director, Matt White, has displayed the sort of confidence in the Yates brothers that Sky’s young riders, lining up to support first Bradley Wiggins and then Froome, or sidelined in favour of bigger names from Italy, Spain, Colombia and elsewhere, have never been granted. Born in Bury on 7 August, 1992, nine days after Chris Boardman had laid down a marker for British cycling by winning gold in Barcelona, the Yates brothers followed their father into track cycling and became part of the Olympic development programme in Manchester. When Adam was not invited to take the next step with a place in British Cycling’s academy, he moved to France and spent three years riding for amateur clubs alongside future stars such as Pinot and Warren Barguil. Simon did get an invitation, which he accepted. In 2013, wearing British Cycling’s colours, he won two stages of the Tour de l’Avenir, an important race for promising young riders, and a stage of the Tour of Britain, beating Wiggins and Nairo Quintana to a hilltop finish on Dartmoor. Then came their biggest decision, which for Simon involved rejecting an overture from Sky. It was like a young player from Chelsea’s academy joining Liverpool or Spurs in the belief he would get regular games. Money didn’t come into it, he said; he simply appreciated the programme the Australians were offering. It is a sign of the brothers’ shrewdness that, although they are close, they used different agents to negotiate their deals with the same team in case things did not work out for one of them. The past four seasons have been a story of careful development, with one notable blip when the team’s incorrect completion of a therapeutic use exemption form for an asthma inhaler during the 2016 Paris-Nice race brought Simon a four-month UCI ban for “non-intentional doping”. That year Adam won the white jersey for best young rider in the Tour de France, an achievement matched 12 months later by Simon. Now Simon is not just leading a grand tour but doing so with an air of utter confidence. Froome may yet discover his form before the 34km time trial that opens the race’s final week when the powerful Dumoulin represents an equal threat, but further huge mountain stages could give Yates the chance to make up for any time lost. With 2,000km still to cover before the race enters the gates of Rome, it’s a lot to ask. But if you’ve been watching him over the past few days, launching his attacks with lethal timing and a fluency that recalls the sport’s great stylists, you may not want to bet against the Giro celebrating its 101st edition with its first British winner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/may/15/these-tests-only-measure-a-little-bit-of-you-the-teachers-letters-that-go-viral","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T07:00:50Z","webTitle":"'These tests only measure a little bit of you' – the teachers' letters that go viral","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/15/these-tests-only-measure-a-little-bit-of-you-the-teachers-letters-that-go-viral","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/15/these-tests-only-measure-a-little-bit-of-you-the-teachers-letters-that-go-viral","fields":{"headline":"'These tests only measure a little bit of you' – the teachers' letters that go viral","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is a ritual almost as established as the exams themselves, but with the year 6 Sats tests for primary school pupils in England starting this week, it is also that time of year when encouraging notes and messages from schools and teachers get the opportunity to go viral on social media. This year, one of the notes to gain national attention has come from Micklands primary school’s headteacher, Mark Frost. In it, he tells pupils “Here is what you need to do over the weekend in order to be fully prepared for the tests.” The letter then goes on to list such activities as reading a book, playing on a computer or games console, playing board games, or watching films. The letter also encouraged pupils to “spend home time with your family and people you love” and advised that “the weather for the weekend looks good. Get yourself outside for a game of football, cricket or whatever sport you enjoy. Go for a walk or run, climb a tree; anything that will get your heart pumping a little. Remember that exercise lowers your stress levels, makes you feel happy and more alert.” The Sats, or national curriculum assessments as they are formally known, test pupils against key stages 1 and 2 of the national curriculum. The majority of pupils taking the tests are aged seven or 11. Another head, John Newport at Marden Bridge middle shool in Whitley Bay, sent pupils a letter last week stating: “Please remember, when you open your first test on Monday morning, a test is all it is. It will not define who you are, you are worth more and are better than that. You are a strong, resilient member of our community and people will think highly of you because of this and not because of how many questions you can answer. You can rest assured that because of the hard work you have put in you should feel confident with these tests. Please do not let them worry you.” The letters follow in the footsteps of texts that went viral in previous years. In 2017 Bishop Wood Church of England school in Tring sent a note from the headteacher, Linda Hardman, which reassured pupils that “the people who create these tests and score them do not know each of you the way that we do”. It went on to say: “They do not know that some of you speak two languages or that you love to sing or draw. They have not seen your natural talent for dancing or playing a musical instrument. They do not know that your friends can count on you to be there for them; that your laughter can brighten the darkest day or that your face turns red when you feel shy. They do not know that you participate in sports, wonder about the future or sometimes help your little brother or sister after school.” The precise format of this text seems to have first become popular in 2015, when a similar letter from Buckton Vale primary school was featured on ITV’s This Morning show and additionally tweeted by presenter Phillip Schofield. Some schools have helped children to prepare for this week’s tests by offering a free breakfast club during the week, to ensure children arrive on time and well fed for their exams – with some even promising the bonus of bacon sandwiches for breakfast on Friday. It isn’t just before the exams that encouraging words from a school can gain huge public recognition. Last year after the results came out, a kind letter sent out following the results of the tests was also widely shared. Sats tests have proved unpopular with many parents – and activist groups like Let Our Kids Be Kids have campaigned against them, and also encouraged parents to boycott the tests. As well as the pressure the exams put on pupils, critics are unhappy with the content of the tests, which focus on rigid interpretations of grammar and force pupils to use specific parts of speech in the English language. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), representing about 18,000 school leaders, has cautioned parents against this. Last month Julie McCulloch, ASCL’s interim director of policy, told Schools Week newspaper: “We would advise parents against withdrawing their children from key stage 2 tests” as they “help secondary schools know how much support they may need to give to a child”. The row over the exams has not stopped teachers doing their best to relax and encourage pupils before facing the tests. The letter sent to pupils this year at Micklands ends: “Remember that Sats do not test the following qualities: compassion, creativity, happiness, love, generosity, confidence, kindness, faith, bravery and many more things that are far more important in life than long division and adverbial phrases.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/15/sex-toys-redesigned-help-survivors-sexual-assault-healthy-sex-life-products-women-reclaim-bodies","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T05:00:50Z","webTitle":"How sex toys are being redesigned to help survivors of sexual assault","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/15/sex-toys-redesigned-help-survivors-sexual-assault-healthy-sex-life-products-women-reclaim-bodies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/15/sex-toys-redesigned-help-survivors-sexual-assault-healthy-sex-life-products-women-reclaim-bodies","fields":{"headline":"How sex toys are being redesigned to help survivors of sexual assault","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For many survivors of sexual assault, a happy sex life feels out of reach.

But some people are working to change that, and are reconfiguring and reappropriating sex toys as tools for healing. Last year, the Dutch designer Nienke Helder created a range of objects to help survivors reprogramme how they deal with physical sensations. Drawing on her own experience, she wanted to redress what she saw as the “clinical” approach to recovery currently employed. “The tools are an opportunity to explore your personal sexual recovery,” she says. Her collection, titled Sexual Healing, includes a horsehair brush to explore touch and tickling, a mirror designed to help you better view your vulva, as well as a pelvic device that vibrates when your muscles are too tense, and a bean-shaped sensor that lights up if you’re breathing too fast, to remind you to slow down and relax. “By getting biofeedback through the tools, you can visualise what kind of processes are happening inside your body, which can help you understand in which situations your body reacts with a reflex.” Although Helder’s designs are still prototypes (she hopes to get them manufactured and sold soon), there are places where survivors can go to find existing tools. Sh! Women’s Erotic Emporium in east London is a female-focused sex shop with an extensive education and outreach programme. It consults with the NHS to recommend products for women who have been through trauma. “Unfortunately, many health professionals are still not comfortable talking about sex,” says Renée Denyer, the shop’s manager and in-house sex educator. She is also a facilitator for Cafe V, part of My Body Back Project, a support group for women who have experienced sexual violence. “For survivors of sexual assault and rape, their body is taken away from them. But when women are ready to start thinking about sex, after they’ve had therapy and counselling, there is nowhere to go, so we made that space.” According to Denyer, using sex toys is a powerful way for survivors to reclaim their body. “Especially for those who experienced abuse from childhood, they very early on learned to tune out when any sort of sexual touch is happening,” she says. “Even later in life when they are with a chosen partner, they’ll dissociate because that’s what they’ve been conditioned to do. We work on trying to fix that.” Many of the recommended products focus on non-fleshy, non-phallic and non-penetrative tools, whilst also encouraging the use of things such as flavoured lube so survivors are not triggered by the smell of genitalia. But it seems that the most important thing is to grant women permission to explore sex again in a healthy way, in a safe environment and without the time or physical pressure that can come with having sex with a partner. Though there is still a long way to go to improve the recovery process, using a more sex-positive approach is bringing many survivors one step closer to a happy sex life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/14/spotmini-robotic-dog-sale-2019-former-google-boston-dynamics","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T11:31:42Z","webTitle":"SpotMini: headless robotic dog to go on sale in 2019","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/14/spotmini-robotic-dog-sale-2019-former-google-boston-dynamics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/14/spotmini-robotic-dog-sale-2019-former-google-boston-dynamics","fields":{"headline":"SpotMini: headless robotic dog to go on sale in 2019","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Former Google robotics outfit Boston Dynamics, famed for its advanced humanoid and canine automatons, has announced that it will begin sale of its headless robotic SpotMini next year. At a robotics conference in California, the company’s founder Marc Raibert announced that the slightly creepy SpotMini was currently in pre-production and scheduled for large-scale production and general availability from middle of 2019. The 30kg quadruped can operate up to 90 minutes between charges and is capable of being driven semi-autonomously, but also able to navigate fully autonomously using its series of cameras. “SpotMini’s development was motivated by thinking about something that could go in an office or accessible place for businesses purposes, or a home eventually,” said Raibert on stage at TC Sessions: Robotics at UC Berkeley. The robot’s main frame has a quick-disconnect battery, stereo cameras in the front, side cameras and a “butt cam”, but it can also be upgraded with a series of attachments on the top, including an articulated arm. Third-parties will be able to develop systems to mount to SpotMini for different applications, but Raibert said Boston Dynamics was working on a few systems itself. “We have a surveillance package where we have special low-light cameras mounted on the back, there’s a camera mounted in the arm, and the computer can take user code,” said Raibert. Wheeled security robots are already in the wild, with mixed results. Raibert thinks that wheeled platforms can only go so far and that legs are the answer to most human environments. “There are lots of applications for legs, such as going up the stairwells in skyscrapers checking for things that should be left there,” said Raibert. “We’re also looking at construction. Where as productivity in other areas has consistently gone up, in construction it’s almost flat – no technology has really been brought to bear to help. “The application is very much like the industrial security one, where you want to go around and use your sensors to see what’s going on, but here it’s in an environment that changes every day and the terrain is changing.” Raibert wouldn’t be drawn on price, but given that the company is looking at industrial applications first, it might be a while before consumers can readily buy or even afford a headless robotic dog of their own. Boston Dynamics’ owner SoftBank already sells a series of robots, of which the wheeled humanoid Pepper is the most recognisable. Pepper has been available in Japan since 2014, but was released in the UK in 2016 where it is mainly used as a office receptionist. Where Pepper presents as a benign presence, the more threatening frame of SpotMini could cause more of a stir when it is let loose into the office or construction environment.

The struggling childrenswear and maternity retailer said it was finalising a comprehensive restructuring and refinancing package to put the business on a stable and sustainable financial footing. “We are in the final stages of detailing these restructuring plans alongside new committed debt facilities, an underwritten equity issue and access to other sources of capital,” it said. The firm’s new chief executive, David Wood, who was parachuted into the job last month and previously ran US department store group Kmart, will provide further details on Thursday alongside the group’s full-year results. Mothercare issued a profit warning in January following disappointing sales over Christmas. It slashed its profit forecast to £1m to £5m for the year to the end of March. City analysts are expecting profits to crash to £1m from £19.7m last year. Mothercare shares fell by almost 10% to 18.09p in early trading on Monday as the company confirmed it would tap shareholders for cash. Like other household names on the high street, the company has been battling weak consumer spending and a shift to online shopping, as well as increasing competition in the toy and kidswear market. Toys R Us and Maplin are among the chains that have gone into administration, with the loss of thousands of jobs. Shoppers are deserting the high street in greater numbers than during the depths of the recession in 2009, the latest footfall figures from the British Retail Consortium and Springboard suggest. They tallied with a 2% drop in consumer spending last month, according to Visa’s consumer spending index, which has recorded declines in 11 of the past 12 months. Mothercare, which has an £80m hole in its pension pot, has been in discussions with its lenders, Barclays and HSBC, since March, when it revealed it was on course to breach the terms of its bank loans and needed extra cash to fund an overhaul of the business. The company is also expected to announce a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency used to close unprofitable stores and drive down rents, to speed up store closures. Mothercare started shutting stores four years ago and has reduced its UK portfolio from 220 to 137, with a target of 80-100 as sales move online. It is also refurbishing remaining outlets. Britain’s biggest carpet retailer Carpetright is also using a CVA to close 92 stores – with the potential loss of 300 jobs – and negotiate rent reductions of up to 50% with landlords."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/15/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds-weapons-grade-gags-subversive","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T03:00:45Z","webTitle":"Deadpool 2 review – struggles for subversion despite weapons-grade gags","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/15/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds-weapons-grade-gags-subversive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/15/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds-weapons-grade-gags-subversive","fields":{"headline":"Deadpool 2 review – struggles to be subversive despite weapons-grade gags","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Too soon? With Avengers: Infinity War still in cinemas, the world is hardly screaming out for another effects-laden saga of superheroes banding together to defeat a baddie played by Josh Brolin. But Deadpool is in a different league – or at least a different age rating. Where most superhero movies have gone family and broad, Deadpool went adult and rude, and revelled in the possibilities a UK 15 or US R rating opened up in terms of “strong bloody violence”, “strong language” and “crude depictions of sexual acts”, to quote the British Board of Film Classification. Not to mention a generation’s worth of pop-culture references only an older audience would appreciate. The gamble paid off handsomely: Deadpool became the second highest grossing R-rated movie in US history after The Passion of the Christ. And that audience will need little persuasion to return for the sequel – just the mention of a running gag about Barbra Streisand’s Yentl will probably be enough. But now that there’s a lot riding on it, this sequel is presented with a challenge: how to send up the genre without looking as if you are part of it? What made the first Deadpool, and saves this one, is the way they mix emotional sincerity in with the meta-movie wisecracking. The comedy comes from a place of pain, and Ryan Reynolds’ ability to flip between both registers so effortlessly is a superpower few actors possess. Thus, this second instalment begins with Reynolds’ Deadpool attempting to kill himself. Given his capacity for regeneration, he fails, of course. After a few hilariously gory fight scenes and another Bond-movie parody title sequence, it’s explained how it came to this: Deadpool has become tragically separated from his true love Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). His relationship with his “surrogate family”, the X-Men, also gets off to a bad start when they team up to confront a teenage mutant Kiwi firestarter named Russell – played by Julian Dennison, the kid from Hunt for the Wilderpeople. On the trail of Russell, for reasons initially unknown, is Brolin’s mean, tooled-up cyborg soldier Cable, who doesn’t need an Infinity Stone to travel back in time. “You’re so dark. Are you sure you’re not from the DC universe?” asks Deadpool. Snappy, self-aware, fourth-wall-breaking lines like that flow fast and rarely miss their targets in the ensuing adventure. The lines between good guys and bad guys are refreshingly blurred, and the movie is at its funniest when it genuinely subverts the formula – as with Deadpool’s ill-prepared attempt to assemble his own “X Force” superhero team. But there are still boxes to tick in terms of moral lessons about guilt, revenge and (stop me if you’ve heard this one before) “family”. Not to mention regular crash-bang action set pieces. The cartoonish excess is often gratifying, but even when a big CGI fight scene is prefaced with Reynolds saying, “big CGI fight scene coming up”, it is what it is. The movie’s other major weakness is its continued foregrounding of the white guys at the expense of the consciously inclusive cast around them. Only Brolin’s Cable gets anything resembling a fleshed-out character. Dennison gets some space to make an impression but he’s virtually reprising his Hunt for the Wilderpeople persona, and Deadpool’s bromance with Colossus is the most meaningful relationship in the movie. More problematic is Deadpool’s cool, new African American accomplice Domino, played by Atlanta’s Zazie Beetz (at one point he refers to her as “black black widow”). Her superpower is luck, which gets the plot out of many a corner, but doesn’t extend to the script giving her any decent lines. Baccarin is largely out of the picture, Brianna Hildebrand’s enjoyably snarky Negasonic Teenage Warhead is underused, and her new Japanese girlfriend’s sole personality trait seems to be having purple hair. Worst of all is Karan Soni’s taxi driver Dopinder, a weedy, emasculated Indian stereotype whose superhero aspirations make him the beta-male butt of the joke. Looks as if the writers haven’t got up to speed with The Simpsons’ Apu controversy. Such concerns might not bother Deadpool 2’s core audience too much, but they implicitly suggest that core audience is white and male, and that everybody else ought to just lighten up. It’s easy to do so, given Reynolds’ undiminished charm, and the generous flow of weapons-grade gags. But now that it’s no longer the underdog, Deadpool is in severe danger of punching down rather than up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
