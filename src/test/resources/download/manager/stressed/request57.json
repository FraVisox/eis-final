Though no narcissist, he hated the hair loss, and tried to reverse it with pills, then disguise it with an artful comb-over, before cropping the whole lot off. As he says, baldness is not a terminal disease but he thinks of it as “good preparation for ageing and death, the skeleton being the ultimate baldy”. Just as he grew to accept his baldness then, so now, at 80, he has come to accept that he won’t be around for ever. For most of us, such acceptance doesn’t come easy. Humankind cannot bear very much reality: don’t ask for whom the bell tolls and maybe it won’t. What Holloway acronymises as AAPD – the Anti-Ageing and Postponement of Death industry – has never been busier. Modern medicine prolongs life even when it no longer has quality or agency. The hucksters of cryogenics promise to bring us back even when we’ve gone: for $200,000, the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona will preserve your corpse at a temperature of -190C then thaw you out on resurrection day (for the cheaper neuro-only option at $80,000 they’ll freeze just your brain instead). Holloway is dismayed by all this. As a man deeply versed in religion (a former bishop of Edinburgh and head of the Scottish Episcopal Church), he’s familiar with notions of reincarnation and eternal life. But he thinks denial of death spiritually unhealthy. Even if our corpses did come back, suitably defrosted, what kind of reception would we get? Wouldn’t we be treated like freaks or illegal immigrants? And what about the social injustice of only the rich having the resources to outrun death? He doesn’t downplay the physical adversities of old age, but sees it as an opportunity for self-examination, for “a last shot at reality”. Looking back, he reproaches himself for inattentiveness, lack of curiosity and, above all, impatience: “Getting there was always the point for me – but where’s there?” Regrets, yes he has a few, but he doesn’t overdo the sackcloth and ashes. We have to play the cards we’re dealt; not everything that happens is in our control. Owning up to past mistakes is important but so is self-forgiveness. Gerard Manley Hopkins had it right: “My own heart let me more have pity on”. Hopkins is among the many poets from whom he quotes, along with WH Auden, Dylan Thomas and Louis MacNeice. Helen Dunmore would surely have been here, too, had there been time to include her last poems, which chime with Holloway’s argument: “I know I am dying / But why not keep flowering / as long as I can / From my cut stem?” And inevitably there is Larkin, with whose “Aubade” he takes issue, unable to comprehend why extinction should be terrifying: “We won’t be there to know we’re not there … so it can’t hurt.” Novels and paintings are also invoked. The book is enriched by its breadth of cultural reference. Biblical passages are quoted, too, as well as extracts from orations Holloway has given at funerals and weddings. But his tone is less priestly than agnostic – liberal and secular not fundamentalist. Nothing irks him more than religious certainty. “The Church is in danger of becoming a club for strict believers,” he says, a club with no room for doubt, nuance or “the wistful children of unbelief”. Parishioners for whom religion was once a source of spiritual comfort feel alienated by the stridency. Where faith leaders rant against moral decay, what he sees is a society that has, at best, become more tolerant and inclusive. Whatever his nostalgia for times past, he won’t allow himself any geriatric bitterness and resentment. The purpose of religion, as he defines it, isn’t to preach to the converted, or hector the fallen, but to wrestle with the mystery of existence. There won’t be conclusive answers, because the universe remains unfathomable; Unhintergehbarkeit – ungetbehindability – is its essence. But that doesn’t invalidate the struggle to make sense of how we began, why we’re here and what (if anything) happens next. Holloway is with Keats and his definition of negative capability, prepared to live with uncertainty without any irritable reaching after fact. The word “God” isn’t wholly absent from the book. But Holloway has seen too much suffering and cruelty to conjure a benign overseer. He recalls presiding over the funeral of a two-year-old boy and, after reading from the relevant section of The Book of Common Prayer (“Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live”), putting his arm round the grieving mother and saying he hoped that her pain would pass – to which she responded by shoving him off and shouting that she wanted to go on feeling her pain for ever. It was a lesson in how not to console – though when faced with an 11-year-old girl dying from leukaemia he didn’t hesitate to offer her the hope of a life beyond in the “eternal Here and Now”. Sometimes, as he says, “there is no room for truth”; what’s needed is wisdom and compassion. They are the qualities that shine through this little book. But there’s a fair bit of truth-telling, too.

Beamed on to the screen was my four-year-old son, hair sticking out and school jumper on back to front. As we checked the sound, I asked him what message he would like to send. Without hesitation he said: “Why do people have to throw rubbish in the sea and hurt marine creatures?” His worried little face, now filling the 2m-wide screen, stayed with me throughout the meeting (along with the hope that he’d turned his jumper round before going to school). His message was with me again as I watched distressing footage of thousands of dead starfish and other creatures washed up on the beaches of Kent and the east coast. Conservationists believe last week’s freezing weather was behind the mass die-off. Like many people, my son is really anxious about the damage we are doing to our seas. He still loves exploring rock pools, and watches Blue Planet episodes over and over again with his equally sea-loving grandad. But I’ve realised I need to work to instil in him some optimism to counter his anxiety. Fortunately, there are good reasons for hope. I remember a 2009 conference in Washington DC, where the marine scientist Sylvia Earle gave a keynote address about “hope spots” – her term for special places around the world where conservation work has particular ecological, cultural or community importance. In the decade since then, Earle and others have taken this message around the world, as part of a wider movement to promote the idea that it is not too late to act to protect our global marine ecosystems. The first Conservation Optimism Summit event was held in London last year, co-hosted by the Zoological Society of London, Oxford University and the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. There are some great stories about how good science, international co-operation and community engagement have saved species and habitats. In 1979, for example, there were less than 100 Rodrigues fruit bats left on the Indian Ocean island that gives them their name. Thanks to decades of conservation efforts, both locally and internationally through zoo-breeding programmes, there are now more than 20,000 in the wild. As they fly out from their forest homes at dusk to forage for fruit, they symbolise real hope for those who are working to save species on the edge. But conservation success isn’t just about saving rare creatures, or wonders of the world such as tigers and coral reefs; initiatives to improve people’s everyday interactions with nature can happen almost anywhere, and are vital in shaping a future in which people and nature can co-exist. Urban gardens can increase biodiversity; communities can resurrect forgotten traditions and indigenous knowledge to reconnect with their local environments; and teachers can inspire and influence the behaviour of entire generations. We need to face and understand environmental problems to be able to solve them, but despair alone doesn’t lead to positive outcomes. It is easy to become overwhelmed by the vastness of the task of reversing the alarming damage to so many aspects of the natural world. We need stories about people working together to make a difference to inspire our own small steps. Children are bombarded with stories of the ocean’s demise, whether it’s news about plastic pollution, or coral bleaching on BBC children’s programmes such as Octonauts. They need to know there are some happy endings. My son understands that if he doesn’t drop litter, and explains to his friends why this is important, their behaviour will directly benefit the marine nature reserve in the bay where we live. I recently attended a community screening of the film A Plastic Ocean. With a potent mix of horror and hope, the film shows the extent of the problem but also highlights what we can all do to help. We need to tell our children about the harm humans do, but also about where special habitats have been protected, and show how everyone can do something to help look after the oceans. • Fiona Gell is a marine conservation officer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/08/international-womens-day-six-trailblazing-women-youve-never-heard-of","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T10:01:28Z","webTitle":"'Believe in yourself, the rest will follow': five trailblazing women you've never heard of","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/08/international-womens-day-six-trailblazing-women-youve-never-heard-of","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/08/international-womens-day-six-trailblazing-women-youve-never-heard-of","fields":{"headline":"'Believe in yourself, the rest will follow': five trailblazing women you've never heard of","bodyText":"Angel Vendeline Namshali dresses in khaki with big, laced military boots on her feet. She is armed with nothing more than a walkie-talkie and torch, but the bush of Tanzania’s Serengeti is her second home. “The bush has many challenges for women,” she says. “But of course we can do it.” The daughter of a poor subsistence farmer, Namshali has established the only safari resort in the world run entirely by women. Last week, the camp climbed to second spot on TripAdvisor’s list of the best places to stay out of the 128 in the Serengeti. In a country where social norms dictate that women stay at home to care for their husbands and children, every one of her 22-strong team has overcome prejudices and resistance to work here at Tanzania’s Dunia camp. From the guides to the chefs to security, the women take enormous pride in their achievements at grinding such stereotypes into the dust. “It can be a real challenge here in Tanzania for women to join the tourism industry. Many owners of the big companies do not trust women. They think women cannot do much,” says Namshali. “Women do not get many opportunities. But if you give her a chance to work, she will do even better.” Namshali grew up in a mud hut in the Usambara mountains, the third of six children. Her family are from the Pare tribe, an ethnic group indigenous to the Kilimanjaro region of northern Tanzania. Namshali juggled her schoolwork with her duties of collecting the family’s firewood and water, always conscious of her father’s struggle to pay the school fees. Sometimes her mother would trade bags of maize or beans to pay for her lessons. She excelled in exams, but there was no money for her to go to college. With limited resources at his disposal, her father decided to educate her brothers instead. Namshali’s first job was folding linen in a hotel, where she took the opportunity to learn English from foreign guests. Her spark and enthusiasm got her noticed and promoted. When she got her first job in a safari resort with Asilia Africa, she was put in charge of a tented camp staffed entirely by men. “Manage all these men, can you imagine?” Staff were initially resistant. “But they soon understood who was boss,” she says. In 2016, Asilia Africa took the unprecedented decision to turn Dunia camp into the world’s first game lodge staffed entirely by females. “At first, my father was in shock. He asked everyone to pray for me, living in the bush like an animal and only surviving by the grace of God!” says Namshali. “These days you hear him boasting that his daughter is a manager in the best company!” More than a year into the project, guests have nothing but rave reviews. Though one burly gentleman, on being walked back to his tent by the night security guard, did query how this young lady armed only with a torch would help in the face of a snarling predator. Little did he know, a few months prior, the guard had frightened off an elephant bull who had stampeded the kitchen in search of watermelons, using nothing but pots and pans. The team face sexism on a regular basis while at work. Namshali finds she is often disparagingly referred to as “woman manager” by her male peers. She has been told frequently to stop pretending, to go home and take care of her children and stop disrespecting her husband. “As a woman, working in this kind of environment, you have to be very tough and very strong,” she says. “Be confident and believe in yourself, even if the world doesn’t, and the rest will follow.” Namshali financially supports her teenage son and stay-at-home husband, a concept alien in Tanzania, where traditional gender roles dominate. All the women at Dunia work 45 days on site, followed by two weeks at home. At first, Namshali found it hard leaving her son for such long periods and they both used to cry, but now he understands his mother’s job provides for the whole family. Namshali firmly believes tourism is creating a turning point for women in east Africa, and predicts there will be many more working in the hospitality industry, and in leadership roles, within the next five years. “With women, they will go the extra mile. You don’t ever have to say twice, they are there and it gets done,” she says, with pride. “The women, they are Dunia!” Fatima Zaman On 7 July 2005, Fatima Zaman heard the blast of the London bombs. As a young girl growing up in east London, she was at school close to Aldgate. “I heard the blast, I felt the ramifications,” she recalls. “I’m a young Muslim woman and I felt the personal effects of the stereotyping and the discrimination that followed those attacks. So at the age of 13, I decided that I wouldn’t let hate be my story.” Now 24, she calls herself a counter-extremist. “It’s not something that a young person usually chooses as her career,” she says. “It was a very personal choice. I was very young when I witnessed the 7/7 bombings.” Zaman runs a schools’ roadshow under the Extremely Together programme, travelling across Britain to teach young people how to resist violent extremism, and to question hate and propaganda. “I’ve had numerous occasions where I’ve actually been frightened by the extremists that I’m working to protect people from. The far right has attacked me. Islamists continuously attack me and my work, and they want to attack my community. It’s a very difficult thing, but I keep reminding myself that the extremists won’t stop, and if I let one piece of hate deter me then I’m not good at what I do. “So every time I get a bit of discrimination, I get challenged. Anyone who wants to threaten me: bring it on! Because that just pushes me to work harder to make sure that there’s a positive alternative.” Zaman emphasises that extremist organisations are very good at harnessing the power of social media. “It’s an infinite resource that lies unfettered and unchecked. In targeted campaigns they engage young people on things that they like and, once they’ve got that hook, they personalise it. They try to say, ‘You’re disenfranchised, you don’t belong. You’re British, you’re Bengali, you’re Muslim – there’s a clash of civilisations within you but we can offer you an alternative where you belong.’” Zaman juggles her job as a civil servant with her activism. “It’s the passion that drives me. I’m not going to stop for as long as there is the ill of extremism, I can’t slow down. “My mum is very supportive. She gave me my feminist values and just wants me to do good in the world. “My family’s history is quite rich. My father helped to bring peace to Bangladesh during the war in 1971, and I think that’s where I get my activism from. It’s in my blood. With all that’s going on with the Rohingya community and the refugees, I need to go back and do something – I don’t know what yet, so watch this space! – but my culture is so important to me. I call myself a hybrid. I’m British and I’m Bengali. The two can co-exist. I can bring my experiences from the UK to Bangladesh, and my rich, diverse culture that defines my personality and who I am back to the UK.” Krishna Kumari Kohli In a remote Hindu-majority district of south-eastern Pakistan, the dark evenings of Krishna Kumari Kohli’s childhood were reserved for exhausted sleep rather than dreams of political office. Kohli’s community had lived on the margins for centuries in South Asia as Dalits, “untouchables” on the lowest rung of the caste system. Shackled to a life on the fields in Tharparkar, near the Indian border, Kohli and her family worked as bonded labourers, for harsh feudal landlords who dictated when they ate, slept and prayed. This month, however, Kohli became the first female Dalit member of Pakistan’s Senate. The 39-year-old won a parliamentary seat reserved for women after being nominated by the Pakistan People’s Party. In Pakistan’s 70-year history, a woman from a low-caste Hindu background has never reached this upper echelon of political power. In the Muslim-majority country, Dalits are entrenched in cycles of debt bondage, even children labouring in brick kilns or farms. Few are ever able to extricate themselves from the situation, making Kohli unique, although she disassociates herself from the institution of caste. “I believe in equality and brotherhood,” she says. “I reject the caste system.” With no previous political experience, Kohli was an activist working in human rights and development. She plans to use her new position to advance women’s rights, tackle child marriage and end the forced labour she and her family endured. Pakistan’s Hindus have celebrated her victory. “We are so happy,” says Kashi Ram, a 30-year-old priest in Lahore. “I am happy Hindus also have a position here in Pakistan,” he adds. Now Kohli carries the hopes of such Hindus, most of whom live in her home Tharparkar district, a poverty and drought-stricken region where malnutrition and hunger are widespread. Kohli’s village, Dhana Gam, suffers a dearth of healthcare facilities and doctors, and waterborne diseases are rampant. As a member of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Kohli says she walks in the footsteps of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, assassinated in 2007. “She accepted the challenge and became the first female prime minister in spite of threats and opposition,” Kohli says. “Benazir Bhutto is my role model.” Although Kohli has garnered attention for her Dalit background, the senator remains focused on her pledge to use the role to help women and minorities, and denounces all discrimination based on religion, caste, and gender. “Humanity is superior to everything,” she says. Kohli is not just a senator for Hindus or Dalits, she adds. “First, I am a Pakistani.” Dina Meza A farmer’s daughter from Cofradía, in north-west Honduras, Dina Meza took up journalism thinking that it might cure her crippling shyness. Two years into her studies, her brother Victor, a social activist, was kidnapped by the military, tortured and thrown in prison. She found her voice. “I wasn’t conscious of the danger at that time,” says Meza, now an award-winning journalist and human rights defender. “My brother was accused of terrorism as a political prisoner. All I wanted to do was find him alive.” Victor Meza, who suffered terrible injuries in prison, was eventually released during a political amnesty in 1992, along with 17 fellow prisoners, thanks to a campaign by Meza and others. But in Honduras, one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists, Meza’s work has made her a target for harassment, intimidation and death threats. Amnesty International issued an urgent action alert to the Honduran government calling for those who threatened her to be brought to justice. In 2013, Meza, 55, was forced into exile in the UK, and was accepted on the University of York’s protective fellowship scheme for human rights defenders. The scheme, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, provides temporary respite. In January, as part of a Pen International writers’ event, she spoke about her determination to continue her work, despite threats against her. To write in Honduras, she said, “is to write with a gun pointed at your head”. Her fellowship, and the support of the Fund for Global Human Rights and the Sigrid Rausing Trust, enabled her to set up an online magazine, Pasos de Animal Grande– “steps of a big animal” – to allow her to write freely. “There is a saying in Honduras,” says Meza. “When you say you can feel the steps of a big animal, it means you can feel there’s going to be radical change.” Her magazine is now translated into more than 20 languages. She is founding president of Pen Honduras, which supports journalists at risk. The organisation has taken on cases of high-profile writers charged with defamation, and of students criminalised after protesting against reforms at their university. Meza, who also founded the Association for Democracy and Human Rights, still receives terrifying death threats. In April last year she was followed on to a bus by a man who told her he was armed, and that there was an order out to kill her. “I was so terrified,” she says. She managed to escape. But she now has a safety plan, which includes support from Peace Brigades International, an NGO that provides international observers to protect human rights defenders in danger. Her country remains in political turmoil. On 27 January, President Juan Orlando Hernández was sworn in for a second term after winning a violently disputed election in which his party was accused of electoral fraud. Meza says the UK, and the international community, should not be fooled by the Honduran government’s rhetoric. “If you are being fooled you are helping to sustain the impunity in the country.” There is, she says, still much work to do in Honduras. “It’s very important to achieve change. We can’t have this evil continuing … I have a commitment to my brother, who was tortured and imprisoned, and also to my children. I owe it to them not to pass on the same Honduras that I grew up in.” Sister Maria Loitaruk In the three years since Sister Maria Loitaruk became head teacher of Bishop Caesar Mazzolari school, in Rumbek, South Sudan, pupil numbers have soared from 280 to 1,300. This is no mean feat in a country where thousands have died, millions have fled their homes and two-thirds of the population are struggling to find enough food after last year’s famine. In Rumbek, a farming town where feuds over dwindling cattle herds are fought to the death, and gunshots interrupt school lessons daily, education is seen as a low priority. “Life is very difficult here,” says Loitaruk, who grew up in a pastoralist community in West Pokot, Kenya. “War and drought and extreme poverty are part of their lives.” What makes this Catholic nun most proud is that the school has achieved a gender split of almost half and half in a male-dominated, polygamous culture where 52% of girls are married by the age of 18 (and nearly one in 10 by the age of 15). “I am seeing the way the girls are growing – knowing their rights, as girls, as women, as human beings,” she says. “And when they get back to the village, they are able to explain those rights to their mothers. “Women in this community are submissive to their husbands, they are like property. Pastoralists value cows more than even human lives.” South Sudan became the world’s newest country in 2011 but, within two years, fighting had broken out between members of the Dinka tribe, loyal to President Salva Kiir, and the Nuer tribe, supporting former vice-president Riek Machar. Amid violence and drought, Loitaruk struggles to get parents to value education. Across the country, three-quarters of adults are illiterate, Unicef estimates, and many schools lie abandoned in the towns and villages. Loitaruk visits families, telling her own story. As the youngest of eight, her father wanted her married off for a dowry of 100 cows. Her “unique” mother fought hard for her to be allowed to go to school. “We visit the parents and talk to them about the value of education. I tell them of my own childhood,” she says. “I tell them marriage can wait, but education cannot. I say the cows on which you are dependent, they will never pay to stabilise the economy of the country. If you leave a child at home idle or looking after cows, they will learn stealing and fighting. But if you take your children to school, they will see life from a different angle. They will have ideas and grow and help to stabilise the economy of the country.” Living in such a violent, tribal culture, children face harsh, difficult lives, and Loitaruk pays tribute to those who want to become doctors, nurses and teachers. “If a child is able to wake up and say, “I’m going to school”, that is an achievement,” she says. “If a child is able to follow the curriculum, that is an achievement. We shall do our best to help them.” Photo credits: Kathleen Prior; Jonty; Pervez Masih/AP; David Levene for the Guardian; courtesy Sister Maria Loitaruk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/mar/15/handwriting-eal-pupils-language-barrier-teachers","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T11:11:45Z","webTitle":"How handwriting is helping EAL pupils to leap the language barrier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/mar/15/handwriting-eal-pupils-language-barrier-teachers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/mar/15/handwriting-eal-pupils-language-barrier-teachers","fields":{"headline":"How handwriting is helping EAL pupils to leap the language barrier","bodyText":"Handwriting may be out of fashion in the digital age, but for pupils whose mother tongue is not English, it is proving helpful when it comes to learning the language. With more than one million children aged between five and 15 in UK schools for whom English is an additional language (EAL), teachers have to work hard to help pupils overcome language barriers and achieve fluency in the written and spoken word. The latest Department for Education figures found one in five (20.6%) of primary school pupils speak a language other than English at home, and 16.2% of secondary school students. At St Jude’s C of E primary academy in Wolverhampton, where a third of the children are EAL students, year 5 teacher Julianne Britton has found handwriting particularly useful for teaching grammar. It’s an area where EAL students often fall down because English sentence structures are frequently very different to their native language, she explains. “Sometimes it is easier for children to see the words and sentences written down rather than simply listening to it,” she says. “By handwriting, they are more likely to notice the grammatical structures.” One effective activity Britton uses with her EAL students is to ask them to arrange jumbled up words into the correct sentence order. The children may not necessarily know what the words mean at first, but they are developing an understanding of how to build a sentence in English. She also encourages pupils to read a lot in English – they are given ebooks with audio in their home language and in English, with subtitles in both languages displayed on the screen. Britton says: “It’s a really good starting point because it is something they can do independently. [In class] I provide them with pictures from the ebook, and ask students to put them in the order of the story. They will then start to write some basic sentences about what happened, so the reading, writing and listening are all linked.” She found that pupils enjoyed using the ebook because “it gives them a little bit of ownership over their learning as I allow them to choose the story they’d like to hear or read.” Working with peers is important, too. “I have noticed that some EAL pupils feel more confident using conversational English with their peers rather than with an adult.” There is evidence to support the benefits of linking writing with developing language. In a New York Times article, Virginia Berninger, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Washington, says studies have found that “handwriting – forming letters – engages the mind, and that can help children pay attention to written language”. Another study of children aged nine to 10, published in 2015, found that handwriting improved students’ spelling and composition, because the connecting strokes helped children connect letters into words. However, much of the progress an EAL child makes in handwriting and literacy is dependent upon the extent of their previous knowledge. Britton describes teaching a Romanian student who started in year 5 but had never been to school before. Although he could speak in Romanian, he couldn’t read in that language. She had to go back to the basics with him and start with phonics. On the other hand, an EAL child who is very literate in their home language may find it easier to learn written English and catch up with their classmates. A tailored approach is essential. Matthew Martin, history teacher and head of EAL at the Totteridge academy in Barnet, where roughly 70% of the school are EAL students, draws up individual achievement plans to help them improve. He says EAL children need to have a good level of written communication before they can improve fluency. “We may have somebody whose aim is to really master the alphabet,” Martin adds. “That may sound quite basic but you can have a multilingual child who writes a different script to English and cognitively can understand the task, but gets their capital letters and punctuation mixed up. They really need to have that foundation.” In Martin’s school less proficient children are taken out of lessons three times a week and given specialist support in groups of five. That enables a specialist teacher to focus on the student’s individual needs and build their vocabulary to support them in mainstream lessons. Britton, meanwhile, believes it’s more beneficial to immerse EAL students in the language and surround them with English-speaking children who they can learn from. However, she does take children out at times in small groups or individually to minimise distractions – and to focus on basic English vocabulary. It is crucial that lessons are creative and fun in order to boost EAL students’ confidence. At the British Council school in Madrid, 98% of the children are Spanish and the remaining 2% are made up of other nationalities. Teachers have to work hard to motivate students who are unlikely to come into contact with the English language beyond the school gates. Catherine Stewart, head of early years at the school, says they immerse the students in the English language by displaying words around the classroom – bombarding them with vocabulary – and encouraging pupils to practice them throughout the day and at home. There are areas for children to practice writing through role play and they are encouraged to go outside with clipboards and write down what they see. “If we don’t give them the opportunity to write in English, they may not get that after 4.30pm or before 9am,” Stewart says. “So we have to give them that opportunity. It’s also about using different materials. You give them a felt tip pen and suddenly they want to write. A nice piece of paper with a border around. It’s all those things. You know as a teacher that if they have enjoyed it, you will get writing from every single child without a fuss.” Graham Smith, who runs the EAL Academy, agrees that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to teaching EAL students literacy. He says the first step is understanding what a pupil can do, and can’t do at the moment but might be able to, given the right support. “You have to believe that they are capable and have high expectations of them,” Smith adds. “Teaching is a creative activity, you need to find things that work for your children, not just take stuff off the peg. There isn’t a miracle cure. There is knowledge about children, how language is acquired and about literacy but there isn’t a shortcut to that.” Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach, like us on Facebook, and join the Guardian Teacher Network the latest articles direct to your inbox Looking for a teaching job?

There has been a huge loss of affordable council homes for rent since the introduction of right to buy in 1980. This is because money has been lost through selling homes at below market value and the ban of reinvesting a large part of the money in new homes for rent. When it was introduced, there were 6.5m council houses in the UK. There are now 2m. Currently 40% of homes sold to council tenants are rented out by private landlords. This situation is immoral and not in the interest of taxpayers. Scotland has recognised this and stopped the sale of council houses in 2016. Significant numbers of people on low incomes will never be able to afford to buy their own home, and with diminishing numbers of council properties to rent they are forced to rent from the private sector at inflated prices, with restricted forms of tenancy and a lack of security. The balance of opinion needs to change to recognise that renting is not second best to ownership. What is desperately needed is for the government and councils to provide affordable homes for rent but with some new imaginative forms of tenancy. Robert Dark London • Dawn Foster does not address Conservatives’ assumption that everyone wants to own their home. As long as renters are subject to such poor security, excessive rents and lack of control on conditions, it is hardly surprising that ownership seems a nirvana. Fair, decent and secure rentals would provide positive alternatives. It works in Germany. If this government is determined to make significant and speedy improvements to housing, rather than build “affordable” (really?) houses, rent controls, landlord licensing and security of tenure must be introduced. This landlord would welcome it.

Amanda Spielman told MPs she was very concerned about the growing number of children who were not in school, with many apparently being home educated or taught in unregistered schools, “often with a very particular religious slant”. Unlike in most countries, she said, parents in England were not required to register their child if they did not attend school, adding: “I’m not sure the historically permissive approach we’ve taken is going to be the sensible way to continue for ever.” The chief inspector, giving evidence to the Commons education committee on Wednesday, called for greater powers to inspect unregistered schools and signalled that the current legislative framework was insufficient to deal with a changing education landscape. She said it had been drawn up at a time when “nobody really contemplated there being schools that simply would not want to comply with the law”, adding it was becoming increasingly difficult to sustain a system where “we simply don’t know what institutions exist, and what children are even in the country”. Spielman said Ofsted teams had seen some “very disturbing things” during inspections of unregistered schools. “We have seen poor education, we’ve seen squalid conditions and we’ve seen some very worrying teaching materials in some of those institutions,” she said. “Books by people who are banned from entering the country, books promoting very concerning practices advocating men beating their wives to punish them, advocating – teaching – that women are not entitled to refuse sex to their husbands and so on. “I would very much like to have stronger powers to get entry to suspected unregistered schools and to seize evidence. At the moment we can copy, so we do take photographs where we can, but if the proprietors or teachers pick up everything that’s there and walk out with it, there’s nothing we can do, they can simply take it away.” Spielman was also quizzed about the recent row at St Stephen’s primary school in Newham, east London, where she publicly backed the headteacher, Neena Lall’s decision to ban Muslim pupils under the age of eight from wearing the hijab. The decision was subsequently overturned following complaints from parents and local councillors about a lack of consultation. Currently the Department for Education’s policy is for individual schools to set their own uniform policies. Spielman suggested, however, that in future such sensitive decisions should be taken out of the hands of individual schools and given to government or local authorities. “We have a very autonomous school system where we delegate a great deal down to individual heads. Compared with most countries in the world, we give more autonomy to individual heads,” she said. “If we are going to end up with an asymmetry where people conscientiously running often quite small schools can be effectively targeted and bullied in this way, I think we’re in a very worrying world.” The Muslim Council of Britain has previously criticised what it described as an obsessive focus on the hijab. “The damage this has done to community relationships, and the trust between parents and the school, is incredibly serious,” it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/11/bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story review – a remarkable double life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/11/bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/11/bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story-review","fields":{"headline":"Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story review – a remarkable double life","bodyText":"It is, as one interviewee says, the ultimate “crime fighter by night” story.

Yes, there he was, the Manchester United manager, clean shaven, in a fashionable fleece, and – could it really be – actually smiling. “Drop the cliché,” he joked as the voiceover announced The Special One was joining the channel as a World Cup pundit. The voiceover did as it was told. It will be José from now on. As World Cup punditry revelations go, the Mourinho announcement crashes straight in at No 2. It sits right between Robbie Williams having his skillset critiqued by Martin O’Neill and the look on John Bond’s face as Brian Clough explained to him the true nature of Trevor Francis’s role in the England 1982 midfield. This summer the (second) most famous manager in world football will opine for a broadcaster that has rights to show precisely none of this summer’s tournament. But why? At first glance it just doesn’t make sense. Then you take another. You cast off your blinkers, pop a sweet red pill and start asking questions. Suddenly everything looks different. For some, RT may be a meretricious outpost that persists in putting food on George Galloway’s table. To the US Department of Justice, it is a “foreign agent” operating on behalf of the Russian state. But to more liberated thinkers it is a much-needed counterweight to US imperialist propaganda, with an extra hour of Alex Salmond on a Thursday. And whatever side you are on, no one would argue its sports coverage does not need beefing up. So you look at RT and you start to make the connections. One field in which the channel is an undoubted leader is in the peddling of conspiracy theory. Whether it be local matters, such as the Russian invasion of Crimea actually being perpetrated by patriotic Ukrainians, or international happenings such as whether the CIA invented Ebola, RT breaks the story and breaks it big. That time it claimed the BBC faked a Syrian chemical weapons attack didn’t go so well (a report by Ofcom adjudged the broadcaster had “materially misled” its audience), but some of the segments on the poisoning of western minds by both chemtrails and fluoride in the water supply are pretty eye-opening. What if I then told you Mourinho has been known to talk of conspiracy himself on the odd occasion? What if I was to say that not only has the United manager talked about conspiracy, but he has kind of made it his absolute thing following matches when his lavishly equipped side achieve underwhelming results and, sometimes, even whelming ones? The conspiracies José has implied include the Uefa one that led to him having a man sent off pretty much every time his team were within reach of a European trophy. “I went to Inter and played a Champions League semi-final with 10 men against Barcelona,” he said in 2013. “I go to Real Madrid, I played again a Champions League semi-final with 10 men. Now I come back to Chelsea and played a Super Cup final with 10 men. Go to analyse the actions and make your conclusions. I’m unlucky. Just that.” To be clear, you could read those remarks as being delivered with an element of sarcasm. The same applies to a more recent theory that suggested referees love to send him to the stands for mouthing off. “Yesterday one fourth official told a manager: ‘I enjoy very much your passion,’” he said last year, probably lobbing a grenade at Jürgen Klopp while he was at it. “Today I was told: ‘Sit down or I have to send you to the stands.’ Everything is different for me. So don’t ask me questions that put me in a difficult situation.” As if. Oh, and we have time for one more. This time regarding the scheduling of his team’s matches during the Christmas period. “You television companies make the decisions and we have to accept,” he told one of them in January. “I believe you make the decisions but I also believe that some clubs, or some managers, have good friends in the right chairs and I don’t have them.” Who is in possession of the right chairs? Where are they hidden? And are they stackable? These are the sort of questions José will at last be able to explore during the summer. There will also surely be some exciting new gimmicks drummed up – perhaps Mourinho will be given licence to gouge the eye of a fellow pundit for each of his four days with RT this summer. Oh, did I forget that bit? Yes, José is going to Russia for only four days at the beginning of the World Cup. He will also phone in (literally) his thoughts on the final. In return he will get a reported £1.7m. So when it comes to the eternal question of “cui bono” the answer is José Mourinho. Just as he did when he signed endorsement deals with Heineken, Hublot, Jaguar, BT Sport, Adidas, Atlantis hotels, EA Sports and Lipton Tea (you won’t need reminding of his seminal #bemoretea campaign). Yes, make no mistake, José is the beneficiary of this particular deal. Vladimir Putin and the Russian state come only second."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2018/mar/08/international-womens-day-career-leading-charities-geraldine-peacock","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T07:17:00Z","webTitle":"'There was a lot needing to be done': one woman's career leading charities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2018/mar/08/international-womens-day-career-leading-charities-geraldine-peacock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2018/mar/08/international-womens-day-career-leading-charities-geraldine-peacock","fields":{"headline":"'There was a lot needing to be done': one woman's career leading charities","bodyText":"“Being the only one, I couldn’t be anything but different. I felt I could speak out – there were so many of them missing the point sometimes.” Geraldine Peacock, a female pioneer in the charity sector, is talking about a 1997 dinner for the heads of Britain’s 20 top charities, at which she was the only woman. At that time, Peacock was one of the voluntary sector’s only female leaders – and certainly the only one leading a charity with a £20m turnover. At that dinner, in the Army and Navy club, Peacock found herself sitting with 19 men, many of whom were from a military background. “They didn’t quite know how to handle it,” she admits. “There were no women’s toilets in the club, apart from on the top floor – it would have once been the maid’s quarters. Every time I needed the toilet, I had to go up all of these stairs. “But it signalled a big change [having a woman at the table],” she adds. “I felt quite empowered by the situation.” Peacock’s whole career in the sector has highlighted the strength of female leaders. Her appointment in 2004 as the first chair of the Charity Commission was not without controversy. Her post coincided with a period of reform, when the then Labour government was overhauling charity law and regulation, leading to the Charities Act being passed in 2006. Peacock’s first day included a visit to the parliamentary committee examining the bill and a row over whether charities charging high fees, including private schools, should be made to prove they offered a public benefit. Looking back, Peacock says political interference with the commission’s remit went further than that. “Tony Blair saw me just before I left [in 2006],” she says. “And he said, ‘I want you to do one thing for me before you go. I want you to leave private schools out of the new act.’ “I said I couldn’t do that. The whole point of the act was to make sure it was a level playing field for everyone. He insisted: ‘I’m not asking you, I’m telling you [and] I’m your boss’. I replied: ‘You’re not actually. You only recommended me to the Queen’.” Peacock got her way: private schools were included. It’s a revealing, but not unexpected, exchange from a woman who once climbed through a window to talk to a disgruntled group of visually impaired people who had barricaded into a Devonshire hotel due to be closed by Guide Dogs for the Blind. Peacock was the chief executive of the charity from 1997-2004, before she was appointed to the Charity Commission. Peacock believes the 1988 founding of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo), which she also chaired, was a turning point in attracting women into the sector. Women met like-minded peers, there were mentoring opportunities, and cross-sector groups across private and voluntary sector organisations started to form. Acevo’s latest research (paywall), from 500 respondents, found 57% of the organisations surveyed are now run by women. Remarkably, Peacock also credits being diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease at 39 as a contributing factor in propelling her forward in her career. It was in 1988, while having the medical for the job at Guide Dogs of the Blind that doctors gave her the news. She had been headhunted after serving as the first paid chief executive of the National Autistic Society (NAS) . “I thought I wouldn’t get the job then,” she says. “Some of them didn’t want me anyway because I wasn’t from the military and I wasn’t a man. Luckily they did because NAS said they’d only take me back on a rolling three month contract [after the diagnosis]. [They thought] I might not be able to keep up with the job. “Funnily enough, after I was diagnosed I actually pushed myself more. I applied for jobs I never would have applied for because I thought I’ve got to live while I can. I didn’t know how long I was going to last with this, I didn’t know what it was going to do to me, and I felt that there was a lot that needed to be done. It sort of spurred me on somehow.” Peacock left the Charity Commission in 2006 to move to Canada and marry her second husband, who died last year. She is now back in Wells in Somerset, working with local charities and the Parkinson’s Society. “I’m one of the few people who have had Parkinson’s for as long as I have and is still living,” she says. She is still pragmatic about the changes that are needed in the voluntary sector, particularly the need to finally define what “public benefit” is. “The government left the commission to define it [in 2006]. I thought that was a huge opportunity and spoke to the BBC about having a televised debate about what the public wants and is looking for from charities. That would have produced a much better public understanding of what charities are too. I still think we need that debate.” On the challenges facing the sector – cuts to government funding, revelations about sexual harassment in the sector, and building public trust – Peacock says leaders need to look to the bigger picture. “The sector is having an identity crisis,” she comments, but adds that charities need to focus on how to positively learn from what is happening. She does not think the government values the voluntary sector or sees it as a key player in policy, even though it’s often the deliverer of public services. “There’s an opportunity for the sector to fill the void that’s there at the moment and come up with its own agenda for social wellbeing, for the lives of people in this country. There’s much more that can be developed at a grassroots, community level. And I think it would be ideal for charities to live without government funding. It should enhance activities, not define them.” Talk to us on Twitter via @Gdnvoluntary and join our community for your free monthly Guardian Voluntary Sector newsletter, with analysis and opinion sent direct to you on the first Thursday of the month.

Liv Wynter, who chose to resign on the eve of International Women’s Day to maximise its impact and highlight the “invisible inequalities” at the Tate, was also angered by recent harassment comments from the British art institution’s director, Maria Balshaw. Balshaw was reported in an interview with the Times last month to have said: “I personally have never suffered any such issues. Then, I wouldn’t. I was raised to be a confident woman who, when I encountered harassment, would say: ‘Please don’t’ ... or something rather more direct.” In her resignation letter, Wynter said that Balshaw’s words had come as a “huge slap in the face” to her as a campaigner against cuts to domestic violence services and what she described as the “erasure” of women from the Tate. “I cannot describe to you the personal shame I feel as a survivor of domestic violence, to work for someone who could think so little of me whilst simultaneously profiting off my ‘survivorness’ and the work I dare to make about it,” she wrote. Wynter, an activist who identifies herself as a queer working-class female artist, has been a Tate artist in residence for education, schools and learning. She said Balshaw’s comments came “during a powerful reckoning on sexual assault and harassment, with the creative industries pledging to make change through campaigns such as #MeToo and #TimesUp”. Balshaw used Instagram last month to apologise for her comments about sexual harassment, saying: “I am sorry if this has been misunderstood. It is absolutely not my intention to say that women are in any way to blame. To be clear, it is the perpetrators who are responsible for their behaviour and not the women who are subjected to it.” The Tate said in a statement that Balshaw had apologised for her comments during an open discussion with staff last week and it did not recognise the description of events given by Wynter. It added that Balshaw also restated her commitment to inclusivity and diversity, which staff support. Balshaw said: “Throughout my career I have been dedicated to addressing issues of gender, race and equality and I apologise if my recent comments have offended people. When I became director of Tate, I set out my vision to make this the most culturally inclusive museum organisation in the world, and I am truly committed to that vision. I have spoken publicly about my values on many occasions over the years and I will continue to argue for equality and inclusion at every opportunity.” Pressure has been building on the Tate since it suspended contact with one of its biggest donors, Anthony d’Offay. The Observer revealed that the art dealer – who sold almost his entire art collection to the Tate and National Galleries Scotland in 2008 for the price he had paid – was facing allegations of harassment and inappropriate behaviour dating from 1997 to 2004. He denies the claims. Balshaw also faces criticism from Wynter and others over separate comments in which she told an audience how she had been pleased to see a photograph of a group of young men at a gallery watching a video installation by the black artist Steve McQueen and “eating their fried chicken lunch”. Wynter said that she and others had attended a meeting with Balshaw where the “fried chicken” remark and comments on harassment had come up, but had been disappointed by her response. “If she wishes to wear this apparent racial and sexist ignorance as a badge, I am forced to question, how did she become appointed to the role? How can anyone so proudly ignorant be the head of the UK’s largest cultural institution?” said Wynter. Wynter also took aim at the way she said that the Tate had chosen to work with artists from marginalised communities. She said this had been done as a “distraction technique” from the low representation of the same groups at the Tate, where only 13% of the workforce identify as BAME and where every director is white. She called on the Tate to give a platform to survivors of abuse, donate time, money and space to groups such as the black feminist organisations Sisters Uncut and IMKAAN, as well as diversify its workplace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/08/tory-feminists-do-exist-but-they-offer-only-cheap-wins-and-bad-faith","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"Tory feminists do exist – but they offer only cheap wins and bad faith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/tory-feminists-do-exist-but-they-offer-only-cheap-wins-and-bad-faith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/tory-feminists-do-exist-but-they-offer-only-cheap-wins-and-bad-faith","fields":{"headline":"Tory feminists do exist – but they offer only cheap wins and bad faith","bodyText":"I distinctly remember (read: Googled) what Harriet Harman used to think about being a Conservative and a feminist: she said it was impossible. Now, she points to “a dramatic change in the nature of Conservative women MPs … These MPs are more modern, and people that we, as Labour women, can work cross-party with.” She singled out Sarah Wollaston (cool voice of reason on the NHS); Maria Miller (trenchant opponent of sexual harassment); Nicky Morgan (good on Brexit); and Justine Greening (who had concerns about Toby Young’s appointment to the Office for Students board, which unfortunately – because no man took up her point and repeated it more loudly – went unheeded). These women, five years ago, looked at best like Lib Dems in the wrong party, and now, in comparison with their male colleagues, they look amazing. In an ideal world, we would run the Conservative party like a netball match, and attach a scrappy, energetic woman who listened to reason to every blowhard man who didn’t. Austerity would still happen, we’d still have a housing crisis, social injustice would persist and in all likelihood we’d still sell arms to despotic regimes, citing the many valuable jobs they provide. But utterly pointless acts of national self-sabotage, built on lies by the solipsistic ambitions of the shameless and entitled, those could be blocked. The main problem with Tory women is not that they’re not feminist enough, it’s that there aren’t enough of them. However, looking like a good person relative to Jacob Rees-Mogg is not yet enough to make you a feminist. Tories cannot truly be feminist, because their decisions impact women most. When you roll back the duties of the state, whether in paying its public-sector workers or providing social care or a safety net, the resultant burden falls disproportionately on women. When you close down domestic-violence refuges, it’s women who die. It is simply not possible to smother all this under a delightful quilt of strong words on sexual harassment or FGM. This is a classic 21st-century manoeuvre: to tilt in the direction of equality with political actions that don’t cost very much. It looks like it’s better than nothing, but it’s actually worse, since it borrows the garb of fairness and returns it sullied, smelling of bad faith. However – and this is a major however – there is another, deeper, problem with feminism as this buoying, reassuring worldview we have all signed up to. Drawing up that litany of economic violence against women, I looked into how many of the 75,000 people with disabilities who had lost their adapted vehicles, and thereby their independence, in the latest round of benefits cuts were women. I couldn’t find out, because it’s a stupid question. There is no rational world in which you care about the female victims of benefits changes more than the male; no world in which child poverty counts as a “women’s issue”; no world in which “period poverty” – not being able to afford tampons – can be separated from “actual poverty” (not being able to afford beans). Gender equality, disaggregated from equality as a principle, is all “women on boards” and “slogan T-shirts”; hollow-hearted because it’s arbitrary. Radical feminism versus socialist feminism was the hot-button division of the second wave, before everything fell out of favour, radicalism being a bit of a nuisance and socialism being so dated. Feminism then reappeared, alone, and anybody could be one. And that’s still true, in the sense that it’s great when we can all work together. But if you want internal coherence, “not a conservative” doesn’t quite cut it: you really need to be a socialist. Italy’s nationalists are scapegoating the nation itself It turns out that we’re not the only electorate with a north-south divide. In Italy, it is even starker: the south is more or less entirely with the Five Star Movement (M5S), the north is has gone with Lega Nord (the North League). Some kind of coalition is inevitable, and on paper, straightforward. M5S and the League have a lot in common; they both locate the nation’s problems in a colourful, amorphous axis of the establishment and, for some elements, an influx of foreigners. Sure, there’ll be areas of contention. The League wants to decriminalise brothels, but not those “messy brothels like in the past, or putting women behind a shop window,” said Matteo Salvini, the leader. This gives M5S a headache, because it loves mess. Explicitly established not as a party but as a loose collective aiming to destroy political parties, its members embrace chaos of all sorts. One of its core pledges was to repeal 400 laws in its first year of office, one of which is the legal duty to vaccinate your children. Nobody panic: it also has a plan to repeal the laws of the natural universe, so that’s one in the eye for science and its made-up diseases. The two parties may well cohere into a relatively unified picture of nationalistic fervour, but this would be far from true nationalism. The North League was conceived as a regional force, to get away from the south. Salvini has conveniently buried these roots under enemies who are more convenient: the EU and the foreigner. Because what could be more politically uncomfortable than admitting what you really mean? I hate Puglians. I hate Neapolitans. I hate the establishment, by which I mean Rome. It happens elsewhere: I hate Westminster, by which I mean Londoners. I hate people from Hull. Or Charlottesville. Or New York. Populism, driven by recession, always ends up at scapegoating, and we assume that there is some deep-seated truth in there about closing ranks and rejecting the foreign. In fact, the foreigner is just a diversion, a piñata for a build-up of rage that started within the bosom of the family. It’s not nationalism. It’s nationphobia. Public health messages effective? Fat chance Obesity causes cancer. This is a public health announcement, you can see it on a bus stop. There’s a hypothesis here on which huge amounts of public policy have been built, but which is never tested: that people eat the wrong foods because they don’t know what is right, and remain obese because they don’t realise that it’s unhealthy. Public health messages cling with a religious fervour to this idea of an ignorant population that just needs more enthusiastic telling. If they took their own mechanistic, calories-in-calories-out approach, the agencies responsible might see that the messages in aren’t generating the results out. They might have to make some lifestyle changes, like thinking, or even listening. --"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14928","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T00:00:25Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,928","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14928","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14928","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,928","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/08/tories-deficit-slash-state-david-cameron-george-osborne-austerity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"The Tories never cared about eliminating the deficit.

The same can be said for politics. The continuing, unprecedented cuts to Britain’s public services, for example, will appear quite different to a disabled person unable to get to the toilet because their social care has been halved than they will to, say, a former prime minister reading the news at his mansion. Two events from the past week display this stark contrast. In response to news that Britain has eliminated its day-to-day deficit budget, the delayed target originally set by George Osborne when he imposed austerity on public services in 2010, the former chancellor tweeted: “We got there in the end – a remarkable national effort. Thank you.” David Cameron followed self-congratulatory suit with: “It was the right thing to do.” Only a few days earlier, Northamptonshire county council – the authority that has essentially gone bankrupt – confirmed a cuts programme of almost £40m over the next financial year (an additional £10m than was first planned) in an attempt to stay afloat. This means the closure of 21 of its 36 libraries, after a public campaign forced the council to abandon plans to close 28 of them. Children’s centres in the area have already had their funding cut by 40%, and now vulnerable teenagers will lose half a million pounds in skills and jobs support. Meanwhile, insufficient funds for adult social care means care services for older and disabled adults are said to be on “the verge of being unsafe” – that’s a wheelchair user on the bathroom floor because she’s got no one there to help her safely wash, or an 80-year-old developing sores after being left to sit in his own dirt. I wonder, is this an example of the “right thing” Cameron speaks of? There is an almost delusional refusal among austerity’s architects to acknowledge the reality of the last decade – a gaping chasm between the moral superiority Cameron and colleagues attach to the implementation of cuts and the human misery they have caused. From its beginning, the Conservative’s practically romanticised cuts – creating an image of a simple belt-tightening, a type of blitz-spirit rationing. Sacrifice sounds noble. But then, it’s easy to find sacrifice noble when it’s other people who are doing the sacrificing. Reminiscent of his “all in it together” mantra, Osborne’s language this month – “We got there in the end – a remarkable national effort” – is reflective of this. “We”, as if each of us has taken an equal share of the burden. Research by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, among others, show these are in fact cuts felt predominantly by those least able to take the strain, from working class women to ethnic minorities, and disabled people. This week, it emerged 75,000 disabled people – yes 75,000 – have now had their Motability cars removed because of tightened benefit eligibility rolled out by Cameron’s government and continued by Theresa May – in essence, tens of thousands of sick people having their lifeline to the shops or doctor pulled out from under them. Forget “all in it together”: Osborne’s so-called fiscal success is built off the back of making paraplegics housebound. This gutting of services was always the intention. Rather than sound economic prudence, the austerity measures that Osborne and Cameron launched were ideological: an excuse to shrink the state, as cuts to government spending focused in on social security and public services. (Think of the zealotry with which ministers spoke of waging war against the “something for nothing culture” of single mums, jobseekers, and disabled people.) As Ann Pettifor, director of Prime: Policy Research in Macroeconomics, points out, this was not even economically sound. Many economists stress Osborne’s post-crisis austerity programme actually deepened and lengthened Britain’s post-crisis recession, causing public and private investment to fall further and real wages to decline. That’s not to mention the long-term costs to the taxpayer of rocketing numbers in expensive temporary accommodation because of a rise in homelessness at a time of benefits cuts, or added strain on the NHS from cuts to care services. Far from revelling in success, the Conservatives should be considering the consequences of their failure. What’s happening in Northamptonshire may well be repeated in councils up and down the country as local authorities are forced to deliver vital services on almost halved budgets. It’s hard to imagine how it feels to be a low-income teenager in Northamptonshire right now, about to lose your chance at job training, or a disabled person unable to sleep because you’re terrified your personal assistant is going to stop coming to help you wash. These are ordinary families who are being abandoned by the state when they most need help. That this is being celebrated is insult to injury. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/07/texas-primary-democratic-turnout-soars-as-republicans-stand-their-ground","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T14:38:08Z","webTitle":"Texas primary: Democratic turnout soars as Republicans stand their ground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/texas-primary-democratic-turnout-soars-as-republicans-stand-their-ground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/texas-primary-democratic-turnout-soars-as-republicans-stand-their-ground","fields":{"headline":"Texas primary: Democratic turnout soars as Republicans stand their ground","bodyText":"Democratic turnout soared in America’s most populous Republican state on Tuesday as Texas held the nation’s first primary elections before November’s midterms. The Texas primaries were scrutinized across the country for hints as to whether revulsion over Donald Trump and the rightwards swing of the GOP could translate into a flurry of Democratic enthusiasm that gives the party a chance of retaking the House of Representatives in November. One of the country’s most solidly conservative states is an acid test for the “blue wave”: no Democrat has won a statewide election in Texas since 1994. However, in early voting, Democratic turnout doubled from 2014 and outstripped the Republican total, according to state figures from the 15 counties with the most registered voters. Beto O’Rourke, an El Paso congressman seeking to oust Ted Cruz from the US Senate, won the Democratic nomination with a campaign that has gathered momentum and raised significant funds. “They are mobilizing in a powerful way,” Cruz told CBS’s Dallas affiliate. “At the end of the day, the good news is that there are a lot more conservatives in Texas than there are liberals.” In a sign that the early burst of Democratic energy may struggle to overcome entrenched Republican dominance in the long run, Republicans gained ground on election day itself. Cruz ultimately won more than twice as many votes as O’Rourke, and the total number of Democratic voters was about 1 million compared with 1.5 million Republicans. Even in a state that was relatively lukewarm towards Trump in the 2016 election, embracing the president proved more asset than liability for George P Bush. In a bid for re-election as land commissioner, which centered on the preservation of the Alamo site, Bush faced a stiff challenge from fellow Republican Jerry Patterson, a gun-toting former marine who once described the former Texas governor – and current US energy secretary – Rick Perry as resembling a “west coast metrosexual” when he stopped wearing cowboy boots. But the son of Jeb Bush, nephew of George W Bush and grandson of George HW Bush easily held off Patterson to keep the family dynasty politically alive – after touting his support of Trump during his campaign, with the president returning the favour in a Twitter endorsement. In the race for governor, Lupe Valdez, the former sheriff of Dallas county, faces a runoff with Andrew White, the son of former Texas governor Mark White. The eventual Democratic candidate faces a tough task against the popular and well-funded Republican incumbent, Greg Abbott. On a night in which women enjoyed notable successes, two Hispanic women, Sylvia Garcia and Veronica Escobar, won primaries in heavily Democratic districts and are likely in November to become the first Latina congresswomen from Texas. And a congressional Democratic hopeful who was castigated by her national party secured a runoff election. In an echo of the intra-party conflict between progressive and more centrist factions that split the Democrats in 2016, when Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton vied for the presidential nomination, Laura Moser, a writer and activist, will face off against Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a lawyer, on 22 May, after no Democratic candidate for Texas’s seventh district won more than 50% of the vote. “A lot of people in the state aren’t even in a party, they’re independents, so I think the fact that I’m sort of outside the box will help me,” Moser told the Guardian at a boisterous watch party in Houston. “I think that the people who will win up and down the ballot this year are going to be people who stand for, and by, their values, and I think it’s going to be like an existential moment for national Democrats. We’ve got to stand for something.” Texas’ seventh congressional district will be one of the most followed races nationally. Covering large swaths of Houston’s wealthy western suburbs, it has been reliably Republican since 1966, when George HW Bush, the former president, won the seat. He is a current resident. The incumbent, John Culberson, is a staunch conservative who took office in 2001. Eight years later, as the “birther” movement questioning Barack Obama’s citizenship gathered pace, he co-sponsored a bill that would have required future presidential candidates to prove their American citizenship. Yet the district narrowly plumped for Clinton ahead of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, seemingly putting it in play for 2018. Moser is a writer and activist who grew up in Houston and launched Daily Action, an anti-Trump resistance group, after the 2016 presidential election. Her husband, Arun Chaudhary, was the videographer for the Obama White House. Evidently believing that Moser is too progressive to win in November, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee issued a statement in February replete with the sort of negative research that might have been expected to come from one of her opponents. It described Moser as “a Washington insider” and referred to a magazine article from 2014 in which she wrote that she would “sooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia” than move to the small town of Paris, Texas. The statement misleadingly implied this was because she did not want to live in Texas, though the piece was about the pros and cons of big-city life. Rather than ruin Moser, the attention boosted her fundraising: her campaign picked up donations at a far higher rate than before."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/07/british-brexit-french-wine-france","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T16:30:19Z","webTitle":"The British have Brexit.

We French have our wine delusion","bodyText":"If you want to become – or remain – the president of France, you have to touch a cow. François Hollande touched a cow; Nicolas Sarkozy touched a cow; Jacques Chirac touched more cows than anyone can remember; and every party leader or Elysée hopeful has had to touch a cow at one point or other. It cannot be any cow: the ceremonial patting must occur at the Paris International Agricultural Show, an annual event that does exactly what it says on the tin, and is attended by every French politician worth their salt. The fair often becomes the scene of minor gaffes as senior politicos trip over themselves to show just how provincial and normal they are, with predictable results – a particularly amusing example in 2015 involved the then prime minister, Manuel Valls, getting thoroughly sloshed. Emmanuel Macron didn’t appear drunk at the agriculture show last week, but alcohol did end up causing him a headache. Speaking to journalists from the regional press, the president admitted to drinking wine every day “with lunch and dinner”, and being a staunch believer in his predecessor Georges Pompidou’s saying: “Don’t piss off the French.” “It is a danger to public health when young people binge-drink spirits or beer,” he added, “but wine isn’t the issue.” He then confirmed that his administration had no ambitions to make the Loi Évin, a law passed in 1991 putting restrictions on alcohol and tobacco, any stricter than it already is. This clearly didn’t go far enough for Christophe Castaner, the secretary of state for parliamentary relations, who took it upon himself to add in a TV interview: “Let’s not get carried away – there’s alcohol in wine, but it’s not strong alcohol. Wine is a part of our culture, our tradition, our national identity. It’s not our enemy.” Shockingly, this didn’t please everyone. In an open letter published by the newspaper Le Figaro on Monday, nine health professionals politely but firmly reminded the head of state and his minister that wine is – believe it or not – an alcoholic beverage like any other. “From the liver’s point of view, wine really is alcohol!” was the title of the letter, which pointed out that nearly 60% of all alcohol consumed in France is in wine, and that alcohol kills around 50,000 people a year in the country. That this needed to be said is quite remarkable, but perhaps unsurprising; behind that glass of red sipped at a family dinner lies an interesting quirk of the French, and how we like to see ourselves. You see, French people are civilised. They care about the food they eat and the bottles they carefully pick to go with it. They look down on anyone unsophisticated enough to suggest that their habits might not be as refined as they think. Sure, they might occasionally drink more wine than the food can soak up and find themselves horizontal, but they don’t get drunk like the British do. Over the Channel lies a an island of feral binge drinkers who do shots and throw up on themselves and pass out in public. Isn’t it ghastly? Like retired people showing their slides after a holiday, French expats in the UK and holidaymakers who have been there catalogue instances of the British binge culture –it’s almost a national sport. Of course, data collected by the World Health Organisation in 2015 shows that French people drink nearly as much as their British counterparts – 11.6 litres of pure alcohol per capita compared with 12 – but this doesn’t matter. Every country has their very own national delusions – Brexit certainly counts as one – and France is no exception. In a way, Macron embodies a lot of ours. He arrogantly charmed his way into the presidency, frequently pontificates about philosophy, unashamedly talks about his love of classical novels and poetry, and is passionate to the point of absurdity about the French language. France isn’t, in reality, the France we know from the movies, and everyone knows it deep down. But it doesn’t hurt to pretend once in a while. However, deciding that wine simply isn’t a normal alcoholic beverage because it happens to be quintessentially Gallic is not harmless, and though the current crop of politicians are knee-deep in patriotic cliches, future generations might finally decide to put health before tradition. They just need to make sure they touch a cow first, if they want anyone to pay attention. • Marie Le Conte is a French freelance journalist living in London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/08/the-outsider-review-jared-leto-joins-the-yakuza-in-crass-netflix-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"The Outsider review – Jared Leto joins the yakuza in crass Netflix thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/08/the-outsider-review-jared-leto-joins-the-yakuza-in-crass-netflix-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/08/the-outsider-review-jared-leto-joins-the-yakuza-in-crass-netflix-thriller","fields":{"headline":"The Outsider review – Jared Leto joins the yakuza in crass Netflix thriller","bodyText":"Blood is thicker than water, and as pulp fiction would have it, that viscosity is never denser than in the bustling underground of organized crime. They don’t call it a capital-F Family for nothing; trust is the only currency with any worth among gang types, and the type of alpha-male mentality lending itself to mob life favors members of its own pack. In Goodfellas, Henry Hill’s half-Irish lineage prevents him from ever graduating to a full-fledged “made man” in the mafia to which he pledges himself, no matter how hard he tries. (Not that pure Italian blood can save Tommy DeVito from the doom awaiting him.) Per the new Netflix release The Outsider, however, they’re playing it a little looser with assimilation in parts east. The latest feature from Denmark-born journeyman Martin Zandvliet shares more ancestry with films like Dances With Wolves and The Last Samurai than Martin Scorsese’s Cosa Nostra opus, narratives about white men rising to lead a foreign people instead of struggling for mere acceptance. The faulty gene in this family pool recurs once again as Nick Lowell (Jared Leto, an apt ambassador of whiteness if ever there was one) rises through the ranks of the Japanese gangsters known as yakuza. These films give lip service to a faux reverence for their subjects, but then reduce them to a collection of signifiers and monolithic character types before placing them in a position of inferiority to the white interloper. In its obsession with all things Japanese, the film places a special emphasis on the quality of humility. Nevertheless, the story ends with an elite corps of Asian assassins bowing to the former frontman for 30 Seconds to Mars. Post-second world war Osaka sets the scene for this culture clash, though the aesthetic of oppressive dark grey-ness suggests that the production crew shot inside a raincloud. We’re made to understand early on that Nick has earned his stripes among his adoptive brethren: while shuffling through janitorial work as a prisoner during the war’s final days, he saves some poor sap’s life after a brutal bathroom beating, who then offers him a gig once the unconditional surrender makes Nick a free man. Even before he’s tossed into the middle of a turf war, Nick honors and respects the Japanese and their ways of life, going so far as to pulverize a racist American GI still using slurs in conversation. Like the innumerable college students following in his path during semesters spent abroad, he takes a local lover and gets a cool fish tattoo after a few months. For a gaijin, a catchall term referring to anyone not of Asian descent, he’s pretty committed. But the film containing him may be better described with the newer invention of weeaboo, pejorative slang for white people with an off-putting, superficial attachment to the far east. Indeed, the film has a fetishistic relationship to Japanese elements that could have only come from someone who sees them as exotic, rather than intuitively understanding their place in society. Screenwriter Andrew Baldwin could have very well run a quick online search of “what are some Japanese things” as he awkwardly incorporated such regional touches as sumo wrestling, kabuki theater, and a traditional tea ceremony into his script. At a certain point, the Japanese actors filling out the smaller roles start to feel like set dressing tacked on for a little added authenticity. The tell, the dead giveaway that this film appreciates the concept of Japan far more than its reality, is Nick’s unequivocal victory over the civilization he purports to love. There’s real drama in the first half-hour or so, as Nick bumps up against the limits to which he can fully shed and remold his identity, but it disintegrates the moment the film decides those limits don’t have to exist. He’s got military training and all, but the notion that Nick could stroll right in and take over a complex criminal network suggests that his whiteness is the real secret weapon enabling him to beat the yakuza at their own game. If the film’s not going to interrogate the politics behind its core premise of an army man’s quest to out-Asian actual Asian men, it’s scarcely worth telling at all. Presumably, the great Japanese film-maker Takashi Miike had an answer in mind when he signed on to the project in 2014. It’s by no means impossible to carve a challenging, meaningful story out of difficult interchanges between the east and west. To return to Scorsese, consider Silence, a fine film about European men slowly realizing just how little they understand of Japan. But neither Zandvliet, Baldwin, nor Leto care to look beyond themselves. They’re worse than the simple gaijin, or the over-affectionate weeaboo – they’re tourists who think they own the place.

The struggling fashion chain has confirmed plans for a restructuring process called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which could involve the closure of more than a tenth of its 593 stores, while a further six sites have been sublet to third parties. The process, which is designed to help struggling companies stave off insolvency, must be approved by creditors including landlords at a meeting on 21 March, will also involve rent reductions at 393 stores. Alistair McGeorge, executive chairman of New Look, said: “Given our challenged trading performance and over-rented UK store estate, we are having to take tough but necessary actions to reduce our fixed cost base and restore long-term profitability. “We have held constructive discussions with our key landlords and strategic partners and will now seek creditor approval on our CVA proposal. A priority for us is to keep all potentially affected colleagues informed during this difficult time.” The company said it expected a maximum of 980 redundancies out of a workforce of 15,300 as a result of the store closures which would take place over the next six to nine months. It said efforts would be made to redeploy as many people as possible. McGeorge was parachuted in to lead the retailer late last year after sales and profits collapsed. He has said the previous management team led by Anders Kristiansen pushed up prices and started selling clothes that were “too young and edgy”. The likely New Look closures come amid a tough time on the high street which has seen a string of well known brands collapse or close stores. Toys R Us and electronics specialist Maplin both fell into administration last week while Mothercare has admitted it is in talks with its banks in an attempt to fund a turnaround plan that involves the closure of almost half of its 152 UK stores. Other chains including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and House of Fraser are also closing store space. Retailers are facing a pinch because shoppers are switching to buying online and tightening their belts as inflation outstrips wage increases. Other pressures include a rise in the legal minimum wage and business rates as well as the increase in the cost of buying in goods from overseas as a result of the Brexit-fuelled drop in the value of the pound. Daniel Butters, partner at Deloitte, which will be handling New Look’s CVA process, said: “The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels. “New Look is an iconic brand on the high street and the CVA will provide a stable platform upon which management’s turnaround plan can be delivered.” New Look stores identified for potential closure under the CVA proposal: Aberdeen – Bon Accord; Beckton; Bolton Mens; Borehamwood; Brynmawr; Burton Mens; Cameron Toll; Cardiff – Queen Arcade; Cheshunt; Clevedon; Craigleith; Doncaster Mens; Dundee – Wellgate; Exeter Mens; Fleet; Gateshead – Team Valley; Glasgow – Buchanan Street Mens; Gorleston; Hanley Mens – Intu Potteries; Hounslow Mens; Hull – Whitefriargate; Keynsham; Kingswood; Leeds – The Core Shopping Centre; Leicester – Haymarket; London – Marble Arch; London – Moorgate/ London Wall; London – Oxford Circus; Maidenhead; Maidstone Mens; Merry Hill Mens; Metro Centre – Mens; Monmouth; Newport Mens; Newton Mearns; North Shields; Nottingham Mens; Ocean Terminal; Peterbrough Bridge Street; Pontypool; Portswood; Ramsgate; Reading - Broad Street; Reading Oracle Mens; Rhyl; Romford Mens; Rugby; Shrewsbury Mens; Sidmouth; Stockport – Merseyway; Stockton-on-Tees; Stratford-on-Avon – Bridge Street; Thornaby; Tonypandy; Torquay – Union Street; Tredegar; Troon; Wallsend; Weston Favell; Wigan Mens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/07/the-fiver-tottenham-juventus-manchester-city-basel-basle-baarrrrlll-barzuhl-big-cup-baby","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T15:58:58Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Antiseptic game management and academic form completion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/07/the-fiver-tottenham-juventus-manchester-city-basel-basle-baarrrrlll-barzuhl-big-cup-baby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/07/the-fiver-tottenham-juventus-manchester-city-basel-basle-baarrrrlll-barzuhl-big-cup-baby","fields":{"headline":"Antiseptic game management and academic form completion","bodyText":"BIG ON CUP, LOW ON DRAMA Real Madrid turned up for work on Tuesday night, had a cup of tea, yawned, scratched their arse, and that was the end of Qatar FC. Meanwhile at Anfield, Iker Casillas, 63, made a couple of regulation saves and Liverpool fans patronised him to within an inch of his life. And that was that for another memorable evening of Big Cup entertainment. More, please, world’s most prestigious club football tournament! And sure enough, there will be more of it this very evening, as Manchester City welcome Basel/Basle/Baarrrrlll/Barzuhl to their home for a textbook display of antiseptic game management and academic form completion. Or maybe City will run in another four goals without reply. Thanks, world’s most prestigious, etc. More, more, more. To be scrupulously fair to Big Cup, it is at least a tournament still in the balance. Unlike the Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, the German Bundesliga, the Austrian Bundesliga, the Scottish Premiership, the Primeira Liga in Portugal, the Russian Premier League, the Swiss Super League, the Belgian First Division and the Dutch Eredivisie, we have no clear idea who is going to win it. Two potential champions face each other on Wednesday at Wembley, in fact, with Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus in serious danger of giving the viewing public across the continent something interesting and unpredictable to sink their teeth into. It’ll never catch on. Spurs go into this last-16 second leg having won the first meeting in Turin, if the celebratory mood in the British media was anything to go by. Hmm. They are leading the tie on away goals, though, so Harry Kane can continue his recent clodhopping habit of shanking simple chances miles wide from the edge of the six-yard box all evening long if he so desires, as long as the lads at the back let nothing in. The absence of Toby Alderweireld doesn’t help, admittedly, but on the other hand Serge Aurier is suspended, so it should be easier for Spurs to clear their lines now that keeping hold of possession at throw-ins is no longer a wild pipe dream. Juve obviously carry a mighty threat: they’ve won 14 of their last 15 matches, and would have won the other had Gonzalo Higuaín’s hat-trick penalty in the first leg flown in three weeks ago. They’ve also reached two of the last three Big Cup finals. But Spurs are unbeaten at home in seven matches against Italian opposition, while Juve have lost their last five European knockout ties against English clubs. Continue those trends, and Tottenham will have made it to the quarter-finals for just the third time in their otherwise storied history. Perhaps more importantly, it’d be one stage further than Arsenal managed last year. And the year before that, and the year before that, and the year before that, and the year before that, and the year before that, and the year before that. Much to play for in Big Cup, then.

Nightclub Patrick’s son Justin has received a first call-up to Ronald Koeman’s Netherlands squad for this month’s friendlies against England and Portugal. And in a big day for Nightclub Patrick, the man himself is being linked with Oxford United’s managerial vacancy.

The accused, Peter Madsen, pleaded not guilty as the trial opened at Copenhagen district court in what prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen has described as a “unusual and extremely brutal” case. Madsen is charged with murdering and dismembering Wall, along with a charge of sexual assault without intercourse of a particularly dangerous nature. He has admitted dismembering her body on board his submarine and dumping her body parts in the sea. Interest in the trial, which has seen 100 journalists from more 15 countries register to attend, also reflects the colourful profile of Peter Madsen, whose nine-year push to send himself into suborbital space on his own self-built rocket has made him a minor celebrity both in Denmark and internationally. Buch-Jepsen started the 12-day trial by reading the charges while Madsen, wearing glasses and a dark shirt, watched the prosecutor from his seat beside his defense lawyer. The defence lawyer, Betaina Hald Engmark, then formally entered a not-guilty plea to the murder charge. “The accused denies voluntary manslaughter, but admits violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse,” his lawyer Betina Hald Engmark said in court. Under the Danish penal code, manslaughter is used to describe the deliberate killing of a person and there is no distinction between manslaughter and murder. Involuntary manslaughter is used when the killing is not intentional. Buch-Jepsen plans to push for a life sentence, the most severe punishment possible in Denmark and one normally reserved for those who have killed multiple victims or children. The prosecution believes Madsen killed Wall to fulfil sadistic sexual fantasies, tying her up and beating and stabbing her, and then either strangling her to death or beheading her. Buch-Jepsen will run through the evidence that the murder was pre-planned, including the saw, knife, plastic strips, and metal tubing Madsen brought on board. He told the court that Madsen had scratches on his underarms and Kim Wall’s blood flecked on his left nostril, though his DNA was not found on her body. Madsen himself will on Thursday afternoon take the stand, the first time the 47-year-old will be able explain in court why he claimed in a pre-trial hearing that Wall’s skull had been shattered by a metal latch falling on her head. This claim was disproved a month later when Wall’s head was discovered without skull injuries by police divers in October. Madsen has since confessed to sawing off Wall’s limbs and head, but he has so far continued to insist that she died in an accident, claiming she died of asphyxiation in the submarine’s cabin while he directed the vessel from the surface. The trial will be held over 12 days in March and April, with the verdict expected on 25 April, but may be delayed if days are postponed due to a strike planned by court employees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/07/west-virginia-teachers-strike-workers-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T14:54:02Z","webTitle":"West Virginia teachers' triumph offers fresh hope for US workers' rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/west-virginia-teachers-strike-workers-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/west-virginia-teachers-strike-workers-rights","fields":{"headline":"West Virginia teachers' triumph offers fresh hope for US workers' rights","bodyText":"West Virginia teachers expressed joy on Wednesday as officials settled a historic nine-day strike to conclude the first statewide work stoppage since 1990. Outside her local union’s party at the Cozumel Mexican restaurant in Ripley, Adena Barnette, the 36-year-old president of Jackson County Education, said: “It means that I get to stay in West Virginia. “I am a single teacher, and it was getting to the point where I was afraid that I was going to have to move away if these things weren’t corrected.” Barnette said she hoped the teachers’ success would help restore West Virginia’s place in American labor history. The state was once one of the strongholds of organized labor. Barnette was in third grade when the state’s teachers last went on strike. “The seeds of what they did in 1990 were planted in me and they just came to bloom,” she said. On Tuesday, Governor Jim Justice passed a law granting all public employees – not just teachers – a 5% across-the-board raise. This raise will probably halt talk among public employee unions about striking, as the legislation initially proposed had public employees slated for smaller raises than the teachers. But the money for the raises will come from cuts to other areas of the budget – including potential reductions to Medicaid – rather than taxes on fracking companies, as the union and its allies preferred. Governor Justice, however, vowed to veto any bills that would fund charter schools, strip teachers of their seniority, or reduce or remove the deduction of union dues from their paychecks – even if those dues are applied to political work. The deal will also freeze all out-of-pocket healthcare costs under the WV Public Employees Insurance Agency (PEIA). A taskforce composed of some union representatives will then convene to present a long-term solution to fixing PEIA. Many teachers were disappointed that a long-term fix to PEIA was not paid for by increased taxes on the natural gas industry, which has come to dominate the local economy. “We’re happy, but it’s a mixed emotions kind of happy,” said Kim Martin, a shop steward at Triadelphia middle school in Wheeling. “We’ve made sacrifices and won some victories but we have to stay vigilant in the future.” With the taskforce expected to present its report in October, the union hopes to shine a spotlight right before the November election upon state legislators blocking long-term reforms to the state’s health insurance plan. “This isn’t the end of the battle, because teachers are still not paid well enough and they still don’t have enough resources,” said the American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten. “But in West Virginia, lawmakers were put on notice that they needed to act in the best interests of kids and workers, not for special interests. And if they didn’t learn that lesson through this strike, workers will make sure they learn it in November.” Many teachers interviewed by the Guardian said the public support they received during the strike gave them a new sense of political power – a power they intend to use. Barnette said: “I think the righteousness of the cause led people to continue to support us, and I believe teachers have learned that they can no longer be passive when it comes to politics.” The strike is also likely to have a positive effect on the morale of teachers in other states who are fighting cuts driven by legislators’ unpopular austerity plans. Last week, teachers in nearby Pittsburgh, which shares a media market with much of West Virginia, voted to strike within 96 hours unless their demands were met. Administrators in Pittsburgh conceded to the union and within two days signed a new contract that met most of the teachers’ demands. In Oklahoma, teachers earning even less than their West Virginia colleagues announced that they have been in communication as they plan a similar statewide walkout. A recent survey by the Oklahoma Education Association of its 10,000 members found that 80% of them supported a strike. “A school closure is a last resort, but we are preparing for such an event in case the legislature refuses to show bold leadership and act,” the Oklahoma Education Association president, Alicia Priest, told the Oklahoman. In an era in which labor is facing serious attacks from the US supreme court and Republican-controlled legislatures, many veterans of the movement say the victory in West Virginia has given workers the spark to keep fighting. “West Virginia has a long history of labor activism – where right often met might. Today, right beat might in the truest tradition of Mother Jones,” said Weingarten."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/06/poland-antisemitism-nationalism-holocaust","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T12:55:52Z","webTitle":"Poland’s nationalists are burying their antisemitic past – this is dangerous | Przemyslaw Wielgosz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/poland-antisemitism-nationalism-holocaust","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/poland-antisemitism-nationalism-holocaust","fields":{"headline":"Poland’s nationalists are burying their antisemitic past – this is dangerous","bodyText":"A war is being fought over collective memory in Poland. In the absence of a convincing vision of the future, the ability to control definitions of the past has become one of the most important sources of legitimacy in Polish politics. But if the historicisation of policy is a game played by all sides, the conservative, nationalist right is the most consistent and effective player. Its strategy is well illustrated by the current conflict over the act that enshrines the legal status of the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN). The government presented the bill as a way to eliminate a discourse about “Polish death camps” during the Holocaust. The government says this discussion falsely accuses Poles of complicity in the murder of 3 million Polish Jews under Nazi occupation and is spreading throughout the world. The majority of the opposition either abstained or supported the government, with the main objection coming from liberal media where the law was criticised for provisions that introduced historical censorship. Under the guise of defending the good name of “The Polish Nation” the bill opens the way to criminalising anyone who seeks to reveal dark chapters of Polish history, such as antisemitic pogroms before, during and after the war. But this is a veneer. What is truly at stake is not Poland’s reputation, but Polish nationalist rightwing tradition. The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) makes no secret of the fact that it is part of this tradition. The language and ideas of PiS leaders, as well as their policies towards refugees, minorities and political opposition, draw directly from the rhetoric and strategy of Polish nationalism in the first half of the 20th century. Before the second world war the Polish nationalist movement was furiously antisemitic. Organisations including ONR-Falanga, the Camp of Great Poland, the National party and the Camp of National Unity had between them hundreds of thousands of members organised on the model of Italian and German fascists. They organised a boycott of Jewish shops and companies, as well as militias that physically attacked representatives of the Jewish community. Between 1935 and 1937 a wave of antisemitic pogroms passed through Poland. The most important centres of antisemitic violence were universities and university cities, which were controlled by the nationalist right. At universities, with the support of their authorities, the “ghetto benches” (special pews for Jews) were introduced, and the number of Jewish students reduced. Those who remained were regularly harassed and beaten. Antisemitic violence spread from cities to the provinces. Areas in which the nationalists’ influence was strong in the 1930s became the most dangerous for Jews during the war and occupation. Marches and boycotts gave way to more deadly attacks. In some places – Jedwabne, Radziłów, Wąsosz, Szczuczyn – thousands of Jews were murdered by Poles in the summer of 1941. The last phase of the Holocaust (1943-44) saw Jewish “runaways” escaping ghettos hunted and denounced. Polish antisemitism still has a very specific political face. It is the work and the tool of the nationalist right. This is PiS’s history and presents a problem for the party. Restoring this part of our national memory corrupts the image of Poland’s rulers, and so PiS seeks to close the mouths of those historians who remind us of the crimes of Polish nationalism. Jarosław Kaczyński’s party wants to blur the memory of an important element of its own identity and to purge itself of a murky heritage of pogroms and denunciations. But that is not all. The more effectively Poland’s rulers can create a collective amnesia, the easier it will be for them to turn this heritage into a present-day reality – by organising a campaign of suspicion towards strangers, spreading hatred towards refugees and feminists, and turning a blind eye to fascists from ONR and All-Polish Youth and the increasing attacks on migrants. While whitewashing its own history, the party seeks to blame its opponents on the left for the antisemitic crimes of the past. We see this in the prose of the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, when he suggested that the pogrom in Kielce in 1946 was the work of communist provocateurs, and not a population imbued with the antisemitic propaganda of the National Armed Forces – a nationalist armed organisation that was particularly strong in this region. And so instead the antisemitic crimes of the past are represented as features of singular, depraved perpetrators rather than as the consequence of political movements and currents which we continue to see glimpses of today. Cleared of all charges, PiS can now level them at others instead – at the opposition, at critical historians and journalists – and in doing so deprive them of their legitimacy and of their right to participate in the politics of Poland now, and in the future. • Przemysław Wielgosz is editor of Le Monde diplomatique’s Polish edition"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/men-after-metoo-masculinity-fundamentally-toxic","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T14:00:39Z","webTitle":"Men after #MeToo: ‘There’s a narrative that masculinity is fundamentally toxic'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/men-after-metoo-masculinity-fundamentally-toxic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/09/men-after-metoo-masculinity-fundamentally-toxic","fields":{"headline":"Men after #MeToo: ‘There’s a narrative that masculinity is fundamentally toxic'","bodyText":"One of the first things I discovered at the men’s group was that most men are scared of other men. Here we all were, 25 or so specimens of metropolitan masculinity, gathered in a London yoga studio to spend our Saturday learning how to “get vulnerable” with Rebel Wisdom, a newly formed men’s collective. “In today’s world, for men to be vulnerable and speak their truth is an act of rebellion,” says its chic new age website. “We exist to fuel this rebellion.” In practice, this meant we were going to spend a day doing breathing exercises, talking about our fathers, pretending to be tigers, leaning on one another, working out which Jungian archetypes we vibed with, and trying to articulate why we all felt so defensive and angry and misunderstood so much of the time. But first we had to stand in a circle and say how we were feeling. And one by one, the men – mostly in their mid-30s, mostly straight, mostly white – said they were afraid. One guy, a straight-talking youth worker, reckoned that if the estate kids he worked with could see him now, they’d rip the piss and would probably be right to. Another, extremely gaunt and pale, had recently suffered a huge emotional and physical breakdown, and confessed that this was the first time he had been out in weeks. When it came to my turn, I said I was hungover. (Humour is a good way of deflecting uncomfortable feelings, I find.) Then I tried a bit harder: “I can’t remember the last time I was in a room with all men,” I said. “I actively avoid these situations. And maybe that’s quite strange.” The next thing I learned was that men – at least the sort who come to men’s groups – are quite nice, really. No one laughed or took the piss. We all listened sympathetically to each other talking about sporting humiliations and paternal misunderstandings. The organisers promised there would be no group hugs, but there were lots of group hugs. They also exhorted us to be honest. “What if you just told the Truth?” the invite read. I left feeling lighter, warmer, but no wiser as to what that truth might be. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but men are not exactly giving the best account of themselves at the moment. Every week brings another high-profile reminder of unhealthy masculinity, from Harvey Weinstein to Aziz Ansari to the former Oxfam boss Roland van Hauwermeiren. Clearly, something needs to shift. Like all the male friends I’ve spoken to recently, I’ve found the current reckoning disorienting at times, shaming at others, but mostly exciting, necessary and liberating. I’ve seen the overwhelmingly positive effect it’s had on many women in my life. But there are moments – say when I’m happily cooking with my son – when the dominant narrative of masculinity as toxic, entitled, corrupt, dysfunctional and so on seems a little limiting. If you’ve always found men such as Weinstein despicable and pathetic, it’s disorienting to find yourself in the same category as him by virtue of also having a penis. A couple of times, I’ve begun the sentence: “You know, not all men… ” only to recall that that in itself is seen as a dick move. And there are clearly dissonances in political, legal and psychological notions of gender that require careful unpicking: for example, the feminist notion that masculinity is in full control of itself and consciously uses sex to cement its power doesn’t quite tally with our understanding of the subconscious. Masculinity is very rarely under control and sexual abuse is often perpetrated by men who are threatened (often by other men), vulnerable, damaged, lashing out. Not that this insight can be expected to provide solace for their victims. Perhaps all the moment requires is for men to shut up and listen, something many clearly find hard. But watching the hashtags accrue – #menaretrash, etc – it’s often hard to discern any positive role for men, beyond apologetic retweeters of feminist memes. And there’s a wider defensiveness around masculinity. The comedian Robert Webb titled his memoir How Not To Be A Boy: a negative inversion of Caitlin Moran’s celebratory How To Build A Girl. “If you want a vision of masculinity,” Webb writes, “imagine Dr Frankenstein being constantly bum-raped by his own monster while shouting, ‘I’m fine, everyone! I’m absolutely fine!’” But as we know, men are not fine. Boys get worse grades than girls. Suicide is the biggest killer of men under 35; men also report significantly lower life satisfaction than women. According to statistics compiled by the Men’s Health Forum, men make up 76% of all suicides, 95% of the prison population, 73% of adults who go missing and 87% of rough sleepers. A key part of this is men’s reluctance to seek help. Last year’s cross-party Jo Cox Commission described male loneliness as a “silent epidemic”: more than one in 10 say they are lonely but won’t usually admit it. “One of the problems is that in the last 10 years or so, the world hasn’t really been interested in the psychology of gender,” says the psychotherapist Nick Duffell. “What we’ve been interested in are transgender issues and free choice and pronouns and gender as a social construct and abuses of power. But one of the things I’ve been working with is how powerless men often feel in the private sphere. Men are very unskilled when it comes to relationships and dealing with their emotions. We need to train them to be better at vulnerability, better at relating – and when they begin to do that, the power they develop is more authentic.” It is a few weeks after the men’s group and I have come to the launch of something called (for now) Men’s Movement 2.0 at 42 Acres, a “transformational” space in east London. The scent of orange blossom is in the air; green creepers hang from the ceiling; amethyst crystals are warding off bad energy and, hopefully, any men’s rights activist (MRA) types who might mistake this for some sort of alt-right/anti-feminist hate-in. The men here are keen to distinguish themselves from these “MRAs” – who they feel have given men’s groups a bad name – and instead look back to the original men’s movement, which had its origins in the early 1970s as a male adjunct to radical feminism, and went on to give the world terms such as “male bonding”, as well as the 1990s bestseller Iron John by the American poet Robert Bly, who urged men to locate their “Zeus energy” and “sun-like grandeur”. Among those present are Kenny “the Man Whisperer” Mammarella-D’Cruz, who hosts informal drop-in sessions for men; Nathan Roberts of the charity A Band of Brothers, which pairs elder male mentors with young ex-offenders; and Paul Robson of the Nordic Men’s Gathering. Still, the fact that the Weinstein scandal has broken between this event and the last one – as well as the female “allies” in the audience this time – might explain why the atmosphere is a little more charged than it was a few weeks before. At the outset, David Fuller, 42, a film-maker and one of the founders of Rebel Wisdom, outlines what Men’s Movement 2.0 hopes to achieve. He has been on a personal journey these past few years, he explains, and of all the “work” he has done – from psychedelics to tantra – he has gained most from “men’s work”: men coming together in small groups, “holding space”, sharing their “fierce loving energy” and helping each other grow. Women give birth to boys, but men give birth to men is an axiom of the movement. A man must “do the work” to develop his own independence and grow into a “relaxed masculine confidence” that is not threatened by the feminine. Something magical and unexpected happens when men help each other do this, Fuller believes – and it’s something the world is calling out for in 2018. “Around the election of Donald Trump, it felt really significant that a lot of issues around masculinity were being reflected in the culture,” he tells the 60 or so attendees. “How is it possible that a man who boasts of sexual assault can be elected to the most significant public role in the world? It spoke to a deep dysfunction around our ideas of healthy masculinity. But, at the same time, there’s a narrative that there’s something about masculinity that’s fundamentally toxic.” What we need to do as a society – but particularly as men – he says, is to redefine “healthy masculinity”. A masculinity that is no better or worse than femininity, but that stands as its opposite, equal pole. One of the themes that has come to the fore is that women shouldn’t have to perform the emotional labour of teaching men how not to harass and assault them – just as it shouldn’t be down to people of colour to call out and explain racism. Reflect. Be humble. Work this out. Admit fault. This seems compatible with the core precept of men’s work, which involves men sorting out their shit with other men. But the question is, when men get together to talk about men, do they say the sorts of things that women would like to hear? As the Men’s Movement 2.0 launch gets underway, I’m not so sure. There is lots of talk about anima and animus, about how men need to make peace with their inner feminine. The lack of male role models and masculine rites of passage is mourned. Duffell, a veteran of the first men’s movement, talks about how important it is for men to learn to admit their vulnerability. “We’ve been educated out of vulnerability!” Then an audience member becomes frustrated and asks why we’re talking about our feelings when violent male fascists are marching on the streets in Poland. “But how does that make you feel?” Duffell asks. “It makes me angry!” the audience member says. “So why don’t you just say that? I’m angry and scared!” Rafia Morgan, another veteran facilitator, talks about the origins of the men’s movement at Berkeley, California, in 1968. Then we watch a video from a Nordic Men’s Gathering, whose founder, Paul Robson, tells us that in egalitarian Sweden they’re about five years ahead of us in their approach to gender and celebrate strong healthy masculinity. Nathan Roberts of A Band of Brothers talks about how older men are a “vast, untapped social resource” and encourages us all to volunteer to help vulnerable younger men. Someone asks if gay men have a role in the movement. “Yes! All are welcome!” Then we spend a long time discussing whether Men’s Movement 2.0 is a good name. Finally, someone remarks that it would be interesting to hear from one of the women in the room. “Come on, girls, speak up!” One woman says she’s been leading feminist groups for years and it’s interesting how similar the discussions are: “Obviously, there’s a different energy, and it’s complicated where the patriarchy starts coming in,” she says. “But we’ve been doing this sort of work for a long time and we talk about similar things.” Surprisingly, this is the first time anyone has mentioned the word “patriarchy”, and it produces a frisson. Roberts steps up: “For me, it’s about the idea that we’re equal, but different,” he says. “I have a biochemical experience based on testosterone; a woman has a biochemical experience based on oestrogen. It’s a different sort of consciousness, in my belief. But there’s also a historical aspect. We as men have denied the effects of patriarchy for centuries. We can’t deny that. But if we lump all men and patriarchy in together, men end up nailed to the tree of history and feel a sense of shame that they will never escape from.” “Stop calling it patriarchy!” comes a voice from the crowd – an angry-looking guy with a ZZ Top-style beard – possibly a stray men’s rights activist. “We shouldn’t gender a co-created system!” “But the reality is, at the top of our society, the vast majority of people are men,” Roberts continues. “The question is how to differentiate that from masculinity itself.” “But do we really need to differentiate it?” Everyone turns to Robson, the Swedish guy. “It sounds to me that there’s some sort of negative association there. What you see in the most gender-equal societies like Sweden is that it’s still the males at the top, and there’s actually a lower percentage of females in leadership positions. For me this idea that we should smash the patriarchy, that men in power are evil, this is quite misguided, you know? Western society is actually kind of OK compared with any other society that’s ever existed. And it was built by a patriarchal system. These are guys working hard to make the world a better place. Yes, there’s corruption and so forth, but actually I think we’re doing better than anywhere else in the whole world.” I notice Fuller and Morgan exchanging a pained glance. Two of the women behind me snort. “For fuck’s sake…” After the talk, I approach Robson and ask him to elaborate. “Well, I don’t want to be fact-checked on this, but the more equal a society becomes, the greater the specific psychological difference between the genders becomes. I got that off a Jordan Peterson video, but he’s kind of an expert on the issue, right?” Peterson is a controversial Canadian psychologist and mythographer, whose recent bestseller, 12 Rules for Life, urges disillusioned young men to “take responsibility”. He spends a lot of time talking about masculine order and feminine chaos, and is a favourite of the Rebel Wisdom crew, too. I ask Robson what he thinks of society’s current discussions ongender. “I see a lot of good things in the #MeToo campaign, but I also see a lot of angry women,” he says. “All these women are angry at the masculine and they’re angry at men, and this is not helping the guys who are already feeling insecure in their masculinity.” Maybe they’re not trying to help men, I say, maybe they’re trying to help other women? Robson seems disappointed with the way the evening has gone. “There is this feminine way of talking here in the UK, it’s very passive-aggressive.” You could call it respectful? “The problem is that there’s a polite surface and underneath things get really angry.” He worries darkly that Europe could be about to see an uprising of the far right, precisely because we haven’t located our “healthy masculine”. Other men seem to be frustrated, too. Nelson Melina wasn’t sure we got to grips with patriarchy: “There are some men at the top of society who make decisions, sure. But competence is not a bad thing. Oppression is what’s bad. I don’t subscribe to this idea that we live in a system of victims and oppressors. There are different games that can be played in life, you have advantages in some, you have disadvantages in others.” Jason Ho, one of a handful of gay men here, tells me the presence of women made everyone too cautious. “I think if we were in a room with all men, the conversation would have gone differently. We would have got to the patriarchy question much quicker. With women around, it’s more formal, there’s less banter and cut and thrust.” He says his entire social life consists of men’s groups. “I wanted more from life, I wanted more from myself and more from other people. Before, I just didn’t have many straight male friends. And I feel so close to my brothers now. I don’t want to socialise in standard social scenarios any more.” The patriarchy question is one that has been exercising Dave Pickering for some time. A London-based writer and performer, he interviewed 1,000 men about patriarchy for his live show, Mansplaining Masculinity, which he is now turning into a book via the crowdfunding publisher Unbound. About 85% of the men he interviewed thought patriarchy exists; some thought it was a good thing; some didn’t; some protested about the premise of the question; others cut-and-pasted the dictionary definition (“a system in which men have all or most of the power and importance in a society or group”). But it did provoke unexpected confessions. “A lot of men talked about being unfairly promoted, and not doing enough domestic chores,” Pickering says. “But a few were really surprising. One man said, ‘I raped my girlfriend because I didn’t know what rape was.’” Pickering feels one of the reasons men become so defensive about patriarchy is the idea that they are supposed to be benefiting from it when, in fact, so many of us are suffering under it. “The main breadwinner is not a pleasant place to be. The person who is expected to use violence to defend people is not a healthy place to be. More men are in prison, more men are in the army, men are more likely to hurt other men, and it’s usually because they’re policing masculinity. My mum told me that men are wrong and men are sick. That’s something I internalised. And that’s part of patriarchy. Hating ourselves is social conditioning, this idea that there’s only one way to be, and if we don’t feel that way, we should be ashamed.” Pickering has come to question the entire idea of gender, believing it’s just another way for society to categorise us. As loaded a term as “masculinity” doesn’t begin to reflect the range of experiences and thoughts and feelings that men actually have. Soon after the launch, the tensions in the Men’s Movement 2.0 inevitably rise to the surface. Everyone seems to have found Robson too aggressive. There are further disagreements about whether to call it a men’s movement at all. When I describe all this to my wife, she seem unsurprised that we lacked direction. “When women get together, we don’t talk about femininity. We talk about rights.” Perhaps with no specific political cause to rally around, men have nothing else to contemplate other than our wounded feelings. But that’s still a lot to contemplate – and even if no one can agree on what to call the movement, it seems to be gathering pace. Fuller recently flew out to Canada to interview Jordan Peterson for his new Rebel Wisdom multimedia channel, and plans a series of intensive men’s retreats for the summer. You could spend all summer at similar events: at Hero’s Journey, a weekender in Wiltshire, men are encouraged to live out the transformation process of ancient myths in a woodland: “We’re offering this retreat as a safe space, in which – supported by the fellowship of a group of men – you can move towards a chosen new dream or goal, face your fears and learn from them, and open to new inspiration and direction,” says “holistic explorer” Will Gethin. When I meet Morgan for coffee a few weeks later, he remains convinced that the men’s work he helped pioneer at Berkeley in the early 70s is precisely what the moment requires. Only he points to a difference in scale. Back then, the aim was to reach hundreds of people. In the digital age, a few well-placed memes and YouTube videos mean that men’s work could reach millions. Every generation has to learn these lessons for itself, and Morgan recognises in the younger men he mentors many of the conflicts he was working through when his mind was blown by the radical feminists of the early 70s. He moved into a house of male radicals who saw themselves as feminist allies, launched a men’s radio station and held co-counselling sessions. But at one of these sessions, he had an epiphany. “I remember listening to all these polite, middle-class men, full of guilt, full of anger, full of despair… And I had this image of them sawing their own balls off.” He was “completely lost” at the time. His father had just died and he become a father himself, unexpectedly: a woman had become pregnant with his child, deliberately and without his consent, he says, which left him confused and angry. But then he walked into a “bioenergetic men’s encounter group”, an offshoot of the human potential movement then taking shape in California. “These guys just saw me for who I was. I was completely out of touch with my anger. And I just had this anger fit in front of them all.” He has now been leading men’s groups for 40 years. “What it’s so good at doing is breaking down the traditional ways men are supposed to relate,” he explains. “I find men incredibly generous with one another when they come together like that. There’s an implicit support for all men, the wounded men, the insecure men.” The message he finds himself giving, time and time again, is that men need to work on being present. Simply listening. “I find a present man is by his nature solid, loving, kind, protective. He’s not threatened by his own femininity, or the external feminine. He knows how to make women feel valued. And the problem is, women feel devalued by a patriarchal culture that’s run by castrated men and other devalued women.” I can’t argue with Morgan’s central conceit that it’s a good idea for men to be present, but isn’t it a good idea for women to be present, too? I’m not sure my own experiences with men’s groups have left me more embodied in my masculinity (no doubt I haven’t gone deep enough). I also wonder if viewing everything through the prism of masculinity really helps men to be better men. If I didn’t spend much time worrying about whether I was being true to my gender identity beforehand, I sure as hell did afterwards. Still, I take some comfort from the main thing I learned from men’s groups. Not one of us has a clue what he’s doing. I think it’s one reason many men are finding this moment so hard: we are perceived to have the power, yet most of us feel powerless in relation to our own lives, emotions, relations. You get a real rush when you admit that in front of another man, and another rush when you hear pretty much the same thing echoed back. It may not be much to work with, but it’s a start.

But once he was a Qeerroo: a young, energetic and unmarried man from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, the Oromo, bound by what he calls a “responsibility to defend the people”. Twelve years ago he helped organise mass protests against an election result he and many others believed the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) had rigged. This landed him in prison, along with thousands of others, on terrorism charges. Since then he has married and, like many of his generation in Ethiopia, mostly avoided politics. That was until 12 February, when he joined almost everyone in the town of Adama, and in many others cities across the region of Oromia, in a strike calling for the release of opposition leaders and an end to authoritarianism. The boycott, which lasted three days and brought much of central Ethiopia to a standstill, culminated on 13 February with the release of Bekele Gerba, a prominent Oromo politician who lives in Adama, and, within 48 hours, the sudden resignation of Ethiopia’s beleaguered prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn. The shaken federal government then declared a nationwide state-of-emergency on 15 February, the second in as many years. “It was a total shutdown,” says Desalegn, of the strike in Adama. “Almost everybody took part – including government offices. You wouldn’t have even been able to find a shoeshine boy here.” For him and many other residents of Adama, about 90km south-east of the capital, Addis Ababa, there is only one explanation for how a normally quiescent town finally joined the uprising that has billowed across much of Oromia and other parts of Ethiopia since late 2014: the Qeerroo. Who the Qeerroo are, and how they have helped bring one of Africa’s strongest and most autocratic governments to its knees, is only dimly understood. In traditional Oromo culture the term denotes a young bachelor. But today it has broader connotations, symbolising both the Oromo movement – a struggle for more political freedom and for greater ethnic representation in federal structures – and an entire generation of newly assertive Ethiopian youth. “They are the voice of the people,” explains Debela, a 32-year-old taxi driver in Adama who says he is too old to be one but that he supports their cause. “They are the vanguard of the Oromo revolution.” The term’s resurgence also reflects the nature of Oromo identity today, which has grown much stronger since Ethiopia’s distinct model of ethnically based federalism was established by the EPRDF in 1994. “In the past even to be seen as Oromo was a crime,” says Desalegn, of the ethnic assimilation policies pursued by the two preceding Ethiopian regimes, imperial and communist. “But now people are proud to be Oromo … So the Qeerroos are emboldened.” As the Oromo movement has grown in confidence in recent years, so the role of the Qeerroo in orchestrating unrest has increasingly drawn the attention of officials. At the start of the year police announced plans to investigate and crack down on the Qeerroo, arguing that it was a clandestine group bent on destabilising the country and seizing control of local government offices. Party sympathisers accused members of being terrorists. Though many dispute this characterisation, few doubt the underground strength of the Qeerroo today. Since the previous state of emergency was lifted last August, Qeerroo networks have been behind multiple strikes and protests in different parts of Oromia, despite obstacles like the total shutdown of mobile internet in all areas beyond the capital since the end of last year. Bekele Gerba, the opposition leader, credits the Qeerroo with securing his release from prison, and for sending hundreds of well-wishers to his home in Adama in the aftermath. But like many older activists, he confesses to limited knowledge of how they organise themselves. “I only became aware of them relatively recently,” he says. “We don’t know who the leadership is and we don’t know if they have a central command.” But in a recent interview with the Guardian, two local leaders in Adama, Haile and Abiy (not their real names), shed light on their methods. According to the two men, who are both in their late 20s, each district of the city has one Qeerroo leader, with at least 20 subordinates, all of whom are responsible for disseminating messages and information about upcoming strikes. They say their networks have become better organised in recent months, explaining that there is now a hierarchical command chain and even a single leader for the whole of Oromia. “This gives us discipline and allows us to speak with one voice,” says Abiy. Their job has become more difficult in the absence of the internet. “With social media you can disseminate the message in seconds,” says Abiy. “Now it can take two weeks, going from door to door.” Instead of using WhatsApp and Facebook, they now distribute paper flyers, especially on university campuses. The role of Oromo activists among the diaspora, especially those in the US, also remains crucial, despite the shutdown. Zecharias Zelalem, an Ethiopian journalist based in Canada, argues that it is thanks to prominent social media activists that the Qeerroo have acquired the political heft that youth movements in other parts of the country still lack. He highlights in particular the work of Jawar Mohammed, the controversial founder of the Minnesota-based Oromia Media Network (which is banned in Ethiopia), in amplifying the voice of the Qeerroo even when internet is down. “[Jawar] gives us political analyses and advice,” Haile explains. “He can get access to information even from inside the government, which he shares with the Qeerroos. We evaluate it and then decide whether to act on it.” He and Abiy both dismiss the assumption, widespread in Ethiopia, that Jawar remote-controls the protests. “The Qeerroos are like a football team,” counters Haile. “Jawar may be the goalkeeper – helping and advising – but we are the strikers.” The reimposition of the state-of-emergency has angered many Qeerroos in Adama and elsewhere in Oromia, where the move was widely seen as heavy-handed bid to reverse the protesters’ momentum. Some analysts fear further repression will push members of a still mostly peaceful political movement towards violence and extremism. Many in the government, as well as in other parts of the country, worry about a rise in ethnically motivated attacks, on people and property, and especially on ethnic Tigrayans, who make up about 6% of the population but are generally considered to dominate politics and business. Late last year federal troops were dispatched to university campuses, in large part due to escalating ethnic violence, which included several deaths. There were reports of similar incidents during protests throughout the past month. Jibril Ummar, a local businessman and activist, says that he and others tried to ensure the protests in Adama were peaceful, calming down overexcited young men who wanted to damage property and attack non-Oromos. “It worries me,” he admits. “There’s a lack of maturity. When you are emotional you put the struggle in jeopardy.” Gerba says he worries about violence, too, including of the ethnic kind. “We know for sure that Tigrayans are targeted most, across the country. This concerns me very much and it is something that has to be worked on.” In the coming days the EPRDF will decide on a new prime minister, and many hope it will be someone from the Oromo People’s Democratic Organisation (OPDO), the Oromo wing of the ruling coalition. This might placate some of the Qeerroo, at least in the short term. But it is unlikely to be enough on its own to dampen the anger. “When we are married we will retire from the Qeerroo,” says Haile. “But we will never do that until we get our freedom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/07/vatican-hosts-first-hackathon-to-tackle-global-issues","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Vatican hosts first hackathon to tackle global issues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/vatican-hosts-first-hackathon-to-tackle-global-issues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/07/vatican-hosts-first-hackathon-to-tackle-global-issues","fields":{"headline":"Vatican hosts first hackathon to tackle global issues","bodyText":"The Vatican is to host its first hackathon this week, harnessing the technological skills and creativity of students from more than 50 universities around the world to tackle issues identified as priorities by Pope Francis. About 120 students and 35 mentors will gather in Rome over three days to focus on social inclusion, migrants and refugees, and interfaith dialogue. “The aim is to bring people with backgrounds in technology, business, civil society and the humanities together to bring new perspectives to key global issues,” said Father Eric Salobir, a Catholic priest and president of the research and innovation network Optic. The VHacks event is being organised in partnership with some of the world’s biggest tech companies, including Google and Microsoft. Participating students come from a range of backgrounds. “There is a minority of Catholics. We have a big number of Muslims taking part and also Jews and people of no faith. There is a gender balance, and all five continents are represented,” said Jakub Florkiewicz, a technology consultant and organiser of VHacks. The pope has spoken of the potential of technology and science to increase knowledge and understanding, but has also urged innovation to be coupled with equality and social inclusion. He has warned young people of the limits of tech-based interactions, saying social media are no substitute for human connection, and he has highlighted the risks as well as benefits of artificial intelligence. This year he told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland: “Artificial intelligence, robotics and other technological innovations must be so employed that they contribute to the service of humanity and to the protection of our common home, rather than to the contrary. It is vital to safeguard the dignity of the human person.” Salobir said: “Because [the pope] points to dangers doesn’t mean he’s anti-technology. It’s the way it’s utilised. He is really concerned about a certain type of technology related to a certain type of capitalism.” He said the hackathon was “a sign of the transformation of the [Catholic] church led by Pope Francis. It’s a way to bring fresh air, youth and technology inside the Vatican, and to get these students to concentrate their energies on real problems.” The church had a high level of engagement with big global technology companies, “but this is not done in front of the microphones. It’s discreet,” he said. The students will be divided into teams tackling different themes. The event, which begins on Thursday, will conclude with an award for the most innovative contribution combining technology and human values."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/09/swipe-left-swipe-left-online-dating-with-a-side-order-of-brexit-podcasts-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"Swipe Left Swipe Left: online dating with a side order of Brexit – podcasts of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/09/swipe-left-swipe-left-online-dating-with-a-side-order-of-brexit-podcasts-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/09/swipe-left-swipe-left-online-dating-with-a-side-order-of-brexit-podcasts-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Swipe Left Swipe Left: online dating with a side order of Brexit – podcasts of the week","bodyText":"Picks of the week: GrownUpLand, This Is Love and Swipe Left Swipe Left GrownUpLand Podcast Radio 4’s new podcast is co-created by The Guilty Feminist’s Deborah Frances-White, which is generally a guarantee of a good-quality listen.

On Sunday 21 October and at 17 weeks pregnant, she attended Galway University Hospital, complaining of back pain. A week later, Savita died of complications arising from septicemia. The circumstances of her death, ignited outrage around Ireland. Savita was denied a termination despite doctors telling her that a miscarriage was inevitable. The reason – the foetal heartbeat was still present. According to the Irish Constitution, this heartbeat was as important as Savita’s life and it was the Irish Constitution that ended up taking the mother’s life with the unborn. This episode of The Story talks to some of the key players in understanding what happened to Savita. It also explains why her death would eventually lead to countless debates and protests, and in the end, a historic referendum announcement for the people of Ireland. An incredible, tragic story that deserves all of our attention.

Use your noodle","bodyText":"What do you drink with noodles? Two answers come to most people’s minds, I’m guessing: “lager” or “you don’t”. I get both points of view. Wet noodle dishes, such as pho, have their own liquid incorporated, and I never feel the need for more with it. With other spicy noodle dishes, such as Singapore noodles, lager ticks the box pretty well, for instance Tiger Asian lager, £1.89 for 640ml at Iceland, or £2.19 at the Co-op, was originally from Singapore, but is now brewed under licence in the UK by Heineken). But as you can see from my colleagues’ recipes this week, there are many different kinds of noodles that can be eaten in combination with other dishes, rather than on their own. Is there a predominant ingredient that gives the dish its character? Does it come from a particular cooking tradition? Is the dish hot or cold, spicy or mild? Just like pasta, it’s the sauce, not the basic ribbons, that steer the match. Take the umami character of Japanese-style noodles for a start. My first thought would be a sake and, believe it or not, there is one now made in Peckham, south London – a Junmai grade called Kanpai. It’s a bit spendy at £15 for 330ml, but it is really impressive. Drink that with Yotam’s seaweed and sesame salad with tahini dressing. Wine is now made in Japan although, again, it’s not cheap. Look out for koshu, which is the name of both the wine and the grape. Marks &amp; Spencer has one for £14, but I’d pay the extra for the clean, pure elegant Lumière Koshu Hikari from Amathus, which has four shops in London. Or go for the versatile Austrian grüner veltliner, which is a reliable all-rounder with noodle dishes. Then there is tea. I like drinking green tea with noodles, but I’m also addicted to genmaicha, a green tea made with roasted brown rice that is delicious with sesame noodles – Clearspring has one for £3.59 a pack – although with Chinese noodle dishes such as chow mein (see Felicity Cloake’s recipe), I’d probably go for jasmine tea instead. Spicier Thai and other south-east Asian noodles benefit from a wine with a touch of sweetness, such as riesling or pinot gris. New Zealand has good examples of both: try the smooth, aromatic The Crossings Pinot Gris from Marlborough, which would be great with a chicken noodle salad. As for red wine, it’s not for me with noodles, but don’t let that stop you. Kanpai London sake £15 for 330ml Hop, Burns &amp; Black, 14% Improbably made in Peckham, but impressively authentic Lumière Koshu Hikari 2015 £19.65 Amathus (£16.72 if you buy a case), 11% Pure, intense Japanese white.

In fact, he said, it was something audaciously new: “A novel for television.” Exactly 10 years after its final episode aired, The Wire is established as one of the greatest shows in the history of US television – some would say the greatest. But, while shows such as The Sopranos and Mad Men launched with loud fanfares and walked paths strewn with accolades, strong ratings and Emmy awards, The Wire’s route to the pantheon was a long slog. “David Simon had to fight for every season,” says Clarke Peters (Det Lester Freamon). “Nothing was ever guaranteed.” The story began in 1984, when Simon, then a journalist on the Baltimore Sun, was covering the wiretap-related arrest of a local drug lord, Melvin Williams. Ed Burns, 14 years his senior, was the detective leading the case. As both of them were blunt, abrasive, fiercely intelligent and morally enraged by the status quo, they became friends. After Simon’s 1991 nonfiction masterpiece Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets became a hit NBC show, Homicide: Life on the Street, which ran for seven seasons between 1993 and 1999, both men quit their jobs. Burns became a teacher, and the two collaborated on the 1997 book The Corner: A Year in the Life of An Inner-City Neighbourhood, which examined the futile cruelty of the war on drugs from the other end of the telescope. The Corner became an HBO miniseries, which enabled the 40-year-old Simon to pitch The Wire to HBO’s CEO, Chris Albrecht, and entertainment division president, Carolyn Strauss, as “the anti-cop show, a rebellion of sorts against all the horseshit police procedurals afflicting American television”. Simon would later describe The Wire in different ways: as “Greek tragedy for the new millennium,” with sclerotic institutions playing the role of callous, indifferent gods; as a story about “the triumph of capitalism over human value”; and as a chronicle of “the decline of the American empire”. On Homicide: Life on the Street, NBC executives would repeatedly ask the writers: “Where are the victories?” The Wire avoided victories, preferring to show corruption, failure and decay. In this show, reformers would be thwarted, crooks rewarded and ordinary people ground down by the system. The Wire was as much journalism as entertainment – a form of protest television. The most frequent question asked in this writers’ room was: “What are we saying?” When The Wire began production in late 2001, Simon’s and Burns’s burning conviction was inspiring. “They were two different cats,” says Peters. “I felt an avuncular vibe from Ed. David was blinkered and focused, always under pressure. He really had to hold the reins of this team of horses so that they didn’t gallop away.” “They were such a unique pair to be writing this show,” says John Doman (deputy commissioner William Rawls). “Their view was from the inside out, not from the outside in. They knew the stories and the characters first-hand. I think The Wire really tore the cover off an American city and showed that, for so many people, the American dream was dead.” Simon was an authenticity hound who described his writing as “stealing life”. If the people he was writing about didn’t think his work rang true, then he had failed, regardless of what viewers thought. So he drew on individuals, anecdotes and snatches of dialogue that he had picked up as a reporter. Believing that most television writers didn’t have an ear for the streets, nor much interest in the lives of people living in poverty in urban areas, Simon put together a team of crime novelists (Pelecanos, Dennis Lehane and Richard Price) and former colleagues from the Baltimore Sun. “The final decision was always David’s, but he encouraged debate and wanted to be persuaded that there was a better way to go, if you could argue it successfully,” says Rafael Alvarez, a former reporter who became a staff writer on season two. “In one meeting, David and Ed went at it, over something I don’t recall, for more than an hour-and-a-half, with the rest of us watching like it was Ali v Frazier.” The show’s casting director, Alexa Fogel, also broke with industry norms, assembling a richly textured cast of stage actors, Britons, musicians, underused veterans, promising newcomers, complete novices and even some of the real cops, gangsters and politicians who inspired certain characters. “The number of African Americans cast on the show was groundbreaking for its time,” says Sonja Sohn, whose Det “Kima” Greggs was the strongest of the handful of female leads in The Wire’s very male universe. “I think I played the first black lesbian on television. The Wire ushered in a new interest in African American stories.” Simon encouraged his writers and actors to conduct field research. “Wendell Pierce [Det Bunk Moreland], Dominic West [Det Jimmy McNulty] and myself went out on some ride-alongs with Baltimore cops,” remembers Doman. “The cops were so blase. We went to the hospital, and one guy had been shot 13 times. The cops were standing around drinking coffee. It was another day at the office for these guys, but our eyes were popping out of our heads.” Simon’s attention to detail could be exhausting, but it was all in the service of telling the truth. “David was always there, making sure everything was done right,” says Faison. “People in Baltimore were very passionate about this show. It put them on a stage where they could be seen. Everyone who came up to me said: ‘Good for you guys. Ain’t that the truth.’” As for the viewers, Simon wrote in his foreword to Alvarez’s 2010 book about the show The Wire: Truth Be Told: “The first thing we had to do was teach folks to watch television in a different way.” The Wire’s novelistic ambition messed with standard rhythms of television, interleaving drama with the “anti-drama” of everyday life. It dared to slow down and stretch out, demanding unusual patience and attention from viewers. “It went way beyond mere entertainment,” says Aidan Gillen (local politician, Tommy Carcetti). “It dealt with issues that no other shows would be interested in dealing with. It didn’t compromise in any areas. To get it, you had to watch and listen, and there was a risk that people might not have bothered, but they did.” While many prestige dramas, before and since, focused on a charismatic antihero, or at least a tight ensemble, The Wire didn’t have a central character unless you count Baltimore itself. Each season introduced characters while expanding or contracting the roles of existing ones without warning. To keep the cast “in the present tense”, only the writers knew what was coming next. Actors waited in suspense for each week’s script, some wondering if their characters would make it out alive. “People started disappearing and my paranoia kicked in,” says Peters. “I could pick up the script and someone might say: ‘Did you hear what happened to Freamon the other night?’ That was an ever-present spectre. In hindsight, that’s what living in Baltimore is like. You can catch a bullet filling up your car with gas.” “Initially, I just thought I was going to do a couple of episodes,” says Isiah Whitlock Jr, whose corrupt senator, Clay Davis, barely appeared in the first two seasons. “I had no idea where it was headed. It was quite a ride.” Tracking the methodical investigation into the Melvin Williams-inspired crack kingpin Avon Barksdale and his ambitious consigliere Stringer Bell, The Wire debuted in June 2002 to modest acclaim, attracting a mostly black fanbase of people who saw their lives reflected in the show: Doman remembers being approached by cops who would say: “I work for an asshole just like you!” It was with season two, which looked at “the death of labour”, that Simon made clear his intention to “build a city”. Otherwise, he told Burns, “we truly are doing just a cop show”. He wanted to show the connecting thread – the wire – that ran between seemingly different organisations and the people who worked in them. Alvarez believes that if Simon hadn’t succeeded in pitching The Wire, the themes driving the five seasons might instead have inspired five books. Whether he was exploring police departments, drug cartels, labour unions, the school system, newspapers or city hall, Simon was interested in how the machine worked, or failed to work. If he could explain Baltimore, then he could explain the US. “One of the problems here in the US is that we try to deal with the solution without understanding the why,” says Whitlock. “I always felt that The Wire explained to you the why. It said we’re gonna take it real slow, go deep and show you the whole landscape.” For viewers who embraced the first season as a gritty crime drama with a predominantly black cast, however, the pivot in season two to the travails of white dockworkers was a jolt, even as it pulled in new viewers. “I thought: ‘What the fuck is this? What happened to our drugs?’” says Peters. “For me, it was a way of saying: this isn’t about you. This is about the city of Baltimore. It was necessary.” Season three’s plot strand about Carcetti’s bid to become mayor of Baltimore even confounded some of the writers. Pelecanos, who lived in Washington DC, found politics “fucking boring”, but came around when he saw the results. Sooner or later, everyone learned to trust Simon’s vision. Over time, the cast and the crew of The Wire became a tight-knit family. “I had a rough time during the first season,” says Sohn. “The guys who supported me through that remain my brothers today.” The younger actors developed a reputation for hell-raising. Gillen remembers Simon warning him to “make sure and tape bail money to your person” before hitting the town with certain cast members. Older actors migrated towards the calmer climate at Peters’ house, a bohemian salon that became known as “the academy”. Meanwhile, HBO established outreach programmes to give something back to the city. “Because of our celebrity, some hard-heads who might want to sling crack or sling a bullet in your direction all of a sudden become little kids, and you have a window to touch their humanity,” says Peters. “We became actors on a mission because we had met the characters in the machine of Baltimore.” By season three, the cast was beginning to get recognised in the street outside Baltimore, but with ratings low and Emmy recognition negligible, HBO felt that the downfall of original antagonists Barksdale and Bell marked a natural conclusion. “HBO was spending all its promotional money on The Sopranos,” says Doman. “We were underground for a long time. We never knew whether we were going to get renewed until the last minute.” Simon insisted that he wasn’t done yet. He still wanted to explore the perverse incentives of Burns’s profession (teaching) and his own (journalism), and cajoled Albrecht and Strauss into letting The Wire live. It was a wise U-turn because the next season was the show’s artistic zenith. “Season four is where it broke open,” says Gillen. “I think centring the narrative around four teenage kids whose plight you couldn’t help but fret over brought a lot of people in.” Stephen King wrote that The Wire “has made the final jump from great TV to classic TV”. Even the divisive final season, in which Simon ground his axe with the media a little too loudly, didn’t dent its reputation. Then one final twist: The Wire’s popularity only really boomed once it was over. “A critical mass of critical praise had been established just in time for the series to be released as a DVD box set,” says Alvarez, who is now a novelist and screenwriter. “It spread very quickly, sort of like, ‘Did you hear the new Beatles song? You haven’t? You must!’ I had no idea that the show was going to become a cultural phenomenon to the degree that Barack Obama would one day cross paths with Andre Royo [the informant Bubbles] and call out: ‘Hey, Bubs!’ No one knew.” A decade later, The Wire’s legacy is unimpeachable. It established Simon as one of TV’s great auteurs: he is currently working with Pelecanos on season two of his latest HBO show, The Deuce. It transformed the careers of several actors, notably West, Gillen, Idris Elba and Michael B Jordan. “I thought, at the time, that nobody was paying much attention,” says Whitlock. “More people recognise me from the show than they ever did. I run into people who have just seen it and they want to talk to me about it. I have to tell them it was 10 years ago. You move on. But I’m very proud to have been a part of it.” It left its mark on the city, too. Sohn stayed in Baltimore to build on The Wire’s outreach work and directed Baltimore Rising, an HBO documentary about tensions between police and activists after the killing of Freddie Gray in 2015. “I believe that, although hope dies every day on the streets of Baltimore, Chicago, Afghanistan or wherever, hope lives in these very same places,” she says. What’s more, The Wire rewrote the rules of television drama with regard to tone, subject matter and narrative scope. The show that was once a tough sell is now both a benchmark of quality and a social document that is taught in universities. “When I saw the conversation that was initiated by The Wire, in all walks of life, it made me feel that people don’t want to be dumbed down,” says Peters. “They want something that’s going to challenge their intellect, make them feel alive, give them issues to debate. I didn’t see the whole series until about five years ago. I sat down and binged and said: ‘Oh my God, is that what I was a part of? Thank you, Lord.’” “The Wire deals with every element of society, from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high,” says Faison. “Sometimes the ‘good’ people are not so good and sometimes the ‘bad’ people are striving to be good. It was something a great deal of people could identify with. We never pulled back. We met everything head on and dealt with the truth.” That fundamental truth, which explains why The Wire illuminates the era of Trump and Black Lives Matter just as it spoke to Hurricane Katrina and the financial crisis, was best summed up by Simon in a 2007 interview with Nick Hornby. “This is part of the country you have made,” he said. “This, too, is who we are and what we have built. Think again, motherfuckers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/06/sp-system-under-scrutiny-after-low-turnouts-plus-southwell-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T11:10:51Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: SP system under scrutiny after low turnouts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/06/sp-system-under-scrutiny-after-low-turnouts-plus-southwell-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/06/sp-system-under-scrutiny-after-low-turnouts-plus-southwell-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: SP system under scrutiny after low turnouts","bodyText":"The attendance at Southwell on Tuesday should be a little better than last Friday’s crowd for a hastily-arranged “jumpers bumpers” meeting, but then it could hardly be much worse. Around 400 paying customers – the standard crowd for an all-weather Tuesday at the Nottinghamshire track – are expected to turn up, which is nearly 400 more than the 13 who paid through the gate four days ago. When trainers, owners and stable staff are taken into account, the “crowd” at Southwell last Friday was probably around 100 in all, but most of those will have been at the track to work, rather than bet. So with only three bookmakers standing in Tattersalls, there were effectively only four paying punters for every bookie. And yet these 13 punters were, in theory at least, responsible for the starting prices at which many thousands of bets were settled, in Britain’s betting shops in particular. The most recent report from the Starting Price Regulatory Committee, which oversees the SP system, is for 2016 and suggests that “some half of current bets” are conducted at SP. What “some half” actually means is anyone’s guess, as the SP is increasingly irrelevant online, where punters tend to notice it only when their selection drifts and wins, and they benefit from a “Best Odds Guaranteed” concession. But even on a bleak Friday in early March, the amount of cash changing hands on an SP basis around the country will have been significant. How an on-course market made up of a baker’s dozen of punters and, perhaps, a smattering of owners can be expected to generate SPs that are “produced with integrity, fairness and transparency” – as the SPRC likes to put it – is beyond me. But then, what is a reasonable ratio of punters to bookies if you are looking for credibility in the SP? Fifty punters per book? Or maybe 100? Taking 100 punters per bookie as a minimum, Southwell alone staged 49 meetings in 2017 that failed the test. Even being generous and allowing for 50 punters per bookie as enough to make a meaningful on-course market, there were 15 meetings where the ratio ranged from 27:1 to 49:1. The ratio dropped below 50:1 for 12 all-weather meetings at Lingfield, 18 at Wolverhampton and 14 at Newcastle, though only one at Kempton Park (which the Jockey Club hopes to bulldoze). The reality, of course, is that on-course bookies at these meetings are logged on to Betfair and simply adding a little margin to the odds on the machine. It is also only fair to point out that the over-rounds at last Friday’s meeting were far from excessive, ranging from 112% to 105%. But that is not really the point. When a market is as weak as the on-course market at many all-weather meetings, and can be the tail that wags a much more significant dog, then it is open to abuse and, sooner or later, someone will abuse it. The BHA has shown little inclination to address the issue in the past, a complacency that may, at some point, come back to haunt it. Chaucer’s Tale (4.20) looks the pick of the prices on Tuesday’s only surviving card. Mick Easterby’s runner has yet to record a victory on the Fibresand, but he has shown useful form on all three of his previous starts at Southwell and only just failed to record his second win of the winter campaign when dropped back to seven furlongs at Wolverhampton last time. That was just the 10th start of Chaucer’s Tale’s career and his best run yet, and today’s return to a mile should suit. Avocet (2.50) was an easy winner on her Southwell debut last month, has won again since and will be very hard to beat back on Fibresand, while Mimic’s Memory is another Southwell regular who looks to have dropped to a winning mark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/06/survivors-of-catholic-church-abuse-in-ireland-demand-meeting-pope-francis-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T15:25:26Z","webTitle":"Survivors of Catholic church abuse in Ireland demand papal meeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/survivors-of-catholic-church-abuse-in-ireland-demand-meeting-pope-francis-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/06/survivors-of-catholic-church-abuse-in-ireland-demand-meeting-pope-francis-compensation","fields":{"headline":"Survivors of Catholic church abuse in Ireland demand papal meeting","bodyText":"Survivors of sexual and physical abuse in schools run by the Catholic church in Ireland have demanded a meeting with Pope Francis during his visit to the country in the summer to discuss compensation. The Irish Catholic church has invited the pontiff to a religious conference in August. It will be the first papal visit to Ireland since John Paul II’s tour in 1979. The Guardian has seen a letter from the Irish Survivors of Child Abuse (Soca), in which the campaign group calls for a meeting with Francis to ask why Catholic religious orders have not paid out more in compensation. The letter has been sent to archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, asking him to pass on their request to the Vatican. Soca is angry about a deal between the Catholic church and the Irish government in 2002 that resulted in the taxpayer footing most of the bill for compensating those abused in religious institutions. The deal resulted in the church having to pay out €128m of a €1.3bn compensation bill. Last year, Ireland’s comptroller and auditor general found that only €85m had been paid out of church funds. On top of its criticism of the deal, Soca said the church should at least be forced to pay out in full the agreed €128m. In the letter to Martin, one of the co-founders of Soca said survivors also wanted Pope Francis to hear about what they described as the “Violence R Us” culture in religious orders such as the Christian Brothers, which ran Ireland’s notorious industrial schools. “At this time I don’t intend to recite the sums involved but they are substantial and a debt of honour to Ireland is overdue since much remains unpaid and the orders have shown themselves unworthy in this respect,” John Kelly writes. “These matters should now be handled by the papal authorities in Rome through a special remittances office to be established for the purpose. There should be no further quibbling over money owed to the Irish state. “We are saddened that notwithstanding numerous inquiries over the past 20 years the religious orders that operated institutions on behalf of church and state have not been properly held to account.” Soca is hoping to hear a response from the archbishop and the Vatican within the next two weeks. A 2,600-page report released by a child abuse commission in 2009 found that rape was “endemic” in more than 250 Irish Catholic care institutions from the 1930s to the 1990s and that the church in Ireland protected paedophiles in its ranks from arrest or prosecution. The report found that boys in industrial schools such as Artane in north Dublin were treated more like convicts and slaves than children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/06/lego-sales-fall-growth-job-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T12:53:14Z","webTitle":"Lego reports first sales fall in 13 years, saying 'there is no quick fix'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/06/lego-sales-fall-growth-job-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/06/lego-sales-fall-growth-job-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Lego reports first sales fall in 13 years, saying 'there is no quick fix'","bodyText":"Lego has reported its first drop in sales and profits in more than a decade as children ditch its plastic bricks for more modern toys. The family-owned Danish company said on Tuesday that its 2017 sales declined by 8% to 35bn Danish kroner (£4.2bn) following a “challenging year” during which it axed 1,400 jobs. Profits dropped by 17% to DKr10.4bn compared with DKr12.4bn in 2016. It was the first annual decline in Lego’s operating profit since 2003, when the 85-year-old company was on the brink of collapse and foreign venture capitalists were circling ready to pounce. Niels Christiansen, who took over as Lego’s chief executive five months ago, said there would be “no quick fix” and it would take years for the company to return to growth. “2017 was a challenging year and overall we are not satisfied with the financial results,” Christiansen said. “We started 2018 in better shape and during the coming year we will stabilise the business by continuing to invest in great products, effective global marketing and improved execution. There is no quick fix and it will take some time to achieve longer-term growth.” Christiansen was appointed in October, replacing 61-year-old Briton Bali Padda, the first non-Dane to run the company. Padda served just eight months in the top job. Christian started work slashing costs and overhauling the company’s bloated structure. More than 1,400 jobs – or 8% of the total workforce – have been axed. Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, the Lego chairman and former chief executive, said the company had developed too many layers and overlapping functions, preventing it from realising its growth potential. Knudstorp, who was widely credited with rescuing Lego from its last crisis, was elevated from chief executive to chairman in 2016, becoming the first non-family member to head Lego. Both Knudstorp and Christiansen are former McKinsey consultants. Lego is controlled by the billionaire Kirk Kristiansen family, descendants of founder Ole Kirk Christiansen, a master carpenter who made the first Lego toy – a wooden duck. Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, grandson of Ole, is chairman of Kirkbi, the family holding company that owns 75% of Lego. Kjeld is Denmark’s richest man, with a $13bn (£9.3bn) fortune according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index. Lego said part of the collapse in profits was due to the company producing too many of its colourful bricks, which it was forced to sell off cheaply to make room in its warehouses. A spokeswoman told the BBC that Lego had too much stock in shops and stores, which made it hard to get new products in front of consumers. “There wasn’t enough room to get 2017 toys into the stores, and the toy trade is driven by newness,” the spokeswoman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/observer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T00:01:15Z","webTitle":"Observer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/observer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/observer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer sudoku","bodyText":"Click here to access the print version Fill the grid using the numbers 1 to 9.

They had a wonderful marriage. My brother and I were lucky beneficiaries of that. They were a truly magical couple, and until I went to college I thought that everyone was like that.

At the end of the tour I was booked to play a petting zoo. I had to rethink my career after that. Spiritually I’m a seeker.

The ban comes more than four years after the bank came close to collapse due to a £1.5bn black hole in its accounts. Flowers, a former Methodist minister, was the £132,000-a-year chairman of the “ethical” Co-op bank from 2010 until June 2013, when he stepped down after the full extent of its financial troubles became clear. The structure of the board was later criticised by the Treasury select committee as “an accident waiting to happen”. Four months after news of the black hole, secret footage of Flowers emerged that led to him pleading guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine and acquiring the nickname “the Crystal Methodist”. The Financial Conduct Authority said it had only investigated Flowers’ use of company technology and his drug convictions, and not his role in the near-collapse of the bank. However, the Treasury immediately announced that it has launched a new independent review into supervision of the Co-operative Bank between 2008 and 2013. In its ruling on Tuesday, the FCA said that Flowers’ conduct demonstrated a “lack of fitness and propriety” required to work in financial services. Mark Steward, its executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: “The role of chair occupies a unique place of trust and influence. The chair is pivotal in setting expectations of a company’s culture, values and behaviours. “Mr Flowers failed in his duty to lead by example and to meet the high standards of integrity and probity demanded by the role. These high standards are what the financial services industry and the wider community rightly expect of its senior individuals.” The FCA found that Flowers demonstrated an “unwillingness to comply” with its and other legal, regulatory and professional requirements and standards, as its investigation found that he had used his work mobile phone to make “a number of inappropriate calls to a premium-rate chat line”, in breach of Co-operative Group and Co-op bank policies. In addition, he used his work email account to send and receive “sexually explicit and otherwise inappropriate messages, and to discuss illegal drugs”, the FCA added, despite having been warned about his earlier misconduct. Following the scandal, Flowers was also removed from the list of Methodist Church ministers, stripped of the title reverend and the power to lead services for “seriously impairing the mission, witness or integrity of the church”. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said she had written to Andrew Bailey, head of the FCA, last week to ask why an investigation into the Co-op bank had still to begin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/06/martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album-shaolin-seized-federal-court","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T10:51:08Z","webTitle":"Martin Shkreli's $2m Wu-Tang Clan album seized by federal court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/06/martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album-shaolin-seized-federal-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/06/martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album-shaolin-seized-federal-court","fields":{"headline":"Martin Shkreli's $2m Wu-Tang Clan album seized by federal court","bodyText":"Martin Shkreli, the former pharmaceuticals entrepreneur awaiting a criminal sentence following a fraud conviction, has been forced to hand over the Wu-Tang Clan album he paid $2m for at auction in 2015. The order comes after Shkreli was convicted for securities fraud in August 2017 – he was found to have lied to investors about how their money would be spent, though Shkreli defended himself by saying that none of the investors lost money, and some made substantial profits. He is facing a maximum of 20 years in jail, though his lawyers have recommended only 12 to 18 months, plus community service. Following his conviction, Shkreli was released on $5m (£3.6m) bail, though this decision was later revoked and he was sent to jail, after he made a threatening Facebook post about Hillary Clinton, offering followers $5,000 if they could send him a strand of her hair. The double Wu-Tang Clan album, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, is part of a bundle of assets worth $7.36m seized by a federal court, which also include a Picasso painting and another rap record, the unreleased Lil Wayne album Tha Carter V. The album was pressed in a single copy by the Staten Island rap group, and housed in an ornate silver box, before being auctioned by the company Paddle8. As the winning buyer, Shkreli was forbidden from releasing the album for 88 years, a stipulation that the Wu-Tang Clan’s Method Man described as “stupid”. The purchase was another notorious move by Shkreli, who had already become infamous for aggressively hiking the price of the drug Thiola, used to treat the disease cystinuria. Later in 2015 he became widely despised for buying up the patent to the drug Daraprim, often used to treat Aids-related toxoplasmosis, and raising the price of each pill from $13.50 to $750. Shkreli attempted to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin on eBay, with the winning bid passing $1m, though the sale was never completed. “I didn’t like the idea of him putting it on eBay,” the Wu-Tang producer, RZA, told the Guardian last year. “I think he could have got more than what he paid.” Shkreli’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman has claimed that the album is now “probably worthless”. Shkreli’s sentencing is scheduled for 9 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/06/kremlin-denies-russian-involvement-in-mystery-illness-former-spy-sergei-skripal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T17:25:56Z","webTitle":"Britain using spy illness to demonise Moscow, says Litvinenko murder suspect","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/kremlin-denies-russian-involvement-in-mystery-illness-former-spy-sergei-skripal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/06/kremlin-denies-russian-involvement-in-mystery-illness-former-spy-sergei-skripal","fields":{"headline":"Britain using spy illness to demonise Moscow, says Litvinenko murder suspect","bodyText":"Andrei Lugovoi, one of the prime suspects in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, has suggested that the apparent poisoning of a Russian spy in Salisbury is part of a British campaign to demonise Moscow. “I don’t rule out that this is another provocation by British intelligence agencies,” said Lugovoi, a pro-Kremlin MP and former FSB spy agency officer. “Whatever happens on [British] territory, they start yelling: ‘He was killed, he was hung, he was poisoned!’ and that Russia is to blame for everything. This is to their advantage,” he told Russian media. Lugovoi’s comments come as Sergei Skripal, 66, a Russian former military intelligence officer, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, remain critically ill in hospital. They were found unconscious on a bench in a shopping centre in the small Wiltshire city after exposure to an unknown substance. Skripal was convicted in 2006 by a Russian court of spying for Britain, and sentenced to 13 years in jail. In 2010, he was one of four Russians swapped for 10 deep-cover “sleeper” agents planted by Moscow in the US, including Anna Chapman, a diplomat’s daughter. Lugovoi, 51, was charged in 2007 by Britain with murdering Litvinenko, also an ex-FSB officer, by poisoning his tea with radioactive polonium in the lobby of a Mayfair hotel. He denied the allegations. President Vladimir Putin dismissed accusations of Russian involvement and refused to extradite Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, another suspect, to Britain. The row plunged British-Russian relations to a post-cold war low. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it has no information about the incident involving Skripal and his daughter. “We don’t possess any information about what could have been the cause [of Skripal’s illness], and what this could be connected to,” said Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman. He said Russia had not been contacted by Britain but it was ready to assist in any investigation. “Moscow is always open to cooperation,” Peskov said, calling the incident “tragic”. Speaking in 2010, Putin, a former KGB officer, said “traitors always end badly”. “Secret services live by their own laws and these laws are very well known to anyone who works for a secret service,” he said. However, Peskov appeared to mock British media speculation that Skripal could have been poisoned by Russian agents, saying: “It didn’t take them long.” Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist politician and presidential candidate, suggested that British intelligence services could have poisoned Skripal because “he was of no more use to them” and knew secrets that he could have sold on. He also said his poisoning with “some mysterious, rare substance” may have been an attempt by Britain intelligence to blame “murderous Russia” for the suspected hit on the former spy. The Russian embassy in London described British media reporting of the hospitalisation of Skripal as part of an anti-Russian campaign. “The way the situation is being described by British media causes serious concern,” a spokesman for the embassy said. Argumenty i Fakty, a popular Russian tabloid, said “western propaganda” would exploit Skripal’s illness “to the full”. Some Kremlin supporters on social media suggested the incident was aimed at discrediting Putin ahead of this month’s presidential elections. “Clearly the Kremlin will know what to do with this story for domestic political purposes,” said Sam Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London. “At the moment this fits into this argument about Russia being surrounded by enemies. “In Western responses to Russia there is much hyperbole, and it is rapidly making everything Russia-linked seem as toxic as whatever poisoned Skripal. In a sense, Russophobia is becoming a reality. But the cure to the syndrome lies in Moscow,” he said. Skripal served in Russia’s GRU military intelligence until 1999, reaching the rank of colonel. He then worked at the Russia foreign ministry’s office in Moscow until 2003, when he went into business. He was arrested in 2006 and charged with passing the identities of Russian agents working undercover in Europe to MI6. Russian prosecutors said he had been paid $100,000 (£72,000) by MI6 for information he had been supplying since 1995, when he was a serving officer. “You outplayed me,” Skripal reportedly told FSB agents after his arrest. An FSB spokesperson at the time compared Skripal to Col Oleg Penkovsky, who was executed by the Soviet Union in 1963 for supplying the US with information during the Cuban missile crisis. According to her Facebook page, Yulia Skripal worked at Holiday Inn in Southampton until 2014, when she returned to live in Russia. A friend, Irina Petrova, told the Guardian she had never expressed fears that her father could be targeted by Russian intelligence. “They lived calm and measured lives,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2018/mar/06/russian-spy-incident-counter-terrorist-police-investigate-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T17:58:34Z","webTitle":"Russian spy mystery: counter-terror police take charge of investigation - live updates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/mar/06/russian-spy-incident-counter-terrorist-police-investigate-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2018/mar/06/russian-spy-incident-counter-terrorist-police-investigate-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russian spy mystery: counter-terror police take charge of investigation - live updates","bodyText":"As the day draws to a close we will pause the blog for the time being - but bring you any breaking news as it happens later tonight. The alleged poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal follows a “long tradition of Russia eliminating its enemies”, according to an expert on Russian politics. Dr Paul Flenley, a senior lecturer in politics and international relations at Portsmouth university, says Russia and its secret police had a “code” to avenge treachery. “It’s all speculation at the moment, but there’s a long tradition, since the 1920s, of Russia eliminating its enemies. “The secret police are well trained. There’s an assumption you can’t escape, there’s a code and if you break it, if you betray them, they will get you - it’s part of their discipline.” But Flenley says Russian president Vladimir Putin was not necessarily the source of such acts: “There’s tendency to assume everything is orchestrated by Putin, and of course he likes that, it amplifies his power, but there are other possibilities, there are business groups and mafia-like groups who could be seeking revenge.” A picture is emerging in Salisbury of a polite, friendly, gregarious man. Shopkeeper Ebru Ozturk, 41, said Sergei Skripal came into the store once a week. He liked a particular type of Polish sausage and spent between £30 and £40 on lottery scratch cards a time. She described him as “like a grandfather”. She said: “He’s a very kind person, I really look forward to him coming in. Last time I saw him is a few days ago - he came in and bought a scratch card. He often wins money. He’s very lucky. He was always well-dressed and neat. “He bought lottery tickets a lot. He was very polite. He’s a very kind customer. He sometimes came with his daughter. He mentioned that his wife had died a couple of years ago. Whenever I saw him he was happy. “I think he was doing lots of business things. He knows lots of different languages, he’s very educated. I think he’s been to lots of different countries. We talked a lot. We chatted about different countries and different foods he cooked. I was about to ask if he wanted any Russian food or vodka the next time he comes in.” He was also a member of the Railway Social Club in Salisbury. Other people who knew him said they thought he was wealthy and may have dabbled in property abroad. Theresa May and other senior ministers have been briefed about the investigation at a meeting of the government’s national security council, Downing Street has said. May’s spokesman said the PM and her ministers “were updated on the ongoing investigation in Salisbury, which is now being led by counter-terrorism police. The council followed a meeting of senior government officials from across Whitehall earlier today”. May was among people who spoke at the meeting, the spokesman said: “A number of people spoke, including the prime minister and officials.” Beyond that, we didn’t learn much, with May’s spokesman declining to say who attended, beyond May and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, or what was discussed. He said: It’s an ongoing investigation, and it’s important not to pre-judge the facts and to let the police get on with their work. Counter-terror police have taken over the investigation into how the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia came to be found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury. Police have said they are keeping an open mind as to what happened. Skripal and his daughter are in intensive care being treated for exposure to an unknown substance. Both remain in a critical condition. Samples from the scenes are being tested at the military research laboratory at Porton Down. Experts have yet to identify the substance. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has said the UK will respond “robustly” if Russia is found to have been involved. He told the Commons there were echoes of what happened to Alexander Litvinenko who was poisoned in London in 2006 by Russian agents. He also described Russia as “malign and disruptive”. Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed his remarks as “wild”. Johnson’s office has rowed back from his suggestion that England could boycott the World Cup in Russia this summer over the incident. Sources clarified that any boycott would apply only to officials and dignitaries, not the team. Wiltshire police have said one member of the emergency services is in hospital. Police said a small number of emergency services personnel were assessed immediately after the incident and one remained in hospital. CCTV footage has emerged showing a man and woman walking through an alleyway connecting Zizzi’s restaurant in Salisbury and the bench where Skripal was found. A witness said those in the footage appeared to be the pair seen unconscious on the bench. The Russian embassy has denied that the illness affecting the Skripals resulted from “planned action by the Russian security services”. It said: “Media reporting could give rise to the impression that this is a planned action by the Russian security services, which in no way corresponds to the truth.” The Kremlin said it was ready to cooperate if Britain asked for help in its investigation of the “tragic situation”. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “Nobody has approached us with such a request. Moscow is always open for cooperation.” Skripal was one of four Russians exchanged for 10 deep cover “sleeper” agents planted by Moscow in the US in 2010. Skripal was convicted of passing the identities of Russian agents working undercover in Europe to MI6 in 2006. Andrei Lugovoi, the Russian agent believed to be behind the killing of Litvinenko, has suggested the incident in Salisbury is a false flag operation. “I don’t rule out that this is another provocation by British intelligence agencies,” Lugovoi told Russia’s pro-Kremlin Vzglyad newspaper. Ben Emmerson QC, who represented the Litvinenko family at the inquest in London, called on the government to consider establishing a public inquiry into the suspected poisoning in Salisbury. Our Espionage section has more on the incident. The Microbiological Research Establishment at Porton Down, Wiltshire, which specialises in chemical warfare, is testing samples from the scene in Salisbury, according to the BBC. But experts have not confirmed the identity of the substance, the BBC’s home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds reports. PA has more on the confusion Boris Johnson sowed over England’s World Cup involvement - before his team rejected suggestions that Gareth Southgate’s squad could be pulled from the competition. Raising a point of order, Labour’s Toby Perkins quoted Johnson’s remarks and said: “If what the foreign secretary was saying was that it was his view that England should pull out of the World Cup, the consequences of that are absolutely massive – on the travel industry, on businesses, on the tens of thousands of supporters who are intending to travel and the media and so on. “I wonder if you have heard if there is going to be a statement to that effect and if not that we should ask the foreign secretary to come back and explain such an important claim very quickly.” The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, replied: “To be fair the foreign secretary used the conditional tense and I think it would be correct to say that he was ruminating on the possibilities in the event of no improvement in the situation. “I don’t think it would be right to say that he made a statement of policy.” Russia’s foreign ministry has dismissed Boris Johnson’s remarks about the incident. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the foreign secretary’s comments were “wild”, the Interfax news agency reported. Johnson threatened a “robust” response if Russian involvement in the incident was proven. “I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go either unsanctioned or unpunished,” he said. He also described Russia as “malign and disruptive”. And he said it would be difficult to see how UK representation at the World Cup in Russia could go ahead in the normal way if the Kremlin was behind the illness that has struck down Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Pritchard didn’t reveal anything new, but for the record here is some of his statement. Our focus has been on what has caused these people to become critically ill and whether or not criminal activity has taken place … The counter-terrorism network will be leading this investigation as it has the specialist capability to do so. It is important to reiterate that they have not declared this as a terrorist incident. At this stage they are keeping an open mind as to what has happened. We can confirm that a small number of emergency service personnel, including some officers and staff, were assessed immediately after the incident. I want to reassure you that there does not appear to be any immediate risk to the public. During this time it vital that we continue to provide an increased policing presence in the Salisbury city area, as I believe this plays an important part in helping to reassure our communities. Angus Macpherson, the police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire, has given a brief statement. Speaking in Devizes, he said: This appears to have happened on a quiet Sunday afternoon in our cathedral city. In the past couple of days I’ve been briefed regularly by the chief constable and can say with confidence that the matter has received the full support of both the police and our partner agencies in a coordinated major response. Measures necessary to ensure the safety of the public in and around the scene have also been taken. He did not take questions either. The temporary chief constable of Wiltshire police, Kier Pritchard is giving a press conference on what he describes as a “fast-paced” investigation. Pritchard confirms that counter-terror police are leading the investigation. He repeats that it has not been declared a terrorist incident. Pritchard says there is no risk to the public. He does not take questions. Counter-terror police have taken over the investigation into how the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia came to be found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury.

Ben Emmerson QC, who represented the Litvinenko family at the inquest in London, called on the government to consider establishing a public inquiry into the suspected poisoning in Salisbury. Facebook images have emerged of Yulia Skripal, who was found unconscious with her father, Sergei Skripal, after being exposed to an unknown substance. Both are in intensive care in hospital in Salisbury. Skripal’s Facebook profile, last updated in 2016, says she lives in Moscow. She is reported to have been visiting her father in Salisbury when the incident happened. Earlier, Boris Johnson told the Commons there was much concern about what had happened to Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Counter-terrorism police have taken over the investigation in Salisbury, Scotland Yard has announced. In a statement on the incident, the Metropolitan police said: Due to the unusual circumstances it has been decided that the counter-terrorism policing network will lead the investigation as it has the specialist expertise to do so. It has not been declared a terrorist incident and at this stage we are keeping an open mind as to what happened. At approximately 16:15hrs on Sunday 4 March, a man in his 60s and a woman in her 30s were found unconscious on a bench in The Maltings shopping centre, Salisbury. They are currently being treated at hospital for suspected exposure to an unknown substance. Both remain in a critical condition in intensive care. Wiltshire police, along with colleagues from the ambulance and fire services, attended the scene and cordons were established, which remain in place today. Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, the head of counter-terrorism policing, said: The focus at this time is to establish what has caused these people to become critically ill. We would like to reassure members of the public that this incident is being taken extremely seriously and we currently do not believe there is any risk to the wider public. We continue to appeal to any members of the public who may have information in relation to this incident to contact police immediately on 999. Temporary chief constable of Wiltshire police, Kier Pritchard, said: I would like to reassure our local communities that the multi-agency response is ongoing and we will continue to work with our partners, including Public Health England, the local NHS trust, local authorities and emergency services. The attempts by Johnson’s office to backtrack on his suggestion of a World Cup boycott have been met with much ridicule. Here’s the full text of Johnson’s remarks about the World Cup. Responding to Labour’s Toby Perkins, who didn’t even ask about the tournament, Johnson said: If things turn out to be as many members I think on both sides of the house suspect that they are … I think we will have to have a serious conversation about engagement with Russia. For my own part I think it will be very difficult to see how we – I’m thinking ahead to the World Cup this July, this summer – I think it will be very difficult to imagine that UK representation at that event could go ahead in the normal way. And we would certainly have to consider that. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist politician and presidential candidate, has said British intelligence agencies may have poisoned Skripal because “he was of no more use to them and he knew secrets about British intelligence … that he could have sold on.” He also said his “poisoning with some mysterious, rare substance” may have been an attempt by Britain to discredit Russia. Those close to Boris Johnson appear to be rowing back on his suggestion that England could boycott the World Cup over the incident in Salisbury. He meant “officials and dignitaries” rather than the team, a source told Paul Waugh. Labour’s Toby Perkins will demand clarification in a point of order, he told Waugh. Anna Turley, the Labour MP for Redcar, has backed Johnson’s threat to pull England out of the World Cup in Russia. Paul Waugh from HuffPost UK has more on Johnson’s comments about the possibility of England boycotting the World Cup. Sam Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London, argues that after his expected re-election Putin will have to address the widespread mistrust of Russia. The Boris Johnson urgent question session has now finished. Near the end Johnson suggested that if Russia were found to be involved in the Skripal case, England would boycott the World Cup due to take place in Russia this summer. In those circumstances, he said, “I think it will be difficult to see how UK representation at the World Cup can go ahead”. Labour’s Luciana Berger asks if the toxicology report from the Skripal investigation will be made public. Johnson says he will not comment on the investigation. The Conservative MP Jack Lopresti asks how the government categorises cyber-attacks from Russia on the UK’s critical infrastructure. Are they nuisances or acts of war? Johnson replies: I increasingly think that we have to categorise them as acts of war, and that means that we need to elaborate a new doctrine of response and a new doctrine of deterrence as well, and we certainly are. That is one of the conclusions that we took in the NSC [national security council] a few months ago. Johnson says the UK is “in the lead across the world in standing up to Russia”. That may explain the level of hostility directed against the UK, he says. If that is the case, it is worth it, he says. Dominic Grieve, the chair of the parliament’s intelligence and security committee, says his committee has launched an inquiry into Russia’s covert activity. He says the inquiry has new urgency in the light of the Skripal case. He asks Johnson to ensure the committee gets the help it needs to carry this out. Johnson tells Grieve he will respond to his request. In response to a question about a BuzzFeed investigation saying US intelligence officials think 14 people have been killed by Russian security services or mafia groups on British soil, Johnson says he will discuss this issue with Amber Rudd, the home secretary. In response to a question from Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, Johnson says the government will look at proposed Magnitsky amendments to a government bill “with an open mind”. He says the government’s current view is that a specific Magnitsky amendment (which would impose specific sanctions on those involved in the death of Sergei Magnitsky (see 10.47am)) is unnecessary. But he says he acknowledges that MPs may want to go further. Johnson says the UK has taken a tough stance against Russia. It has backed sanctions, which have hurt the Russian economy. He says it is not yet clear what happened in Salisbury. But MPs will have their suspicions, he says. As I say, it is too early to speculate as to the precise nature of the crime or attempted crime that has taken place in Salisbury yesterday. But I know members will have their suspicions. And what I will say to the house is, if those suspicions prove to be well founded then this government will take whatever measures we deem necessary to protect the lives of the people in this country, our values and our freedoms. And although I am not now pointing fingers, because we cannot point fingers, I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go either unsanctioned or unpunished. It may be that this country will continue to pay a price for our continued principle in standing up to Russia. But I hope I will have the support of members on both sides of the house in continuing to do so. He also describes Russia as a “malign and disruptive force”. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, asks his question. It is phrased as a general question about Russia. Boris Johnson says there is much concern about what has happened to Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. There are echoes of what happened to Alexander Litvinenko. He says if evidence emerges of state responsibility, the government will respond “appropriately and robustly”. Police, together with partner agencies, are now investigating. Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. And while it’d be wrong to prejudge the investigation, I can reassure the House that should evidence emerge that implies state responsibility, then Her Majesty’s government will respond appropriately and robustly. Johnson, the foreign secretary, says the UK will respond “robustly” if Russia is found to have been involved in the Skripal case. The Russian embassy has denied that the illness affecting the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal resulted from “planned action by the Russian security services”. It said: “Media reporting could give rise to the impression that this is a planned action by the Russian security services, which in no way corresponds to the truth.” The embassy has said it is seriously concerned by British media reporting of the hospitalisation of Skripal and complained that the incident is being used to demonise Russia. “The way the situation is being described by British media causes serious concern,” a spokesman said. “The British media are swiftly launching a new phase of the anti-Russian campaign.” Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is responding to an urgent question in the Commons about the Skripal case. He has just turned up in the chamber, about three minutes late, and will be starting shortly. My colleague Steve Morris has sent some further details on the timeline of events on Sunday. 3.47pm A CCTV camera at Snap Fitness captures two people believed to be Skripal and his daughter. They are apparently walking normally. 4.03pm The same camera catches Freya Church, a personal trainer. She turns left out of the gym and sees in front of her Skripal and the woman on the bench. She said the woman had passed out and the man was behaving strangely. Approx 4.15pm Emergency services are called. The woman is airlifted to hospital; Skripal is taken by road. That means there was a gap of 16 minutes between when the couple walked past the gym CCTV camera and when Church saw them in great distress. Police will want to know what prompted them to stop at the bench. Were they feeling ill or did they just stop to enjoy the mild afternoon? According to the Met Office, most of last week’s snow had cleared by then and it was becoming milder – around 10C. The bench, next to the river Avon, would have been a good place to pause. Freya Church said: I just finished training and I walked out of the gym and there were a couple outside on a bench. It was a young, blonde and pretty girl and it was definitely the man that’s been pictured in the news – the guy that’s a spy. She was passed out and he was looking up to the sky and I tried to get eye contact to see if they were OK. They didn’t seem with it, to be honest I thought they were just drugged out as they were in a weird state. They were out of it. There are lots of homeless people here so I just thought they were homeless. Now that I know what I know I’m absolutely shocked, I just thought it was a couple of people sat there taking drugs. It’s quite scary and I’m actually a little nervous – nothing like this happens here in Salisbury. You hear Russian spy being thrown around and it makes me a little worried, it almost doesn’t seem real. Describing the woman, she said: “She had a red bag with her, she didn’t look really raggy or anything. It was weird that she was much younger and he was an older man.” Downing Street has declined to comment on the case, with Theresa May’s spokesman saying it was still a police matter. He said: “All relevant departments, including No 10, are being kept informed of developments, as you’d expect. But this is an ongoing investigation which is being led by the police, and is an operational matter for them.” The cabinet had their usual weekly meeting this morning, but did not discuss events in Salisbury, he said. There had been no meeting called of the government’s Cobra security committee, the spokesman added. A Foreign Office minister is expected to face an urgent question on Russia at 12.30. The minister will make a short statement. Then he/she will take questions from MPs for about 30-40 minutes. • The second person found unconscious in Salisbury alongside the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal is his daughter. Yulia Skripal was discovered on a bench next her father and, like him, is in a critical condition in hospital. It is understood that she lives in Russia but was visiting the UK. • Wilshire police have said one member of the emergency services is in hospital. Police said a small number of emergency services personnel were assessed immediately after the incident and one remained in hospital. • CCTV footage has emerged showing a man and woman walking through an alleyway connecting Zizzi’s restaurant in Salisbury and the bench where Skripal was found. • The UK’s leading counter-terrorism officer, Mark Rowley, said his specialists were supporting the investigation that has led to a major incident being declared in Salisbury. Rowley said the investigation could look at possible links with the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. • The Kremlin said it was ready to cooperate if Britain asked for help in its investigation of the “tragic situation”. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “Nobody has approached us with such a request. Moscow is always open for cooperation.” • Skripal was one of four Russians exchanged for 10 deep cover “sleeper” agents planted by Moscow in the US in 2010. Skripal was convicted of passing the identities of Russian agents working undercover in Europe to MI6 in 2006. • Skripal and his daughter collapsed on Sunday afternoon. The pair were taken to Salisbury district hospital, where a major incident was declared on Monday. Public Health England radiation and toxicology experts have been called in to help. Alastair Hay, a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, has outlined how Skripal and his daughter will be being treated and tested in intensive care. Standard blood tests will be done to assess electrolyte levels and liver and kidney function. Individuals will be receiving intravenous fluids anyway and it is essential to maintain fluid balance. Intensive care facilities in hospitals are best placed to look after poisoned patients as they have the necessary skills and equipment. As for tests, a variety of fluids will be investigated. Blood, saliva and urine will all be tested. Urine may provide clues for substances excreted more rapidly. Given the apparent rapidity of onset of symptoms a bacterial or viral cause seems less likely but we know nothing at this stage about how the couple were feeling hours earlier. So a microbiology lab may well do a range of screening tests to check for a bacterial cause. But this will depend on what the clinical team feels is appropriate. Signs and symptoms give a clue about possible candidate chemicals or drugs and the hospital’s own laboratory may be able to do some of the testing. Other labs at Guy’s hospital or in Birmingham are also equipped to screen for a wide range of substances. And finally, there is the government’s chemical defence laboratory at Porton Down which has state-of-the-art equipment to look for trace amounts of substances. Individuals cannot provide unlimited amounts of blood for testing so investigations will be guided by the clinical team. Some tests are rapid and some candidates will be looked at quickly But if the cause is more unusual, body fluids will require significant clean-up preparation before they can be put in an instrument. So this could take a day or several days. There will be active coordination with a whole range of agencies and hospital departments in a case like this. The Guardian’s Luke Harding recounted in his book about the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko how the KGB established a poisons institute on the orders of Lenin. Known as Lab X, it is said to have operated throughout the Soviet era, and its existence was confirmed in the memoir of Pavel Sudoplatov, head of the KGB’s Administration for Special Tasks. In January 2016 Sir Robert Owen, the coroner in the Litvinenko inquest, said he was certain Litvinenko had been poisoned by two Russian men, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, using polonium made in a nuclear reactor. He said the men were probably under direction and that the operation was probably approved by Vladimir Putin. He noted that Putin had subsequently decorated Lugovoi for services to the fatherland: “President Putin’s conduct towards Mr Lugovoi suggests a level of approval for the killing of Mr Litvinenko,” Owen said. More from Wiltshire police. One member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Here’s the main points: Both victims remain in a critical condition in intensive care. A number of scenes have been secured. These include the Zizzi restaurant on Castle Street and The Bishop’s Mill pub in The Maltings. The advice from Public Health England remains that, based on the evidence to date, currently there doesn’t appear to be any immediate risk to public health. Police can confirm that a small number of emergency services personnel were assessed immediately after the incident and all but one have been released from hospital. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has granted an urgent question on the government’s policy towards Russia. The Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, will be asking the question at approximately 12.30pm in the House of Commons. Two police officers dealing with the Salisbury incident have been admitted to hospital, the BBC reports, citing a Wiltshire police email. The BBC’s Tom Symonds says they had minor symptoms including itchy eyes and wheezing. Last night police closed Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury city centre as a precaution. The Conservative MP for Salisbury, John Glen, has expressed his concern about Sunday’s events. Writing on Twitter he appealed for the police to be given space to investigate. He also said he had been assured there was no wider risk to public safety. Skripal’s wife, Liudmila, died of cancer at the family home in Salisbury in October 2012. Her daughter Yulia reported the death to Wiltshire council’s register office and told staff that her father was a retired local government planning officer. The death certificate recorded Liudmila’s cause of death as disseminated endometrial carcinoma. She and her husband and daughter all lived at the same address in Salisbury, according to the certificate. Bill Browder, the chief executive of Hermitage Capital, who is fighting for justice after the death of his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison cell in 2009, claims the Salisbury incident was attempted murder. Speaking to the Press Association, he said: “We don’t know much, but based on the headlines from yesterday, who the person was, his relationship with the Kremlin and the circumstances of his collapse, the first operating assumption should be that this was an assassination attempt by the Kremlin against a traitor of Russia.” Browder, who is in Westminster to give evidence to a parliamentary committee on fake news, added: “It should be treated with the utmost seriousness in terms of law enforcement resources. Putin has publicly said that he kills traitors wherever they are in the world. Again, we don’t know what exactly happened here, but assuming he was poisoned then the most likely theory to pursue would be a Kremlin assassination plot similar to Litvinenko.” Update: Our correspondent Marc Bennetts has clarified that Putin has never said this. In fact, he has stated that Russian special services do not kill traitors. This map pinpoints the key locations. It may only be coincidence but two of Skripal’s close family have recently died. Now he, and reportedly his daughter, have been found unconscious in Salisbury. His 43-year-old son died in St Petersburg last year. And his wife, Liudmila, died recently of natural causes. Yulia Skripal was discovered next to her father on a bench and is in a critical condition in hospital. She lives in Russia but was visiting the UK, the BBC reported. It said relatives had not heard from her for two days. The BBC’s Tom Symonds has identified Skripal’s daughter Yulia as the second person found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday. Here’s a helpful graphic of the scene in Salisbury where Skripal was found unconscious. Freya Church, 27, who spotted the pair “slumped” and “passed out” on the bench told the Press Association, the couple in the CCTV images were “100%” the people she saw on Sunday. The gym worker, from Salisbury, said: “She was leaning on him, slumped. She looked passed out and he was looking up doing these hand movements (gesticulating upwards with arms). His eyes were glazed. To be honest I thought they were just homeless.” Litvinenko suspect Andrei Lugovoi has suggested the UK is paranoid about the Salisbury incident. “Considering that there are constant incidents in Britain with gentlemen who have fled Russia, there isn’t much to be surprised about here,” he told the RIA Novosti news agency. He told Interfax: “The English suffer from phobias. If something happens to Russians, they immediately seek Russian fingermarks.” Earlier he suggested it was a false flag operation. Aside from Litvinenko, Russia’s Vedomosti newspaper said at least two other Kremlin foes had been killed on foreign soil since Putin came to power. Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, a Chechen separatist leader, died when a bomb ripped through his car in Qatar in 2004. Two GRU agents were jailed for life by a Qatari court but were extradited to Moscow less than a year after the trial. Their whereabouts are unknown. In 2005 a Russian official admitted they were not in jail. Last year Denis Voronenkov, a Russian MP who turned against the Kremlin, was shot dead in Kiev, Ukraine. Moscow denied it was responsible for his murder. Boris Berezovsky, a former oligarch who fled to Britain after falling out with Putin, died at his Berkshire home in 2013 in unclear circumstances. A coroner recorded an open verdict on his death. Another Russian, Alexander Perepilichny, who had been assisting a Swiss investigation into Russian money-laundering, was found dead in 2012 in Britain. Police have ruled out foul play, despite suspicions that he may have been poisoned. An inquest has yet to give a final conclusion on the cause of death. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has said she will be seeking assurances from the government. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she stopped short of calling for investigations into the mysterious deaths of other Russians on British soil to be reopened. But she said would be writing to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to ask what assurances she could provide “if it does prove to be the case that the Russian state is involved”. She said: “I don’t like defaulting to a ‘red menace’ analysis, but we can’t allow London and the Home Counties to become a kind of killing field for the Russian state and its enemies.” Rudd could be asked to make a Commons statement. Salisbury district hospital, where the pair are being treated, is open as normal. A man who saw Skripal being treated by paramedics said he was in a “catatonic” state, Solent News Agency is reporting. Graham Mulcock said: “The paramedics seemed to be struggling to keep the two people conscious. The man was sitting staring into space in a catatonic state. He was just staring ahead of himself.” Andrei Lugovoi, the Russian agent believed to be behind the killing of Alexander Litvinenko, has suggested the incident in Salisbury is a false flag operation. “I don’t rule out that this is another provocation by British intelligence agencies,” Lugovoi told Russia’s pro-Kremlin Vzglyad newspaper. “Whatever happens on [British] territory, they start yelling: ‘He was killed, he was hung, he was poisoned!’ and that Russia is to blame for everything. This is to their advantage.” CCTV footage has emerged showing a man and woman walking through an alleyway connecting Zizzi’s restaurant in Salisbury and the bench where Skripal was found. Police took away an image, shot at 3.47pm on Sunday, from a camera at the gym Snap Fitness, according to the gym’s manager. Cain Prince, 28, said: “Police had a good look at the footage and were interested in these two people. It was the only image they took away. “They wanted a list of everyone in the gym between 3 and 4pm as well.” Prince added police said Skripal was “wearing a green coat”. Ben Emmerson QC, who represented the Litvinenko family at the inquest in London, called on the government to consider establishing a public inquiry into the suspected poisoning in Salisbury. He said: If Sergei Skripal turns out to have been the target of a Russian assassination attempt, the prime minister and the home secretary must promptly announces a public inquiry to determine the extent of Kremlin involvement. Theresa May initially refused to set up a public inquiry into the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko through the administration of the radioactive isotope polonium 210, which the Kremlin believed thought was undetectable. One of the reasons May gave for this cowardly decision was that a public inquiry would harm the UK’s relationship with Russia. Litvinenko’s widow, Marina, had to go to the high court to get an order overturning May’s decision. That unseemly spectacle should not be repeated here. The Russian state policy of assassinating political opponents – so-called enemies of the state – at home and abroad has been allowed to continue unchecked for too long. The international community has to send a clear message to the Kremlin that this is intolerable and must stop. This is not the time for prevarication. May needs to act quickly and decisively and show the Russian state that if they send murder squads to Britain, we will be dogged in our search for the truth, without fear of the diplomatic fallout. Welcome to live updates on the Russian spy incident as former spy Sergei Skripal fights for his life in Salisbury. Here’s what we know so far: Police are trying to establish what the substance was that Skripal, 66, and a woman in her 30s were exposed to in Salisbury over the weekend. The bench where the pair collapsed unconscious in the Maltings shopping centre next to the river Avon is still cordoned off on Tuesday morning, as is a nearby Italian chain restaurant. The UK’s leading counter-terrorism officer, Mark Rowley, said his specialists were supporting the investigation that has led to a major incident being declared in Salisbury. Rowley said the investigation could look at possible links with the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. “If you look back at other cases like Litvinenko, if necessary we will bring that investigation into the counter-terrorism network,” he said. The Kremlin said it was ready to cooperate if Britain asked for help in its investigation of the “tragic situation”. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “Nobody has approached us with such a request. Moscow is always open for cooperation.” Skripal was one of four Russians exchanged for 10 deep cover “sleeper” agents planted by Moscow in the US in 2010. For more than five years he has been living quietly – though not hidden – in a modern red-brick home close to Salisbury city centre. Skripal and the woman, who has not been identified, collapsed on Sunday afternoon. Skripal was convicted of passing the identities of Russian agents working undercover in Europe to MI6 in 2006. The pair were taken to Salisbury district hospital, where a major incident was delcared on Monday. Public Health England radiation and toxicology experts have been called in to help."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/mar/06/brexit-david-davis-eu-scrutiny-committee-eu-firms-more-worried-about-protecting-single-market-than-maintaining-trade-with-uk-says-barnier-aide-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T17:42:38Z","webTitle":"Davis says Commons vote on withdrawal agreement won't be able to stop Brexit - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/06/brexit-david-davis-eu-scrutiny-committee-eu-firms-more-worried-about-protecting-single-market-than-maintaining-trade-with-uk-says-barnier-aide-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/06/brexit-david-davis-eu-scrutiny-committee-eu-firms-more-worried-about-protecting-single-market-than-maintaining-trade-with-uk-says-barnier-aide-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Davis says Commons vote on withdrawal agreement won't be able to stop Brexit - Politics live","bodyText":"The UK will “respond appropriately and robustly” if the Russian state is found to have been involved in poisoning the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury on Sunday, Boris Johnson has said, including reconsidering its participation in the World Cup. After Johnson’s comment in the Commons, a Foreign Office source said he was referring to the participation of British officials in the World Cup, not to a potential boycott by the England team. Emily Thornberry, his Labour shadow, posted this reponse on Twitter. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has told MPs that the Commons vote on the withdrawal agreement planned for the autumn, the so-called “meaningful vote”, will not be allowed to stop Brexit. (See 4.45pm.) Airbus has warned it would have to consider its position in the UK without imminent clarity over customs rules after Brexit. The most recently retired British ambassador to the United States has described the prospect of a “generous” free trade deal with Donald Trump after Brexit as an “illusion”. Prison governors are to be given a refreshed system of “carrot and stick” incentives and sanctions to control inmates’ behaviour, including improved “virtual” family contact time, to help tackle the record level of violence in jails in England and Wales. As Alan Travis reports, the justice secretary, David Gauke, cited his experience of benefit sanctions when he was work and pensions secretary as evidence that a system of incentives and penalties could work. He also confirmed in a speech at the Royal Society of Arts in London that there would be a “back to basics” approach with an “immediate and relentless focus” on maintenance and staffing to tackle the filthy conditions inside some of the worst prisons. Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister has defended the “punitive action” of handing women on hunger strike at Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre official letters warning them they could face accelerated deportation if they continue with their protest. The transgender model and campaigner Munroe Bergdorf has quit her role on the Labour party’s LGBT advisory board after attacks in the tabloid press and by Conservatives over comments she had made. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here are the main points from David Davis’s evidence to the European scrutiny committee. Davis, the Brexit secretary, insisted that the Commons vote on the withdrawal agreement planned for the autumn, the so-called “meaningful vote”, would not be allowed to stop Brexit. When asked about this by the Labour MP Geraint Davies, Davis replied: I don’t believe in the meaningful vote as overruling the referendum, if that’s what you mean ... We will leave in all circumstances. Davis suggested that EU professionals could be allowed easy access to work in the UK under the government’s plans for a trade deal. Asked if the government would offer immigration access as part of a trade deal, he replied: What you will find is that when you have trade deals which cover things like services, and there’s a fairly limited amount of free trade in services at the moment, you often have related free movement arrangements, mode 4, there are various modes of migration. And it is entirely possible that could happen. We would want to negotiate, I don’t know whether the Europeans would be willing, but we would want to negotiate significant mutual professional qualification recognition. If we do that, I would imagine there will be some arrangements allowing people with those professional qualifications to move between companies. He admitted that it was possible that the UK might not be able to participate in various EU agencies after Brexit, as Theresa May proposed in her Mansion House speech. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said that some EU agencies, like the European Medicines, have no provision for third-country participation. EU laws would have to be re-written to allow the UK to participate, Kinnock said. Davis replied: We may or may not be able to do it. That’s why I said we are exploring it. I think the likelihood is very high that we would. Take the European Medicines Agency, I think we do about 40% of the approvals under the European Medicines Agency, something of that order ... To be honest, the central issue will be whether the union itself want to negotiate these matters. If it wants to negotiate them ... The will is there with us. The question is, [is the will there on their side?] We’ll know shortly. We’ll now after March 23 [when the EU summit discusses the trade negotiation.] Afterwards Kinnock said he found Davis’s uncertainty on this point “astonishing”. Davis said the government would not stop contingency planning for a “no deal” Brexit if it agreed a transition deal. The Conservative MP Marcus Fysh said this contradicted what Philip Hammond, the chancellor, told the committee yesterday when he said the government would stop contingency planning for a “no deal” Brexit in March 2019 if a transition were agreed (although Hammond said the government would still prepare for the possibility of the transition ending without a trade deal.) Davis claimed that he and chancellor took the same view, even though Fysh was right to say that there was a difference in what they were saying. Hammond was arguing that, if a transition deal gets agreed soon, there will be no realistic chance of the transition not happening; Davis was arguing that, because the transition will formally be part of the final withdrawal deal, it could fall apart at the end. (See below.) Davis said it was possible the talks could collapse without a deal at the end of the process. But this was not likely, he said. It is always possible - highly improbable but always possible - that the deal will come apart at the end for some wholly unpredictable reason. A responsible government has to be ready for that outcome just as a matter of good practice. Davis said Home Office officials would travel to Brussels to brief MEPs on their plans to allow EU nationals to apply for setted status after Brexit. MEPs want this process to be straightforward. Davis said Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, discussed this with Home Office officials today. Davis said: [Verhofstadt] was briefed by the Home Office team on what was being done to make this whole process much more administratively clean-cut, much more dependable, and much more simple. And one of the things he agreed with them was that they would visit the European parliament and take the people who are most concerned about this through the process, and also that we could listen to what they have to say. Davis hinted that Number 10 forced him to open talks with the EU on phase one Brexit issues before moving on to discuss the future trade relationship. Davis was mocked last summer when, having promised “the row of the summer” over this (he wanted to negotiate trade in parallel with phase one issues like the Irish border), he acquiesced to the Brussels timetable. When Labour’s Kate Hoey suggested it was a mistake to agree to EU sequencing, Davis replied: Well, I’ll let that one pass. You can tell how comfortable I was [about the decision to enter talks on the commission’s terms.] After his talks in Number 10, Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, said it would be best for the UK to stay “very near” to the rules of the EU. He told reporters: If the UK stays very near to the rules of the European Union that will secure jobs in Britain. That will be the best way forward for the British economy. My preferential choice would be that Britain still is part of the single market, still is part of the customs union, then most problems would be solved. That is not the wish of the UK government. The most recently retired British ambassador to the United States has described the prospect of a “generous” free trade deal with Donald Trump after Brexit as an “illusion”, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports. Cash ends by urging Davis to tell Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, that the UK cannot be pushed around. Cash says article 50 changed the EU, in that the UK is no longer just a normal member state. Davis says he always believes in being polite in negotiations. And that’s it. Overall, that was relatively non-eventful. In so far as there were any news lines, I will post a summary of them soon. Lavbour’s Geraint Davies goes next. Q; Have you ruled out offering more immigration access to countries as part of a trade deal? Davis says the government would not put it like that, and he would not say so publicly he was doing that. But he says trade deals do contain provisions relating to immigration rules for qualified workers. Kelvin Hopkins goes next. He asks about the lines in Theresa May’s speech about “binding” and “strong” commitments to aligning on standards. Davis says most trade agreements include commitments to meet certain standards. A commitment to meet ILO (International Labour Organisation) standards would be binding, he says. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock goes next. Q: Just before the EU referendum Theresa May said that leaving the EU would lead to the return of a hard border in Ireland. Why has she changed her mind? Davis says he cannot comment on that speech. But the government wants to keep the border invisible. That does not mean there might not be tax collection etc. But it would be away from the border. Richard Drax, a Conservative, goes next. Q: Do you think people are using the Irish issue, and the threat of the return of violence, to stop Brexit? Davis says the Irish border issue is resolvable. He is not going to get into commenting on what other people said. But he does not want to see violence return, he says. Labour’s Kate Green goes next. She asks the question her Labour colleague Emma Reynolds asked Theresa May in the Commons yesterday, about whether there is any open border between two countries not in a customs union. Davis says that, in many places, the US/Canada border is open. And, although the Irish border is open, it is a border, he says. He says the government does not need to be able to point to a particular model to be able to answer this question. Davis is now talking about the three proposals for solving the Irish border issue in paragraph 49 of the joint report published in December. He says option A is the government’s preferred solution. Option B would come in to play to address those issues not solved by option A. But he says the UK has not been able to negotiate those yet, because the trade talks have not started. Q: Perhaps we should not have started talking about Ireland now then? Davis says he will pass over that. Then he says the questioner (Kate Hoey) can guess what he felt about having to discuss the Irish border issue first. (Davis originally said he would have “the row of the summer” over this, but then backed down. His comments this afternoon suggest that he only did so under orders from Number 10.) Labour’s Kate Hoey goes next. She asks what will happen to fishing during the transition. Davis says this has not been negotiated yet. Q: Fishing communities are worried this will be used as a bargaining chip. Davis says the UK will have control of its own waters. But it will need to negotiate with the EU, not least because it will need market access. But it won’t trade away fishing rights for other things, he says. In response to a follow-up from Richard Drax, a Conservative, he says there will not be sudden block on foreign fishing boats coming into UK waters. But those waters will be under UK control, he says. Sir Bill Cash, the committee chairman, goes next. Q: Will the European court of justice have any exclusive jurisdiction over the withdrawal agreement? Davis says it would be wrong to allow the ECJ to have an exclusive say over how the treaty is interpreted. The treaty has to be overseen by an independent authority, he says. Davis says Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, met a team from the Home Office this morning who explained how they process would work for EU nationals who apply for settled status. Davis says it was agreed that Home Office officials will go to the European parliament to brief MEPs on their plans. Q: How do we give EU nationals that whatever is decided now will not be repealed by a future government? Davis says the provisions relating to the rights of EU nationals will be in a treaty. Historically governments have not repudiated treaties likely, he says. And he says he finds it hard to imagine any government going back on what has been promised to EU nationals. Davis says, if the UK were to leave the European Medicines Agency, they would leave a 30/40% hole in its work. He says he does not believe in taking a macho approach to negotiations. Instead, he thinks you should look at what is in the interests of both sides. Davis says the UK is going to explore the idea of signing up to some EU agencies after after Brexit. But he says it remains to be seen if the EU will support this. Q: What will happen if parliament votes done the withdrawal agreement? Davis says this has been explained from the despatch box. (In the past Davis has said that, although the Commons might want the government to return to Brussels to get a better deal, there is no guarantee that the EU would reopen the negotiation.) When pressed, he says he does not see the vote as overturning the referendum. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons European scrutiny committee. You can watch a live feed here. Davis says there are 11 areas where the UK and the EU still disagree on issues pertaining to the transition deal. We’ve got some new Guardian/ICM polling out today. The poll was conducted over the weekend, after Theresa May had delivered her Brexit speech, and we asked people about the May speech and Jeremy Corbyn’s earlier in the week. The results should make grim reading for both party leaders. What voters made of the Corbyn/May Brexit speeches We asked four sets of questions about the Corbyn/May speeches intended to find out: whether they clarified policy; whether their Brexit aims seemed realistic; whether voters approved; and whether it was likely to affect voting intention. Here is a chart showing the results. The key line for each question is the grey one, showing the net result (those agreeing minus those disagreeing). In one case there is no grey line because the net result was zero. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have both failed to enthuse voters with their speeches on Brexit, a Guardian/ICM poll suggests. The survey shows that, on almost all measures, people were more likely to react negatively than positively to what they heard. Corbyn notched up the only positive score, with those saying his Brexit policy is clearer than it was before outnumbering those who disagree by a net +1. But on realism (-11), approval (-13), and impact on voting intention (-17), his figures were negative. The poll suggests that May was less successful than Corbyn at clarifying her policy (she got a net score of -5 on this measure). But on the other three measures she did not do as badly as Corbyn, with voters notably more likely to say that they approved of her policy (her net score was “only” -3, against Corbyn’s -13) and that her aims were realistic (net score 0, against Corbyn’s -11). Analysis These figures are likely to have people scratching their heads in Labour HQ. When Corbyn delivered his speech, saying the UK should stay in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, Brussels experts generally agreed that this was a more realistic proposition than May’s “cakeist” approach. But the respondents to our poll disagree. (Is that because May included a realistic-minded passage in her speech on the “hard truths” about Brexit, unlike Corbyn?) And in Labour circles, backed by some psephological evidence, it is also taken for granted that the party’s softish Brexit stance puts it closer to the public opinion centre of gravity in a country where 48% voted remain than May’s hardish Brexit policy. But, again, the respondents don’t seem to see it that way. They prefer the May approach. Perhaps it is because there is still quite a negative reaction to Corbyn personally? Or perhaps it is because people who don’t obsess about politics have incompatible views and don’t always think rationally (an inconvenient truth largely, and wrongly, ignored by those who write about politics for a living.) It could also be the case that a large number of people say Corbyn’s Brexit policy doesn’t make them likely to vote Labour, not because they are not backing Labour, but because they know that Corbyn is more Eurosceptic than they are and his Brexit stance doesn’t count as one of his attractions. ICM’s Alex Turk says the real story may just be that people are fed up with Brexit. He writes: This is bleak reading for both Labour and Conservatives. Our regular polling results seems to increasingly show Brexit to be a zero-sum game for the two main parties – politicians have to be seen to be taking a position, but any position chosen is generally met with more public disagreement than agreement. Voting intention And here are the voting intention figures. Conservatives one point ahead of Labour, poll suggests. ICM’s Alex Turk writes: In terms of voting intentions, there’s very little change. Labour and Conservatives trade one percent of the public’s vote intention between them, meaning the Conservatives regain a slim lead on 43% compared to Labour’s 42%. But these two proportions are still very much within the margin of error on this poll, so if there was an election tomorrow, we’d still consider it too close to call. I will post a link to the tables here later. UPDATE: Here is the ICM write-up. And here are the tables (pdf). ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,030 adults aged 18+ on 2 to 4 March 2018. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. The urgent question about Russia and the Sergei Skripal incident is over, and I’m back. As we reported on the Srkipal live blog, Boris Johnson said the UK would respond “robustly” if Russia were found to be involved. Johnson, the foreign secretary, told MPs: Police, together with partner agencies, are now investigating. Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. And while it’d be wrong to prejudge the investigation, I can reassure the House that should evidence emerge that implies state responsibility, then Her Majesty’s government will respond appropriately and robustly. At 12.30pm Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, will be responding to an urgent question on Sergei Skripal, the former Russian spy taken ill in Salisbury after “suspected exposure to an unknown substance”. We have been covering this story on a separate live blog, and I will be covering the UQ in that blog, not this one. You can follow it here. NHS staff in England are reporting lower satisfaction with the quality of work and care they are able to deliver, a major new survey has found. As the Press Association reports, the 2017 NHS staff survey - the largest workforce survey in the world - found that 66.8% of staff “agree” or “strongly agree” that they are able to deliver the care they aspire to - down from 68.2% in 2016. The poll of more than 400,000 NHS workers found that 81.2% said they were satisfied with the quality of care they give to patients - down from 82.7% in 2016. Meanwhile, just 31% agreed that there are enough staff in their organisation to enable them to do their job properly. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has posted this about his meeting with Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman. On Sky’s All Out Politics Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter, former party leader and former work and pensions secretary, claimed there was growing anger in Europe about the way the European commission is sequencing the Brexit talks. People increasingly realise that it is impossible to produce a solution to the Irish border problem without knowing what the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU will be like, he argued. He said: I think that there is more and more a pressing sense that they [the commission] have got this wrong. They insisted on this stage by stage process. But what is actually going on - I’ve talked to a lot of representatives of various countries around and there’s a lot of under-the-surface anger about the way that the commission is insisting on completing the process about the interim period, or the implementation period, without recognising that the deal that follows has a whole bearing on everything that will happen ... Unless we get to the point of a free trade arrangement, we cannot dictate what those borders [on the island of Ireland] will be like. So they have genuinely made a major mistake. Sky’s Darren McCaffrey says Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, told him that procedures at the US/Canada border did offer potential solutions to the Irish border issue. Theresa May said the same thing in the House of Commons yesterday, although Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister subsequently said that he disagreed strongly. He said: I visited the Canada/US border back in August and saw physical infrastructure with customs posts, people in uniforms with arms and dogs and that is definitely not a solution that we could possibly entertain. Foster says the DUP wanted Barnier to understand why they were so unhappy about the draft text of the withdrawal treaty published last week. She says that the DUP did not feel that it fully reflected the joint report agreed in December. Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s leader at Westminster, says they told Barnier that he had united the UK parliament, because all sides agreed that Northern Ireland being inside the single market while the rest of the UK was outside would be unacceptable. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, is now holding a press briefing in Brussels. She says the DUP told Michel Barnier that it was important for both sides to work together on finding a solution to the Irish border problem. She says she wants a “sensible Brexit”. She does not think in terms of hard or soft Brexit, she says. She says she thinks Barnier was “receptive” to what she said. And Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has tweeted this about her meeting with Michel Barnier. She says their meeting was “constructive”. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, tweeted this after his meeting this morning with the DUP leader Arlene Foster. The transgender model and campaigner Munroe Bergdorf has quit her role on the Labour party’s LGBT advisory board after attacks in the tabloid press and by Conservatives over her previous controversial comments. Bergdorf said she had been thrilled about the appointment, but said it had “turned into nasty tabloid fodder, blown out of all proportion”. The model, who had previously ended a L’Oreal partnership over other controversial statements, say her words were taken out of context by newspapers. She has been criticised for social media posts where she wrote that she no longer had the energy to talk about the “racial violence of white people any more”. In a statement posted on Twitter, Bergdorf said she had decided to step down from the role “with great sadness” and said Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities minister who appointed her, had been “nothing but supportive.” She said: This is the decision that I’ve had to make due to endless attacks on my character by the conservative rightwing press and relentless online abuse. I refuse to be painted as a villain or used as a pawn in the press’ efforts, especially those at the Daily Mail, to discredit the Labour party and push their transphobic rightist agendas. My colleague Matthew Weaver is writing a live blog covering the latest developments in the Russian spy incident story. Here it is. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, was on the Today programme earlier talking about this. She said: It’s important not to speculate without knowing everything about it, but it does bear a striking similarity to the death of Litvinenko, who was poisoned by the Russian state, and before that Markov who was killed bizarrely by somebody stabbing him with an umbrella with poison on the tip. Abbott said she would be writing to Amber Rudd, the home secretary, to ask what assurances she could provide “if it does prove to be the case that the Russian state is involved”. Abbott went on: I don’t like defaulting to a ‘red menace’ analysis, but we can’t allow London and the Home Counties to become a kind of killing field for the Russian state and its enemies. We had been expecting to get the EU’s guidelines for the EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks today. Publication of that document, which will constitute the EU’s fullest response yet to Theresa May’s Lancaster House speech, has been postponed. But last night we got a fairly good insight into how the European commission is reacting when Stefaan De Rynck, the main adviser to the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, spoke at an event at the LSE. Our main story on De Rynck’s speech says that Theresa May’s chances of securing a deep free-trade deal with the EU were dealt a blow when De Rynck stressed that the rules of the single market required far more than her chief proposal – a mutual recognition of standards. You can read it here. Here is a summary from John Peet, the Economist’s Brexit editor. And here is an alternative take from the Spectator’s editor, Fraser Nelson. But De Rynck also had another important message; he said that EU businesses were more concerned about protecting the integrity of the single market than about maintaining access to trade with Britain. According to Politico Europe, De Rynck said: We keep hearing from EU businesses that the short-term costs of Brexit will never outweigh the longer-term costs of having the single market unravel. Michel Barnier was in Copenhagen on Friday, he met social partners, stakeholders, businesses. I was struck by what one journalist tweeted, I quote: ‘All Danish businesses are more concerned with keeping the integrity of the internal market than any loss of UK market access.’ This is the tweet he was referring to. Ole Ryborg is a Danish TV journalist covering Brussels. As usual, there will be a lot more Brexit later. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 10am: Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, attends a meeting with the leaders of the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens in parliament to discuss their opposition to the government’s approach to Brexit. Morning: Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, meets Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels. 11am: Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, arrives in Downing Street for talks with David Davis, the Brexit secretary.

Buffon said the outbreak of pessimism in Turin after the 2-2 first-leg draw was entirely normal; any blip Juventus suffer is invariably magnified. But as the manager, Massimiliano Allegri, suggested he was ready to start with Gonzalo Higuaín, Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa up front, Buffon sounded a note of optimism. “When Juventus are wounded or we have our backs to the wall, it spurs us on,” the 40-year-old goalkeeper said. “It will be an uphill battle but sometimes you can get caught out if it’s all downhill all the way. It’s obvious there is a certain amount of pessimism after the first leg. One false step with Juventus and people start to fear the worst or criticise us. But we are capable of playing the right game. “Spurs like to attack but by the same token they have a style of play which sometimes allows the opposition a few chances. It will be very even. The team that has the best clinical edge will be the team that goes through.” Buffon said the Tottenham striker Harry Kane reminded him of Gabriel Batistuta, the great Argentina No 9, but he was more concerned with Juventus’s attacking options. Dybala is back from injury while Higuaín returned to training on Monday after an ankle problem. “I don’t see any reason why they cannot both play,” Allegri said. “The fact that this is such a huge game – you want to play in a game like this, even if you’re not in tip-top shape. Douglas Costa could well play, too.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/06/dulwich-hamlet-champion-hill-eviction-meadow-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T15:38:32Z","webTitle":"Threat of eviction grows for Dulwich Hamlet as row with stadium owners escalates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/06/dulwich-hamlet-champion-hill-eviction-meadow-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/06/dulwich-hamlet-champion-hill-eviction-meadow-football","fields":{"headline":"Threat of eviction grows for Dulwich Hamlet as row with stadium owners escalates","bodyText":"The breakdown in relations between Dulwich Hamlet and Meadow Residential LLP, the property investment fund which owns their stadium, Champion Hill, has reached a new low after the non-league club were informed they could no longer even use their own name or initials. Dulwich, top of the Bostik Premier Division after Tuesday’s win at Billericay, had been handed an unanticipated bill for back rent of £121,000 by Meadow on Monday evening with the threat of a winding-up order to follow within 21 days, and were served notice that their licence to play at the stadium had been terminated with immediate effect. The south London club, who celebrate their 125th anniversary this year, were still digesting that news when they received a letter from the solicitors Blake Morgan representing ‘Greendales IP LLC’, a subsidiary of Meadow, declaring that ‘Dulwich Hamlet Football Club’, ‘The Hamlet’ and even ‘DHFC’ had been registered as trademarks on 17 October 2017. The letter went on to demand that those trademarks “no longer be used on any printed literature and any online activity including websites and Twitter”. Dulwich intend to continue using their own name regardless of the legal implications, with supporters taking to Twitter in defiance on Tuesday night championing the hashtag #DHFC. Meadow purchased Champion Hill for £5.7m four years ago but were blocked from an £80m residential development of the site after losing a legal battle with Southwark council last October, at around the same time the trademarks were registered on the club’s name. Their long-standing threat to evict the club – who regularly attract gates in excess of 1,500 to games in the seventh tier – was duly carried out on Monday. “This follows repeated breaches of the licence by the club,” said a Meadow spokesman, “together with unwarranted personal attacks on the company, which has funded the club for a number of years and without which the club would not have survived as long as it has.” Dulwich, who are exploring options to groundshare at other south London clubs as they seek to fulfil their remaining six home games this season, remain of interest to Rio Ferdinand’s affordable housing group, Legacy Foundation. The former England defender, who hails from nearby Peckham and is a close friend of the Dulwich manager, Gavin Rose, had proposed a development in compliance with Southwark Council’s requirements with a £10m bid lodged with Meadow before Christmas. That was rejected, with subsequent efforts to re-enter negotiations having come to nothing. Southwark council intends to discuss its own potential acquisition of Champion Hill, potentially under a compulsory purchase order, at a cabinet meeting next week. The council leader, Peter John, joined the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, on Tuesday evening in writing to Meadow in their offices in New York to request they consider selling Champion Hill to Southwark, thereby bringing the stadium into public ownership and safeguarding the future of the club. On Wednesday Meadow made a set of proposals which included transferring to the supporters’ trust ownership of the trademarks to DHST. It also said it wanted Dulwich Hamlet to see out the season at Champion Hill and to work with Southwark council to find a solution which would enable Meadow to develop the site for housing and build a new stadium for the club."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/09/martin-shkreli-sentence-jail-arrogance-sentencing-fraud","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T19:45:48Z","webTitle":"Martin Shkreli pays price for arrogance – and 'egregious multitude of lies'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/09/martin-shkreli-sentence-jail-arrogance-sentencing-fraud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/09/martin-shkreli-sentence-jail-arrogance-sentencing-fraud","fields":{"headline":"Martin Shkreli pays price for arrogance – and 'egregious multitude of lies'","bodyText":"Martin Shkreli sounded uncharacteristically contrite in the letter he wrote to the judge last week, shortly before his sentencing. “I was a fool,” the disgraced pharmaceutical boss wrote in a last-ditch attempt to head off a heavy sentence. “I have learned a very painful lesson.” On Friday in Brooklyn, Judge Kiyo Matsumoto seemed unconvinced, handing down a seven-year sentence following Shkreli’s conviction last August on charges that he deceived investors in a pair of failed hedge funds. Prosecutors had asked for Shkreli – dubbed the “Pharma Bro” – to be given 15 years in prison. Legal experts said he could easily get 10. Matsumoto said Shkreli had shown remorse, but the case was about an “egregious multitude of lies” and mentioned that Shkreli’s bail was revoked by after he offered a $5,000 bounty for a Hillary Clinton hair – with the follicle. John Coffee of Columbia law school said Shkreli’s crimes were similar to insider trading, and the longest sentence handed out in such a case is the 11 years given to the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. Rajaratnam was convicted of trading on illegal tips in the biggest such case brought in decades. That case was “longer-term, more egregious and absolutely predatory”, said Coffee. So why did Shkreli get nearly as long? Basically, because he acted like a jerk. “His behavior during the trial was arrogant, and he treated the judge as an irrelevancy. Every defense counsel I know, and I know a lot of them, instructs his client to be respectful and modest because ultimately the judge is going to sentence you. Your arrogance can cost you a very high price,” Coffee said. From his cell at Metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn, New York, Shkreli may well be regretting calling the prosecution “junior varsity”, telling reporters during a break that his critics “blame me for capitalism” and trolling detractors on social media so hard that not only was he banned for life from Twitter but prosecutors called for a gag order to stop him from making “a spectacle of himself and the trial directly on the courthouse grounds”. It could all have been so different. Born in Coney Island, Brooklyn, in 1983 to Albanian immigrants who both worked janitorial jobs, Shkreli was a bright kid who attended New York’s Hunter College high school, a public school for gifted kids whose alumni include the supreme court justice Elena Kagan and the Sex and the City actor Cynthia Nixon, before getting a degree in business administration. If he had taken another path, he might have been an American business hero. Instead he became the poster boy for excess in the pharmaceutical industry and was dubbed the most hated man in the country. It all started auspiciously enough. At 17, Shkreli was interning at Cramer Berkowitz, a hedge fund run by the CBNC pundit Jim Cramer (Cramer told Vanity Fair he didn’t remember him) and by 21 he was running his own hedge. He was also running into trouble. In 2007, a bet with Lehman Brothers on declining markets went wrong and Shkreli refused to pay up. Shkreli was right that markets would tank – but a year later. A suit ensued, but by then Lehmans had declared bankruptcy, the financial crisis had begun, and the suit was vacated. It was his next venture, a hedge fund called MSMB, that landed him in jail. MSMB invested in biotech companies. According to US prosecutors, Shkreli used “a trifecta of lies, deceit, and greed” to scam its investors, lying about its success and paying them back from another company he owned. Shkreli was arrested in 2015, taken from his Manhattan apartment in a grey hoodie and handcuffs in a morning “perp walk” in front of the nation’s press, and charged with “widespread fraudulent conduct”. The charges, however, had nothing to do with the incident that had already made him infamous. As became apparent in court, most of MSMB’s investors got their money back, and the trial would have been a run-of-the-mill case if it weren’t for Shkreli’s alter ego – Pharma Bro, a villain whose origin story is a tale fit for the comic-book baddy he became. In 2015, one of his companies, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the US rights to Daraprim, a drug that has been around since 1953 and is used to treat toxoplasmosis, an infection that is particularly dangerous for people with Aids and compromised immune systems, as well as pregnant and elderly people. Untreated, it can cause seizures, blindness, birth defects and death. Outside the US, Daraprim is cheap: it costs $1 to $2 a pill. Patients take two or three pills a day and need treatment for weeks or months. The price in the US was already far higher ($13.50) when Shkreli bought the company in 2015, but overnight Turing hiked the price of Daraprim to $750, a fiftyfold increase. The story became a media sensation and Shkreli became “the most hated man in America”. What he did wasn’t illegal or even, sadly, all that unusual. Price gouging is a common practice for US pharmaceutical companies. But while other price hikes have roiled the media, Shkreli remained the poster boy for pharma excess and seemingly revelled in it.For a short moment it looked like Shkreli could be the impetus for change, and Congress held hearings on drug prices. Shkreli declined to testify but characteristically found time to tweet that members of Congress were “imbeciles”. For all the shouting, drug laws haven’t changed. The $277m the pharma industry spent on lobbying last year alone probably helped. And in the meantime, Shkreli managed to keep the attention on himself with a series of increasingly obnoxious stunts. He paid $2m for the one copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin by the rap legends the Wu Tang Clan – and then got into a fight with the band. Ghostface Killah called him “Michael Jackson nose kid”. Shkreli retaliated by appearing to physically threaten the rapper in a video where he was flanked my masked goons. But it was his behavior in court that may well have cost him dearest. “If you are going to be arrogant with a sentencing judge, you are taking your life in your hands,” said Coffee. Sentencing expert Edward Bales, founder of Justice Solutions of America, said he expected Shkreli would initially be sent to Butner, a facility in North Carolina that holds fraudster Bernie Madoff, for assessment after sentencing. If the authorities rule Shkreli is mentally sound, his threats to Clinton and others could mean a stay in a medium-security prison – alongside gang members and other hardened criminals. “It’s a whole different ball game when you are threatening government officials. They take that very seriously,” said Bales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/06/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-juventus-wembley","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T18:34:43Z","webTitle":"I am a dreamer, says Pochettino as Tottenham prepare for Juventus test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/06/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-juventus-wembley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/06/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-juventus-wembley","fields":{"headline":"I am a dreamer, says Pochettino as Tottenham prepare for Juventus test","bodyText":"Tottenham Hotspur were first written off after the Champions League group-stage draw. Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund? Too difficult, particularly after the way they struggled in the competition last season. But Mauricio Pochettino and his players made a mockery of the gloomy predictions, surging into the knockout stage as the group winners. They were written off once more three weeks ago, after nine minutes of the last-16 first leg at Juventus, as they trailed 2-0. “The team was suffering because we were nervous about conceding the third goal,” Pochettino said. They almost did, only for Gonzalo Higuaín to crash a 45th‑minute penalty against the crossbar. It was a moment of fortune. By then, however, Harry Kane had made it 2-1 and Spurs were once again showing the mettle that has marked their progress this season. They were full value for the eventual 2-2 draw and, according to the captain, Hugo Lloris, it has made them the slight favourites before the return leg at Wembley on Wednesday night. It is a seismic occasion for the club – only the second time they have made it so far in the Champions League, after Harry Redknapp’s class of 2011 reached the quarter-finals. Pochettino’s team have been fortified by disappointment and joy. They have grown season on season and one thing is plain: they now sense opportunity. “The first leg was another example of the attitude we have in the team,” Lloris said. “We were nearly out of the competition because, if they had scored a third goal before half-time, it could have been very difficult. But then we turned the tide. “You need to live through different experiences and it was the case last season in the Champions League [when they went out at the group stage]. We failed together but the best way is to learn very quickly. Everyone outside the club was concerned after the draw this season but we have showed our quality. “In football and in life, when you have the chance to play a competition like this, you need to take it because you never know what will happen in the next few years. It’s a great moment to show the real face of Tottenham.” Seizing the moment was the theme of the pre-match media conference and there was no little tub-thumping. “Winning one title would be fantastic for everyone and mean a lot because, if we can win some trophies along the way, it will be complete – different from other clubs,” Pochettino said. “The players would be heroes because they will have competed with these big sides. We can’t set a limit. I don’t do that. I am a dreamer. Every chance you have to play, you need to go as far as possible.” Tottenham’s improvement has been inexorable. Two years ago, after their Europa League exit against Dortmund, Pochettino said his team could not compete with the continent’s leading clubs. This season they have beaten Dortmund home and away with a home win against Madrid the high point, the greatest confidence-booster. “We have improved the team every season step by step,” Pochettino said. “Maybe no big step but a little step every season. You can see that the team is more mature and more competitive every season. We improved our reputation in Europe after the group stage. People started to respect Tottenham more.” Juventus have Paulo Dybala available again after he missed the first leg through injury and it was revealing that Pochettino mentioned the Argentinian attacker in the same breath as Lionel Messi. The Tottenham manager also described Higuaín as “one of the greatest strikers in the world” – although he is a major doubt with an ankle injury. Mario Mandzukic has not travelled because of a thigh problem. Tottenham must manage the occasion as well as the opposition and Lloris said it would be foolish to try to dig in and protect their away goals advantage. They have to play to win. “If we think too much about playing for a draw, especially against an experienced team like Juve, you can be in trouble,” Lloris said. Pochettino said: “We must not think too much about the consequences of the result. We need to feel free.” The manager talked about the special feeling of these glamour ties the goosebumps when the Champions League anthem plays but there will be a moment of sadness at kick-off time when a minute’s silence is held to honour Davide Astori, the 31-year-old Fiorentina captain who died on Sunday. Lloris said the Tottenham squad had been “very affected by this tragic news” while for Pochettino it brought back memories of the death of Dani Jarque in 2009 – his former captain at Espanyol. Pochettino said: “It’s impossible to take away that pain and find an explanation. I met Davide for lunch five years ago because I wanted to sign him at Southampton and he was a great person. We share the pain with all the people in Italy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/07/is-cold-water-good-for-you-google","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T07:59:03Z","webTitle":"Is cold water good for you?

You asked Google – here’s the answer","bodyText":"I swam through ice three weeks after giving birth. I wondered, momentarily, if it was possible to freeze breast milk in your own body. I wondered, briefly, if my uterus might shrivel up and fall out. I wondered, frankly, if I still had it in me. And yet, afterwards I felt happier, more clear-headed and warmer of heart than I had for weeks. The question – as with all things that give us a rush of adrenaline, take effort, force us outdoors and push us into severe discomfort – is: should I be doing this? Is it safe? Is it advisable? Is it good for me? With half a heart we roar for the answer to be yes, the confirmation that will fling us out into the bright, sharp edge of our ability, to surprise ourselves. Yet simultaneously, and just as strongly, we hope the answer will be no; that we will be warned back into the cosy warmth of what we know, what comes easily and what won’t require standing in the howling wind with nothing but our pubes for warmth. Is cold water good for you? Well, it depends how it is administered, how often and under what circumstances. For those with heart conditions, asthma or compromised immune systems, cold-water swimming may well be a stress too far on your body, and certainly something worth discussing with a GP before you start. But I’ve spent many months working as a lifeguard at the Kenwood Ladies’ Pond on Hampstead Heath, where I regularly watched women in their 70s, 80s, even 90s climb down the duck-cluttered ladder into the cold, velvet brown water and glide effortlessly across the surface. I am therefore inclined to believe that, when it comes to our bodies – the muscles and bones, the hormones and heartbeats that keep us going – cold water does us the opposite of harm. A report published in the BMJ Case Reports last month seems to indicate that cold-water immersion can improve postoperative pain and mobilisation outcomes. Standing around on the muddy banks of a river, on a windswept beach or in the mottled-thigh changing room of the ponds, I have often heard like-minded swimmers swap theories about how endorphins, increased heart rate, the burning of calories, improved circulation and the sheer act of getting out and wet and cold has kept them healthy. The real good of cold water, however, flows not just through our bones but in our hearts and minds. Purely anecdotally, swimming outdoors in all weathers seems to kick a huge range of mental health issues squarely in the nuts. Solace in grief, the silencing of anxiety, a chink in the fog of depression and a splashing off of loneliness: men and women without number have told me how they have seen a significant and lasting improvement to their emotional and psychological health after taking up cold-water swimming. Perhaps it’s the release of serotonin and dopamine, perhaps bringing your physical body into an extreme state allows your mental discontent to take a temporary back seat, perhaps it’s the therapeutic benefits of swimming beside ducks and under branches. If you can do it regularly enough to become acclimatised, cold water is like the bite of an apple, the clear song of a bird, the shine of silver on your body and lightning through your brain. It silences tension, burns your skin with frozen euphoria and leaves you feeling like a viking, like a wet-haired warrior, like a steam-breathing dragon. Throughout the winter I swim outdoors, in the cold, at least once a week. If you have similar intentions then the best way to start is by simply letting a summer swim habit bleed on into autumn, then the ember months and simply see how long you can go. Neoprene gloves and boots have made all the difference to me, as sluggish circulation often left me fumbling with my knickers using wax-white, useless fingers. A good towel, a thermos and a snack will all help you recover through the chattering and goosepimpled chills afterwards. Also, do it in company – the social element to cold-water swimming is as beneficial as that of your physical or mental health. Even if you can’t find a volunteer to get in with you, make sure you have someone to hold your towel if you’re going in the sea, a river or anywhere else that may prove risky. Finally, cold water, like schnapps, sprinting or a visit to your family, is a treat best appreciated only in short bursts. I keep to a 50-stroke maximum in the winter, often far, far less. This week, as I clocked up three months since giving birth, I found myself crunching through snow on a Yorkshire hillside, beside a friend who pushed out her own baby just seven weeks earlier. There we were, in the bright, biting white of a February morning, surrounded by ice, snow and rocks, stripping down to our underwear as our partners stood on a bridge overhead, holding the babies. As we both slipped under the brown, tumbling, ice melt, pushing our mothering-soft arms and milk-heavy breasts out towards the waterfall, we hollered, sighed and turned our faces to the sky. It felt like living, like healing, like pure joy. In short, it felt pretty damn good for you. • Nell Frizzell is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/09/siamese-nightmare-how-sour-grapes-scuppered-the-pumpkins-reunion","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T13:00:37Z","webTitle":"Siamese nightmare: how sour grapes scuppered the Pumpkins' reunion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/09/siamese-nightmare-how-sour-grapes-scuppered-the-pumpkins-reunion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/09/siamese-nightmare-how-sour-grapes-scuppered-the-pumpkins-reunion","fields":{"headline":"Siamese nightmare: how sour grapes scuppered the Pumpkins' reunion","bodyText":"When the late Mark E Smith declared: “If it’s me and your granny on bongos, it’s the Fall,” he spoke for the vast majority of indie rock’s commanders-in-chief. Does it really matter who’s doling out disco basslines for the Killers or pressing the “sparkly cavern” button somewhere at the back of the Cure? In many cases, the frontman rules, so it’s frontman’s rules. When you are re-forming a classic act in the hope of rekindling your initial hype and magic, though, it matters a hell-ton. Would it be the Smiths without Mike Joyce? Oasis without Bonehead? Rock scientists call this the Kimless Pixies Conundrum. Case in point: Billy Corgan has announced that he will be re-forming the Smashing Pumpkins this summer to tour arenas with an early-albums-only set – but without original bassist D’arcy Wretzky. Will this be the Smashing Pumpkins? Barely. D’arcy wasn’t just the archetypal example of the iconic female bassist that all the best proto-grunge bands had to have in 1989 (see also: Kims Deal and Gordon), but also represents every cult band’s enigmatic lurker; the mysterious fringe presence whom the singer might well see as a dispensable waste of catering, but fans consider the personification of the band’s allure. Virtually mute in interviews during her tenure in the Pumpkins and a reclusive enigma holed up in rural Michigan for the 18 years since she left (discounting five years in Austin and six days in jail), Wretzky has become grunge’s most intriguing blank page: its Lord Lucan or Syd Barrett, a vacant depository for all of the Pumpkins’ vampiric mystique. We knew there was unspoken trauma and turbulence in the Pumpkins’ past, and D’arcy seemed its silent, absent reminder. Our fascination was justified. Last month she gave Alternative Nation her first interview for 20 years, spewing forth about the stress-induced miscarriage, screaming rows with Corgan and 30 panic attacks a day she endured in the Pumpkins, not to mention the OD attempts, rehab and life-threatening illnesses she’s suffered since. Her reason for not joining the tour? Corgan, she alleges, was unable to agree an equal financial split or invite Wretzky to key reunion events, so she refused to “hang from the ceiling in a carrot suit”. Corgan has responded by saying now “isn’t the time” to talk about D’arcy. But by believing a re-formed Pumpkins is little more than the Corgan Show, he has blown any chance of real event status for these shows. Not to suggest that Noel Gallagher is stuck with his scissors player for ever, but without an intriguing, intrinsic outlier such as D’arcy, any band reunion is rendered shallow. Sorry Billy, but when recrafting masterpieces, your granny on bongos just won’t do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"law/2018/mar/06/european-court-rejects-appeal-in-isaiah-haastrup-life-support-case","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T18:27:47Z","webTitle":"European court rejects appeal in Isaiah Haastrup life support case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/mar/06/european-court-rejects-appeal-in-isaiah-haastrup-life-support-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/mar/06/european-court-rejects-appeal-in-isaiah-haastrup-life-support-case","fields":{"headline":"European court rejects appeal in Isaiah Haastrup life support case","bodyText":"An 11th-hour appeal to European court judges by the father of the profoundly brain-damaged baby Isaiah Haastrup to try to prevent doctors from withdrawing his son’s life-sustaining treatment has failed. The European court of human rights ruled inadmissible the appeal to overturn a UK court ruling that the one-year-old could be removed from the ventilator that has kept him alive since birth. Three ECHR judges made the ruling on Tuesday after treating the case as a priority. The court said the decision was final. Isaiah cannot breathe or move independently after “catastrophic” brain injuries caused by oxygen deprivation at birth. He is ventilator-dependent, has a profoundly depressed level of consciousness, is blind, deaf and has dystonia, which may be causing pain, according to medical experts from five hospitals who have examined him. King’s College Hospital NHS foundation trust won a legal fight to remove Isaiah from life support in January. Mr Justice MacDonald, a judge in the family division of the high court, said it was in the infant’s best interests. MacDonald said the parents’ evidence that Isaiah responded to his mother’s voice and touch was influenced by “the flattering voice of hope”. Last week at the court of appeal Isaiah’s father, Lanre Haastrup, 36, who works for a legal firm, argued for life-support to continue so that other treatments including hyperbaric oxygen therapy could be explored. A panel of three judges refused permission to appeal, ruling he had failed to show evidence that alternative treatments could improve his son’s condition. Haastrup made an emergency application to the ECHR last week, which was treated as an urgent matter. On Tuesday the court declared the application inadmissible, “finding that there was not appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the European convention on human rights”.

My own touch diary says that I have touched five people to whom I’m not related in the past seven days. One was a newborn and two were accidental (that was the delivery guy). Touch is the first sense humans develop in the womb, possessed even of 1.5cm embryos. But somewhere in adulthood what was instinctive to us as children has come to feel awkward, out of bounds. In countless ways social touch is being nudged from our lives. In the UK, doctors were warned last month to avoid comforting patients with hugs lest they provoke legal action, and a government report found that foster carers were frightened to hug children in their care for the same reason. In the US the Girl Scouts caused a furore last December when it admonished parents for telling their daughters to hug relatives because “she doesn’t owe anyone a hug”. Teachers hesitate to touch pupils. And in the UK, in a loneliness epidemic, half a million older people go at least five days a week without seeing or touching a soul. Sensing this deficit, a touch industry is burgeoning in Europe, Australia and the US, where professional cuddlers operate workshops, parties and one-to-one sessions to soothe the touch-deprived. At Cuddle Up To Me, a cuddle “retail centre” in Portland, Oregon, clients browse a 72-cuddle menu. Poses includes the Alligator, the Mamma Bear and, less appealingly, the Tarantino. In Japan, a “Tranquility chair” has been developed, its soft arms wrapping the sitter in a floppy embrace. Is this what a crisis of touch looks like? And if so, what do humans risk losing, when we lose touch? “Of course we are moving away from touch!” exclaims Francis McGlone, a professor in neuroscience at Liverpool John Moores university and a leader in the field of affective touch. He is worried. “We have demonised touch to a level at which it sparks off hysterical responses, it sparks off legislative processes, and this lack of touch is not good for mental health.” He has heard of teachers asking children to stick on a plaster themselves, rather than touch them and risk a complaint. “We seem to have been creating a touch-averse world,” he says. “It’s time to recover the social power of touch.” Touch is commonly thought of as a single sense, but it is much more complex than that. Some nerve endings recognise itch, others vibration, pain, pressure and texture. And one exists solely to recognise a gentle stroking touch. Known as c tactile afferents, this last is the one that McGlone has studied for years. To find it, a needle is inserted into the skin to “fish”. “It’s like sitting on the banks of the river,” McGlone says. “One’s a pain fish. One’s an itch fish.” Hours can pass before anyone catches a gentle touch nerve, but this elusive fibre has helped to teach scientists why humans need touch. By watching the nerve’s discharge behaviour while the skin is stroked, scientists have learned that the optimum speed of a human caress is 3cm to 5cm a second. This may sound like a diverting snippet of touch trivia, but its application is far-reaching. When a parent strokes a child, for instance, “they are writing out the script that was laid down by 30 million years of evolution,” McGlone says. “We are destined to cuddle and stroke each other at predetermined velocities.” The pleasantness encourages us to keep touching, nourishes babies and binds adults, and threads wellbeing into the fabric of our being. It could also teach us more about the touch-averse, including how and when autism and eating disorders develop, and even lead us to a cure for loneliness. Last year, researchers from University College London showed that slow, gentle stroking by a stranger reduced feelings of social exclusion. “Bang on!” McGlone says. “This nerve fibre is responsible for so many aspects of our wellbeing across our lifespan. I call it the Higgs boson of the social brain. The missing particle that glues everything social together.” Ironically, having been brought up in the 50s, when parental affection was thought to encourage mawkish children, he is himself sensitive to touch, and feels a gentle stroke “like an electric shock”. As a society, we instinctively understand the power of touch. That is why, after the tragic shooting at his school, the head of Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Florida promised “to hug each and every one” of his 3,300 students. A single, small touch can change countless lives. Princess Diana knew this when she held the hand of an Aids patient in 1987. So did Barack Obama when he stooped to let a young black boy pat his hair, so that he could feel his own potential in the palm of his hand. Tiffany Field founded the Touch Research Institute at Miami Medical School to study this neglected sense and its impact on health. She enjoys a weekly massage and happily lists the positive effects of being touched. “We know from the science of what goes on under the skin that when the skin is moved, pressure receptors are stimulated,” she says. This “slows down heart rate, blood pressure and the release of cortisol”, which gives people better control over their stress hormones. Being touched increases the number of natural killer cells, “the frontline of the immune system. Serotonin increases. That’s the body’s natural antidepressant. It enables deeper sleep,” Field says. Her appraisal is borne out by the experience of Kira “Cuddles” from Cuddle Up To Me in Portland, who has to remind her clients to check for phone, keys, wallet. “They leave with a dose of oxytocin. They are floating on a cloud.” Most basically of all, touch tells us who we are. That is why in the womb, McGlone says, “with the amniotic fluid washing over it, the brain inside begins to realise, ‘I’ve got my body, and that’s somebody else’s.’ That developing brain has that sense of me rather than something else out there. If that doesn’t happen, you get this almost locked-in syndrome.” Mary Carlson is 78. She worked as a student assistant with the legendary scientist Harry Harlow, whose experiments with monkeys found that the hankering for touch is so innate that an infant, removed from its mother, would cling to a cloth-covered wire surrogate rather than a cold wire one with milk. It would choose to feel nourished rather than be nourished. Carlson met Harlow as a freshman. At the first lecture she attended, “he came out hooting and running around on all fours”. In his laboratory, she witnessed monkeys that as infants had been deprived of their mother’s touch. In social groups, they would “go off in a corner, self-grasping, staring into space.” She saw similar patterns of behaviour in humans three decades later when she visited orphanages in Romania, a legacy of Ceausescu’s regime, where tens of thousands of infants were raised with minimal human touch. For Carlson, touch is “a sort of species recognition”. Which suggests that without touch, humans may be, well, less human. “You just don’t see people touching each other these days,” Field complains. She has just come from a restaurant. “And everybody was on their cellphones.” At LaGuardia airport recently, she walked around the waiting area. “Not a soul was touching another. Even two-year-olds were sitting in carriages with iPads on their laps.” (Getting touch from their touch screens.) Then, at the Coconut Grove art festival, “There were people bumping into each other because it was so packed. I heard people say, ‘I’m sorry! Excuse me!’ and move off in a way that made it look like they were really embarrassed.” Field is planning studies in restaurants and airports “to document how little touch there is and how much distraction by social media”. There is as yet no scientific data to connect declining touch to the rise of mobile technology or social media, but Field’s descriptions of people wrapped in their own worlds rather than each other, sitting in isolation, bowed over screens, a huddle unto themselves, are evocative and familiar. Do those atomised people who bounce off each other at art fairs before spinning away in shame, or those who sit day after day alone in their homes carry shades of Harlow’s monkeys self-soothing in the corner of their cages? And if so, where will our loss of touch lead us? Kellie Payne, research and policy manager at the Campaign to End Loneliness, says that loneliness is fatal precisely because it puts people “into a kind of defensive state where the levels of cortisol are raised. Having had negative experiences, they anticipate that their connection with people will also be negative,” which makes it hard to reinstate contact. To add to the challenge for the elderly, touch sensation is in decline. According to David J Linden, author of Touch: The Science of Hand, Heart and Mind, “Humans have their strongest touch sensation at around 20, after which it goes down by a percent a year for your whole life”. Field, meanwhile, is worried about the rise in paediatric pain syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia, previously common only in adults. She thinks this is due to stress and the absence of touch, and is also worried that “kids are getting more and more aggressive because there is less and less touch”. “This is what I’m concerned about,” McGlone says. “If this evolutionary system is in any way disturbed or interrupted, brains are good at finding compensation. It could be drugs or alcohol ... If you remove a reward system, the brain will try to find some other way to get that reward.” Humans love touch. We love it so much that the word has the power to sell a heap of products from soft-touch pillows to velvet touch tights, expert touch saucepans and even smooth, perfecting touch face creams. But touching each other in an age of pervasive and historical sexual abuse and harassment no longer feels safe. There is a hypervigilance of boundaries that makes it hard to find the right approach. “I think twice about hugging a colleague at work in a way that I didn’t a couple of years ago,” Linden says. “I’m thinking, maybe this is going to be misinterpreted. Maybe this is going to make somebody feel bad.” Touch – even the gentlest kind processed by McGlone’s beloved c tactile afferents – is never only about affection, warmth and care, but also about power. (Just watch Donald Trump greet world leaders.) The so-called “Midas touch” studies which have shown that diners gently touched on the arm by their server will leave a generous tip, or that people in a care home eat more if touched, illustrate the power of touch to persuade. Touch can retract – as well as confer – agency. It is not a universal good. It can exacerbate the symptoms of those with autism, and those who have experienced trauma or abuse. At her home in north London, I meet Anna Fortes Mayer, who has run Cuddle Workshop since 2010. We sit on her red sofa and talk about how to broach touch. She is not tactile, but then we are strangers and her sofa is large. I tell her about my touch diary: by now my yoga teacher has patted me and I’ve collected a matchday hug from my daughter’s football coach. “It’s not much. It’s really not,” Fortes Mayer says, shaking her head. But what’s a person to do? How can we build more touch into our lives? For a start, Fortes Mayer advises against “energetically leaning forward for a hug”. She dislikes the phrases “Do you want a hug?”, “Give us a hug” and “Can I have a hug?”; they are “all too, ‘Who takes ownership here?’” (This is the mistake Kesha made with Jerry Seinfeld.) She suggests instead, “Would you like to share a hug?” Encouraging self-consciousness of the ways in which people offer and invite touch has many benefits. But this kind of touch can never be impulsive, immediate, if it comes with explanatory notes. And touch that breaks protocol can feel more affecting. Consider the excitement when Meghan Markle preferred a hug to a handshake, or Michelle Obama slipped an arm around the Queen’s back. Even McGlone, despite that 1950s upbringing, on a walk through the park, was tickled to see a “big rugby player type bloke” offer his wife and then him a hug. (He was so touched, he started to explain about c tactile afferents.) In Fortes Mayer’s hall, I put my shoes back on and with my hands at my sides ask, “Anna, would you like to share a hug?” She says yes – and it feels good. “I will often place my hand on someone’s shoulder,” Carlson says. “I believe in touch. There are ways you can do it so it isn’t demeaning.” “Even stranger touch, when it’s wanted, is pretty good,” Linden points out. “Even petting your dog. Even petting a dog that’s not yours.” For the truly solitary, daily power walking stimulates pressure points. It’s what Tiffany Field does. She also advocates yoga: “It’s moving your limbs against each other.” Of course, nobody thinks that a cure for loneliness will happen at a stroke, but maybe careful touch could bring it closer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/06/britain-putin-russia-sergei-skripal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T19:00:07Z","webTitle":"Britain would not win a spy showdown with Putin | Richard Norton-Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/britain-putin-russia-sergei-skripal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/britain-putin-russia-sergei-skripal","fields":{"headline":"Britain would not win a spy showdown with Putin","bodyText":"Let’s say hard evidence emerges that Russia was in fact responsible for the suspected attack on Sergei Skripal, the former Russian military intelligence officer who spied for MI6, and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. Comparisons have inevitably been drawn with Alexander Litvinenko, the Russian dissident and former intelligence officer poisoned by a dose of radioactive polonium-210 in London – an operation British intelligence quickly became convinced had been planned in the Kremlin. In 2010, Skripal was swapped in an exchange for 10 Russian spies being held in the US. But Russian intelligence officers can be unforgiving. And if they were responsible for the attack on Skripal, they could well have had a nod and a wink from Putin himself. A public inquiry into Litvinenko’s murder concluded in 2016, a full 10 years after the event, that there was a “strong probability” that the Russian security service the FSB was responsible for Litvinenko’s fatal poisoning, and that Putin “probably” approved it. The Russian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office, and the assets of the two main suspects, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, were frozen. Litvinenko’s widow, Marina, chided the British government for not doing more. What could the British government do now if there was evidence that Moscow was involved in the attack on Skripal, short of indulging in hand-wringing rhetoric? Economic sanctions have already been imposed in response to Putin’s military incursions into Ukraine. A number of Russian individuals and Putin’s cronies may have been hit by them, but Putin has not been. Perhaps the government could break off diplomatic relations, indulge in a tit-for-tat expulsion of spies. But this would risk playing into Putin’s hands. He has cultivated the Russian view that the west has sought to humiliate Russia ever since the fall of the Soviet Union. It is not surprising that he revels in trying to humiliate the west in return. And for Putin, a Britain – preoccupied and divided by Brexit, with its diplomatic, economic, and military clout eroding – is a prime target. This does not mean that he was involved in any way with the awful attack on Skripal; just that if there was any suggestion that he was, he would ignore any British protests, even mock them – especially now, as he looks forward to being re-elected Russian president later this month. British army chiefs, enthusiastically cheered on by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, have been upping the ante, warning of the growing threat Russia poses. Russia could cause “thousands and thousands and thousands” of deaths in Britain by crippling the country’s infrastructure and energy supply, Williamson told the Telegraph in January. Moscow quickly dismissed the warnings as “something out of Monty Python”. Shortly before, Stuart Peach, chief of the defence staff, warned that there was a growing risk of a Russian attack on undersea communications cables, posing a potentially “catastrophic threat” to the internet and international trade. This all sounds like a crude pitch for more money for the defence budget. Both John Sawers, head of MI6 until 2014, and Robert Hannigan, former director of GCHQ, pointedly declined to comment on Williamson’s warnings when invited to, when they gave evidence to parliament’s national security strategy committee in January. Sawers also revealed that when he was head of MI6 he was banned by ministers from talking to his “Russian counterparts”. Engaging with the Russians was not being nice with them, he said, but being tough. Adam Thomson, a former permanent representative to Nato, told the committee that he was concerned about all the rhetoric aimed at Moscow. “We need to engage with Russia,” he said. Mark Sedwill, the government’s national security adviser, in a little-noticed address last summer, urged his audience of senior army officers to see things from Moscow’s perspective. When the west talks about containing Russia, the Russians see it as “encirclement”, he said. These interventions by senior security figures are telling. They reflect the frustration about the inability of the west – Britain in particular – to influence the Kremlin. Would engaging with Putin stop any future attempt to kill former Russian spies in Britain? Perhaps not. But the British government should calm down and encourage British intelligence officers to start engaging with their Russian opposite numbers. After all, such official meetings took place throughout the cold war. It could make Putin’s Moscow and its professional spies take Britain more seriously. • Richard Norton-Taylor writes for the Guardian on defence and security • This article was amended on 7 March 2018.

The chancellor is expected to use a speech in the City to challenge the idea – voiced strongly by France’s finance minister on Tuesday – that financial services have never been included in trade deals because of their complexity and the risks to stability. Hammond will argue that every trade deal the EU has concluded in the past has been unique and that is “time to address the sceptics who say a trade deal including financial services cannot be done because it has never been done before”. The chancellor, who is being strongly lobbied by the City to secure access to the EU after Brexit, will say that bespoke agreements have already been agreed between Brussels and Turkey, Canada, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland. Speaking in London on Tuesday, Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, ruled out financial services being part of a trade deal. “The rules will change. We don’t believe that financial services can be part of an FTA,” Le Maire said. “Because financial services are not goods. They cannot be traded and supervised in the same way.” The French finance minister, who met Hammond for talks on Tuesday, said UK financial firms would have to make do with the same arrangement for access to the EU – known as equivalence – used by American and Japanese firms. But the chancellor will say: “I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so. “A trade deal between the UK and the EU must start from the reality of today: that our economies, including in financial services, are interconnected; that our regulatory frameworks are identical.” The chancellor is expected to challenge Le Maire’s opposition to financial services being included in a free trade agreement by noting that the EU itself wanted financial services cooperation to be included in its controversial Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the US. Hammond will add that both with TTIP and the agreement finally struck with Canada, the EU sought to promote convergence between separate markets with low levels of interconnectedness, and that it was possible for the EU and the UK to do better. “Our markets are already deeply interconnected; and we have demonstrated how we can work together over the past decade as we have repaired and defended the financial stability of our continent. “If it could be done with Canada or the USA it could be done with the UK – the EU’s closest financial services partner by far.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/09/brian-ferneyhough-la-terre-est-un-homme-plotzlichkeit-review-bbcso","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T09:55:50Z","webTitle":"Ferneyhough: La Terre Est Un Homme/Plötzlichkeit review – massive and mesmerising","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/09/brian-ferneyhough-la-terre-est-un-homme-plotzlichkeit-review-bbcso","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/09/brian-ferneyhough-la-terre-est-un-homme-plotzlichkeit-review-bbcso","fields":{"headline":"Ferneyhough: La Terre Est Un Homme / Plötzlichkeit review – massive and mesmerising","bodyText":"While not quite a musical scandal on the level of the premiere of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, the first performance of Brian Ferneyhough’s La Terre Est Un Homme in Glasgow in 1979 is remembered as a disaster; sabotaged, so the story goes, by the orchestra’s hostility to a score of such challenging density. The London premiere a few weeks later, conducted by no less than Claudio Abbado in his inaugural concert as principal conductor of the LSO, seems to have been only a marginal improvement, and together they confirmed Ferneyhough’s reputation for producing music of unrealisable and incomprehensible complexity. In the UK at least, he’s remained a remote and often misunderstood figure, but the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s revival of La Terre Est Un Homme in 2011 went a long way to redressing the balance. A recording of that outstanding performance, conducted with astonishing lucidity by Martyn Brabbins, dominates this NMC disc, confirming La Terre as one of the most remarkable orchestral achievements of the last half-century. Ferneyhough borrowed his title from a 1942 painting by the Chilean surrealist Roberto Matta, a desert landscape that reminded the composer of a recent dream, and an image of “leaden, slowly moving sand and sudden flashes of intensely coloured movement”. The impression left by this teeming, heaving 13-minute score, in which each instrument of the 88-piece orchestra sometimes has its own immensely intricate solo line, is that of a musical explosion slowed down and heard in minute detail. The effect is massive and mesmerisingly overwhelming, punctuated by rare moments of piercing clarity, when the music thins to a single line, or a becalmed, beautifully chilly chord. The disc also includes the only other piece for full orchestra that Ferneyhough has composed since La Terre, Plötzlichkeit (“Suddenness” or “Unexpectedness”) from 2012. Like several of his other recent works, it’s made up of contrasting musical fragments of varying length, which sometimes coalesce into more conventionally rhetorical ideas, and also thread a trio of wordless female voices through the instrumental textures. That use of self-contained fragments is easier to hear in the ensemble piece from the same year, Liber Scintillarum, written for Ensemble Recherche, which begins at maximum density and gradually thins out over its 20-minute course, becoming increasingly punctuated by silences and by the ghosts of recognisable music shapes. With Exaudi’s exemplary performance of the early Missa Brevis included, too, it all adds up to an exceptionally rewarding collection."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/07/poisoning-of-skripal-a-kremlin-warning-to-western-spy-agencies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"Suspected Skripal poisoning: who might have ordered it and why?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/poisoning-of-skripal-a-kremlin-warning-to-western-spy-agencies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/07/poisoning-of-skripal-a-kremlin-warning-to-western-spy-agencies","fields":{"headline":"Suspected Skripal poisoning: who might have ordered it and why?","bodyText":"The biggest question about Sergei Skripal’s suspected poisoning is the timing. Skripal had spent several years in a Russian jail after being convicted of espionage and had presumably been thoroughly debriefed by his former spy bosses. If the Russian security services had wanted him to have an “accident” during those years it would have been very easy to organise. Sunday’s assassination attempt in Salisbury, if that is what it was, therefore appears to have a demonstrative nature. Suggestions that this could be some kind of vote-winning ploy, coming two weeks before presidential elections Vladimir Putin is certain to win, seem unconvincing. Many Russians are patriotic and have bought into the Kremlin’s aggressive new foreign policy, but it is unlikely that the assassination of a former spy of whom few had heard would do much to whip up popular passions. More likely, the move is a deterrent, aimed at reminding other Russian operatives of the potential risks of working with foreign intelligence agencies. Every year Russia’s top security officials speak of active attempts by the CIA and other western agencies to recruit Russians. Part of this is propaganda for domestic consumption, but there is no doubt that western spy agencies are active in Russia. Last January, two of Russia’s top cybersecurity officials were arrested and accused of aiding the CIA, in a case some have linked to US election hacking claims. The British, too, have been active in Russia, most memorably revealed by the “spy rock” scandal, in which a fake rock was used to pass messages back to British intelligence. While there are fewer ideological reasons than during the Soviet period for Russian spies to become traitors, western agencies can provide financial incentives. Russian prosecutors suggested, during Skripal’s court case, that he was recruited with cash – according to Russian media. Many agents, working in structures in which their superiors are demonstratively corrupt, might be tempted into colluding with friendly foreigners offering cash for secrets. As such, the demonstrative killing of a traitor could be a warning to junior officers not to follow the same path. Russian officials have often made it clear that traitors will meet a sticky end one way or another. Public threats were made against the officer in the SVR foreign intelligence service who betrayed the Russian sleeper agents swapped for Skripal and others, back in 2010. “We know who he is and where he is,” a high-ranking Kremlin source told Kommersant newspaper at the time. “You can have no doubt – a Mercader has already been sent after him.” Ramón Mercader was the assassin tasked by the KBG to kill Leon Trotsky in Mexico in 1940. It is unusual, however, to target spies after they have been swapped. One possible reason is that Skripal was being punished for a continuing relationship with British intelligence, or the suspicion of one. “My presumption is that if the Russians were behind this, and it does look plausible, then it is because they assumed Skripal was still working for British or other western intelligence and not simply retired,” said Mark Galeotti, a Russia watcher and security analyst. “That is likely what tipped the balance with Litvinenko.” Many hits on Russians abroad arise from financial warfare and do not necessarily come from the Kremlin – such as the shooting of the banker German Gorbuntsov in London, 2012, and the assassination of the Russian MP Denis Voronenkov in Kiev last year. Yet the attack on Skripal looks more likely to belong to the category of hits organised and approved by the Russian state. And given the long political fallout of the Alexander Litvinenko murder, it is unlikely that intelligence agencies would risk such a gambit without a signoff at the highest level."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/06/counter-terrorism-take-on-russian-spy-sergei-skripal-poison-case","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T19:41:59Z","webTitle":"Counter-terrorism police take over Sergei Skripal 'poison' case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/06/counter-terrorism-take-on-russian-spy-sergei-skripal-poison-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/06/counter-terrorism-take-on-russian-spy-sergei-skripal-poison-case","fields":{"headline":"Counter-terrorism police take over Sergei Skripal 'poison' case","bodyText":"The investigation into the possible poisoning of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal gained new momentum on Tuesday, as Scotland Yard announced its counter-terrorism police would take charge, and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, promised a “robust” response if the Kremlin’s role in the case was proved. Skripal was found slumped unconscious on a bench in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. The woman discovered next to him has been identified as Skripal’s 33-year-old daughter, Yulia. Both remain critically ill and in intensive care after exposure to an “unknown substance”. The Metropolitan police said that due to the “unusual circumstances” its counter-terrorism unit would now be heading the investigation. The police presence in Salisbury was stepped up on Tuesday, as specialist officers appeared around a police cordon. Sources close to British intelligence said toxicology tests would be key in the days ahead. They cautioned that other factors or triggers may have been involved. Samples from the scene are being tested at the military research laboratory at Porton Down. Experts have yet to identify the substance. Witnesses said that Yulia Skripal had “passed out”, adding that her father was “looking at the sky”. “They didn’t seem with it,” said Freya Church. “To be honest, I thought they were just drugged out as they were in a weird state. They were out of it.” Detectives were closely scrutinising CCTV footage. It shows a man and woman – possibly Skripal and his daughter – shortly before 4pm walking together normally past a fitness centre. Soon afterwards both collapsed. The restaurant Zizzi in the city centre and a nearby pub, the Mill, remain closed as a precaution, police said. Firefighters spent around an hour on Tuesday at South Western Ambulance’s base at Amesbury. It is understood the incident is connected to events in Salisbury. A worker at the Mill said Skripal and his daughter came into the pub on Sunday afternoon, enjoyed a drink and a laugh and left together. “All seemed completely normal,” he said. The case invites comparison with the 2006 murder of the former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko. A public inquiry later ruled this was a state plot, “probably approved” by Vladimir Putin, and carried out on the streets of London by the president’s FSB spy agency. The foreign secretary ignited a political row with Moscow by warning that if suspicions about Kremlin involvement were again confirmed England might pull out of this summer’s World Cup, to be hosted by Russia. “I think it will be very difficult to imagine that UK representation at that event could go ahead in the normal way,” he told MPs. He added: “We don’t know exactly what has taken place in Salisbury, but if it’s as bad as it looks, it is another crime in the litany of crimes that we can lay at Russia’s door. It is clear that Russia, I’m afraid, is now in many respects a malign and disruptive force.” Foreign office aides swiftly clarified that Johnson meant government officials, rather than England players. Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed his comments as “wild” and accused the UK of hysteria and unwarranted “Russophobia”. The embassy in London said “there was no truth” in the suggestion its special services were connected. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, is due to chair a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee on Wednesday morning in response to the incident. If a toxin or nerve agent is confirmed then the government will face a major international crisis and – inevitably – an acrimonious war of words with Russia. Theresa May was briefed about the incident in Salisbury during a meeting on Tuesday of the national security council, her spokesman said. Skripal was a military intelligence officer, who was “swapped” in 2010 for Russian spies caught in the US. Russian websites, citing details from his trial, said MI6 recruited him in 1995. He was approached during business trips to Malta and Spain. He eventually divulged the names of dozens of Russian intelligence assets to his British handlers, they said. Skripal had been living quietly in a semi-detached house in Salisbury. His wife, Liudmila, died of cancer in 2012. Neighbours described him as friendly, sociable and living in full view. He shopped locally, drank in the Railway social club and gambled. Skripal sometimes admitted he had been a colonel in Russian intelligence, but told others he was a retired former planning officer. The incident on Sunday triggered a full emergency response. Skripal was taken to hospital by ambulance, while his daughter was flown there by helicopter. According to her Facebook page, she moved to the UK in 2010 with her parents, working for a time at the Holiday Inn in Southampton. Skripal’s 43-year-old son appears to have died recently during a visit to St Petersburg. The biggest question about Skripal’s mysterious poisoning is the timing. Skripal had spent several years in a Russian jail and had presumably been thoroughly debriefed. If the Russian security services had wanted him to have an “accident” during those years, it would have been very easy to organise. On Monday Putin gave a speech to his old FSB service, congratulating officers on their success in detecting foreign espionage plots. He will be reelected as president later this month. Whether or not the Kremlin’s fingerprints are found, the Skripal case is likely to be seen as a warning to Russian operatives of the dangers of working with MI6 or the CIA. Shoppers returned to the centre of Salisbury on Tuesday. Public Health England said there didn’t appear to be any immediate risk to public health. One member of the emergency services remained in hospital, Wiltshire police said, with several others treated on Sunday now discharged. The US State Department declined to comment on the case, referring the matter back to its counterparts in the UK. Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Litvinenko, said no conclusions should be made until “the facts and evidence” are available. “I didn’t know Sergei but it looks very much a spy story,” she told the Guardian. “He has never been involved in any political activity, never criticised Putin.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/06/manchester-city-barcelona-pep-guardiola-champions-league-basel","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T17:07:03Z","webTitle":"Manchester City are not at Barcelona’s level yet, says Pep Guardiola","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/06/manchester-city-barcelona-pep-guardiola-champions-league-basel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/06/manchester-city-barcelona-pep-guardiola-champions-league-basel","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City are not at Barcelona’s level yet, says Pep Guardiola","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City are inferior to Barcelona, saying his team have to dominate for at least a decade to be considered at their level. City host Basel in Wednesday’s Champions League last-16 second leg holding a 4-0 advantage. Yet despite being virtually through to the quarter-finals and impressing throughout the competition Guardiola is adamant they remain below the quality of Barça, five-times winners of the competition. “They have won a lot in the past. We are new – we’ve won one title [the League Cup] but it is not a [fair] comparison,” Guardiola said. “It is not good for us comparing [ourselves] with that Barcelona team. That team dominated the last decade, 15 to 20 years with different managers, different players. We have just won the first title. To join this kind of team you have to be there a long time.” On Tuesday Mike Riley, the head of Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, met Txiki Begiristain, City’s sporting director, regarding Guardiola’s concerns about some of the tackles on his players this season. Yet the manager also warned his team they cannot afford the kind of tackle that caused Fabian Delph’s sending off in the FA Cup defeat at Wigan or Oleksandr Zinchenko’s on Victor Moses in Sunday’s win over Chelsea, which drew a yellow card. “At Wigan one action, the red card. Zinchenko on Moses, it’s orange – could be yellow, could be red. If it is red, you are out of the Champions League,” Guardiola said, before pointing to the value of European pedigree. “Real Madrid [12-times winners] before the first game against PSG it is: ‘Oh Madrid is not good, not playing well.’ They win 3-1,” he said. “It is different competitions. We have a big chance to be in the quarter-final for second time in our history. “We are almost in the quarter-finals, we are almost champions of the Premier League. We are not in the quarter-finals, we are not champions. That is why we have to be calm. That is the best advice I can give to my players.” Despite having highlighted the problem of bad tackles Guardiola did not meet Riley. “The press officer informed me 15 minutes ago Mike Riley was here,” he said. “I didn’t know it. I don’t know which issues they talked about. When I spoke about the tackles it is not about Manchester City players, it is about football. I accept the physicality in England.” Guardiola also said Martin Glenn did not understand what the yellow ribbon he wears represents when the Football Association chief executive compared it with the swastika and Robert Mugabe. Glenn has since apologised and Guardiola said: “My first impression when I heard that was he didn’t understand exactly what the yellow ribbon means. He made a comment that was far away from what it means. Maybe now he will realise. It’s not about independence or no independence. “It’s about four people who are in jail [in Catalonia] when they didn’t do absolutely anything to be in jail for. I think with his comments he didn’t understand the reality of what happened right now with the situation but I’m pretty sure now he will know it.” Having accepted an FA charge of “wearing a political message”, Guardiola will stop wearing the ribbon. “At the end there are rules, they [FA] have them and they apply them, I accept the decision because I have to. I accept them but it doesn’t mean I agree with the decision. But I am here, I am working here and there are rules and I accept them.” Raheem Sterling may be in contention to play against Basel following a hamstring problem but Fernandinho has not recovered from the same injury. “Maybe Basel, maybe Stoke [on Monday] for Raheem,” Guardiola said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/07/ad-watchdog-cracks-down-ticket-resale-websites","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T00:01:17Z","webTitle":"Advertising watchdog cracks down on ticket resale websites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/07/ad-watchdog-cracks-down-ticket-resale-websites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/07/ad-watchdog-cracks-down-ticket-resale-websites","fields":{"headline":"Advertising watchdog cracks down on ticket resale websites","bodyText":"The Advertising Standards Authority has taken action against four large secondary ticketing sites over the misleading presentation of pricing information on their websites. After sector-wide investigations, the ASA found that StubHub UK, Viagogo, Seatwave and GetMeIn! were not clear with consumers about additional ticket fees and charges added at the end of the booking process. The ASA has instructed these organisations to improve transparency over pricing, making clear the total ticket cost from the outset of the customer’s engagement with the site, including the booking fee (inclusive of VAT), applicable delivery fee and non-optional taxes. A StubHub spokesperson welcomed the move and said the company would comply with the ASA’s decision. Ticketmaster, which owns GetMeIn!, also supported the ruling and affirmed their existing commitment to transparency. It said: “Our ticket resale sites already ensure fans know exactly what they will pay at every stage of the buying process, displaying all fees as soon as the customer selects and submits the number of tickets they are looking to buy.” Viagogo has been banned from using the slogan “official site” as it misled customers into believing that it was a primary ticketing outlet rather than a secondary resale site. The ASA has also banned Viagogo from claiming that consumers had a “100% guarantee” of entry into the relevant venue when there is a reasonable risk that they would be denied entry. One advertisement investigated suggested that consumers who bought Viagogo tickets would be guaranteed entry to an Ed Sheeran concert when this was not the case. A spokesperson for FanFair Alliance, the leading campaign group on secondary ticketing, said: “While we welcome today’s ASA ruling and hope it goes some way to addressing this latter issue, what’s absolutely crucial now is enforcement. Without proper sanctions, we fear that much-needed reforms will not be implemented, particularly by Viagogo, and the public will continue to be duped.” The ASA’s clampdown follows recent government legislation that will force secondary ticketing sites to provide purchasers with detailed information about the location of seats, disclosure of any restrictions and the original price of the ticket, to provide greater clarity for consumers and helping ensure they are paying a fair price. The ASA’s chief executive, Guy Parker, said: “Many of us will recognise the frustration of being happy with the initial price of tickets on a secondary website only to be stung by hefty fees when we come to book. The message from our rulings is simple and it’s clear: the price you see at the start should be the price you pay at the end.” In November 2017 Competition and Markets Authority officials raided the offices of StubHub and Viagogo to seize data relating to schemes that allegedly benefit industrial-scale touts. It was also announced that secondary ticketing firms could be fined or taken to court after a year-long investigation by the UK competition regulator uncovered “widespread concerns” about breaches of consumer law. Google has also imposed tough restrictions on ticket resellers, barring them from claiming to be an “official” source of tickets in Google results when they are in fact selling them secondhand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/13/puttanesca-sauce-recipe-rachel-roddy","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T12:00:40Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s classic Neapolitan puttanesca sauce recipe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/13/puttanesca-sauce-recipe-rachel-roddy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/13/puttanesca-sauce-recipe-rachel-roddy","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s classic Neapolitan puttanesca sauce recipe","bodyText":"There are various stories about the origins of spaghetti alla puttanesca; various translations, too: whore’s spaghetti, tart’s spaghetti; I have even heard it called lady-of-the-night spaghetti. As much as I like Neapolitan tales of seductively coloured clothes, satisfied customers and meals cooked between clients, the story that always comes into my mind is the hungry group rolling up to a trattoria late and demanding the owner “faccia una puttanata qualsiasi”. Now, in this context, puttanata translates as “a rubbish thing”, so you could translate this – clumsily maybe – as “make me whatever rubbish you have”. Now this is Naples and, as we all know, no one ever eats rubbish in Naples – especially in the stories recounted by English food writers in Rome. The puttanesca rumbled up in that kitchen was a thing of sapid beauty, a tangle of spaghetti with a deeply flavoured sauce of tomato, garlic, chilli and the inimitable three: anchovy, capers, olives. Such a thing of beauty that it became a much-requested dish known as puttanesca. What makes it even more appealing is the notion that the very nature of puttanesca is anarchic; how else could it be when balancing such strong and divisive flavours as salty, briny, sweet and umami, when you are using what you have? We have dealt with a recent move – across a courtyard and up a flight of stairs – by not being very balanced and ferrying rapidly cooling boxes of pizza across an uncharacteristically cold, and lately snowy, piazza. The great extent of my home cooking has been things rumbled out of the cupboard, at least one panful of which wasn’t nice at all (although I always have Laurie Colwin in mind with this sort of thing: “We learn by doing. If you never stuff a chicken with paté [or in my case put tinned peas and ancient, dusty oregano in your puttanesca] you will never know it is an unwise thing to do.” For the the most part, though, when you put together pasta with tomato, garlic, chilli, anchovy, capers and olives, in proportions you like, the result is reliably tasty and satisfying. My start is pretty much always the same: while the pasta water comes to the boil, I warm six to eight tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan with two cloves of garlic – peeled and crushed for a gentle flavour; peeled and finely chopped for a more persistent one – making sure the garlic very gently sizzles rather than fries, and never burns (garlic is a bitter bully when it burns). To this I add a couple of anchovy fillets and nudge them around the pan until they disintegrate, a pinch of red chilli flakes, and tomato – either a small tin or a few fresh ones peeled and chopped – then raise the heat a bit and let everything bubble in a lively way for about 10 minutes. Put the pasta in the water. At this point, the sauce is perfectly good and ready, or it can be enriched, depending on what you have or fancy: a pinch or fistful of rinsed capers or black olives, a tin of drained tuna or a handful of dried mushrooms that have been soaked back to life (not traditional). Once tarted up, the sauce can bubble away until the pasta is ready to be drained and tossed with its partner. I pretty much always finish with a handful of finely chopped parsley. But, as is so often the case with this column, the above is simply a template, a springboard for you to make your own puttanata qualsiasi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/meera-sodhas-vegan-recipe-for-peanut-and-broccoli-pad-thai","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T09:30:09Z","webTitle":"Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for peanut and broccoli pad thai","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/meera-sodhas-vegan-recipe-for-peanut-and-broccoli-pad-thai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/meera-sodhas-vegan-recipe-for-peanut-and-broccoli-pad-thai","fields":{"headline":"Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for peanut and broccoli pad thai","bodyText":"In the late 1930s, Thailand’s prime minister held a public competition to find a new national noodle dish. The winning entry was a dish that combined rice noodles, vegetables, peanuts, shrimp and egg, and it was named “pad Thai” in a bid to promote Thai-ness. This vegan interpretation of that classic dish celebrates the brilliance of the original, while also bringing in something new in the form of purple sprouting broccoli. I’m not sure the former Thai PM would approve, but I hope you do. Peanut butter and purple sprouting broccoli pad thai Pad thai is best eaten with as many garnishes as possible, so feel free to customise yours with shop-bought fried shallots, pickled Thai radishes, beansprouts and crushed roasted peanuts as you wish. Buy sprouting broccoli with thin, tender stalks, rather than fat, woody ones. Rice noodles are fragile, so be gentle with them. Prep 10 min Cook 20 min Serves 4 For the pad thai sauce 6 tbsp crunchy peanut butter 2 tbsp tamarind paste 3 tbsp brown rice syrup (or 2½ tbsp agave syrup) 4 tbsp soy sauce 3 tbsp fresh lime juice (from 2 limes) For the tofu and broccoli 450g purple sprouting broccoli 3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1.5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 2 birds’ eye chillies, finely chopped 225g firm tofu, drained and cut into 1.5cm x 1.5cm cubes 250g flat folded rice noodles Rapeseed oil, for frying 6 spring onions, finely chopped 1 handful sesame seeds, for decoration Toasted sesame oil, for drizzling 1 small handful Thai basil leaves, shredded 1 small handful mint leaves, shredded 1 lime, cut into 4 wedges First, make the sauce by putting the peanut butter, tamarind paste and syrup in a bowl, then slowly mixing in the soy, lime juice and four tablespoons of water. Top and tail the broccoli, and put the florets in a bowl. Chop the stalks and leaves into 1cm pieces. Put the garlic, ginger, chilli and tofu in little piles within easy reach of the hob. Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, rinse under cold water, drain, then drizzle with a tablespoon of rapeseed oil and toss gently: use your hands, because a utensil will cut the noodles. In a large nonstick frying pan for which you have a lid, heat two tablespoons of rapeseed oil on a medium to high flame, then fry the tofu for five minutes, turning every minute, until it’s pale gold. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli, cook for two minutes, then add the broccoli stalks and four tablespoons of water, cover the pan and leave to steam for two minutes, until the broccoli is tender. Add the broccoli heads, sauce and spring onions (reserve a handful for garnish), stir to combine, then cover again and leave for two minutes. Turn down the heat to a whisper, add the noodles handful by handful, gently mixing them in, until coated in sauce, then turn off the heat. Distribute the noodles between four plates and sprinkle over the sesame seeds and reserved spring onions. Drizzle each portion with toasted sesame oil, scatter over the herbs and a generous squeeze of lime, and serve immediately.

And with nary a reference to Guinness, shamrocks or any other accoutrements of tourism, this enterprising, imaginative multi-artist presentation, promoted by Culture Ireland, reflected a modern, multifaceted view of Irish experience far from stereotypes. “A photograph of some of the noises coming out of Ireland right now,” was how the bill-topper Paul Noonan (of Bell X1) expressed it as the show meandered through jazz, classical, gospel, rap and other areas seldom associated with Celtic culture. There was no grandstanding, no big statements of intent or political speeches (apart from a brief feminist shout-out from Lisa Hannigan as she fronted an eight-piece all female band); just a disparate selection of musicians almost seamlessly mixing and matchingcontrasting styles and influences. A versatile house band, the Crash Ensemble String Quartet, provided consistently unexpected counterpoints along the way. In low-key early stages, Maria Kelly brought sweetness and Seamus Fogarty light. But you yearned for the dynamism of a Radie Peat, Lisa O’Neill or Rioghnach Connolly to get the senses pulsing. Happily, the arrival of Irish-Sierra Leone singer Loah, delivering moody soul and atmospheric rhythms in the ancient language of Sherbro, did exactly that. Suddenly, the slightly surreal Gregory Dunn big-screen photographic images depicting unusual vignettes of urban and rural landscapes began to make sense. This was Ireland, but not as we are told we knew it. The hip-hop duo Mango &amp; Mathman bounced on, hurling sharp bouts of rhyming into a melting pot awash with strings, raising the stakes when Lisa Hannigan joined them to sing Deep Blue in epic Eminem-Dido style. The second half was better still, opening with the quickfire Dublin poet Stephen James Smith, accompanied by violinist Emma Smith, with his brilliant and witty My Ireland, addressing the historic misrepresentation of Irishness. The arresting close harmonies of harp/keyboards duo Saint Sister and stirring gospel and blues from the excellent Brian Deady followed. Hannigan took centre stage to deliver her gracefully passionate Fall, before being joined by Saint Sister for an affecting unaccompanied setting of Seamus Heaney’s poem Anahorish. A jovial Noonan closed the show, but there were no big singalongs, traditional favourites, rabble rousing or tumultuous finale. The one indulgence was unexpected – a feelgood whole-cast cover of Dancing in the Moonlight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/07/jo-cox-memorial-grants-women-communities","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T09:04:51Z","webTitle":"This much-needed fund will let Jo Cox’s ideas and values shine on | Alison McGovern","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/07/jo-cox-memorial-grants-women-communities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/07/jo-cox-memorial-grants-women-communities","fields":{"headline":"This much-needed fund will let Jo Cox’s ideas and values shine on","bodyText":"Grief doesn’t really leave us, ever. Yes, the death of a person truly loved is an event from which it is possible to carry on. But that is what it is. Carrying on. And as you carry on living, you carry with you the grief. You carry the lack of that loved person, and the hole they left in your supportive web. You carry on wondering about what they might have thought, what they might have said, the actions they may have taken. I think about my friend Jo Cox a lot. Today, as the Department for International Development announces its Jo Cox memorial grants in support of women’s empowerment and the strengthening of communities to prevent and predict identity-based violence, I hope we take a step forward that she would have liked. Any time I mention Syria, I think about Jo. In the year Jo spent in parliament, she put the devastating impact of the Syrian conflict on the agenda in the House of Commons. She never – not for a moment – allowed the government to forget our responsibility to civilians, who have done nothing to propagate war, but who bear the cost. She did not flinch from describing the brutality of Assad’s barrel bombs, nor did she hold back from spelling out the common humanity that we share with Syrian families. Jo had worked with women from Darfur and spent much time in post-conflict Bosnia. As she was no stranger to the impact of war, she used her voice to call for early interventions to try to stop conflicts before they escalate. Every time I have grasped for the words to explain the grim devastation Syrian civilians face, I have felt Jo’s absence. The truth is, in the past year, it has been far too easy for us all to turn away from that conflict, when we should have been screaming to send help. As the world has found it easier to ignore the suffering of Syrian civilians, I have thought more about Jo Cox. I am furiously angry that she is not here to make her own case for the humanitarian principle, now so evidently lacking. It is a horrific truth that life can be so vibrant yet snatched away in a moment. But I know that the lesson of her life is that the only purpose to that anger is to create sufficient force for change. Jo was a practical person, and we must be practical too. “More in common”, Jo’s expression of pure humanity from her maiden speech, echoed around the wood panels of the House of Commons chamber as she said them. Since she died those words have been shared around the world, and then returned to the Commons chamber, where they are painted in gold underneath Jo’s coat of arms. At the time, Jo was describing her constituency – Batley and Spen – but since her death, those words have been an inspiration to people everywhere. Jo demonstrated that hearing women’s voices matters. And in the case of the victims of war, we know that it is women who are most at risk, but also that their voices can be crucial in stopping conflict. That is why I am glad that the government is creating grants in Jo’s name for women that can help prevent or stabilise conflict. Specifically they will empower women to tackle the complex political, social and economic disadvantages they face, and strengthen the ability of communities to predict and prevent identity-based violence including mass atrocity crimes. This may be a Conservative government that I will disagree with on almost every issue, but when it comes the value of British aid, they have been a force for good. And I learned from Jo how crucial it is that we work across tribal party lines if the chance for change is available. So, I thank Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, along with her predecessor, Priti Patel, for setting up this fund. We are all sisters in this. The day Jo was killed in Batley, I was in the House of Commons. As the news filtered through of Jo’s death, MPs and parliamentary staff gathered in the opposition whips office. I saw grim realisation creep up on the faces of all, and hearts break at the thought of who we had lost. Twenty months later, I know those hearts are still broken. Mine is. Life has turned out to be harder and crueller than I wanted it to be. Despite this, the work, the effort and the campaigning that has gone on in Jo’s name has been a reminder of where love exists in life, too. New friendships – political and otherwise – have been made in her honour. New organisations exist to further the plans she made in life. New projects are well under way, be it in Batley and Spen, on loneliness, on the responsibility to protect, or on the role of women in public life. And in this new Department for International Development initiative, alongside every step to defend decent humanitarian values, Jo’s name truly lives on. And what’s more, her ideas and values live on in it too. • Alison McGovern is the Labour MP for Wirral South"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/17/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-emily-chang-brotopia-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T13:00:34Z","webTitle":"Why sexism is rife in Silicon Valley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-emily-chang-brotopia-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/17/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-emily-chang-brotopia-interview","fields":{"headline":"Why sexism is rife in Silicon Valley","bodyText":"Emily Chang is an American journalist and host of the US TV show Bloomberg Technology. Her new book, Brotopia, is an exposé of Silicon Valley’s macho culture. What is Brotopia? It’s this idea that Silicon Valley is a modern utopia where anyone can change the world or make their own rules, if they are a man. But if you are a woman it is incomparably harder. And that shows in the numbers. Women-led companies get just 2% of venture capital funding. That is egregious, especially in an industry that prides itself on being a meritocracy where anyone can succeed. We need people of all backgrounds to be making these products, because people everywhere are using them. How did men come to rule in Silicon Valley? You say it hasn’t always been like this. Women were programming computers in the early days of the military and Nasa. Then, as the industry started to explode, these personality tests were developed to identify people who could be good at this job. And it was decided, though there is no evidence to support the idea, that good programmers “don’t like people”. Well, the research tells us if you hire people who don’t like people, you hire far more men than women. These tests perpetuated the stereotype of the antisocial, mostly white, male nerds who many of us think of when we think of computer programmers. That has also extended to entrepreneurs as well. Steve Jobs sort of proved a different kind of person could start an amazing company, but we created another stereotype of a swaggering, risk-taking bro instead, which also selected for men. So what’s Brotopia like for the women who do inhabit it? They are frustrated and tired of being the only women in the room, day after day. They are doing this sort of second job that men don’t have to do, which is prove that they deserve to be there. At the same time, they are fending off sexual advances because they are the only women in the room. The circumstances for female entrepreneurs are especially challenging. Most have not just one story to tell about bad behaviour or an unwanted advance, but several. How does Silicon Valley compare with other sectors, such as Wall Street, which is also notoriously sexist? I can’t tell you how many times, as I was interviewing for this book, people said to me: “Well, Silicon Valley can’t possibly be worse than Wall Street.” Well, it is. The gender imbalance is a lot bigger: the top banks are generally 50/50 when it comes to representation; in Silicon Valley, women hold 25% of jobs. Isn’t the problem a “pipeline” one – there just aren’t the female computer science graduates coming through? Silicon Valley created the pipeline problem by creating this very narrow idea of who can be good at the job. The industry [also] has a big retention problem – women are twice as likely to quit tech than men – and that is because it is so male-dominated and the culture is not inclusive. Unconscious bias is a huge problem. How might our tech products have been better if women had been more involved? Evan Williams, co-founder of Twitter, told me that he thinks if women had been on the early Twitter team, online harassment and trolling wouldn’t be such a problem. They just weren’t thinking about how Twitter could be used to send death threats when they were building the product. In addition, maybe porn wouldn’t be so ubiquitous and video games wouldn’t be so violent. The book details drug-fuelled sex parties where rich and powerful men invite women in two-to-one ratios, and “tech bros” attending strip clubs in the middle of the day. Indeed, you visit a strip club in the tech-heavy South of Market region of San Francisco. How extensive is this kind of behaviour and how does it hurt women in tech? It depends on the circles you run in. For some, the [sex party] scene feels ever-present and I spoke to a number of women who either left the country or moved to New York because they didn’t feel comfortable. I spoke to [female] engineers at Uber who said they were invited to strip clubs and bondage clubs in the middle of the day. It is putting women in very uncomfortable situations where they feel sort of damned if they do and damned if they don’t. Because so much business is happening outside the office, if they want access to those opportunities, they feel like they have to participate. The bottom line is there shouldn’t be a “cuddle puddle” at a company party. What possible format could a sex party have in Silicon Valley that would be OK? There are plenty of sex parties where there are very strict rules around consent, alcohol and gender ratios. The Bay Area has had a long tradition of sexual exploration, sexual liberation and sex positivity. But these events [I report on] are a lot more about power than about sexual exploration and it is a power dynamic that is completely lopsided. Google used to have a better representation of women, but now it’s no better than average, with 20% of women in tech roles. What went wrong? Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin really focused on hiring and promoting women in the early days. And they got some incredible women – Susan Wojcicki, Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer – who made incredible contributions to the company [Wojcicki is now CEO of YouTube; Sandberg COO of Facebook; and Mayer stepped down as CEO of Yahoo last year]. But over time, Google lost focus. It began exploding in size, became focused on getting people in the seats as fast as possible and defaulted to all of the same hiring and recruiting strategies that other companies use. What role has Silicon Valley played in the #MeToo movement? I think women in Silicon Valley were pioneering in having the courage to come forward and they deserve a lot of credit for helping women summon their collective courage. It started with Ellen Pao [a former junior partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, who sued for gender discrimination in 2012]. She lost in court but won in the court of public opinion. Then Susan Fowler came forward and that catalysed several women in tech to come forward about investors. What happens to the men in Silicon Valley who leave following revelations of sexual harassment? Are they landing on their feet? I think it is too early to tell. We, as a society, need to think about what we are OK with when it comes to a next act. When are we ready to forgive? I don’t know the answer to that question. There are so many problems – where do you start to fix things? And can Silicon Valley ever really change? I am hopeful. I believe that the same people who changed the world can change this too. They can hire women and pay them fairly. I look into a company called Slack, where the CEO has made hiring and promoting women a specific priority. Slack has focused on giving people the tools to combat their own bias, it has diversified its recruiting teams, it asks employees for diverse referrals, it has built structured reviews and feedback systems and it has done a comprehensive pay review. It is showing in the numbers – about 43.5% women. Aside from not harassing women, what can individual men in Silicon Valley do to make things better? Men need to listen and be advocates. It has been interesting on my book tour: half the audience feel so validated and grateful that someone is finally speaking for them, while half are completely in disbelief. For so long, women have been living this every day and men have been ignorant of it and blind to it. I don’t think there are always bad intentions there, but I do think that at a certain point ignorance becomes wilful. 2017: a year of reckoning February 2017 Computer engineer Susan Fowler publishes a blog post about her experience of sexual harassment at her former company, Uber, prompting an investigation into its culture.

The determination was made by the US Office of Special Counsel on Tuesday, and relates to comments Conway made during the Alabama special election between Roy Moore and Doug Jones to fill the seat vacated by the attorney general, Jeff Sessions. OSC is not related to the ongoing special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller into the Trump administration. According to the OSC, in TV appearances on 20 November and 6 December, 2017, Conway “impermissibly mixed official government business with political views about the candidates in the Alabama special election”, violating the Hatch Act. The act, first passed in 1939, prohibits almost all federal employees in the executive branch from engaging in most forms of partisan political activity. During the first appearance, on Fox, Conway slammed Jones as “weak on crime, weak on borders … strong on raising your taxes” and as “terrible for property owners”. Then, on 4 December, the Office of White House Counsel sent an email to Conway and other White House Office employees reminding them of Hatch act restrictions. “You may not use your official position to affect the result of an election. You may not, for example, use your official title when participating in any political activities,” the email read in part, according to the OSC. Two days later, on CNN, Conway again seemed to advocate for Moore and against Jones to viewers, including potential Alabama voters. Jones won the election in a rare victory for Alabama Democrats. The OSC requested in a letter to Donald Trump that he consider “appropriate disciplinary actions”. Hogan Gidley, White House deputy press secretary, said on Tuesday: “Kellyanne Conway did not advocate for or against the election of any particular candidate. Kellyanne’s statements actually show her intention and desire to comply with the Hatch Act – as she twice declined to respond to the host’s specific invitation to encourage Alabamans to vote for the Republican.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/06/oxford-university-blocks-challenge-to-staff-pension-cuts-proposals-universities-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T19:25:06Z","webTitle":"Oxford University blocks staff attempts to challenge pension cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/06/oxford-university-blocks-challenge-to-staff-pension-cuts-proposals-universities-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/06/oxford-university-blocks-challenge-to-staff-pension-cuts-proposals-universities-strike","fields":{"headline":"Oxford University blocks staff attempts to challenge pension cuts","bodyText":"The University of Oxford has blocked attempts by staff to debate pension proposals that have sparked industrial action on campuses across the UK, to cries of “Shame!” from academics. As the strike by members of the University and College Union (UCU) entered its eighth day, Oxford’s arcane procedures were used to halts efforts to force a resolution on the proposals to downgrade staff pensions that have provoked action at more than 60 campuses. Staff backing the strikes wanted to suspend standing orders at Oxford’s congregation – a university-wide meeting of staff – held on Tuesday afternoon, and debate the university’s response to a changes proposed to the universities superannuation scheme (USS). But their efforts were thwarted when more than 20 members objected, to a chorus of boos from the hundreds in the Sheldonian theatre who wanted to proceed. In an email to staff, Louise Richardson, Oxford’s vice chancellor, said she endorsed the tactics that effectively killed off a wider debate at the meeting. “I fully understand the depth of feeling on this issue but I have to say that I have been disheartened these past few days by the tenor of some of the debate,” she said. “As a university we take pride in our defence of freedom of speech, in reasoned argument, and evidence based decisions. “If we are to impart these qualities to our students, we should, at a minimum, practise them among ourselves.” The academics rejected an offer from Richardson for a non-binding “town hall” discussion instead – amid signs that the employers’ unity is crumbling as vice-chancellors at Sheffield and Loughborough universities visited picket lines at their campuses. The strikes over controversial changes to the pension scheme for librarians, technicians and researchers have spread across three weeks, with UCU and the employers group Universities UK holding a second day of talks at the industrial conciliation service Acas. The UUK had said it was not prepared for further talks until later in the week but after a change of heart on Monday evening notified the union via Twitter. The UCU will continue with strike action later in the year, which increases the chances of interfering with undergraduates’ final-year results and possibly delaying their graduation. At Sheffield, its vice-chancellor, Sir Keith Burnett, met with staff on a UCU picket line, while his counterpart at Loughborough, Prof Robert Allison, did the same. Burnett also issued a statement calling on the UUK to hold “genuine negotiations” with the UCU. “I am not the only vice-chancellor who is urging action to this end, and I will continue to press for this to happen both in public and in private,” he said. Imperial College London has also broken with the UUK by writing directly to the Pensions Regulator, asking for time to allow an expert group to examine the state of the pension scheme. “We appreciate this is an extraordinary request and we are prepared to carry our share of the risk in staying part of the scheme on the current terms, until the work is complete,” Alice Gast, Imperial’s president, wrote. At City University’s Cass business school, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, was asked by striking staff not to cross the picket line. Cable later cancelled an appearance at a conference the school was holding. The strike was provoked by the desire of the UUK to shift staff pensions from offering fixed benefits after retirement to defined contributions, after the Pensions Regulator said the USS was more risky than previously estimated. The role of Oxford and Cambridge colleges has been particularly controversial, after it was revealed they made up a high proportion of institutions backing a lower risk of pensions losses. But even within Oxbridge, support has weakened for the low-risk position that provoked the strikes. King’s College, Cambridge, said in a statement that its submission to the UUK’s survey of members “was not, and should not have been taken as, considered view of the college”. St Catharine’s College, Cambridge, also voided its survey response, saying that it had “no institutional view”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/07/jefferson-poirot-france-england-six-nations-rugby-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"Jefferson Poirot: ‘We were optimistic even before Scotland beat England’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/07/jefferson-poirot-france-england-six-nations-rugby-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/07/jefferson-poirot-france-england-six-nations-rugby-interview","fields":{"headline":"Jefferson Poirot: ‘We were optimistic even before Scotland beat England’","bodyText":"With the surname Poirot it was perhaps inevitable that France’s loose-head prop would develop a heightened interest in using “the little grey cells”. Front-rows have definitely changed. While it is 36 years since the England prop Colin Smart was infamously tricked into swilling aftershave at the post-match banquet in Paris, the thoughtful Jefferson Poirot explains how his preparation for Saturday’s Test against the English will mainly be in the mind. “I have a big focus on mental preparation,” says the 25-year-old. “I love it and I work on it a lot. There’s a lot of hypnosis when I work with my mental coach.” Cynics might suggest watching videos of plodding France sides over the past few seasons would induce a trance-like state but for the Bordeaux-Bègles prop the sessions with his mental coach, Gershon Pinon, are a serious business. “You either believe in it or you don’t and I believe in it a lot,” says Poirot. “When I’m here at Marcoussis I can’t work with him and I have an audio recording that helps me prepare for the match. It is organised thematically as I prepare for scrums, my role in attack, my play without the ball and my defence. The session is the same whether I’m with my mental coach or on my own. When I am on my own I can visualise my opponents and the stadium.” Poirot says that after scrum visualisation with Pinon he often needs to massage his neck as his muscles tighten and fatigue kicks in as if he had been packing down. He credits the mental techniques for helping him through France’s opener against Ireland, his first game in a month. Making 16 tackles in that narrow defeat and being active in the rucks proved his fitness and Poirot has retained the No 1 shirt in the subsequent two matches. A frank Poirot admits: “We knew not having quick ball was a weakness ahead of the tournament and we are improving. Teams were targeting us in this area and our aim is to have as much fast ball as possible and that means getting it away from the rucks in less than three seconds. We did that more than 50% of the time against Italy.” Beating Italy, a first victory for France in a year, has lifted the mood and at Murrayfield Scotland showed the way to get at England, who remain the team every Frenchman wants to beat. “There was animosity every time I played against England for age-group French teams,” Poirot says. “We were optimistic even before Scotland’s win against England. Scotland were effective and above all very aggressive. You simply cannot allow England to settle into their game as they score a lot of tries from strike moves off scrums and lineouts. We need to upset their rhythm as the Scots did. They forced an under-pressure England to throw the ball around any old how. We need to be good at the breakdown and be really aggressive. When you are on the back foot against England it’s really hard to avoid haemorrhaging points. We need to have possession.” Poirot, who missed the 2017 Six Nations campaign with a calf injury, has faced England only once, missing a tackle on Danny Care that led to the scrum-half scoring two seasons ago in Paris as Eddie Jones’s side sealed the grand slam. “I don’t know if personal revenge is the right way to think about it but I certainly don’t want England to come here and beat us again. England have been the top nation since 2015. We’re hungry because we’ve only got one win in the tournament and we could easily have been on three wins from three.” Working with Joe Worsley at Bordeaux-Bègles and the fitness coach Tim Exeter earlier in his career has given Poirot a healthy respect for organised “Anglo-Saxon” coaching methods: “I think England have a great domestic league and I’d like to play in it one day, later in my career,” he says. So how did Poirot, born near Paris in 1992, end up with an English sounding first name? “My father is Anglophone and he wanted me to have an Anglo-Saxon name. I don’t speak English though.” Poirot’s Nigerian father – who once worked for the NHS – separated from his French mother when Jefferson was three and five years later Patricia, a nurse, took her children to live in the Dordogne. There Jefferson made a name for himself as a back-row player and was scouted by Brive at 15. It was a wrench for him to leave as he considered himself to be the man of the household but Patricia left her son no choice: “She told me it was a golden opportunity.” After a single first-team season he moved on to Bordeaux-Bègles where he must have impressed Jacques Brunel, who left the Gironde to take over as the France coach before this year’s Six Nations. Poirot has tempered an early propensity for conflict with his coaches and comes across as mature and controlled for one of his age. Why? “Your questions are difficult,” he says. “I’m relaxed and in control because it’s only the Tuesday before the match. I’ll start to visualise the scrums later in the week. For now I’m trying to store up my energy as I’ll need all of it on Saturday in order to hope to beat you English!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/06/f1-tycoon-vijay-mallya-superyacht-impounded-wage-dispute","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T19:50:51Z","webTitle":"F1 tycoon Vijay Mallya’s superyacht impounded over wage dispute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/06/f1-tycoon-vijay-mallya-superyacht-impounded-wage-dispute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/06/f1-tycoon-vijay-mallya-superyacht-impounded-wage-dispute","fields":{"headline":"F1 tycoon Vijay Mallya’s superyacht impounded over wage dispute","bodyText":"A $93m (£67m) superyacht owned by Indian multimillionaire Vijay Mallya has been impounded in Malta in a dispute over the businessman’s failure to pay the crew more than $1m in wages. Mallya’s 95-metre Indian Empress was boarded by port officials and prevented from leaving Malta on Tuesday as part of the crew’s legal action to recover unpaid wages. More than 40 crew, including several Britons, Indians and eastern European workers, have not been paid since September when Mallya – who is fighting extradition from the UK to India – abandoned the vessel. Some of the senior crew, who have not left the vessel since it was abandoned, are owed up to $92,000 in unpaid wages. Mallya, a co-owner of the Force India Formula One team and self-proclaimed “King of the Good Times”, was arrested in London last year over allegations he supported his F1 team with money-laundered cash. Indian authorities are seeking his extradition to face trial in India. Mallya is on bail pending an extradition hearing scheduled to begin in April. Danny McGowan, strategic organiser of the maritime union Nautilus International, said crew were left with no choice but to ask the courts to hold the Isle of Man-registered superyacht ransom. The yacht, which features a 15-seat cinema and Sir Elton John’s baby grand piano, has been impounded in a “maritime lien” which gives the crew claim over the vessel to the value of the unpaid wages. “Our members onboard gave their employer and the ship owner multiple opportunities to pay monthly wages, displaying a loyalty and restraint greater than many would show in such situations,” McGowan said. “These opportunities were regularly ignored by the owner, leaving us with no option but to take the case to the courts.” McGowan said it was the first that the financial security provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention have been enacted to help crew on an abandoned superyacht. He said the union had secured $615,000, which covers four months worth of unpaid wages from the vessel’s insurers under the international Maritime Labour Convention. But he said Nautilus members were still owed an additional $330,000 and non-union crew members were owed hundreds of thousands more. Charles Boyle, Nautilus’s legal director, said: “The superyacht sector is seen as one of glamour and glitz, but the sad reality is that crew members can experience exploitation and abuse, and that is why Nautilus has become increasingly involved in such justice case.” A representative for Mallya did not respond to requests for comment. The 62-year-old businessman is on bail and living in a £11.5m mansion in the Hertfordshire village of Tewin, nearly Welwyn, 20 miles north of London. Mallya, who was once known as the “Branson of Bangalore” for his business and sport empire that included Kingfisher beer and the Kingfisher airline, bought the Indian Empress in 2006. He spent more than £5m refitting the yacht in 2015, which included making space for Sir Elton John’s black Yamaha Disklavier, which the singer had used to write the Songs from the West Coast album. Mallya bought the piano for €226,000 at a charity auction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/06/crown-prince-saudis-theresa-may-britain-saudi-arabia-money","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T18:22:32Z","webTitle":"The crown prince doesn’t listen to Saudis – why would he listen to Theresa May? | Jamal Khashoggi and Robert Lacey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/crown-prince-saudis-theresa-may-britain-saudi-arabia-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/crown-prince-saudis-theresa-may-britain-saudi-arabia-money","fields":{"headline":"The crown prince doesn’t listen to Saudis – why would he listen to Theresa May?","bodyText":"In February 1945, over lunch in Cairo, the leaders of Great Britain and Saudi Arabia met face to face for the first time. Churchill was just concluding his stewardship of the allied victory in the second world war, while King Abdulaziz, the creator of modern Saudi Arabia, could savour his equally historic unification of the warring tribes of the Arabian peninsula. Often better known in the west as Ibn Saud, the Saudi monarch was the grandfather of the kingdom’s de facto new ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who arrives in the UK on a diplomatic visit on Wednesday. Saluting Ibn Saud’s puritanical Wahhabi principles when they met, Churchill gracefully acknowledged that it was the “religion of his majesty to deprive himself of smoking and alcohol”. But he made clear that his own rule of life “prescribes as an absolutely sacred rite of smoking cigars and also the drinking of alcohol before, after, and if need be during all meals and in the intervals between them”. Let us hope that Theresa May is equally forthright in setting out Britain’s cultural differences with the crown prince today, making clear Britain’s belief in liberty of speech, freedom from arbitrary arrest, the independent rule of law, and the sacred principle that political leaders – be they monarchs or prime ministers – are not the masters, but merely servants of the people. These are principles for which the 32-year-old, familiarly known as MbS, has yet to show much enthusiasm. Several dozen intellectuals, religious scholars and journalists have been detained without trial in Saudi Arabia since last September – which is why MbS will meet the Queen safely inside the battlements of Windsor – a shift of venue perhaps devised by the Foreign Office to protect him from exposure to demonstrations by human rights campaigners. Back in those pre-Israel years, Churchill urged the staunchly anti-Zionist Saudi king to help to ease the general Arab welcome to the Jews in Palestine. Britain had subsidised the Saudi monarchy for 20 years before its discovery of oil, argued the prime minister, so a gesture towards the Jewish homeland was the least Saudi could offer to repay the debt. This was a crude wielding of the British “big stick”, in the opinion of Abdulaziz, when he later reported the discussion to the American minister in Jeddah. Might May try such tough tactics as she seeks to persuade MbS to list or co-list his £1.5tn flotation of Aramco shares through London next year – or dare to inquire of the crown prince if he has secured his people’s approval for this massive sale of national assets? It does not seem likely. There are few big sticks left in the British armoury these days. So, if the prime minister proves no Churchill, what are the ways in which young Prince Mohammed might mirror his famous grandfather? MbS has wasted no time deliberating like his predecessors over such issues as the need for women to drive, or the urgency of curbing Islamic extremism and the hated religious police. He has just got on with it, in a whirlwind of decrees and government shake-ups that his energetic grandfather might well admire. Cinemas and entertainment centres will open their doors all over the kingdom in the coming months, and when it comes to business corruption, the young man has wasted no time locking up more than 300 suspects – albeit in Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton Hotel. As a consequence, the young crown prince is immensely popular, with many young Saudis – and with women of all ages. But for all his get-up-and-go decisiveness, Abdulaziz spent many hours every week sitting with his advisers, foreign visitors, tribal leaders and ordinary members of the public, listening to their ideas and grievances. “We have a popular saying,” declared the king in January 1925, when he occupied the holy city of Mecca. “The people of Mecca know best about Mecca’s mountain passes.” Then he promptly set up a local majlis al-shura – a “sitting place for consultation” – where local people could organise matters such as pilgrim transport and city governance, along the lines of a similar consultative council in Riyadh. Today there exists such a national body, the consultative assembly of Saudi Arabia, set up by King Fahd in the 1990s, consisting of 150 members, some of them women, all nominated by the king. It is an embryo Saudi parliament, and King Abdullah, the predecessor to MbS’s father, King Salman, made muffled noises about opening a percentage of seats to popular election. That talk has stopped abruptly with the advent of the crown prince, whose fierce and headstrong style both at home and abroad in his dealings with countries such as Qatar, Lebanon and, most tragically of all, Yemen, defies all awareness of popular consultation. Britain bears its own responsibility for the 13,000 people who have been killed in Yemen since 2015, both as the legacy of its “master planning” of the Middle East a century ago, and through the current supplying of lethal weaponry to the Saudi-backed coalition that is fighting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Away from Yemen, MbS has rowed back strongly from the kingdom’s previous support of Islamic extremism, so perhaps May can find common ground for Britain to try a little regional peace-making. For his domestic reform programme, the crown prince deserves praise. But at the same time, the brash and abrasive young innovator has not encouraged or permitted any popular debate in Saudi Arabia about the nature of his many changes. He appears to be moving the country from old-time religious extremism to his own “You-must-accept-my-reform” extremism, without any consultation – accompanied by arrests and the disappearance of his critics. So, does his programme lack the most important reform of all – democracy? The crown prince is proposing to impose Saudi Arabia’s first modern taxes as part of his economic strategy in the face of stagnant oil prices – a very brave and necessary move. But he seems oblivious to the need for any popular discussion or consent to accompany that. “No taxation without representation” is an inflexible lesson of history that Britain has learned the hard way, and May would be doing her guest a great favour to remind him politely of it. • Jamal Khashoggi was media adviser to the Saudi ambassador in the UK.

These cases are more devastating to those who loved these people because in many cases the deaths could have been prevented; better care might have saved them. Too often, services did not respond to the concerns of GPs, families, and patients themselves. The Guardian’s figures, drawn from coroners’ warnings – known as reports to prevent future deaths – are if anything conservative. A forthcoming report on the issue from the NHS ombudsman is expected to raise similar issues. There is no doubt that services are overstretched. In one in six of the cases, coroners linked the deaths to the lack of staff, beds and specialist services, or to long delays for treatment. Mental health services have been desperately underfunded for too long, and the promised increase in spending is insufficient given the historic shortfall and the surge in demand. The current government, and the coalition before it, promised to prioritise mental health; these figures show how little progress has been made. A leaked green paper recently revealed that the promise of a maximum four-week wait for children (currently left as long as 18 months without care) will not be fully implemented until 2021 due to lack of staff and funding. A dearth of early intervention also leads to heavier demand for more expensive crisis services. It is impossible to provide adequate care without adequate resources. But funding is not a guarantee of quality. Cash alone cannot ensure that agencies and staff communicate as they should (the issue cited most frequently in these coroners’ warnings); nor can it foster a culture of learning from errors. Some NHS bodies are clearly failing to apply the necessary lessons – even when warned about them in the bluntest possible terms. At least some of these deaths were doubly avoidable. Had mistakes or shortcomings in treating previous patients been addressed, they might not have been repeated to such terrible effect. Similar problems are occurring across regions, reflecting in part the localised nature of NHS provision and the difficulty of ensuring that improvements are applied across the board. Yet in other, still more disturbing cases, coroners say that they have alerted the same trusts to the same problem before. One describes his “considerable sadness” that a death followed a similar case he had examined. His initial warning led to a promise that every patient presenting with evidence of a mental health problem or after reported self-harm or suicidal behaviour would be referred for a mental health assessment. But “the assurances given were not fulfilled in practice” and several staff members treating the second patient were not even aware of the new policy. He notes that the assurances he has received from the trust are to a large extent those given previously, adding: “In view of the history I am concerned that without such an auditing process, failures of care may take place as identified above.” The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, a former health minister, says warnings are not enough: we must ensure that they are followed up. He’s right. While trusts have a duty to respond to these reports, some do so in only cursory fashion. Others take them more seriously, but fail to follow through on promised improvements. Putting the Care Quality Commission in charge of monitoring progress, and ensuring that lessons are applied across the board where necessary, is the least we owe to the families of these patients, and to the patients of the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/06/mark-mcdonald-resigns-from-snp-over-inappropriate-behaviour","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T18:05:22Z","webTitle":"Nicola Sturgeon calls on Mark McDonald to resign as MSP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/06/mark-mcdonald-resigns-from-snp-over-inappropriate-behaviour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/06/mark-mcdonald-resigns-from-snp-over-inappropriate-behaviour","fields":{"headline":"Nicola Sturgeon calls on Mark McDonald to resign as MSP","bodyText":"Nicola Sturgeon has urged her former childcare minister Mark McDonald to stand down as an MSP after he resigned from her party over inappropriate behaviour but refused to quit Holyrood. McDonald announced on Tuesday he had left the Scottish National party after three women accused him of unwanted and inappropriate behaviour, but he insisted he would stay on as independent MSP for Aberdeen Donside. Sturgeon, who is SNP leader as well as first minister, told reporters she could not see why McDonald felt it was right to remain at Holyrood if he felt it necessary to leave the party because of his conduct. “He was elected as an SNP MSP,” she said. “If his behaviour is such that he himself considers he cannot continue as an SNP MSP, then it would be appropriate to give his constituents the opportunity to elect a new MSP.” After the allegations about inappropriate behaviour emerged in November, McDonald stood down as minister for childcare and early years and was then quickly suspended by the SNP. In a statement released on Tuesday, the SNP said three women had complained about McDonald’s conduct, and after interviewing 18 witnesses, an investigation concluded that the allegations against him by two of the women were substantiated. The SNP said his actions included: “Inappropriate and unwanted text and social media messages; unwanted attention causing distress; persistent behaviour over an extended period of time; [and] exploiting his position of power.” A party spokesman said: “Investigators concluded that Mr McDonald had been deliberate in his actions, and should have been aware that it was not appropriate for an individual in his position to be behaving in such a manner. Mr McDonald today publicly resigned from the party.” The investigation concluded that the allegations from the third woman, who accused him of “inappropriate physical contact” at a social event, could not be substantiated. In a statement released on Twitter, McDonald insisted he now accepted his behaviour had been unacceptable and an abuse of power, but he denied any “physical abuse”. He said he deeply regretted his behaviour and had written to one complainant to apologise, as she had requested. “I have accepted that my behaviour towards two individuals fell below the level of professionalism that they were entitled to expect of me, whether in a personal or social context,” he said. Opposition parties had earlier accused McDonald of resigning from the party simply to protect the SNP’s reputation. McDonald is now also expected to vote alongside the SNP and his refusal to resign from Holyrood also prevented a byelection taking place that Sturgeon was confident her party would win. Rhoda Grant, Scottish Labour’s parliamentary business manager, said: “Mark McDonald decided his conduct was not fit for a minister or an SNP MSP – but somehow it is acceptable for an MSP without party affiliation. People in Aberdeen Donside will rightly question that.” Alexander Burnett, the Scottish Conservative MSP for Aberdeenshire West, said: “Many people will rightly be questioning why Mark McDonald thinks that his behaviour was bad enough to resign from the SNP, but not to resign from the Scottish parliament. He is clearly prioritising the reputation of the SNP over that of Holyrood, and it’s simply not good enough.” The allegations against McDonald came soon after the sexual misconduct controversy erupted at Westminster, with the then Scottish Labour deputy leader Alex Rowley also accused of misconduct. A Labour investigation into those allegations was inconclusive, but Rowley quit as deputy leader. Last Friday, Holyrood authorities revealed that a survey of Holyrood staff found one in three women had experienced harassment or sexist behaviour there. Of those who reported sexual harassment, 45% identified an MSP as the perpetrator."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/olympic-skeleton-champion-lizzie-yarnold-how-i-eat","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"Olympic skeleton champion Lizzie Yarnold: how I eat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/olympic-skeleton-champion-lizzie-yarnold-how-i-eat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/olympic-skeleton-champion-lizzie-yarnold-how-i-eat","fields":{"headline":"Olympic skeleton champion Lizzie Yarnold: how I eat","bodyText":"Breakfast During the winter months, we’re away, sliding and training, but on a typical summer training day back in the UK at Bath University, I wake up hungry at 6.30am. I have a cup of tea straight away, then two slices of toast with salted butter, sometimes with marmalade on one, and always with two eggs (scrambled, boiled, or poached). Then I leave for the gym with another cup of tea. Lunch I never eat later than 1pm – usually it’s half a sweet potato with salad, and chilli con carne, tuna or chicken. I like a colourful plate, and always more protein than carbs. I don’t really worry about quantities. Even when I’m not training, I eat the same way. It’s all about keeping my body under control, and my weight down so as not to add any undue strain. The sled weighs 30kg; you have to look after your back. Dinner My husband James is the chef. It’s always no carbs for me. Instead, lots of steamed or roast veg, and more protein: a pork chop, chicken in creme fraiche, anything to make the meat as interesting as possible. I make up two lots of jelly a week, adding fruit in it. And, before bed, I either have a glass of milk or, if I’m on my weight target and feeling good, some Angel Delight: you need to feed your body through the night. And then I take a cup of tea to bed. Snacks I carry a load of snack pots in my backpack – nuts, seeds, beef jerky, yoghurt, fresh fruit, and my guilty pleasure: Grape Nuts cereal. With that, I take a pint of milk and my own tea bags (Twinings extra-strong). I also take a 1.5 litre bottle of water and another 1.5l bottle of squash (supermarket own brand no added sugar, to which I add some salt), which I refill multiple times – on average I drink about five litres of liquid every day.

As a refugee, translator, intellectual, communist and feminist, she played a part in many of the events and movements that shaped the 20th century. She was born Anna Zisserman in Harbin, China, daughter of Vladimir and Matilda (nee Glogau). Her father was a Russian landowner, and Anya spent her first years as part of an émigré community displaced by the Russian revolution. In 1936 she travelled to Vienna to live with her mother’s family, who were Jewish. After the Anschluss, Anya (who was still at school) went to the Rathaus to hear Hitler and Goebbels address the chanting crowds. An Englishwoman she had met on holiday invited her to Britain, and she escaped to London by train. She attended St Paul’s girls’ school, which at the time offered a few free places to refugees. During the war Anya began a degree in modern languages at Oxford, but left to work at a Russian monitoring service set up by Reuters, in Barnet, north London, where she translated radio broadcasts from the eastern front, as well as some of Stalin’s speeches. In 1942 she married Stephen Bostock, a British intelligence officer. They had two children, Nina and Dima. The marriage broke down after the war, and Anya worked as a translator for the newly established United Nations. The children were snatched from New York by her husband and taken back to England, in a case which became a press sensation and led to a custody battle. Returning to England, Anya became part of a circle of leftwing intellectuals and artists that included Eric Hobsbawm, Doris Lessing, Mordecai Richler and the artist Peter de Francia, with whom she had a relationship. She reviewed fiction for the Manchester Guardian, and worked as a reader for Methuen and Hutchinson. Over the years that followed, she translated many books into English (as Anna Bostock), including works by Trotsky, Lenin, Marx, Le Corbusier and Ernst Fischer. In 1951 she met the writer John Berger and began a relationship with him in 1958, changing her name to Berger by deed poll. Her intellectual influence was reflected in his books and in the Ways of Seeing television series (in which Anya appears). They travelled Europe together on his motorbike, and Anya was able to visit the Soviet Union for the first time. Together they moved to Geneva, where Anya again worked as a translator for the UN. She became involved with the women’s liberation movement, and ran a consciousness-raising group in the south of France, where the couple had a house. During their time together they had two children, Katya and Jacob. They split up in the 1970s. Anya continued working into her 80s, remaining a ferocious intellectual as well as a great traveller and storyteller. She enjoyed playing Scrabble (sometimes in several languages at once), tackling the Times crossword, and walking in the mountains around Geneva. She is survived by her four children, nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/06/guardian-weekly-saudi-arabia","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T16:03:43Z","webTitle":"Inside the 9 March edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/06/guardian-weekly-saudi-arabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/06/guardian-weekly-saudi-arabia","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 9 March edition","bodyText":"It’s barely nine months since Mohammed bin Salman was anointed as heir to the Saudi Arabian throne, but in that time he has consolidated his authority with a crackdown on opponents and a rapid-change agenda. His rise was due to be recognised in London this week when he was to visit the Queen on his first foreign visit since his elevation as the kingdom’s crown prince. At home, a mood of change appears to be sweeping Saudi Arabia. Women in particular are poised to benefit from a range of new freedoms, including the ability to drive, join the military and even abandon wearing the abaya. But are the changes here to stay? Not all Saudis are so sure. Martin Chulov reports from Riyadh for the Guardian Weekly’s cover story this week. Inside the paper we reflect on an uncertain outcome to the Italian election, where the winners appear to be the country’s emerging populist parties. From Washington we look back on the latest damaging week for Donald Trump, as the president appears increasingly isolated in the White House, while we also reflect on the possible global reverberations of his threat to impose high tariffs on US steel imports. From China, meanwhile, came guarded concerns over Xi Jinping’s intention to end fixed terms for the country’s leadership (a move that appeared to draw Trump’s approval). As part of his fascinating series The Alternatives, the Guardian’s senior economics commentator Aditya Chakrabortty visited the German town that has unsettled the giant energy providers by taking back control of its electricity grid. We also ponder the future of diesel cars in the wake of several European cities’ decision to ban them from their centres. A developing story of significance in the UK as we went to press was the mysterious case of a former Russian spy who, along with his daughter, appear to have been poisoned in the western English town of Salisbury. There’s coverage in the paper, and the latest can be found on our website. The Weekly Review visits New Zealand, which appears to have become the bolthole of choice for discerning Silicon Valley billionaires concerned about the arrival of the apocalypse. Discovery charts the grim trend of mass animal mortality events, and asks what lessons can be learned from such grisly occurrences. On the Culture front, the Books pages review a collection of observations about city life. There’s also an amusing look at the charming musical collaboration between French crooner Sébastien Tellier and burlesque star Dita Von Teese. On the back page we catch up with the remarkable voyages of the Peace Boat, a 32,000-tonne cruise liner repurposed by radical Japanese social enterprises to spread the word of international understanding. If ever there was a time that the message of peace deserved another hearing, surely this is it. Thank you as ever for supporting Guardian journalism through your subscription to the Weekly.

Netanyahu told Aipac he had warned against the Iran nuclear deal brokered by the Barack Obama administration and claimed vindication. Pointing to a map of the Middle East showing Iran’s alleged dominance, he said: “Darkness is descending on our region. Iran is building an aggressive empire: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen, more to come.” He said Tehran was seeking to build permanent military bases in Syria – where Iranian-backed forces support President Bashar al-Assad in a civil war – and develop factories there and in Lebanon for precision-guided missiles capable of striking Israel. “I will not let that happen,” he said. “We will not let that happen.” Netanyahu and Trump enjoy arguably the closest relationship of any two Israeli and US leaders. Both are also facing politically damaging domestic investigations embroiling their families. Both have dismissed the allegations as “fake news”. The Israeli prime minister – awaiting a decision by Israel’s attorney general on whether to indict him, as police have recommended in two bribery cases – lavished more praise his counterpart on Tuesday. “President Trump has made it clear that his administration will not accept Iran’s aggression in the region,” he said. “He has made clear that he too will never accept a nuclear-armed Iran. That is the right policy. “I salute President Trump on this and the president has also made it clear that if the fatal flaws of the nuclear deal are not fixed he will walk away from the deal and restore sanctions. “Israel will be right there by America’s side and let me tell you, so will other countries in the region.” Both leaders have long spoken out against the Iran nuclear deal, citing its limited duration and the fact it does not cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme or support for anti-Israel militants. Netanyahu also thanked Trump’s team, including the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, for their commitment to peace in the Middle East. Kushner’s role has been questioned after his security clearance was downgraded, denying him access to some top-level intelligence, amid revelations over possible conflicts of interest. The pro-Israel lobby group’s conference is an annual display of solidarity addressed by both Republicans and Democrats. Netanyahu basked in applause and paid tribute to a “beautiful alliance” and “eternal bond”. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, also drew attention to Iran. “The Obama administration’s fealty to the nuclear deal spawned a reluctance to address Iran’s regional ambitions,” he said. “The notion that Sunni powers in the Middle East needed to learn to ‘share the neighborhood’ with Iran created a void. And Iran was happy to exploit that void, menacing our ships and planes deployed to the Persian Gulf.” Netanyahu’s address came a day after he met Trump at the White House and thanked him for recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and pledging to move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv. The US president said he might travel for the opening of the embassy, which he claimed he could get done for a cut-price $250,000, as opposed to an estimate of $1bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/06/italy-shows-that-rise-in-populism-not-limited-to-trump-and-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T17:27:16Z","webTitle":"Italy shows rise in populism is not limited to Trump and Brexit | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/italy-shows-that-rise-in-populism-not-limited-to-trump-and-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/06/italy-shows-that-rise-in-populism-not-limited-to-trump-and-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Italy shows rise in populism is not limited to Trump and Brexit","bodyText":"The first step to an effective response by progressives to the rising tide of rightwing populism in Italy and elsewhere (Editorial, 6 March) is to realise that ever more open borders are the problem. It was predominantly the opposition to inadequately controlled immigration that resulted in the Italian election result, the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s election. The other contributing factor was globalisation, with its job-destroying and far-too-open borders to goods such as steel. Lastly, inadequately constrained flows of capital and financial services assisted in the economic crash of 2008. The only counter will be some form of protectionism. However, Trump’s threatened trade war over steel (Report, 5 March) is the wrong kind of 1930s-style one-sided protectionism. He wants to curb imports that cause domestic unemployment, but at the same time plans to use all possible leverage to open up foreign markets to US exports. To avoid a re-run of the 1930s will require a very different “progressive protectionism”. This could benefit all countries by nurturing and rebuilding local economies through the permanent reduction in the level of international trade in goods, money and services, while enabling nation states to control the level of migration that their citizens desire. This approach can return a sense of optimism to the majority through championing policies geared to achieving more job security, a decrease in inequality and protection of the environment. It is also the only way to see off a further rise of the extreme right. Colin Hines East Twickenham, Middlesex • I agree with Rafael Behr (Opinion, 6 March) that the Italian elections show us that the forces that created Brexit are pan-European. The desperation that makes people vote for populists like Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio is the same desperation that makes people vote for a living fossil like Silvio Berlusconi. In order for “progressives” to prevail, they need to understand rather than condemn the electorate, who fear unemployment and the never-ending flow of asylum seekers through Italy’s southern flank. The opulence that we tourists see in Sorrento, Venice or Rome, is not the experience of many Italians. Stan Labovitch Windsor, Berkshire • Your editorial warns against blaming policy responses by Brussels for the rise of the Italian right. Yet as Larry Elliott says (Backlash grew after decade of damage, 6 March), Italian membership of the euro is clearly a factor in Italian mass unemployment, economic stagnation and the consequent rise of populism, because Rome cannot restore competitiveness by devaluing the lira as it did before 1999. Thank goodness Gordon Brown blocked Tony Blair’s attempts to include Britain in that disastrous political scheme, which was a fetish for British Europhiles in the early 2000s.

Why? Most journeys are short, half are under three miles and 70% under five miles long, and can be faster than driving and parking. While the weather can be blamed, similar weather does not deter Dutch cyclists, where nearly 30% of trips are by bike. The key factor is a lack of safe and direct cycle routes. Compared with the number of UK cyclists killed and seriously injured (KSI) by motor vehicles, the number of pedestrians KSI by bikes is tiny, despite cyclists who illegally use pavements. Yes, hard cases do make bad laws, like the pressure to make cyclists wear helmets. Only three countries did this: Australia, New Zealand and Israel. In each case the KSI level of cyclists increased, as drivers “did not see bikes”. Israel rescinded its law, and at the same time provided cycle routes to encourage cycling, both for health benefits and also to reduce car trips and the import of oil. Only 3% of Dutch cyclists wear helmets and the KSI is much smaller than the UK. As long as fuel duty is a major government revenue the incentive to provide more than lip service to cycling is weak, which is why cycle groups organise events to demonstrate a “critical mass” that will be taken seriously. Perhaps the PM and her security detail might cycle from Downing Street to parliament to set an example? Prof LJS Lesley President, Merseyside Cycling Campaign • Your leader on cycling was strangely muddled and has left me and my friends bemused. Almost everyone is a pedestrian, and many of us also ride bikes and drive cars. While not excusing bad behaviour in any walk of life or mode of transport, we do not recognise a “front in the culture wars” – we’ve chosen to use bikes throughout our lives because they are environmentally good, healthy, fast and fun. If I leave the car at home and walk or cycle – which is most of the time – I’m not adding to air pollution and congestion. That’s not an act of “culture war”, it’s a positive choice to make things better. And I think you might find that people who ride bikes are more likely to recycle and be more aware of wider environmental and wider social issues. I wear hi-vis clothing, and light up my bike like the proverbial Christmas tree – to be safe and be seen. There may be reactionaries out there who don’t like the freedom that cycling represents – so what? I suspect it’s because they resent our lifestyles and will find any excuse to complain. I wonder how long it’ll be before we hear a complaint about hi-vis riders with bike lights that are too bright! Jeremy Iles Director, Green Future Associates CIC • Your editorial states that pedestrians are statistically more likely to be killed on the road than cyclists. However, this is only true if, like the Department for Transport, you compare fatalities with miles travelled. Bike journeys are typically longer than by foot. Perhaps a better indication of relative risk is to compare fatalities with time spent travelling. When The European Transport Safety Council looked at this measure across Europe, it found that cyclists were three times as likely to be killed as pedestrians. Incidentally, motorists were as likely to die as pedestrians per hour of travelling time, with motorcyclists 17 times more likely. This probably chimes with most people’s perception.

In an article for the Players’ Tribune, the Cleveland Cavaliers star said he suffered the attack during a game against the Atlanta Hawks in November. “I was having trouble catching my breath,” wrote Love. “It’s hard to describe, but everything was spinning, like my brain was trying to climb out of my head. The air felt thick and heavy. My mouth was like chalk. I remember our assistant coach yelling something about a defensive set. I nodded, but I didn’t hear much of what he said. By that point, I was freaking out. When I got up to walk out of the huddle, I knew I couldn’t reenter the game – like, literally couldn’t do it physically. “Coach Lue came up to me. I think he could sense something was wrong and blurted something like, ‘I’ll be right back,’ and I ran back to the locker room ... The next part was a blur. Someone from the Cavs accompanied me to the Cleveland Clinic. They ran a bunch of tests. Everything seemed to check out, which was a relief. But I remember leaving the hospital thinking, ‘Wait ... then what the hell just happened?’” Love said he has since started seeing a therapist and was afraid to reveal his story out of fear of being seen as “weak or weird or somehow less reliable as a team-mate.” The 29-year-old, who won the NBA title with the Cavs in 2016, said he had been inspired to talk about the panic attack after the Toronto Raptors’ DeMar DeRozan discussed his struggles with depression last week. “I’ve played against DeMar for years, but I never could’ve guessed that he was struggling with anything,” said Love. “It really makes you think about how we are all walking around with experiences and struggles... and we sometimes think we’re the only ones going through them. The reality is that we probably have a lot in common with what our friends and colleagues and neighbors are dealing with. So I’m not saying everyone should share all their deepest secrets – not everything should be public and it’s every person’s choice. But creating a better environment for talking about mental health … that’s where we need to get to.” It is unclear whether the panic attacks had anything to do with an incident in January when Love left a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder with an unspecified illness. ESPN reported at the time that several Cavaliers players doubted the veracity of Love’s reasons for leaving the game. Love has been sidelined since the end of January with a broken hand but is expected to return in the next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/09/grenfell-tower-uk-may-have-breached-human-rights-says-un","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T16:07:36Z","webTitle":"UK may have breached human rights over Grenfell Tower, says UN","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/09/grenfell-tower-uk-may-have-breached-human-rights-says-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/09/grenfell-tower-uk-may-have-breached-human-rights-says-un","fields":{"headline":"UK may have breached human rights over Grenfell Tower, says UN","bodyText":"The UK government may have failed to comply with its international human rights obligations over the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people and left hundreds homeless, the United Nations’ housing investigator has said. Leilani Farha, the UN special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, told the Guardian she was concerned that international human rights standards on housing safety may have been breached, and could have been a factor in the causes of the tragedy last June. She was concerned that residents had told her they had been excluded from decisions about housing safety issues before the fire and had not been engaged “in a meaningful way” by the authorities about their views and needs in its aftermath. Farha, a Canadian lawyer and the UN’s unpaid housing investigator since 2014, was in London this week on an informal visit to meet Grenfell survivors and local residents, at the invitation of human rights law academics and activists. She said she had been struck by survivors’ “feelings of not being heard, of feeling invisible, and not being treated like equal human beings”. “I’m concerned when I have residents saying to me they feel they are not being heard and that they are not always being treated like human beings. Those are the fundamentals of human rights: voice, dignity, and participation in solutions to their own situations.” Safety standards in the tower – from the types of cladding used on the building to electrical circuits and ease of access to the building for fire and rescue vehicles – may have breached residents’ human rights to safe and secure housing, she said. Although she did not meet ministers this week – a meeting with the housing secretary, Sajid Javid, could not be scheduled – Farha said she was keen to start a conversation with them and has not ruled out writing a formal letter to the UK government setting out her concerns. The government faces increasing criticism from survivors’ groups, residents and local politicians over what they feel is an unrepresentative and overly rigid official inquiry, headed by the retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick. Farha, who said her visit was not to make a formal assessment of Grenfell, said she was concerned that survivors and local residents had been stereotyped and discriminated against on the basis that they lived in social housing. This meant they may have been treated less as people with human rights, and more as objects of charity. “Residents told me they feel the government’s position is that they should feel lucky that they are going to be rehoused and that they should feel lucky that they had social housing. That doesn’t suggest residents feel the government recognises them as rights holders. “The fact that so many residents have said to me they are not being treated as human beings is suggestive of a society that is structured in a way where those in social housing are viewed perhaps as counting less. And that is deeply troubling.” Farha questioned whether this may have influenced the decision to fit the tower with cheaper cladding that turned out to be flammable, reportedly to save £300,000. “If the population wasn’t viewed as somehow undeserving, as really lucky to receive the benevolence of state support for housing, if they were viewed as rights holders, I just wonder if that same decision would have been made,” she said. Farha has been a persistent critic of what she calls the “financialisation” of housing, by which unregulated global capital is allowed to pour billions into exclusive, hyper-expensive new property developments in cities such as London, excluding local residents from local housing, pushing up rents and and fuelling housing instability. She said it felt symbolic that Grenfell Tower was in Kensington and Chelsea, one of the wealthiest and most socially unequal boroughs in the capital: “My sense is that in London there is an emphasis on the development of property to attract money and wealth to the city. My concern is that is overemphasised, and the standards and wellbeing of tenants in social housing are underemphasised, and that is a structural issue.” She added: “Social housing is under considerable stress in the city. I’ve heard that many council estates are scheduled for demolition for regeneration projects – which seems to mean the development of high-end properties and the displacement of those living in social housing.” Farha said she did not want to imply the UK government had done nothing in the wake of Grenfell. It had done a great deal, she said. It was important that ministers had set up an inquiry, she said, even if it appeared to be moving slowly and was not as wide in scope as it could have been. However, it was important the government engaged seriously and urgently with survivors and residents – who had struck her by their thoughtfulness, expertise, intelligence, and resourcefulness – and that it investigated the structural causes of the fire. “I don’t deny it is complicated, but lives are at stake. I’m hearing stories of suicidality, children being extremely traumatised. These are the days that will make or break people.” A government spokesperson said: “Grenfell was an awful tragedy that should never have happened and nothing like it should ever be allowed to happen again. In the immediate aftermath of the fire we were clear that the council had failed the residents of Grenfell, and so we have committed to supporting everyone affected in the months and years ahead – including by rehousing residents and offering mental health support. “Had the UN’s special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing approached the government to discuss her concerns we would gladly have met with her to discuss the work we are doing to support the Grenfell community.” In September 2013, Farha’s predecessor as UN housing investigator, Raquel Rolnik, infuriated ministers during a formal visit to the UK when she called for the abolition of the bedroom tax on the grounds that it violated tenants’ human rights. Rolnik warned that Britain’s relatively good record on housing rights was being eroded by the sell-off and neglect of social housing, and by welfare reforms that left poorer tenants in poverty and despair. Ministers dismissed her criticisms as a “misleading Marxist diatribe”. Farha said she was aware some may see her as a meddling interloper. “Fair enough. On the other hand, sometimes an outside independent perspective can be really beneficial. I think this government is probably interested in some creative ideas. I would hope they would want everyone involved in Grenfell to land in a good place”. Earlier this week, Theresa May unveiled plans to tackle what she called Britain’s “national housing crisis”. The prime minister promised a freeing up of planning rules, and pleaded with developers to “do their duty to Britain and build the homes our country needs”. • This article was amended on 12 March 2018 to correct the number of people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/12/newham-mayoral-candidate-rokhsana-fiaz-sir-robin-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Newham mayoral hopeful calls for vote on scrapping role","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/12/newham-mayoral-candidate-rokhsana-fiaz-sir-robin-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/12/newham-mayoral-candidate-rokhsana-fiaz-sir-robin-wales","fields":{"headline":"Newham mayoral hopeful calls for vote on scrapping role","bodyText":"A referendum should be held on scrapping the directly elected mayoral system used in the London borough where the Olympics was held, according the woman challenging the capital’s longest-serving council leader for the top job. Rokhsana Fiaz accused Sir Robin Wales, the mayor of Labour-dominated Newham, of presiding over an administration that makes decisions in a restricted circle and excludes community participation in formal council meetings that in some cases have lasted less than 20 minutes. Two thousand Labour members in Newham have until Friday to vote on the party’s mayoral candidate for an election in May. Wales has been the mayor since 2002 and was the council leader from 1995 in a borough where Labour has 59 out of 60 council seats. Fiaz said she would ask residents to vote on whether they wanted to continue with the mayoral system by the end of her first term. “This council is too top-down, too hierarchical. The incumbent to my mind represents the past, a very ossified way of doing things,” she said. The system of directly elected mayors was created under Tony Blair. It was successfully established first in the capital and more recently in Manchester and the West Midlands, but it has not caught on elsewhere. Newham is one of four London boroughs that use the system. At the last election, in 2014, Wales won with 61% of the vote. He has a strong grip on Labour’s East Ham constituency and is backed by the area’s MP, Stephen Timms, and he has compared himself to Sir Alex Ferguson. Under Wales’s leadership there has been significant economic investment in the area around the Olympic park, underpinned by the Westfield shopping centre. He has argued that “things take time to get done”, but Fiaz claimed the regeneration benefits have been uneven, with 24,000 people on the council house waiting list at a time when some newbuild flats near Stratford railway station are on sale for more than £1m. “We have all this development, but residents can’t afford to live in Newham,” she said, addingthat she herself could not easily afford to buy a home in the borough. She also criticised the council for writing off £52m on a loan intended to develop the Olympic Stadium for use by West Ham United, a deal that soured when hoped-for income was not generated. Fiaz has been a councillor since 2014. She previously worked as a television producer in public relations and latterly as an adviser on race before running an interfaith charity, the Maimonides Foundation. She has won support from Momentum, although the grassroots Labour group is not strong in the area, and she has the backing of the West Ham MP, Lyn Brown. Fiaz said she voted for Jeremy Corbyn in both Labour leadership contests, but described herself as “a candidate for everyone, hoping for support from all parts of the party.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/12/six-nations-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T09:53:24Z","webTitle":"Six Nations: talking points from the weekend's action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/12/six-nations-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/12/six-nations-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","fields":{"headline":"Six Nations: talking points from the weekend's action","bodyText":"1) England require dramatic improvement to beat Ireland When the post-match debate centres on whether England were poorer in Murrayfield or Paris, there is definitely trouble at mill. They never looked remotely likely to score the four tries required to retain a mathematical interest in the Six Nations title race and it would have been distinctly rough justice on France had the visitors sneaked home late on in Saint Denis. One or two England players felt afterwards they might have received a penalty for French defenders going off their feet at the final ruck under the posts; it would still not have erased the horrors of the previous 79 minutes. In many ways this was even worse than Edinburgh; until the latter stages, Eddie Jones’s side made barely any consistent attacking headway and will need a dramatic improvement to topple the Grand Slam-chasing Ireland. The last time England lost three Six Nations games on the trot was 12 years ago. Robert Kitson France 22-16 England: England title hopes ended Eddie Jones: England are not learning fast enough 2) France must not let success go to their heads The French fans were a little giddy with success on Saturday night, but then it has been a long time since they saw their team beat anyone but Italy. The head coach, Jacques Brunel, tried to talk everyone down after the match when he spoke at length about the glaring flaws in his team’s performance. Their lineout was a 50-50 proposition and they lost a couple of their own scrums, too. France have not won three games in a row since the group stages of the World Cup, two-and-a-half years back. They will need to sharpen up their set-piece play if they are going to snap that sequence against Wales next weekend. Andy Bull Late rally cannot hide England’s breakdown failure France 22-16 England: how the players rated 3) Ireland are relentless but their defence is suspect Whatever the opinions about Ireland and their method – and there has been curious dissent over the way they play – they make you tackle. This was not quite the record-breaking 256-tackle fest France were put through in round one, but the 190 tackles Scotland had to make is enough to be getting on with in Dublin. Ireland are nothing if not relentless. Another curiosity, though, is the fallibility of their own Andy Farrell-constructed defence. Three home games, seven tries conceded – and they were carved up enough times by Scotland to make that tally seem flattering. Whether England prove the team to exploit this remains to be seen. Michael Aylwin Ireland leave faltering England in their wake Ireland crowned Six Nations champions 4) Scottish flair could come at a heavy price There has been much debate since the win against England about That Pass, some claiming it was not risky at all because it was so accurate, others pointing out that it is the repeated throwing of such passes that is the risky bit – they will not all be so accurate. It is an apt summary of the debate surrounding Scotland. All hail the way they play, but it is risky because everything has to be bang on. They will carry on winning gloriously, but you sense that until they learn to “put their foot on the ball” as well, longer-lasting success will remain elusive. MA Ireland 28-8 Scotland: Stockdale at the double against Scots 5) The best is yet to come from Wales Wales will finish second in the Six Nations for the second time since they last won the title in 2013 if they defeat France in Cardiff on Saturday and England either fail to plunder a bonus-point victory from Ireland or do not overhaul them on points difference. While Wales can point to narrow defeats in Twickenham and Dublin, they are trailing the Irish because, at a time when their gameplan is evolving, they lack the accuracy of the champions. Some of their play against Italy was sublime, passing in contact, running clever support lines and sensing space, but they were also guilty of over-exuberance and conceded too many penalties. Their best is still to come. Paul Rees 6) Italy conked out again Another year in the Six Nations, another case of they came, they saw and they conked out. It is Conor O’Shea’s misfortune that his stint in charge of the Azzurri has come at a time when the overall standard of the championship is rising: even France have hauled themselves off the floor. Italy are improving and in the likes of Matteo Minozzi and Sebastian Negri are candidates for the team of the tournament, something that was the annual preserve of Sergio Parisse, but they are not doing so at a rate to close the gap on the rest, unable to take a firm grip on a match and paying dearly for mistakes. Their Under-20s ended a 20-match losing streak in Colwyn Bay on Friday night to reveal stirrings from below. PR 7) Competitive championship boosting women’s game This was the round that caught the eye when the draw for the women’s competition was made and it did not disappoint. France at home against England in a repeat of last year’s World Cup semi-final always felt like the pick of the fixtures but the fact that 17,434 turned up in Grenoble is a magnificent attendance for a nail-biting win for the home side. The women’s competition only benefits when matches are competitive and, judging by the scorelines, that can be said for the other two fixtures. For Italy to win in Wales and Scotland to triumph in Ireland is proof that while France and England are a cut above at present, competition below them is fierce.

In his statement on Tuesday, which will bring no changes to tax or spending, the budget having been moved to autumn, the chancellor will set out the latest financial and debt figures. It has been reported that he will give a more upbeat assessment. On Sunday Hammond said that although government debt was forecast to start falling, people should not expect an immediate loosening of the purse strings. “There is light at the end of the tunnel, because what we’re about to see is debt starting to fall, after it’s been growing for 17 continuous years. That’s a very important moment for us,” he told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One. “But we are still in the tunnel at the moment. We have to get debt down. We’ve got all sorts of other things we want to do. We’ve taken a balanced approach over the last couple of fiscal events, using the flexibility we had to continue paying down debt but also to provide additional support to our public services.” Hammond warned against too much speculation about what the data from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) announced on Tuesday would show. But he stressed that councils in particular could expect no significant extra money soon. Asked about the anguish among many local authorities, including Conservative-run ones, about the intense pressures from successive cuts since 2010 coupled with rising social care costs, Hammond said ministers were aware of the issue. “Local authorities have done an incredible job in delivering efficiencies, and of course they’re under some pressures – we understand that,” he said. But he set out a timetable in which there would be no significant changes for several years. “I’ll be paving the way in this autumn budget 2018 for a spending review in 2019 which will look at public spending from 2020 onwards, what the total envelope should be, how we allocate it between individual departments and, indeed, local government,” he said. Later, on ITV’s Peston on Sunday, Hammond said the forecast fall in the net debt was “a very important moment”. “The reason this matters is not that getting debt down is some kind of ideological obsession. It matters because a debt of 86% of GDP is just not safe, it doesn’t give us enough resilience,” he said. “We haven’t abolished the economic cycle and we need to be prepared to manage our way through the future economic cycles” But, speaking to Marr, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the idea that the UK economy had turned a corner was incorrect. “Last year, we had the lowest economic growth in the G7 countries, so we shouldn’t be celebrating that. The head of the OBR has said austerity is holding growth back,” he said. Real wages remained below the 2007-8 level, McDonnell said. “This isn’t a matter for celebration. In terms of the deficit, we had a promise by the Conservatives that they would wipe the deficit out completely three years ago.” With austerity, McDonnell argued, the government had simply “shifted the deficit on to the shoulders of NHS managers, on to the shoulders of headteachers, and on to the shoulders of local government leaders”. The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said the UK was “clearly not seeing a recovery”, especially over employment. “The Conservatives are always trying to tell us how well they are doing on the employment figures, but they won’t tell us that over 3 million people are in insecure work, and that real wages are still stagnating,” she told Peston."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/11/russian-spy-attack-nerve-agent-traces-found-in-zizzi-restaurant","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T09:56:23Z","webTitle":"National security council meets to discuss Skripal poisoning response","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/11/russian-spy-attack-nerve-agent-traces-found-in-zizzi-restaurant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/11/russian-spy-attack-nerve-agent-traces-found-in-zizzi-restaurant","fields":{"headline":"National security council meets to discuss Skripal poisoning response","bodyText":"The government’s national security council (NSC) will meet again on Monday morning to discuss the response to events in Salisbury, amid speculation that Theresa May is facing pressure from some of her ministers to take a tougher line against Russia if it is decided the country is behind the attempted murders. Downing Street has publicly declined to say what action might be merited, if any, insisting that nothing can be decided while the police investigation is still ongoing. But the meeting of the NSC – which brings together senior ministers with intelligence and security officials, among others – is expected to see some ministers warn the prime minister that a tougher stance is needed than that seen after the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson – who took a robust line on Russia in the Commons last week – is understood to be pushing for strong action, along with the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond. A government source said the NSC meeting was expected to mark more concerted action over attributing responsibility for events in Salisbury and then deciding on a response. “We’re certainly moving into that stage,” they said. “You can probably expect more concrete decisions than last week over what will happen next.” Meanwhile, a public health warning urging hundreds of people who visited a pub and restaurant where the Russian spy Sergei Skripal may have been poisoned to wash their clothes and possessions has triggered concerns about the speed of official responses to the Salisbury incident. The advice from Public Health England (PHE) released on Sunday morning was aimed at as many as 500 customers who ate at the Zizzi restaurant or were in the Mill pub in the centre of Salisbury last Sunday and Monday. The precautionary guidance reinforces suspicions that the nerve agent used on Skripal and his daughter a week ago was first administered inside the restaurant. Traces of contamination have reportedly been found on and around the table where the two Russians sat. Some of the furniture and other items are said to have been destroyed to prevent further poisonings. Scotland Yard, which is running the investigation, would neither confirm or deny claims of contamination at the restaurant. Police activity was also visible at the nearby Mill pub, where traces of the substance have also been found. The public health notice said that although the risk was very low, repeated contact with clothing or items exposed to the nerve agent could still be a danger. Jenny Harries, PHE’s regional director for the south of England, told a press conference on Sunday: “We have learned that there has been a limited contamination in both the Mill pub and in Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury.” Asked about the delay in issuing the notice, Harries insisted it had been done in a timely fashion once the contamination was known about. “We work with our colleagues here on a continuous risk-assessment basis,” she said. “When we get new information, we continuously risk-assess groups of people who may have become exposed from the evidence we have in front of us. As new evidence becomes available, we act on that immediately.” Harries said that most people who were at the pub would have already washed the clothes they were wearing. Anyone who suffered symptoms such as nausea or blurred vision was more likely to have flu than be a victim of chemical warfare. She declined to reveal how the Skripals had been given the nerve agent, whether it was in powdered form in their food or dispersed as a liquid spray. Cara Charles-Barks, the chief executive of Salisbury NHS foundation trust, said the two Russians remained in a critical but stable condition. She added that DS Nick Bailey, who was taken ill after attending the scene, was in a serious but stable condition. Kier Pritchard, acting chief constable of Wiltshire police, said Bailey was conscious and engaged with visitors. The PHE statement said: “While there is no immediate health risk to anyone who may have been in either of these locations, it is possible, but unlikely, that any of the substance which has come into contact with clothing or belongings could still be present in minute amounts and therefore contaminate your skin. Over time, repeated skin contact with contaminated items may pose a small risk to health.” It recommended reducing the risks in several ways. The statement said: “Wash the clothing that you were wearing in an ordinary machine using your regular detergent at the temperature recommended for the clothing. Any items which cannot be washed, and which would normally be dry cleaned, should be put in two plastic bags tied at the top and stored safely in your own home. “Wipe personal items such as phones, handbags and other electronic items with cleansing or baby wipes and dispose of the wipes in the bin (ordinary domestic waste disposal). Other items such as jewellery and spectacles, which cannot go in the washing machine or be cleaned with cleansing or baby wipes, should be hand-washed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed with clean, cold water.” Skripal and his daughter ate in the restaurant hours before they were found unconscious last Sunday. On Monday, Wiltshire police said the restaurant, on Castle Street, had been closed as a precaution, and it remains cordoned off. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said police had identified more than 240 witnesses and 200 pieces of evidence. The Ministry of Defence said armed forces personnel would return to Salisbury to assist for a third day on Sunday. Commenting on the latest development, Alastair Hay, professor emeritus of environmental toxicology at Leeds University, said: “The sites may reveal where the agent was administered … It is important to note that nerve agents do degrade in the environment so you want to collect any evidence as soon as possible. Contact with moisture will lead to breakdown of the nerve agent: this is why people having visited the restaurant or pub in question last Sunday afternoon or Monday are being advised to wash their possessions. “The advice to wash belongings is a precautionary measure. If no one has had physical symptoms suggestive of nerve agent contact by now it is unlikely that they are a risk.” Different nerve agents decay at different rates, he added. Sarin breaks down more rapidly whereas VX is more persistent. Although the unusual nerve agent used in Salisbury has been identified by chemical weapons experts, its name and chemical composition has not yet been made public."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/12/patient-safety-getting-worse-say-two-thirds-of-nhs-doctors","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Patient safety getting worse, say two-thirds of NHS doctors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/12/patient-safety-getting-worse-say-two-thirds-of-nhs-doctors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/12/patient-safety-getting-worse-say-two-thirds-of-nhs-doctors","fields":{"headline":"Patient safety getting worse, say two-thirds of NHS doctors","bodyText":"Nearly two-thirds of doctors believe patient safety has deteriorated over the past year and nine out of 10 have experienced staff shortages, a survey of 1,500 NHS consultant physicians in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has revealed. The Royal College of Physicians (RCP), which carried out the study, said the results exposed a health system “pushed to its limit” in which doctors felt they could not deliver what was asked of them. One told researchers: “We are not robots, we are human beings with limits.” Another said: “I cried on my drive home because I am so frustrated and distraught at the substandard care we are delivering.” According to the study, 80% of those asked said they were worried about the ability of their service to deliver safe patient care in the next 12 months and 84% believed the workforce was demoralised by the increasing pressures on the NHS. By all but one measure, doctors said conditions were worse than last year. In positive news, there was a reduction in the number of doctors experiencing delays in patients being transferred from their care. “It is extremely worrying and depressing that our doctors have experienced an even worse winter than last year, particularly when so much effort was put into forward planning and cancelling elective procedures to enable us to cope better,” said the RCP’s president, Prof Jane Dacre. “We simply cannot go through this again. It is not as if the situation was either new or unexpected. As the NHS reaches 70, our patients deserve better. Somehow, we need to move faster towards a better resourced, adequately staffed NHS during 2018 or it will happen again.” The RCP proposed relaxing visa restrictions for health workers, making more money available to match growing patient need, including in social care, and more investment in public health initiatives that reduce demand. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, backed the recommendations made in the report. She said: “We have huge empathy with our hospital colleagues, and we know that GPs around the UK would echo their sentiments around increasing workload and concerns for patient safety.” A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We are absolutely committed to making the NHS the safest healthcare system in the world, and more staff would now recommend their care to family and friends than ever before. “We know the NHS is busy, that’s why we supported it this winter with an additional £437m of funding, and gave it top priority in the recent budget with an extra £2.8bn allocated over the next two years.” The value of NHS hospitals treating private patients has been questioned in a separate report, which reveals that, far from generating extra cash, several hospitals have lost millions of pounds. According to thinktank the Centre for Health and the Public Interest, private treatment was expected to become a significant source of income for NHS hospital trusts after the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. But nine hospital trusts have lost money, in one case £18m over six years, and others have racked up bad debts from non-payment running into millions. About 1,140 beds across 90 hospitals are set aside for private patients, the report stated. “Could they have made a difference to the many patients waiting hours for treatment in recent months had they been available for NHS care?” asked Dr Sarah Walpole, the report’s author. “It is not possible to say whether the NHS benefits financially from devoting resources to the treatment of private patients.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/11/man-dies-after-being-restrained-by-police-in-london-arrest","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T05:47:21Z","webTitle":"Man dies after being restrained by police in London arrest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/11/man-dies-after-being-restrained-by-police-in-london-arrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/11/man-dies-after-being-restrained-by-police-in-london-arrest","fields":{"headline":"Man dies after being restrained by police in London arrest","bodyText":"England’s police watchdog has begun an investigation into the death of a man who died after being restrained. Scotland Yard said police were called on Friday afternoon to Polsted Road in Lewisham, south-east London, where a man was trying to get into the rear gardens of homes.

The man was restrained at the scene, the IOPC said, then an ambulance was called and paramedics had arrived by the time he became unwell. He was taken by ambulance to Lewisham hospital where he died. His next of kin were informed and a post-mortem was pending.

Yours, still – just – affectionately … My response Thank you for taking the time to write to me on 21 February. You do not say why it is that you feel the Guardian is diminished and you are sad, but that statement alone is cause for concern, especially because you also refer to having taken many years of pleasure from the Guardian. Having reached the age of 96, that’s a lot of pleasure. Your age, and your willingness to express your concerns in writing, indicate that there must be significant reasons for your current feeling. I cannot respond meaningfully in any detail to your brief note, but I want you to know that you have been heard. I am enclosing a recent speech by the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. I hope that as you reflect on what she said you will again have cause to turn from just liking the Guardian still, as you put it, to loving it again. It has a fine tradition, and a person of your age is in a position to put the value of any institution into a long and considered perspective. I often watch my father do the same. He has just turned 95. With best regards … Her reply Thank you for your kind and thoughtful letter in reply to my flippant one. I think that if I had written it a few weeks earlier you would have stashed it away with all the others objecting to your going tabloid, because that’s all I meant by “diminished”. I am pleased to have a copy of Katharine Viner’s speech with its history of the Guardian and hopes for the future. The Guardian is a brave and trustworthy paper and I love it. Whether I like its format is quite piffling. I could not do without it. A letter from the Guardian – “There’s glory for you.” I shall keep it, thank you. Yours sincerely … PS Seriously, there is so much in the world to be really sad about and at home I am still waiting for another government like Attlee’s.

This weekend people in Bradford, Leicester, London, Cardiff and Sheffield reported receiving the notes, printed on A4 paper. The letters say 3 April will be “Punish a Muslim Day” and points will be awarded for certain acts of violence – from 25 points for removing a woman’s headscarf to 500 points for murdering a Muslim. “Are you a sheep like the vast majority of the population?” the letter reads. “Sheep follow orders and are easily led. They are allowing the white-majority nations of Europe and north America to become overrun by those who would like nothing more than to do us harm and to turn our democracies into sharia-led police states.” Counter Terrorism Policing North East said it had received reports of “potentially malicious communications sent to individuals across the UK”. “[We] are coordinating the investigation at this time and will consider any potential links to existing inquiries. Anyone with any concerns about a communication they may have received should contact their local police force,” a spokesperson said. Naz Shah, the MP for Bradford West, said some people in her constituency had received the letter. “Understandably this is very distressful, not only [for] those who have received the letter but also for the wider communities,” she said in a statement on Facebook. “I would appeal to the wider community to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the police.” Iman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, which monitors anti-Muslim activity, said the letters had “caused quite a lot of fear within the community”. “They are asking if they are safe, if their children are safe to play outdoors. We have told them to keep calm and to phone the police if they receive one of these letters,” she said. The group said it was essential that all letters and envelopes were “kept and handled minimally” to preserve evidence for the police to investigate. “Incidents like this are rare, but we urge vigilance and calm as we remind Muslim communities that our confidential support service is available to assist in this matter,” it said in a statement. A number of the letters appear to have been sent from the Sheffield area. The assistant chief constable of South Yorkshire police, Tim Forber, confirmed there had been three reports of letters received in the region. “These communications are extremely distressing and we appreciate that members of our communities will be very concerned,” he said. “I can assure you that these documents are being taken extremely seriously and a thorough investigation into the circumstances is under way. “Hate crime in any form will not be tolerated and we will work with our communities and alongside our colleagues in the counter-terrorism unit to ensure that those spreading fear and hatred will be brought to justice.” Riaz Ahmed, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Bradford, told the Yorkshire Post he had received the letter at his business address. “It was not addressed to anyone, just the address and postcode as if it was sent out randomly,” he said. “It has a second-class stamp on the plain white envelope and the frank mark is Sheffield. It was posted yesterday. It seems strange that anyone would send something like this to an address in a predominantly Muslim area. When I opened it and saw the content, I was horrified.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/11/us-navy-carriers-vietnam-visit-signals-closer-ties-amid-china-tensions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T12:05:46Z","webTitle":"US navy carrier's Vietnam visit signals closer ties amid China tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/11/us-navy-carriers-vietnam-visit-signals-closer-ties-amid-china-tensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/11/us-navy-carriers-vietnam-visit-signals-closer-ties-amid-china-tensions","fields":{"headline":"US navy carrier's Vietnam visit signals closer ties amid China tensions","bodyText":"Thousands of sailors from a US navy carrier and two escort vessels have taken part in a charm offensive while on a port call to the Vietnamese coastal city of Da Nang, in the largest US troop presence in the country since the war ended in 1975. In a classroom on the outskirts of the city, uniformed navy sailors played rock and country classics for dozens of enthralled children who had disabilities that have been blamed on the Agent Orange sprayed by the US military during the war. After the performance, more sailors arrived for some arts and crafts. Cooks from the USS Carl Vinson visited local restaurants to learn Vietnamese recipes, and the US naval band performed songs from the war-era Vietnamese composer Trinh Cong Son. Dignitaries from both the US navy and the Vietnamese government lauded the visit as a sign of budding friendship between the two former foes, but looming over the fun, lighthearted atmosphere of the week was the question of China. Although geopolitical issues were largely left unspoken, analysts said the trip largely stemmed from anxieties over a millennia-old rivalry between Vietnam and its northern neighbour. Nguyen Chi Tuyen, a dissident blogger from Hanoi also known by his pen name Anh Chi, said the Vietnamese people welcomed US military engagement with “our hearts and minds”. He said opposition to China was deeply embedded in Vietnam’s national identity, with the South China Sea dispute only the most recent in a line of conflicts stretching back to China’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, in the third century BC. China claims almost all the South China Sea, including waters internationally recognised as Vietnam’s. The two countries fought a series of bloody skirmishes over the sea’s islands in the 1970s and 80s, with the last occurring in 1988. Tuyen is no fan Vietnam’s single-party communist state, which bans dissent. He has been arrested several times and was once beaten by thugs who he suspects were working for the secret police. But he said most anti-government activists supported the Carl Vinson’s arrival. They also want American arms sales to Vietnam, which were legalised in 2016 when Barack Obama lifted a weapons embargo that had been in place since the war. Tuyen said that shortly before the embargo was lifted, Senator John McCain, a longtime advocate of close bilateral ties, asked him and three other dissidents at a private meeting in Hanoi whether the move would damage the human rights situation in Vietnam. All four told McCain the US should go through with sales, said Tuyen. “We know about the threat that if the US government lifts the ban, they can use them against the activists and the people,” he said. “But we think it is much more important than our own security that if the US government lifts the ban, Vietnam … can use the weapons to defend our own country.” Carl Thayer, an emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales and an expert on south-east Asia, said the Vietnamese government considered the Carl Vinson’s docking to be a balancing act between powers. “The visit of the USS Carl Vinson does not signal that Vietnam is moving into the US orbit to oppose China. It signals that as trust has developed between Vietnam and the United States, the leaders in Hanoi are comfortable with a step up in naval engagement with the United States,” he said. But Le Dang Doanh, a former economic adviser to the government and a Communist party member, said Hanoi felt its hand was being forced. “It is Beijing that has pushed Vietnam closer to the US more than Washington has come closer to Vietnam.” He said he was anxious about whether the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who recently changed China’s constitution to abolish term limits, would use force against Vietnam as a show of strength. China’ss former leader Deng Xiaoping ordered the 1979 invasion of Vietnam shortly after consolidating power, Doanh pointed out. “I don’t know how Mr Xi Jinping will demonstrate his power, we need to pay high attention,” he said. Would Vietnam would ever abandon its non-alignment policy and become a US ally? “It’s not sure [if there could be an alliance], but it’s certainly not their last visit,” said Doanh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/11/labour-mps-should-not-appear-on-russia-today-says-john-mcdonnell","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T11:15:13Z","webTitle":"Labour MPs should not appear on Russia Today, says John McDonnell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/11/labour-mps-should-not-appear-on-russia-today-says-john-mcdonnell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/11/labour-mps-should-not-appear-on-russia-today-says-john-mcdonnell","fields":{"headline":"Labour MPs should not appear on Russia Today, says John McDonnell","bodyText":"John McDonnell has said Labour MPs should no longer appear on RT, formerly Russia Today, in the wake of the nerve agent attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal. The shadow chancellor is one of a number of MPs, both Labour and Conservative, who have appeared on the Kremlin-funded channel in the past but on Sunday he said he would not do so again and would urge his party colleagues to follow suit. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has said it is too early to say who is responsible for the attack on Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, but with fingers pointing at the Kremlin, UK politicians are coming under increasing pressure to stand up to Russia. Asked on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show whether one way of doing that was to stop appearing on RT, McDonnell said: “I think that’s right now and that’s what I’ll be doing … because what we’re seeing from Russia Today at times goes beyond objective journalism.” RT, which interviewed Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 when he was campaigning for the Labour leadership, has long been denounced as a propaganda tool of the Russian state, but McDonnell said there had previously been legitimate reasons to appear on its shows. Asked whether all Labour MPs should refrain from accepting invitations from the broadcaster, he said: “I have been looking overnight at some of what’s happening in terms of the change in coverage on Russian television in particular and I think we have to step back now. “I can understand why people have [appeared on RT] up until now because we have treated it like every other television station. We tried to be fair with them and as long as they abide by journalistic standards that are objective that’s fine but it looks as if they have gone beyond that line, so yes, we will have that discussion.” In October last year the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said it was “an absolute scandal” that Labour MPs had given interviews to RT, seemingly ignorant that some of his Conservative colleagues had also done so. Analysis of the Commons register of interests published in November showed that over the previous 24 months at least 10 MPs were paid for appearing on RT, receiving up to £1,000 an hour. The Labour MPs David Lammy and Rosie Duffield were among those named, as were the Tory MPs David Davies, Mike Freer, Johnny Mercer and Nigel Evans. McDonnell and Corbyn were not on the list. McDonnell’s deputy, Peter Dowd, said he has appeared on RT on a number of occasions, including in a programme broadcast at the start of last week. “In light of the events … of course we will undertake a review of what we do in regards to these, as you will always do in these sorts of circumstances,” he told Sky’s Sunday with Paterson. “But I have to emphasise that what I try to do is to come on to television programmes like this and answer the questions that are put to me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/12/zombie-boy-sculpture-rick-genest-marc-quinn-science-museum","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Zombie Boy sculpture will greet visitors to Science Museum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/12/zombie-boy-sculpture-rick-genest-marc-quinn-science-museum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/12/zombie-boy-sculpture-rick-genest-marc-quinn-science-museum","fields":{"headline":"Zombie Boy sculpture will greet visitors to Science Museum","bodyText":"Marc Quinn, the artist best known for freezing 10 pints of his own blood in a bust of his head, is to create a giant sculpture of a tattooed man known as Zombie Boy to permanently greet visitors to new galleries at the Science Museum in London. Zombie Boy is Rick Genest, a Canadian artist and model who, after a period of illness, decided to cover himself head to foot with tattoos of the inside of his body. He has developed something of a cult following thanks to his appearing in Lady Gaga’s Born This Way video, on the fashion designer Thierry Mugler’s catwalk, in the film 47 Ronin and on BBC One’s Silent Witness. From next year the recognition will surely increase as a 3.5-metre bronze sculpture of Genest will be one of the first things seen in the new £24m medicine galleries at the Science Museum. It is a bold commission. Is Zombie Boy not slightly terrifying? “I don’t find him scary at all,” said Quinn. “I find him rather amazing. He is an artist. His artwork is himself and let’s face it, he does look pretty cool.” Quinn said Genest was “a brilliant crossing point between street culture and science and art” and a man who had, to his credit, literalised a quest to understand his own body. The artist first made a sculpture of Genest in 2010, part of an ongoing series titled Body Alteration in which Quinn made sculptures of people who used what might be seen as extreme methods to alter their bodies. “When I did the show in 2010 people in the art world were scoffing, saying: ‘Oh God, it’s so sensationalist, how can you do these terrible people?’” Now, Quinn said, this difference was being rightly embraced. “I think that ‘marginal’ has become mainstream. Not having a tattoo is now quite unusual.” Having said that, Genest, who has more than 90% of his body covered in tattoos, has gone a lot further than almost anyone else. “It is extreme, but there has not been an eyelid batted here about having him in the Science Museum – in the anatomy gallery where there will be lots of children and young people,” said Quinn. “It is completely fine. As it should be. It wouldn’t have happened 10 years ago, I don’t think.” Ian Blatchford, director of the Science Museum and fan of Quinn’s work, said the sculpture of Genest made total sense for the new galleries. “You may say why would a man do this to his body? I say to people, just remember, for all that medicine does to cure us it is still our body. If he chooses to celebrate his survival there is something noble and interesting about that.” He said he does not think visitors will be scared and in any event “our visitors come here wanting to be surprised”. Quinn is known for creating challenging, monumental sculptures. Notable examples include Alison Lapper Pregnant, which appeared on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, of an artist who was born without arms and with shortened legs; and Planet, a giant white sculpture of his baby son that is now permanently installed in the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. He said the Science Museum was one of his favourite museums in London and one that he had been visiting since he was a child. “The museum is a mixture of knowledge, art and wonder. I hope that this sculpture will add to all three of these elements.” Quinn said it would take at least a year to create the bronze sculpture, titled Self-Conscious Gene. It will be ready for what Blatchford said would be “the greatest medical history museum in the world” when the new galleries open in the autumn of 2019. Covering more than 3,000 sq metres, more than 2,500 medical artefacts spanning 500 years – including a 1930s padded cell and an interactive Victorian pharmacy – will go on display in the new galleries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/12/nrl-blake-green-brings-calm-rugby-league-to-free-up-warriors-stars","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T17:00:35Z","webTitle":"NRL: Blake Green brings calm rugby league to free up Warriors' stars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/12/nrl-blake-green-brings-calm-rugby-league-to-free-up-warriors-stars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/12/nrl-blake-green-brings-calm-rugby-league-to-free-up-warriors-stars","fields":{"headline":"NRL: Blake Green brings calm rugby league to free up Warriors' stars","bodyText":"Ben Hunt will be great for the Dragons, Cooper Cronk the same for the Roosters, and Mitchell Pearce has given Newcastle Knights fans reason to believe. New five-eighth Josh Reynolds will bring his patented froth-and-bother passion play to Wests Tigers, while Kieran Foran may approach the form of not many years ago, when he was among the best players in this National Rugby League. Yet perhaps the most influential recruit could the new man at New Zealand Warriors, the unassuming, even journeyman, Blake Green – and not because he’s not adept or skilful or tough, because he most definitely has game. It’s because, as a calm, “guiding” ball-player and man-mover among a typically talented, if skittish group of circus performers, Green frees up the mercurial halfback Shaun Johnson to do what he does best: run free like the buffalo. Rugby league’s halves usually feature a “controlling” halfback who complements a “running” five-eighth. Both men will have ability to pass, kick and run, but it’s normally the No7 who’s the quarterback-style player, while the No6 runs like the fullback he could be, as the liquid moves of Moses Mbye would attest. The Warriors have turned the paradigm around. Against the Rabbitohs on Saturday afternoon, on a hard and fast surface at a crackerjack new stadium in Perth, we saw halfback “magic” Johnson run the Bunnies ragged. The man can really move. There’s shades of the great Greg “Brandy” Alexander about him: dummies, ball-play, a chip-and-chase; but mostly he runs and steps and scythes. When Magic runs, magic happens. And he tore them up. He did so on a platform built by Green. Green did the “boring” stuff: kicking, passing, instructing, man-motivating; the general-ship required of the modern day ringmaster. It freed Johnson up to take on the Souths pigs and dazzle them with his flashy feet. Against Johnson they turned lumbering bovine. Johnson ignited the Warriors’ first try with a towering bomb. He created their second when his speed made an overlap. A minute to half-time, he ran on the fifth and shredded ‘em, beat five Bunnies and passed in the tackle to David Fusitua who did plenty to score. Yet while Green might be the grubber man, the link man, the pop-the-short-ball-to-the-giant-man man, he’s not without skill. His well-timed flat ball to Sam Lisone forced Adam Reynolds to commit to a decoy and see the Steeden flash in front of his eyes and “try” flash up on the board. He fed Roger Tuivasa-Sheck ball in space that kick-started the next try. He also switched the play back to Johnson who found Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, who in turn found the nuggetty Solomona Kata who crashed through many men. Yet Green’s best, most instructive play came in a set in which he didn’t touch the ball. Up 30-10 with 25 minutes to play, the Warriors won a penalty, thirty metres out from the Rabbitohs’ line. Their big men verily snorted their excitement, so eager were they to get the ball and cart it up hard, step and offload, charge in, and continue the rampant, harum-scarum fun. They wanted to party. Green then moved within earshot of these play-and hay-makers, raised a hand above his head, and mouthed words to the effect of: Calm the hell down. Let’s go through the motions. Let’s keep our heads. Let’s not throw anything out our arse. Let’s play out a good, solid, professional, hard-edged set of six. And so it came to pass. Crash-crash-crash. On the fourth and fifth they threw it about, took on the line. But they’d set a platform – it was Green that built that, too. And so the Warriors rent asunder the blunder-Bunnies of South Sydney. Sure, it’s only round one and Souths aren’t likely to set the world of league afire. And this is the Warriors. But there was plenty to like about their footy in this fixture. The Warriors have always featured among the most talented players in the game. But they’ve not always been the best footballers – their heads have not always matched their hearts. Ball control and not-being-overly-penalised remain works in progress. A footballer’s maturity comes when he knows the time to die with the ball in the tackle, and the time to throw one-handed ball over his head. Now they’ve recruited a man who’ll tell them. And he’ll set an example of super-solid, mistake-free, effective rugby league. In doing so, he’ll free up their superstars."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/12/poll-of-malcolm-turnbulls-electorate-finds-75-back-review-of-adani-approval","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"Poll of Malcolm Turnbull's electorate finds 75% back review of Adani approval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/12/poll-of-malcolm-turnbulls-electorate-finds-75-back-review-of-adani-approval","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/12/poll-of-malcolm-turnbulls-electorate-finds-75-back-review-of-adani-approval","fields":{"headline":"Poll of Malcolm Turnbull's electorate finds 75% back review of Adani approval","bodyText":"More than 75% of voters in Malcolm Turnbull’s Sydney electorate of Wentworth would support reviewing the environmental approvals for the controversial Queensland Adani coalmine, according to a new opinion poll. A ReachTel survey of 676 residents in the prime minister’s electorate, commissioned by the progressive thinktank, the Australia Institute, found an emphatic majority favoured a review of the project approvals, including 70% of Liberal voters. The byelection in the Melbourne seat of Batman is now in its final week, and opposition to the mine is a significant issue in the head-to-head contest between Labor and the Greens. While the focus in recent weeks has been on Labor, and Bill Shorten’s shifting position on the Queensland project, the new poll underscores the fact the mine proposal remains unpopular in inner city electorates around the country, creating political problems for both major parties, given third-party activist groups are running a significant campaign against it. Even geographically closer to the project, in the marginal Liberal-held electorate of Brisbane, 59% of a sample of 747 voters supported a review of Adani’s environmental approvals, including 48.6% of LNP voters. “Adani isn’t just a potent issue in Batman,” said Ebony Bennett, the thinktank’s deputy director. “It’s an issue on the government and the prime minister’s plate right now.” Voters in both Liberal-held electorates were also asked questions about the future of coal, including whether mining and burning coal made the symptoms of global warming worse. A majority voters in Turnbull’s electorate, 64.7%, agreed with the statement: “Australia must halt the expansion of coalmining and fast-track building wind and solar power and storage in order to effectively reduce the worsening impacts of climate change” – including 54.2% of Liberal voters. Just over 70% of Wentworth voters agreed with the statement: “The mining and burning of coal fuels global warming impacts such as heatwaves, bushfires, floods, droughts and more severe and frequent storms” – including 62% of Liberal voters. A clear majority of all voters and Liberal voters also favoured the adoption of a new rule to stop government agencies from putting taxpayer funds into coalmining projects. “Most agree that Australia must halt the expansion of coalmining and fast-track building renewables and storage to reduce the worsening impacts of climate change,” Bennett said. “The economic case for the Adani mine is weak. The banks know it, the voters know it and that’s likely why most voters oppose giving taxpayers’ money to support coal projects like Adani’s proposed mine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/11/rangers-v-celtic-scottish-premiership-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T13:59:33Z","webTitle":"Rangers v Celtic: Scottish Premiership – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/11/rangers-v-celtic-scottish-premiership-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/11/rangers-v-celtic-scottish-premiership-live","fields":{"headline":"Rangers v Celtic: Scottish Premiership – as it happened","bodyText":"Read Ewan Murray’s match report: Anyway, thanks for your company – enjoy the rest of your weekend. And in the meantime, join Will Unwin for Arsenal - Watford. That was fantastic. A game of pace, aggression, attitude and skill – along with plenty of affirming hatred – featuring four great goals, one very good goal, a red card, and a title more or less decided; Celtic are now nine points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand. However, make no mistake: Rangers are on the way back, nurturing a compelling youthfulness and swagger. If they can add some control, they’ll be a serious force next season, What a game that was! 90+4 min Celtic get Edouard on the ball and he teases Tavernier, looking to open that same shooting lane. This time he’s seen away, but wins a corner; that is poised to transition into that. 90+4 min Rangers huff and puff, but to little avail. 90+2 min Tavernier tries another cross and again Celtic clear, breaking with Edouard. Alves can’t help himself, hauling him to the ground and enabling Celtic to waste a few more seconds. 90+1 min Ntcham fouls someone or other and is booked. 90 min We’re going to get four additional minutes. 88 min WHAT A MISS! OH MY DAYS WHAT A MISS! WHAT A MISS, WHAT A MISS, WHAT A MISS! Tavernier slides a pass to Windass, who drives a shot through a phalanx of legs that Bain dives to shove out ... straight to Morelos who, from in front of goal, two yards out, could sneeze it in. But instead he somehow pokes the ball onto the near post and Bain collects the rebound! He’s going to regret that for the rest of his life, which is precisely what football is all about! 87 min Morelos swipes at a ball and sends it towards Tavernier, who scuffs his cross. Rnagers have just lost the heid since going behind - not in wild way but in a don’t know what to do way. 86 min Final change for Celtic: Armstrong replaces Dembele, who has had a quiet, brilliant afternoon: generally not participating but scoring a fine goal and helping to create another. 84 min Rangers win a free-kick, just outside the D, just right of centre, and Tavernier tries a shot but hits it more or less straight at Bain. 83 min Ally Moncrieff makes contact on the subject of tweeting opponent’s goals: 82 min Tavernier again finds Candeias outside him, but the ensuing cross is complete nonsense and Bain will smash his goalkick downfield. 80 min I literally cannot wait to hear Brendan Rodgers affect humility when describing his role in this win - if Celtic do hang on. In that connection, Bain takes ages over a goalkick and is booked. 79 min Rangers are clean out of ideas. They may as well get men forward and whack it into the box because Celtic’s centre-backs aren’t the greatest and nothing else they’re trying is working. 78 min Dembele leaps into Cardoso and wins the header but bashes the man. He’s booked for that and various earlier offences. 77 min What Rangers lack here is a midfielder with authority, able to put a foot on the ball and tell others what they should be doing. 75 min Clubs tweeting out opponent’s goals are my favourite genre of tweet. 74 min Tavernier tricks hiw way down the right and snaps in a cross, but Brown is on hand to intercept and Ntcham completes the clearance. 74 min Rangers replace Goss with Cummings. 72 min If Celtic can hang on here, this win will be branded in the Old Firm annals; coming from behind twice, down to ten men, a sub scoring an immediate and brilliant winner, to more or less confirm yet another title. 71 min Goss volleys Ntcham, which might make him feel a little better for a little while, but not overall. Oh yes! Dembele spreads a fine pass out left to Edouard, who drives at Goss and skips inside him, opening body and angle for a curler; it’s there for all to see, but what a finish it demands ... what a finish it gets, rising into the top corner! Decent change, that. 68 min Crafty Boyata tries to be dead crafty, nipping in front of Morelos to relieve him of possession before he even has it. But he misses and Morelos races away at inside-left, Ajer sliding in as he shoots and Bain doing well to palm away his shot. 67 min The corner comes to nowt. 66 min It’s all Rangers now, and Celtic don’t look especially assured. Tavernier slides a pass out to Candeias, and his cross is beyond everyone but Tierney heads behind anyway. Before the corner is taken, Forrest is replaced by Edouard. 65 min Tavernier nashes down the right and swings in a low cross, which Boyata sees away. 64 min ... but he gets underneath it, larruping well over the top. 63 min Rangers win a free-kick 25 yards out, left of centre ... Windass looks like he fancies this... 62 min Rangers are pushing the pace now; Celtic will have to see this out with one centre-back making just his fourth appearance and the other centre-back being Dedryck Boyata. 60 min So what do Rangers do? Half an hour against ten men, they really ought to win from here, but they’re set up to play on the break. Perhaps another striker would help. 59 min Change for Celtic: Hendry comes on to replace Simunovic, and Rogic is sacrificed. 58 min Andy Walker reckons it was harsh, on what basis I am unsure. Can’t have any complaints about that. It’s possible it was an accident, but it didn’t look much like one to me; his accuracy was unerring and the lino was right there. 56 min Bates has been taken to hospital, we’re told, as Rangers continue giving Celtic’s defenders aggravation in possession. 53 min Rangers are struggling for the first time, unable to put it together when they get the ball away. But they’re now pressing Celtic in their own half, which is a decent ruse. And it works almost immediately, Tavernier finding Candeias and racing inside him to collect a cute return. The ensuing cross earns a corner, which comes to nothing, but that little passage offers a blueprint for how Rangers might play. 52 min Dembele is into this now, and he easily passes Cardoso who has no option but to administer a bodycheck. He’s booked and Celtic have a free-kick, 25 yards out, just left of centre ... Ntcham drives it into the wall. 51 min Again, McGregor gets away down the left, Tavernier not in the same postcode, and opts to cut back a cross to the edge of the box ... but there’s no one around to pick it up. 49 min Morelos is doing an excellent job, a one-man forward line, and he sprints across the width of the pitch, drawing a foul from Brown. Rangers will need behaviour of that ilk to give their defenders a break. 46 min Murphy drives at the Celtic box and slides a pass to Morelos, who is shut down, and immediately Celtic whack it forward, Dembele flicking a lovely touch into the path of McGregor. He streaks away into the box and Docherty seems to pull him back, but the ref sees nothing amiss and he loses control, allowing Celtic to clear. 46 min We go again. Can Rangers give their centre-backs the protection they need? Back come the teams! Half-time email: “Equally capable of scoring or conceding at any given moment,” snarks Simon McMahon. “Who’d have guessed this Celtic side is managed by Brendan Rodgers?” I think he could be a really good manager, if he’d only put his ego away and get someone in to do the bits he’s not so good at. That was a devastatingly brilliant half (of football). Three excellent goals, one very good goal, loads of good play, plenty of hard tackles, and scope for everyone to lose it after the break. Don’t go away! !!!!!! In the right-back position, Brown slams a pass into the channel as Murphy flattens him. Dembele then runs onto the ball, a deft header taking it away from Cardoso as Alves ambles, which allows him to lift a tremendous finish over Foderingham. He’s barely been in the game, which makes that an even more spectacular finish than it was at face value. 45 min There’l be two added minutes. 44 min Tierney drives off the line and towards the box, so Goss slides in to confiscate his legs. Booking, and free-kick Celtic, 25 yards out, far left of centre ... and Alves heads away well. 42 min Before the game, Brendan Rodgers was bigging up himself the options on his bench; I wonder if he’ll dip into them at half-time. His team have the upper hand at the moment, but look vulnerable every time they’re asked to defend. But here they come again, McGregor exchanging passes with Dembele, chucking in a lollipop or two, and driving a low shot through a set of legs and towards the far corner ... Foderingham sees it late, and does really well to shove away. Rangers are getting trampled in midfield at the moment. 40 min Celtic now lead 7-0 in corners, their latest effort causing minor panic when the ball bounces around the box. But Rangers bundle clear, and Celtic must start again. 39 min Rogic drives his cross into the middle, where Dembele has stolen in front of Tavernier. He heads down, but Foderingham dives to shove away, and anyway John was on the line had he been indisposed. 38 min Ntcham floats an outswinger to the back post, where Boyata lurks; the ball would probably have gone out, but Alves concedes the corner to be sure. Nothing comes of it, but Celtic quickly force another. 37 min Forrest attacks the box and inside-right so Docherty shoves him over; free-kick Celtic, 25 yards out... 36 min Candeias finds Morelos down the right and he megs Simunovic before crossing low again. Nothing comes of it, but the Rangers attack is currently far too quick and nasty for the Celtic back-four. 34 min Celtic are pushing again and get the ball to Rogic, 25 yards out. Again he has a shy, low this time, and Foderingham dives on it easily enough. 32 min Lovely from Morelos, slowing down then skinning Boyata on the outside with a change of pace. He drives a low cross across the six-yard box, but nae one is on hand to stick it hame. 30 min The home fans are booncing, and rightly so. This has been a seriously uplifting effort from their team ... though there’s plenty work to be done to translate it into points, never mind “bragging rights”. 29 min Celtic win a corner down the left and try a crafty low one to the near post; Tavernier is alive to it, and Rangers get themselves down the pitch. 28 min This is a brilliant half (of football, for anyone wondering). John pastes down the left again – he is terrific fun – and as the ball arrives into his path, bouncing, he humps a fine cross into the middle. And it passes the various defenders before arriving into the path of Candeias, who keeps head and toes down, driving first-time into the far corner with the help of a minor deflection before losing his mind in appropriate fashion. 24 min Ntcham is beginning to control midfield with his passing, and he drives one out to Forrest which results in a corner. As we wait for it to be taken we see John flying into a challenge earlier in the piece – the ref is doing well to turn the other cheek – and then the corner comes in, won in the air by Ajer ... Simunovic then turns an effort over the top. That was a half-chance. 22 min Celtic knockit about a bit, Ntcham eventually lofting a lovely pass out Forrest on the right. But John is right on him, Rangers break, and he ends up streaking down the line, cutting inside, across the box, and ramming a curler over the top. There’s a really engaging tearaway element to this Rangers side. 20 min Boyata is having an shocker, again hesitating and finding the ball behind him. This time he gets away with it, but Rangers need to pressure him every time he’s close to involved in the game. 18 min Murphy and Candeias make hay down the right, the latter crossing low and hard; Bain does well to dive onto it. 18 min “Covered a Rangers CL game v PSV at Ibrox when Van Nistelrooy was playing for the Dutch side,” tweets Matthew Hirtes. “My ears are still ringing.” The Fabric of football grounds. 16 min I think the pattern of the game is set now. Celtic are on the ball, and Rangers are defending the spaces, with half an eye on breaking viciously. 15 min Not sure I’ve seen a better opening 15 this season, and the handbags aren’t even out yet. 15 min Cardoso replaces Bates. 14 min Bates has been down since the goal - he went over on his ankle in the process of not stopping Rogic equalising. He’s being stretchered off, I’m afraid. 13 min That’s what Rogic is capable off, apparently. More news as I get it. Well! Rogic takes the ball 25 yards out and evades Docherty before unleashing a left-footer which clips Bates and flies past Foderingham! 11 min Back come Rangers! Murphy makes ground down the left then sends Morelos away, but he’s just offside – without good reason. Meanwhile and out of picture, Brown and Alves indulge in a minor scrap. 10 min Ajer goes down the right and swings over a cross at which Foderingham flaps. But Forrest can’t profit as he pursues the loose ball. 8 min Murphy escapes down the left so Brown yanks him down. The free-kick comes ta nothin. 7 min This has been a great start! Tierney advances down the left and finds himself in the box, found by Mtcham’s fine pass. He might shoot ... he should shoot ... but instead squares to nae one. 6 min That goal was exactly what the game needed, and here’s another portion of the same, John scything through McGregor and avoiding a card. 4 min Oh, Dedryck. Boyata makes a horrible error on halfway, out on the left touchline, dawdling in possession as he dreams of purple cranes, furry toilet seats and shimmering diving bells. In the meantime, Windass bursts through him and screeches away, cutting inside and absolutely bassing a rising finish over Bain with inside of his right foot. That was brilliant - he had so long to think about how he was going to finish that, but didn’t think about it at all, simply applying the hammer with minimum fuss and maximum prejudice. 2 min McGregor, preferred to Sinclair, nashes down the left and finds Forrest, but Ajer snuffs him out. 1 min Docherty lofts an aimless one into the box and Simunovic doesn’t deal, giving, Windass a glimmer. But Boyata, back after six weeks away, tidies up. Rangers have started well, but. 1 min Off we go! The referee is a religious affairs teacher, apparently. The players are with us. There’s a fine racket in the ground as Celtic huddle to unspecified purpose. “It wouldn’t be ‘Rivalry Weekend’ without this rivalry...” Er, there’s literally no such thing. In a sense, today’s match is Momentum v Quality. I guess I’m backing Quality, but we’ll have a lot more fun if Momentum can start well. Graham Murty wants his team to be more clinical than they have been in his previous Old Firm games, and to keep their intensity. His team aren’t talking about competing the league, he says, before talking about competing for the league. The kind of thing that NO ONE wants to see at the end of Dundee 0-4 St Johnstone yesterday... Tangentially, are we agreed that Scotland has the greatest vernacular, certainly in the UK and possibly the world? It has been brought to my attention – ma attention – mattenttion – that gadges and radges is Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Feel free to educate me as to the equivalent (at least I know it’s Glesga, not Glesgae). Meanwhile, atmosphere at Ibrox Stadium –the best in Britain, for my money – is building. The main stand is a work of art, and of all the grounds I’ve been to around the world, I’ve never heard one louder than this was before the 2003 Champions League match against Manchester United. A tiny sample size, granted, but people a fair bit older than me concur. Brendan Rodgers says he’s disappointed at having to change his keeper but not worried. He reckons it’s important for his players to stay calm, and he hopes the win; it’s great stuff I can tell you. And here he is yet again. And here he is again, pretending not to be cold. Scott Brown is perhaps the most amusing character in football. Here he is pretending not to be cold. So Rangers are missing Martin and still missing Wallace, Dorrans, Jack, McCrorie and Rossiter, but Murphy and John are good to go. Celtic are without Gordon, Bitton, Griffiths, Hayes, Wallace and the suspended Lustig, but Boyata is back as is Armstrong, who is on the bench. The boy Rodgers remains an ever-present Rangers: Foderingham, Tavernier, Bates, Alves, John, Docherty, Goss, Candeias, Windass, Murphy, Morelos. Subs: Alnwick, Cardoso, Holt, Halliday, Miller, Cummings, Herrera. Celtic: Bain, Ajer, Simunovic, Boyata, Tierney, Brown, Ntcham, Rogic, Forrest, McGregor, Dembélé. Subs: Doohan, Hendry, Musonda, Armstrong, Sinclair, Roberts, Edouard. Bias ref: Willie Collum Loathing, hate, detestation, dislike, distaste, abhorrence, abomination, execration, resentment, aversion, hostility, ill will, ill feeling, bad feeling, enmity, animosity, antagonism, antipathy, bitterness, animus, revulsion, disgust, contempt, repugnance, odium, rancour, disrelish – 27 synonyms for hatred, none of which we’re really meant to feel in real life, all of which mean nothing relative to Rangers v Celtic. You’ve got to love football! So here we are. Rangers are improving – they’ve won their last six games – but more than that, for the first time feel that they are taking on Celtic without asterisks and caveats. Celtic, meanwhile – if they can suppress their sniggers – will point to the league table, which shows that they’re six points clear with a game in hand, and a dispiriting Europa League defeat to Zenit bares no relevance here. But the fact remains that they aren’t playing as well as they were, which is one reason that the Rangers players were excited to draw them in the Cup semis. Whatever happens today, though, and whatever happens when they meet again next month, of one thing we can be sure: fitba is getting back to where it was and football is better off for it.

Queensland is responsible for more tree clearing than the rest of the country combined, so making good on that promise would go a long way to halting Australia’s growing land clearing crisis. But there is reason to doubt the changes introduced by the Palaszczuk government will bring clearing back down to the levels of a decade ago. Most clearing happens free of any regulation The single biggest reason to doubt the impact of the changes is that most clearing in Queensland happens on land that is not regulated by the law the government’s bill proposes to amend. In the three years between 2013 and 2016, almost 1m hectares of native vegetation were bulldozed in Queensland. Analysis by WWF-Australia’s Martin Taylor found almost two thirds of that – 590,785 hectares, or 63.4% – was done on land mapped as “category X” or “exempt”, meaning it is outside the scope of the Vegetation Management Act. The changes announced last week would have stopped hardly any of that clearing. Under the current laws, land is exempt from regulation if it has been cleared at any time since 1989, no matter how important the regrown forest might be for biodiversity or reef water quality. And landholders were able to lock in those exemptions – protecting them from changes to the definition of “exempt” – by asking for an official vegetation map of their property. Once they received that, changes to the definition of exempt land would no longer apply to them. Unsurprisingly, landholders enthusiastically locked in land as exempt, with land clearing consultants and LNP politicians urging them to do so before the new bill was introduced. Official figures, analysed by Taylor for Guardian Australia, show 68% of the land in this category was locked in as exempt from regulation, leaving it free to be cleared at any time. The new laws limit only what land can be declared exempt in the future. And most of the remaining 32% is in areas where almost everything has been cleared and developed anyway – around Brisbane and the Darling Downs. Nevertheless, the state is so big that substantial areas still remain that are not exempt. Previously unregulated regrowth that will now be subject to some level of protection more than triples, from about 500,000 hectares before the new amendment to 1.8m hectares if the amendments pass. Stealth clearing mostly cleaned up Other proposed changes would affect smaller proportions of clearing. The government has moved to shut down “high value agriculture” permits which were introduced by the LNP government, allowing landholders to clear land easily if they say they are doing it for purposes such as growing sugar or creating irrigated pasture to fatten up cows. They allowed some of the biggest land clearing permits in the country, and so became a significant point of tension. But they accounted for a tiny proportion of the clearing in the state. According to analysis by Taylor, high-value agriculture permits were behind less than 4% of the state’s clearing. Of more significance were the “area development codes”, which allowed land owners to self-assess their land and clear for a variety of reasons. Taylor’s analysis of clearing between 2013 and 2016 concluded that about 11% of clearing was done under those codes – about 102,000 hectares. Of that segment, by far the most significant clearing was conducted for the purpose of “thinning”. “Thinning” is a form of clearing allowed without approval in most regions, letting landowners take out up to 75% of the trees in an area. The Queensland government describes it as a way of managing “massive thickening” it says can have adverse effects on the regional ecosystem, and so has presented it as a form of environmental management. “Thinning and appropriate follow-up management can return these thickened areas to a state that is more typical for the regional ecosystem,” the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines has said. But scientists have pointed out many native animals can only live in areas that have not been cleared for 30 years or more. And thinning is commonly used as a way of increasing the productivity of land for cattle grazing. The type of clearing conducted under “thinning” codes has often been hard to distinguish from broadscale clearing, and could be so severe that it was counted as cleared land under state and federal accounting. Satellite images and drone footage have revealed “thinned” areas where very few trees were left. The Queensland government has foreshadowed changes to the thinning codes, but has not guaranteed they will go. A media release said the laws would “require farmers to get approval to thin vegetation,” but the government then released an interim self-assessable code, allowing farmers to continue thinning, although with more oversight required. Self-assessable thinning also lives on in other parts of the legislation, albeit in ways that account for very small areas of clearing. The self-assessable code responsible for the second biggest amount of clearing was one that allowed for “fodder harvesting”. It accounted for 17% of clearing under self-assessable codes, according to Taylor’s analysis. The government has said that will live on, and has released a new code, with some new requirements. But it still allows for bulldozing of significant tracts of land. Reaction from environmental groups Environmental groups that have been campaigning for changes to Queensland land clearing laws have largely welcomed the changes, with some reservations. Having won a significant battle with Queensland Labor, they have been hesitant to be too critical, with several sources saying it was seen as a tactical error to berate the government after it delivered a lot of what they had demanded. The Wilderness Society cautiously described the changes as a “good first step”. Queensland Conservation Council coordinator Tim Seelig called them “an important milestone” and the group said it “strongly welcomed” the changes, but said they would defer judgement until they’ve studied the bill. “We will now need to study the bill in detail, and ensure it delivers the strongest possible protections and meets the policy objectives of ceasing remnant clearing and the destruction of ecologically-important regenerating woodlands,” Seelig said in a statement. WWF called the changes “a major step forward”. WWF conservation director Paul Toni noted the group saw “room to improve the bill” – something he said they would take up with the committee reviewing the bill. The Queensland laws may have wider ramifications, as other states embark on experiments in broadscale clearing. NSW has introduced a variety of self-assessable codes for clearing, mirroring some of those responsible for so much clearing in Queensland. Land-clearing approvals have increased tenfold in the Northern Territory in recent years, and graziers are eagerly eyeing Western Australia for potential developments. If Queensland is able to substantially reduce broadscale clearing, its approach could serve as a blueprint for governments looking to save what is left in their states."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/11/bournemouth-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T17:56:57Z","webTitle":"Bournemouth 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/11/bournemouth-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/11/bournemouth-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Bournemouth 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"So there we go. Bournemouth showed plenty this afternoon, particularly in the first half, and I’m sure they’ll stay up. Spurs, though, played with the confidence of a side which properly rates itself, and eventually their class told. Thanks for your company and comments – sorry I couldn’t use them all – and enjoy what’s left of the weekend. Ta-ra. Excellent from Spurs, who go above Liverpool by a point and now sit third. Bournemouth stay 12th. 90+5 min Spurs enjoy the closing seconds, while Bournemouth do not. 90+3 min This has been a really good effort from Spurs, who lost their best player and talisman when a goal down. Alli, Son and Eriksen have really taken responsibility, while Pochettino made a very good call to bring on Lamela when he could easily have gone for Llorente or Moura. Sissoko trips over the ball 30 yards out, but recovers it in time to roll nicely into the path of Trippier. He caresses a fair cross into the middle but Begovic really should do better than palm towards the back post - where Aurier nods home from an acute angle. 90 min There shall be five additional minutes. 89 min “Nice one Sonny” sing the away fans with all the gusto of a support who’ve happened upon a new tune. Surely it hasn’t taken this long to come up with that? Lewis Cook overruns possession and all it takes is once pass from Eriksen, well inside his own half, to send Son in on goal, at inside-left. Alongside him, Lamela is pounding through the middle so he shapes to roll him in, then drags the ball around the keeper the other way - we don’t see enough keeper roundings these days - then rams a finish high into the net. Great finish, fine player. 87 min Sissoko is basically that kid in the playground who hits puberty first and chases faster and harder than everyone else. He’s already conceded a free-kick. 85 min Alli has hurt himself so is replaced by Sissoko, after taking roughly 69,027 minutes to amble off the pitch, loving each and every one of them individually. 84 min Ball launched towards the box and Ake wins it; Wilson shoves Sanchez and pokes home, but fails to hoodwink Mikey Dean. Oh, you’ve to get up very early in the morning to pull that one off, yes you do. 82 min Francis humps long and Wilson sets off in pursuit; that Alan Parry alters the pitch of his voice tells you how threatening Bournemouth have looked this half, and Lloris collects easily. 81 min Danny-danny Rose has hurt himself, so Kieron Trippikiyay comes on. He goes to right-back, and Aurier steps across to the lleft. 79 min Ibe floats in an absolute dog, and Spurs clear easily. 78 min Spurs are sitting a bit deeper now, but Bournemouth are struggling to use the extra space. But they find Ibe, who darts a clever pass into Wilson; Vertonghen opts to slide in and cede the corner. 76 min Eddie Howe sends on Jermain Defoe for Junior Stanislas; he comes on with a note for Dan Gosling which seems to read “YOUR MUM”. 74 min Nice from Smith, jinking by a couple of men down the left and moving it onto Cook, who squares for Francis. 20 yards out, he has a decent sight of goal, but flings his whole body into a drive which wafts over the top. 72 min Lovely feet from Dembele, three lovely touches in a confined space setting an attack away. Nothing comes of it, and in any case I wonder if his hot streak is over now; at 30, does he still have scope to find the consistency he needs to be a top player? 71 min Rose is coming onto a game, and he weaves forward, rushing the ball into Alli, who finds Son. He shoots and the effort is deflected behind, but the prospect of a corner doesn’t spare him a telling for not having passed. 69 min What kind of player is Dele Alli going to be? He can be great in a free role, but if he’s not scoring or creating, doesn’t contribute much. I’ve always thought that a player with his attitude and physique needs to be involved in the game as much as possible, so should play in midfield. 68 min A double change for Bournemouth: off go Daniels and Mousset, on come Ibe and King. 66 min Lovely from Lamela, beating Stanislas along the by-line then rolling his studs over the ball to take it away from Daniels before prodding against Ake, whose unwitting deflection concedes another corner. It comes to nothing. 64 min Son has, over the last couple of months, progressed from useful accessory to must-have staple. Not many players can play across the front line and fewer still are as two-footed; he now has six in four games, and there he is again, running the channel on the right of the box, stealing a march on Cook and rattling a shot into the near post which Begovic shovels around the post. Spurs have passed it really well this half, showing great composure. Son is involved in the move early, and in the middle when the ball arrives at Alli, loitering on the left of the box. He looks up and picks over a lovely pass, which Son volleys into the ground, a dodgy contact enough to deceive Begovic. 61 min Rose reaches a loose ball before Gosling who, committed to the tackle, has no option but to foul him. He’s booked. 60 min How long till Pochettino makes another change? On the one hand, Spurs are playing pretty well, but on the other another body in the box might help. Do they really need Dembele and Wanyama? 58 min Lovely from Stanislas, nipping the ball away from Aurier, who sells himself for a burton because he simply cannot help it. As 63 defenders rush over to resolve the situation, Stanislas knocks it square to Gosling who, faced with a lunging Rose, drags a low shot wide. 58 min Eriksen plays into Lamela and glides forward, accepting a square pass and immediately whipping a low shot which Begovic saves. 56 min Alli turns up on the left wing, nicking the ball away from Francis who ploughs through him. No foul, reckons Mikey Dean – we don’t see it, but I’m hoping he indicates as much by uncrossing his arms – let’s assume. 54 min Son plays a delicious little pass out to Alli, who lankily saunters inside before feeding a return into the box. As he accepts the ball, Daniels kicks through him and down he goes, but Mikey Dean sees nothing; fair enough in a sense, it probably didn’t hurt much, but it did probably contravene the laws of the game. 53 min Spurs are back to dominating possession, sweeping the ball from right to left via Eriksen and Son. But Rose can’t control his cross on the run, which sails behind. 52 min This is fantastic. Football is the greatest. 50 min Eriksen swings in a cross from the right and Alli shapes to hook it home, but Cook, after reacting slowly, does superbly to insinuate himself between man and ball, his crucial touch allowing Francis to slam clear. 49 min The ballboy who got telt in the first half has an identical twin sat on the opposite touchline. 47 min Bournemouth have started then second half as well as they started the first, and when Sanchez tickles a clearance, Francis puts his foot through it swiping hard; Lloris saves easily enough, and from the resultant corner, curled in by Stanislas, Aurier heads against Ake’s face. The ball flies wide, and Ake stays down for treatment. 46 min Francis curls a long pass into the channel, missed by both Vertonghen and Wilson. But Smith can’t pick it up, and Spurs clear. 46 min Off we pootle once more. Kane has diddled his right angle – possibly the ligaments of. That’s bad news for Spurs, but might be ok news for England, provided it’s not too serious. “Speaking of stepping up, it really feels like Bournemouth is just one top-drawer attacking player away from challenging for European places,” emails Kari Tulinius. “I wasn’t too convinced by them last season, but they seem to have adapted really well this time around, but they need to score more goals.” Easier said than done, but I really like Wilson, who must be a proper aggravation to mark, and Lewis Cook. “Not sure four sub appearances, one goal &amp; two assists makes Moura an inferior player to Lamela,” tweets Mike, “who needed two seasons to ‘settle in’ to his ‘form’, which seems to involve a lot of clumsy fouls and very few goals. Problematic favouritism from MoPo. Is it cos he is Argentinian?!” I very much doubt that. As far as I can see, Lamela leads the press and offers clever passing and balance. Looking at the Kane injury, Begovic’s whole body went through his ankle looking to smother the shot. He’ll be resting up for a while, I shouldn’t wonder. That was a really good half of “Premier League football”. Bournemouth set about Spurs early and their goal reflected the balance of play, but Spurs slowly inched into things and were in the process of improving when Kane went off. They then equalised and more or less dominated thereafter; the second half should be decent. 45 min There’ll be two additional minutes. 45 min Eriksen in low and fast to Lamela, who tees him with a deft touch - the shot scoots wide. 45 min Vertonghen steps forward and misplaces his pass, Wilson snapping into it and heading for the vacated space. But various defenders converge upon him and the danger is averted. 43 min Peter Raleigh is back, and he says: “Fair play, this step certainly doesn’t get to last forever, but I think it can reasonably last longer than it has. Your intro says it is ‘long since time’ that Spurs seriously contended for top honours - so when did that time arrive? Their first season in the top 4? Their second? Maybe this is the reality of modern football, but that seems like it’s permitting them a very small window in which to develop. It’s not as though there aren’t already signs of year-on-year improvement.” Naw, not a reality of modern football, simply that teams generally operate in four-year cycles. In that context, if it’s a season overdue, that’s significant. 41 min Spurs look really confident in possession now, Eriksen doing his best David Silva impression by popping up all over the show. Bournemouth are sitting pretty deep now, rather than engaging the men with the ball. 40 min Wilson is a really good player, and he moves the ball onto Smith, over towards the left from the right flank. But he deices not allow it across his body, the shape of which forces him to sweep wide. 38 min That goal will have shaken Bournemouth, who had been comfortable until that point. But three quick passes can be enough to undo any team. These is a beautifully constructed goal. On the right, Lamela feeds Son, who snaps a pass into Aurier’s stride and suddenly Spurs are around the back for the first time. Immediately, Aurier curls in a low cross between keeper and back four, and Alli cleverly controls a finish for his first goal since Palaeolithic times. He celebrates in the correct manner, goading the home fans via hand cupping ear. 33 min Lamela is stripped and ready, and on he comes. That doesn’t say much for Fernando Llorente, and I’m also surprised that he comes on ahead of Moura, an inferior player but one who might ask Bournemouth a few different and more pertinent questions. 32 min Spurs have Bournemouth pushed back now, but Kane, off to get treatment, slopes down the tunnel! Where’s Vincent Janssen when you need him? Anyway, Eriksen and Aurier combine, the former teeing up the latter to cross, and as the ball drops, Alli swipes at fresh air to widespread mirth. 30 min Kane hurt himself colliding with Begovic, so accepts treatment. In the meantime, here’s Matt loten: “Perhaps one thing Spurs need is more of a ‘Lads, it’s Tottenham’ quality: an almost arrogant self-belief that they are going to go out and dominate a match against inferior opposition. They often turn up against the big teams, but they seem to sleepwalk through the opening months and drop silly points against teams that title winners would swat aside, like they’re threatening to do today. I don’t buy into the theory that they ‘have’ to win a trophy to breed that confidence; I think a few of their players (Eriksen and Alli are prime examples) need to look at Harry Kane, and take heed of his desire to leave his mark on every single match, regardless of the opposition.” I think they have that – what they don’t have is the attacking options that redeem a poor performance, or a first XI quite good enough to beat a good team playing well. 28 min Clever, disguised pass from Son, gently down the line for Alli. He keeps things moving, the ball reaches Aurier, and when his square ball is wayward, Spurs are quick to regain possession. This is much better from them, and when Son finds Eriksen on the right, he curves a clever pass into the middle for Kane to turn home. He’s offside, but the flow of this game has changed. 27 min Son wins Spurs a corner down the left, and when the ball is cleared back to him, a low cross finds Vertonghen. He drags a shot from around his spectacular buttocks, but Daniels flings himself into a challenge which is enough to force him to fire high. 26 min “If Spurs thinks they can afford to let Alderweireld go,” emails Paul Binns, “Wednesday and today is proof that they are deluded. Sanchez has been good but can’t compare to Alderweireld’s commanding composure and organisation.” I doubt Spurs think they can afford to let him go, but that probably isn’t in their control - if a better team, or one with more money make an offer, chances are he’ll take it, and who can blame him? 24 min The game’s gone a little quiet, which might suit both teams. Bournemouth will happily see time elapse in its characteristic style, while Spurs have a chance to find themselves. Feel free to send in any further existentialist thoughts. 22 min “Peter Raleigh and other similar thinking members of the fanbase are the reason we won’t push on,” reckons Alistair Donegan. “Having the sixth-biggest spend and finishing above sixth is nothing to celebrate - winning is. The point is, spend a bit more and we could win it. By celebrating noble failure you’re enabling Levy and ENIC to always, ALWAYS sell us short.” I agree with this, more or less. Of course it’s great to finish above teams with bigger budgets, but that’s not what the competition is there to measure. 21 min We’ve not seen Kane, Eriksen or Alli yet, largely because we’ve barely seen Wanyama or Dembele yet. Bournemouth are giving them very little time or space, while Wilson and Stanislas are sending for Sanchez and Vertonghen. Meanwhile, a ballboy gets a mapolleh for chucking one at Vertonghen’s knees. 19 min “Admittedly, I am an absolute outsider with no investment,” emails Matt Dony, “but I think patience and development are the key necessities for Spurs, for Pochettino as much as anyone else. He rightly gets plaudits as a manager, but he’s still relatively young, and before the Spurs gig hadn’t worked at any great length with players of an Eriksen/Kane sort of quality. He will improve and learn, which will bring more out of his players. The first XI might not be comparable with, say, City, but they are certainly good enough to win a few trophies.” I think that’s fair, provided he keeps the team together. But if the aim is to challenge for the big pots, there’s work that needs doing. 18 min A long ball out to the right finds Wilson, sealing in front of Sanchez, who consolidates his error by selling himself, forcing Rose to foul. He’s booked, but the free-kick from close to the right touchline, is rubbish and Spurs clear. 16 min Spurs knock the ball along the back four before finding Son down the left. He’s really stepped things up this season - perhaps his incremental improvement will obviate the need to sign another winger – and his low cross is decent, but shoved away by Begovic. 14 min Spurs are gently easing themselves into this. 12 min “Why can’t Spurs finish taking THIS step before we start asking why they can’t take the next one?” asks Peter Raleigh. “Spurs have never finished top 4 in consecutive PL seasons before, let alone three in a row as they may do now. I suppose I should be grateful for the rapid promotion to ‘team which ought to be criticised for not winning the league,’ but we’re resolutely 6th in revenue and wage spending, and clearly punching above our weight as it is. An upward trajectory needn’t have reached the very top to be recognised as such.” I think you’re conflating two things here. Obviously they’re doing very well for what they’ve spent, but that’s not really relevant when discussing the need to improve. And how long does this step last? Inferior teams to Spurs have won competitions they’ve been in recently. 10 min “I’m a Spurs fan and am very proud of what the club have achieved in the last few seasons,” emails Mike Rayment. “However there are definitely replaceable players in that first XI. Going forward we’re incredible, it’s the foundations at the back that are questionable. Dier was poor on Wednesday night and Dembele’s form dropped off significantly in the second half when Juve pressed. Man City, Chelsea and Man Utd (the three most successful English clubs of recent years in terms of trophies) aren’t afraid to get rid of players who don’t cut it, Spurs should be the same. The problem for Spurs is that we don’t have the luxury of endless money to replace players on a whim.” Yes, agree with most of that. I wonder if Alli could play in midfield, allowing a proper number 10. And on Dembele, he’s very old for someone still to prove an ability to cut it consistently at the highest level - though a brilliant talent. 8 min Bournemouth have started really well here; Spurs haven’t even started. And though they’re the only side in the league not to lose in 2018, they have yet to win from a losing position this season. No mistakes this time! Smith takes a great touch down the right, back to Rose - he flicks the ball around him, turns, fetches, and crosse on the runs. Meanwhile, in the middle, Sanchez is out of position, Aurier doesn’t call him back, and Stanislas chests down to spank a low drive just inside the far post! 4 min What a miss! Exceptional! Bournemouth break and one pass is all it takes to send Mousset screeching away down the middle, Stanislas alongside. Sanchez is in pursuit so he squares to leave Stanislas a tap-in ... except Lloris does really well to get over and dive in front, forcing a lifted finish ... of which Stanislas gets too much, and the ball bashes the face of the bar! 3 min Today represents a big chance for Danny Rose. There aren’t many places better to play than Spurs, fewer still who want and can afford him, so he may have to stay where he is - in which case he’ll be wanting to nail down a spot in the side. 1 min Christian Eriksen is into the game immediately, prompting around the Bournemouth box. But he’s crowded out and the home team are away. 1 min Bournemouth set us away. Bournemouth huddle, to discuss whether entry to the single market is possible after Brexit. The crowd sing Sweet Caroline. Is Daryl Gurney in attendance? I remember thinking similar about Rio Ferdinand who, towards the end of his career stayed back while Patrice Evra went up and revealed a talent for scoring with headers. The players are ready in the tunnel, tracky tops on and everyfink. Here they come! On the same topic, here’s William Hargreaves: “As a Gooner, I enviously admit they need only to carry on as they are and ensure that spirit grows. Wenger has tenacity, ability to embody the spirit needed to win a trophy. Poch et al will get there soon, I fear.” I’m not sure the team is strong enough not to need strengthening. The question for me is in what position – perhaps alongside Dembele. “In answer to your question,” tweets Mike, “not playing Aurier and playing Moura would be a start! MoPo’s done pretty well, but often seems a bear of little brain, especially his lack of tactical flexibility and defending cheating. His own red card record (13) isn’t inspiring.” Not sure about that last bit – the best side is rarely the cleanest side – and not sure Aurier is the reason Spurs haven’t taken the next step. Eddie Howe explains that Josh King has a neck problem, and hopes that his players will start the game well. Asked about controlling Harry Kane, he explains that “As I always say, when you’re dealing with individual players it’s about the team.” Not sure I’d be so keen to assert ownership of that insight, but there we go. “Is this about character for Spurs today, Tim?” “Yeah, it’s about dusting themselves dahn.” Skill is, of course, entirely irrelevant to this enterprise. Mauricio Pochettino accepts Sky’s commiserations for Spurs’ European exit – it’s a touching moment, I can tell you. He explains that Davies is fatigued but says Rose is ready, and that he’d like his team to improve their position - “the competition does not wait” for them to finish mourning the loss to Juventus. Tim Sherwood is in the Sky studio. I ask this question a lot, because I don’t know the answer, so: what do Spurs need to do take the next step? Their first XI is nailed down with high-quality players, so it’s tricky to advocate replacing any of them. Yet, quite clearly, it’s not been good enough to contest the major prizes, so does Mauricio Pochettino just wait for his younger players to improve sufficiently? Or change something, whether personnel, formation or both? So Bournemouth make one change, Mousset replacing King. Spurs, meanwhile, make three changes from midweek, Trippier, Davies and Dier stepping out to be replaced by Aurier, Rose and Wanyama. Bournemouth (a studied 4-4-1-1): Begovic; Francis, Cook S, Ake, Daniels; Smith, Cook L, Gosling, Stanislas; Mousset, Wilson. Subs: Boruc, Sermon, Arter, Fraser, Ibe, king, Defoe. Tottenham Hotspur (a drilled 4-2-3-1): Lloris; Aurier, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Rose; Wanyama, Dembele; Eriksen, Alli, Son; Kane. Subs: Vorm, Trippier, Dier, Sissoko, Lamela, Moura, Llorente. Leading man: Mike Dean (Wirral) Not many of us marry our first, second or sixty-second love, let alone make a go of it. Rather, we learn from experience, hope to get there in the end, and either do or don’t. So it makes little sense to chastise Spurs for their naivety in losing to Juventus, nor to decry them as bottlers. It is possible for one good side to shade another just because, because football is like that; it is also possible for one good side to shade another because they have better players, able to turn it up at clutch beyond the scope of their opponents. And for all Spurs’ virtues, they don’t have a defender as good as Giorgio Chiellini, nor an attacker as dynamic as Paulo Dybala. On the other hand, it is long since time that they asserted themselves to the tune of substance. For all the fuss, they have not even come close to winning the title or a cup these past three seasons – not because they weren’t strong enough at the end of the race, but because they didn’t start it in the proper manner. So they need to recover their poise this afternoon, to keep on track for next season’s Champions League and to prepare them for a taxing Cup quarter with Swansea next weekend. As for Bournemouth, they’re doing ok. January wins over Arsenal and Chelsea lifted them away from the relegation struggle, but sketchier recent form means that they are only six points above the bottom three. They should have more than enough to stay up, but the longer it goes, tiddly-pom, the closer it goes, tiddly-pom, the more who stays and who goes, tiddly-pom, can be determined by relatively little. So they need the points, and can be relied upon to try and take them.

Their common name is somewhat of a misnomer as they are neither bearded nor tits, though with their “ping pong ball on a lolly stick” body shape, they do bear a passing resemblance to long-tailed tits. They are also referred to as bearded parrotbills or bearded reedlings – given that they are entirely dependent on reedbed habitat for their survival, the latter seems most fitting. At this time of year “beardies” tend to feed out of sight, fossicking through the soil in search of fallen seeds. Their tonal plumage makes it difficult to pick them out as they flit through the bleached stands of Phragmites australis, but eventually I caught sight of a flutter of movement deep in the vegetation. I raised my binoculars for a closer view, but the dense reed monoculture lacked any prominent features to use as a visual point of reference, so I immediately lost sight of my quarry. Gazing into the reedbed felt a lot like looking at a magic eye puzzle. As the cane-like stems swayed in the breeze, my vision began to blur. The key to finding the bird’s hidden form was to diverge my eyes and focus as though I was looking through the reeds instead of at them. Suddenly I was able to pick out a tiny, globular body perched between two stems, its legs splaying into the splits as it clung like a stilt walker to its wavering vertical perches. Bearded tits are sexually dimorphic and even at a distance there was no mistaking that this was a male. While both sexes have rich cinnamon-brown plumage, males’ heads are bluish-grey and they sport conspicuous drooping moustaches and bold black lower tail coverts. Two more beardies skimmed over, their presence betrayed by echoing metallic calls reminiscent of the end-of-line “ping” of a typewriter bell. The male flew up to join them and the trio rapidly disappeared from sight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/10/labour-no-purge-of-staff-battle-over-general-secretary-post","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T21:00:28Z","webTitle":"Labour pledges no purge of staff after bitter battle to fill top party post","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/10/labour-no-purge-of-staff-battle-over-general-secretary-post","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/10/labour-no-purge-of-staff-battle-over-general-secretary-post","fields":{"headline":"Labour pledges no purge of staff after bitter battle to fill top party post","bodyText":"Allies of Jeremy Corbyn’s preferred candidate to run the Labour party are attempting to calm concerns that her arrival will see a “clearout” of staff deemed insufficiently supportive of the Labour leader. Senior backers of Jennie Formby, the Unite union’s former political director and the frontrunner to become Labour’s new general secretary, are trying to reassure party staff that there are no planned overhauls should she secure the job. It comes as senior party and union figures try to find a last-minute “compromise candidate” to take on Formby, with several sources warning she has had run-ins with some of the other major Labour-affiliated unions that have left them seriously concerned about her appointment. Formby is on the verge of securing enough support from Labour’s national executive committee (NEC), which will vote later this month. The post gives the incumbent significant power in party disputes, selections and resources. While Formby is the clear frontrunner for the post made vacant by the sudden departure of Iain McNicol, the race burst into life earlier this month when Jon Lansman, the founder of the Momentum campaign group formed out of Corbyn’s first leadership bid, entered the race – against the wishes of Corbyn. The contest has exposed a growing tension among Corbyn supporters, between those who want to preserve the power of the unions who helped deliver the leadership and those who prioritise turning Labour into a member-led movement. It has become seen as a power struggle between Unite and Momentum. Formby is regarded as part of the inner circle of the leader’s office, which includes Unite leader Len McCluskey, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Corbyn’s increasingly influential gatekeeper, Karie Murphy. Formby is being touted by supporters as Corbyn’s pick for the job, rather than a “Unite transplant” designed to give the union more power. There are now attempts to ease fears among Labour staff about personnel shake-ups at Labour HQ, often regarded by the party’s left wing as insufficiently committed to Corbyn. Rumours have been swirling of a pot of money to help pay for redundancy packages should Formby win – a concern dismissed by her supporters. “Those fears are misplaced,” said a source. “I don’t think there is any likelihood or, indeed, possibility of a clearout. The idea that Labour HQ is the centre of anti-Corbyn intrigue is wrong anyway. There is not the slightest requirement for a clearout, nor will there be one.If individuals want to leave, there is nothing to stop them, but there are people whipping up a fear that has no foundation at all.” Formby’s fearsome reputation as Unite’s political director is causing concern within Labour HQ, with even some major supporters saying that she can be a “ruthless operator”. However, they say that such fears are outweighed by her organisational strengths and her strong links with the leader’s office. Other allies dismiss the fears, saying many who have worked with her remain fiercely loyal. Lansman is said to have launched his bid to ensure a contest for the role. He has vowed to back turning the post into one elected by members – handing more power to the rank and file. He said he was running against “machine politics” and has urged other candidates to come forward. The tensions between Momentum and Unite boiled over this week when Christine Shawcroft, an NEC member who backs Lansman, caused uproar by calling for the party to sever its trades union links. She later retracted her comments after being criticised by union leaders and Lansman. A compromise candidate is still being sought to win support from the centre and right, as well as those on the left who are nervous of Formby. There is a belief that the next general secretary should be a woman. Liz Snape, a senior trade unionist, is one name being pushed, but there is no sign she wants the job. Laura Parker, a Momentum official, would also be a serious contender if she opted to run. Formby remains the firm favourite, but insiders say Unite will “end up paying a heavy price” for its handling of the appointment. The split between Lansman and Formby supporters has also spilled into an online battle, with tensions among a group of leftwing blogs and news sites that emerged to support Corbyn’s leadership. The Skwawkbox, which is seen as having strong links with the leader’s office, has been pushing for Formby’s appointment and has questioned Lansman’s decision to run, while Novara Media, another Corbyn-supporting outlet, has backed both the opening of the contest and a member-elected general secretary. The internal tension has also seen the arrival of the Red Roar, a more centrist blog that details the fights raging within the ranks. Some moderate Labour MPs now believe the forces that brought Corbyn to power are dividing. The split has even been criticised by the Labour Party Marxists group, which said it was “at best, ludicrous and, at worst, irresponsible”. Skwawkbox Early in Corbyn’s leadership, party insiders believed the site was receiving detailed briefings from figures close to the Labour and Unite leaders. It would run lengthy articles against figures such as deputy leader Tom Watson and Gerard Coyne, the Unite official who ran against Len McCluskey in the union’s leadership race. In the general secretary fight, it has been making the case for Jennie Formby’s candidacy and has questioned Jon Lansman’s decision to run. Novara Media Set up by passionate Corbyn backer Aaron Bastani, the site has championed Momentum’s attempts to hand more power to members - with MPs usually losing out. While it has not backed calls to disaffiliate Labour from the unions, it has welcomed Lansman’s decision to run, and supports his idea that the general secretary post should eventually be fully elected. The Red Roar As the party’s left gains strength, another blog has popped up, written by the left’s critics. It opened its Twitter account with a story on how London mayor Sadiq Khan had been blocked from speaking at last year’s conference (a decision later reversed) and has also run unflattering stories on McDonnell and Unite. It has not taken a view on the general secretary race, though a centrist candidate has not yet emerged. Still has fewer than 3,000 Twitter followers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/10/sergei-skripal-salisbury-poisoning-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T21:00:28Z","webTitle":"Sergei Skripal: who was behind the Salisbury poisoning?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/10/sergei-skripal-salisbury-poisoning-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/10/sergei-skripal-salisbury-poisoning-putin","fields":{"headline":"Sergei Skripal: who was behind the Salisbury poisoning?","bodyText":"For a man who lived in a modest semi-detached house in a cul-de-sac in the genteel cathedral city of Salisbury, Sergei Skripal had a very immodest past. Some reports suggest that the former officer with Russia’s military intelligence service, the GRU, shared with MI6 the identities of as many as 300 Russian agents during his time as a double agent. At his trial, the Federal Security Service (FSB, the successor to the KGB) compared Skripal to Oleg Penkovsky, who was executed in 1963, and who history records as one of western intelligence’s most valuable assets. After his release in 2010, in the largest spy swap since the end of the cold war, Skripal would have been all too aware of how his colleagues viewed him. Many in the FSB are fond of quoting the motto of Smersh, Stalin’s counter-intelligence unit: “Death to spies.” That he came from the GRU only made things worse. “The Russian state is a strange construction,” said Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Russia, now an associate fellow at Chatham House. “The FSB is not a monolithic organisation. There are elements within it like the GRU, which is a sort of rival to the FSB.” Many within the FSB are ultranationalists. The assassination of a traitor shortly before this week’s presidential election would have made a nice gift for one of their most famous alumni, President Vladimir Putin, who is seeking to win 70% of the vote. But while Wood has little doubt that the brazen attempted murder of Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, an operation using a rare form of nerve agent available to only a few foreign states, can be laid at Russia’s door, he questions whether Putin would have sanctioned it directly. “I don’t doubt it had general approval from senior heads – that’s the system he’s created. Since 2012 Russia has been going backwards, rejecting economic reform and better courts in favour of renewed state control and repression, a fear of anything that is other. It’s the revival of Stalinism and the idea that Russia has the right to dominate its neighbours.” In this climate, former FSB officers now working in the murky world inhabited by ex-spies feel they can act with impunity. Whether Skripal had an inkling his life was in danger is unclear. There has been speculation in police circles that he received an Osman notice before he was attacked. These are warnings handed by the security services to people they fear may be targeted. But Skripal seems not to have made any changes to his lifestyle: hardly the action of someone in fear for their life. The are also claims that considerable amounts of money were found in his bank account and that mobile phone records connect him to the former MI6 agent who recruited him. Again, none of this can be confirmed. But quite a lot is known about the agent in question. At the time of Skripal’s arrest in 2004, the Itar-Tass news agency reported that the MI6 officer was working in the British embassy in Tallinn and had been responsible for recruiting scores of Russian intelligence assets. According to the FSB, these included a Russian security service officer, Vyacheslav Zharko. It’s at this point that the past and the present collide. The attempted murder of the Skripals has drawn comparisons with the fatal poisoning of the spy Aleksandr Litvinenko, who was on the payroll of the exiled oligarch and Putin critic, Boris Berezovsky. Zharko has said it was Litvinenko who introduced him to the same MI6 agent who recruited Skripal. “It all started in 2002, when he introduced me to employees of MI6 … They proposed that I provide consulting services to them, for money. The fee was about €2,000 a month, plus expenses,” Zharko once explained to a Russian broadcaster. But Skripal was in a different league from Zharko. He was the main asset reclaimed by western intelligence when, along with three others, he was released in 2010 in exchange for 10 Russian agents, including Anna Chapman, the British-based spy. “The exchange was very unusual,” explained Dr Yuri Felshtinsky, who co-wrote Blowing up Russia with Litvinenko. “It was seen as an invitation for Russians to spy for foreigners because it indicated any Russian arrested for spying in Russia could be exchanged.” Felshtinsky suggests the Kremlin had little choice but to trade Skripal: pressure was mounting from powerful supporters to get the 10 Russian “sleepers” back as quickly as possible. “They knew they were making a mistake by releasing him, but they knew they would have a chance to kill him later,” Feltshtinsky said. But, unlike Litvinenko, Skripal seemed to have opted for a quiet life, keeping his head down and making no public criticism of Putin. Indeed, all the stories about him last week were of a man who enjoyed a quiet drink, gambled on scratchcards and studiously visited the graves of his wife Liudmila, and son, Alexander, whose ashes he had had flown back from Russia. This makes the targeting of his daughter all the more shocking. “This is a complete change of the rules of the game and will frighten a lot of people,” Felshtinsky said. Until now only individuals have been targeted in murders suspected of being linked to the Kremlin. In the UK they include Alexander Perepilichny, a Moscow banker turned whistleblower who died after jogging near his house in Surrey and is suspected of having been poisoned, and Berezovsky, who was found hanged at his ex-wife’s mansion in Berkshire. Former Russian press minister Mikhail Lesin was found dead in a Washington hotel room in 2015. A medical examiner’s inquiry and US federal authorities ultimately ruled that he died from falling and hitting his head after a days-long binge drinking session. The former Chechen president, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, was killed in an explosion in Qatar in 2004 for which three Russians were jailed for life, only to be extradited to their homeland, where they were given a heroes’ welcome and apparently freed. Their treatment draws comparisons with that of Andrei Lugovoi, the former KGB officer wanted by Britain for Litvinenko’s murder, now a politician and successful businessman back in Russia. “Not only do they kill their opponents but they also indicate to everybody that a crime is never going to be punished,” Felshtinsky said. “It [the murder] might not be discovered, and if it is discovered, even if you are arrested, they’ll get you out, and if you are arrested they’ll publicly promote you. They are very open, very cynical.” Some have speculated that Skripal was targeted because he was continuing to mine Russian contacts for information that he was relaying to MI6 and to private intelligence firms. “Litvinenko was a ‘gun for hire’ once he left Russia,” said one person who runs a London-based security and risk analysis firm which has operations in Russia. “There a lot of people like him around. They can earn money acting as advisers to us. Skripal’s attempted murder wasn’t subtle. This was about terrorism, not elimination.” The attack will have alarmed the Kremlin’s enemies now residing in the UK. Many arrived between 2008 and 2015 under a now defunct scheme that offered them residency in return for their investing millions of pounds in UK bonds or shares. Campaigning group Transparency International has found that almost a quarter of all such visas went to Russians who invested almost £750m, much of it in London’s property market. Private security consultants patrolling their homes in Belgravia and Hampstead are likely to find renewed demand for their services after last weekend’s events. But the Kremlin’s allies here will also be concerned. Among MPs, there is a clamour for the full implementation of the so-called Magnitsky Act, something that would allow the government to sanction individuals who are found guilty of corruption and human rights abuse, hitting them with visa bans and asset freezes. The government has also signalled that it could use new powers to target those of Putin’s allies who are unable to account for how they came about their wealth. “Transparency International has identified £4.4bn worth of properties bought with suspicious wealth in the UK,” said Duncan Hames, the campaign group’s director of policy. “Over a fifth of which is properties bought by Russians. It is clear that the UK has routinely been the choice destination for Russians with suspicious wealth to move and they have had little trouble doing so, taking advantage of lax regulation and offshore secrecy.” One notable example is Igor Shuvalov, Russia’s first deputy PM, whose official salary is £112,000. He owns a Westminster property valued at £11.4m. Curbing the lifestyle of Putin’s rich allies will not give the Kremlin sleepless nights, however. “There may be something financial we can do if we know any particular names, but I don’t see anything devastating that we could do,” Wood conceded. Rather, if Russia’s involvement is confirmed, the response may be largely symbolic: the breaking off of diplomatic ties, the refusal to attend key events. “If England decided not to play in the World Cup, that would be a good thing,” Wood said. But the UK is unlikely to impose the one sanction that would damage Russia. “European countries, including the UK, have arranged their sanctions policies so far in a way to carefully exclude the purchase of Russian gas,” said Simon Pirani, research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “In reality, for the UK as well as for most European countries, the realistic alternative sources of imported gas are very limited. American liquified natural gas is in the news, and as far as we can see from our research Russia is going to adopt a pricing policy to protect its European market share from American LNG.” In Salisbury on Saturday life appeared to have regained some normality, despite the deployment of 180 military personnel to help with the investigation. It is only at the sites known to have been visited by the Skripals – notably the Mill pub and a Zizzi restaurant – that the scene looks like a film set. At each, tents have been erected for investigators to work in and police in protective suits can been seen moving around. The police cordons have forced some businesses to close and those that are open have reported slower trading. “It is a shame on the back of a human tragedy,” said 41-year-old Claire Singleton, who works in a jewellers. “I feel sorry for the shops that haven’t been able to open since the snow.” Back in Moscow many remain unaware of the story. “I don’t know anything about that. They lived here, in our building?” said a bemused middle-aged woman at the west Moscow housing estate the Skripals called home for many years. State media made only cursory mentions of the attack, including a stark warning to “traitors” not to settle in England because they risked dying in mysterious circumstances. The comment was echoed by Lugovoi. “The more trash and scum of the Earth that Britain accepts, the more problems it will have,” he said. The rhetoric is typical of an increasingly bellicose Russia. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson has said there been a “tenfold increase” in the number of submarines operating in the North Atlantic over the last seven years. Typhoon jets from RAF Lossiemouth intercepted two Russian long-range bombers as they approached to within 50 miles of the UK in January. In addition, Russia’s use of fake news, trolls and cyber-attacks confirm the Kremlin’s upping of the ante. “What Russia is conducting is a war,” Felshtinsky said. “It’s too expensive for them to start a real war and too dangerous, so they try to find a different form of war, a cheaper form of war. This is the cheapest way to destroy the west.” This article was amended on 11 March 2018. An earlier version wrongly stated that the MI6 agent who recruited Skripal worked for a consultancy firm called Orbis. This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/10/zaghari-ratcliffe-boris-johnson-british-iranian-iran-jail","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T16:46:18Z","webTitle":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: question over delay in return of jailed British-Iranian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/10/zaghari-ratcliffe-boris-johnson-british-iranian-iran-jail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/10/zaghari-ratcliffe-boris-johnson-british-iranian-iran-jail","fields":{"headline":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: question over delay in return of jailed British-Iranian","bodyText":"The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual citizen jailed in Iran for spying, has called on the foreign secretary to explain why she has not returned to Britain. Richard Ratcliffe said it was not clear what was delaying a return to the UK for his wife, who was convicted in 2016 and sentenced to five years in jail, after the head of the prison where she was being held this week said he had approved her release. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a charity worker for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was accused of running a BBC Persian online journalism course and seeking a “soft overthrow” of the Islamic republic. She denies the charges and maintains she was in the country to introduce her young daughter, Gabriella, to her parents. Ratcliffe told Sky News there had been positive signs from Iranian authorities, but he still did not know when the family would be reunited. “We’ve been getting better messages from the Iranian side, from the judiciary and the prosecutor’s office in Iran,” he said. “This week the head of prison said, ‘oh yes, I’ve approved her release, I approved it a number of months ago’. So there’s been clearly things to hold on to, hopefully. Part of the aspiration of today’s message to the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, is I would like to meet to ask: ‘What’s the blockage?’” Last November, Johnson wrongly told a parliamentary committee that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been “simply teaching people journalism” during her trip to Iran, prompting fears that it would be used to justify her conviction. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “We will continue to approach each case in a way that we judge is most likely to secure the outcome we all want. Therefore we will not be providing a running commentary on every twist and turn.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/10/football-league-hull-edge-norwich-in-four-penalty-thriller-cardiff-win-again","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T19:19:49Z","webTitle":"Football League: Hull edge Norwich in four-penalty thriller, Cardiff win again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/10/football-league-hull-edge-norwich-in-four-penalty-thriller-cardiff-win-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/10/football-league-hull-edge-norwich-in-four-penalty-thriller-cardiff-win-again","fields":{"headline":"Football League: Hull edge Norwich in four-penalty thriller, Cardiff win again","bodyText":"Championship Four penalties were awarded and all four were scored during a thrilling encounter as Hull beat Norwich 4-3, having been 3-1 down at half-time. James Maddison grabbed a first-half hat-trick, including two from the spot. Abel Hernández then scored two penalties as the Tigers fought back to 3-3 before Harry Wilson’s 71st minute winner. Jackson Irvine had begun the glut of goals with a sixth minute strike for Hull, who pulled themselves six points clear of the bottom three. Cardiff kept up their recent breakneck pace in the race for automatic promotion by beating Birmingham 3-2 to complete a sixth successive victory, to go within three points of leaders Wolves, who lost 4-1 at Aston Villa, and five clear of chasers Fulham. Goals from Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, Craig Bryson and Callum Paterson had Neil Warnock’s team cruising by half-time only for them to suffer a second-half wobble. Craig Gardner scored a penalty and Maxime Colin’s injury-time goal but Blues could not claim a badly needed point, as Garry Monk suffered a second defeat of his first week in charge of Birmingham. Fulham kept up their automatic promotion pursuit with a 2-1 win at Preston. In-form Aleksandr Mitrovic scored the sixth and seventh goals of his highly impressive loan spell either side of an equaliser from Sean Maguire. Sunderland’s woes continued in losing 1-0 at QPR, after goalkeeper Jason Steele was sent off for handling outside the box. Eberchi Eze broke the away team’s resistance in the 62nd minute. Chris Coleman’s team stay rock bottom of the division. Middlesbrough stayed in in sixth after a 3-1 defeat of Barnsley. Patrick Bamford kept up his rich vein of scoring form in scoring Boro’s third goal after Daniel Ayala and Adam Traoré had begun the scoring. Barnsley lost their chance to open up some ground on the bottom three with Birmingham and Sunderland Burton drew 0-0 with Bristol City, a result that was little use to either team in their hunt for the play-offs and precious points in the relegation battle. League One Blackburn stayed five points clear at the top of the division after breezing past Blackpool 3-0 in a Lancastrian derby in which they were not required to get out of second gear. Bradley Dack opened the scoring before two goals from Adam Armstrong. Second-placed Shrewsbury’s 2-0 home defeat of Walsall arrived via goals from Alex Rodman and Abu Ogogo. Wigan lost ground on the top two by drawing 3-3 with Scunthorpe and needed a late equaliser from Gary Roberts to claim a point. Chey Dunkley and Will Grigg twice put the hosts ahead but Tom Hopper equalised on both occasions. Ivan Toney put Scunthorpe into the lead before Roberts’ 87th minute goal arrived via a deflection. Plymouth’s recent charge came to a halt with a 1-1 draw at Fleetwood. Moses Makasi’s opener looked to have set Argyle on their way to a seventh successive win but Fleetwood striker Paddy Madden cancelled that out. Peterborough’s 4-1 defeat of Charlton lifted them within a single point of Plymouth in the battle for the final play-off position. A local derby between Bury and Oldham ended in a 2-2 draw at Gigg Lane. Goals from Jay O’Shea and Neil Danns had put Bury 2-0 up, but Craig Davies and then Ben Pringle’s late equaliser kept honours even. Bury stayed bottom, while Oldham dropped to 19th. League Two Accrington climbed to the top of the table after winning 2-1 at previous leaders Luton. It took an injury-time strike from Billy Kee to lift them there. A seventh win in eight matches came after Accrington took the lead through Sean McConville and Elliot Lee had equalised for Luton. Play was held up for 30 minutes during Chesterfield’s home game with Lincoln, as an air ambulance was required to attend to a fan who had been taken seriously ill in the stands. Lincoln eventually ran out 3-1 winners. Charlie Kirk scored a 98th minute equaliser as Crewe drew 2-2 at Stevenage to stay a point clear of the bottom three."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/11/opera-must-take-more-risks-new-eno-chief-exec-stuart-murphy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T00:05:14Z","webTitle":"I fell in love with opera at 15 … now I want millions to do the same","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/11/opera-must-take-more-risks-new-eno-chief-exec-stuart-murphy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/11/opera-must-take-more-risks-new-eno-chief-exec-stuart-murphy","fields":{"headline":"I fell in love with opera at 15 … now I want millions to do the same","bodyText":"I was 15 when I first played in an opera orchestra – The Magic Flute. But it’s the first rehearsal I remember most vividly: the performers sang, and then spoke, and then sang again. Yep, exactly as they are meant to. But I’d only seen this sort of thing before on a television comedy sketch show – and here it was all gloriously happening live, and I was in the middle of it. Magical. Then we got to the Queen of the Night’s aria and those ridiculous top Fs. I remember looking, dazzled, at the bassoonist next to me, kind of shocked that I’d heard that note; I’ve been in awe of opera singers ever since. My Magic Flute experience was in my native Leeds. I’d ended up in the city’s youth orchestra, and then Leeds Youth Opera orchestra – helped by my local comprehensive, where my brother and I each learned to play instruments; the clarinet for me. Nothing comes close to hearing the full force of an orchestra firing on all cylinders – it’s like a great wall of pleasure. Likewise, there’s nothing like gazing upon the staging and the costumes, and losing yourself in the total immersive experience. The challenge is that people hear and love opera all the time without realising it – in adverts, on film soundtracks, across popular culture – yet the inhibitors to them coming to see and hear it can feel huge. Some might feel it’s not for “people like me”. So one of my jobs is to mix up who this “me” is – mix up the age, ethnicity, social background of our audience. When I told my teenage sons I’d got the job of chief executive of English National Opera, they asked if they’d have to come along to the Coliseum, ENO’s home. I said they would, obviously, because I’m their dad and while they live in my house, it’s my rules. Their heads returned to their iPads. All of us, especially perhaps younger audiences, yearn for connections and real engagements. It’s why festivals and flashmobs work, why marching and demonstrations feel so vital. If we get it right at ENO, my kids will want to come and experience the mindblowing power of ENO’s chorus in La traviata or join the packed audiences rolling around laughing at Andrew Shore in Cal McCrystal’s Iolanthe. I’ve spent my career working in television, not opera, including 10 years at the BBC and six at Sky. While I suspected there would be people who might balk at a “TV person” running an opera company, it’s hardly the first time it has happened. Jeremy Isaacs went from Channel 4 to the Royal Opera House, and Tony Hall, the current BBC director general, moved from BBC News to the same place. The idea that someone from outside the opera world is not qualified to lead this wonderful company fails to appreciate the many ways in which television and opera overlap. But then I would say that. I suspect it’s because senior roles in both industries require pretty similar skills. Both demand the ability to spin plates – to move from one meeting about strategy to another with a “creative”; from a marketing gathering to dealing with some legal complexity. What’s more, understanding and increasing audiences is key, as is finding ways within a business to increase the amount of creative work commissioned. For me, it was a complete joy when the worlds of TV and opera collided, as happened with Flashmob the Opera, which I commissioned for the BBC in 2004. If you didn’t see it, search for it online – it was an opera from Paddington station with full orchestra and chorus, and was watched live by almost 100,000 viewers. I loved TV. Loved the scale, the immediacy, the boundless energy. I loved that it was about emotionally touching or enchanting or surprising people. Life at the Coliseum will, I hope, offer more of the same. At ENO, striving to present truly world-class opera while adjusting to a new, match-fit financial regime has been hard. We need to retain a stellar presence on the national and international operatic stage while all the while remembering that what we do is about something sublimely simple – to move an audience over the course of a few hours. Essentially, then, you let the brilliant artistic and musical directors and technical teams do their thing. If you’ve a culture that encourages staff to take gut-wrenching artistic risks, you also need them to know they’ll be supported organisationally and emotionally if those risks misfire, as they inevitably will from time to time. ENO should never be in a position where someone is performing Tosca while having the hum of internal politics in their ears. Having ENO run smoothly means we’ll have the resources to put back into creating more, and more distinctive, opera. Increasing our national and international reach, expanding and deepening our partnerships and developing on new platforms in imaginative ways all flow out of strong revenues. This would allow us in turn to develop a comprehensive, data-driven understanding both of audiences that come to us and of those that avoid opera completely. I want to know why they feel the way they do and address the reasons why. (Plug: you can come to the Coliseum for the price of a cinema ticket – ENO has 500 tickets for every performance at £20 or less, from the balcony to the stalls.) We need to find the right mix to help people begin a life-long love affair – of suitably operatic proportions – with the artform; encourage them to feel just as I felt as that 15-year-old clarinetist in Leeds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/08/music-industry-still-boys-club-beyonce-songwriter-carla-marie-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T11:53:24Z","webTitle":"Music industry is still a boys' club, says Beyoncé songwriter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/08/music-industry-still-boys-club-beyonce-songwriter-carla-marie-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/08/music-industry-still-boys-club-beyonce-songwriter-carla-marie-williams","fields":{"headline":"Music industry is still a boys' club, says Beyoncé songwriter","bodyText":"The music industry is still a “boys’ club” where women are not given enough opportunities to develop, a leading British songwriter has said. Carla Marie Williams, who has written for artists including Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Craig David and Girls Aloud, said the music industry was not immune to the barriers faced by women in entertainment and called for more investment by record labels and publishers to involve women at a younger age to bridge the gender gap. “Equality in the music industry definitely doesn’t exist, it’s male-dominated through and through,” the Brit-winning and Grammy-nominated writer told the Guardian. To mark International Women’s Day, Williams has invited 100 women in music to the third annual gala for Girls I Rate, a not-for-profit support network she founded two years ago. It was set up with the aim of empowering women already established in the industry and give space to those from disadvantaged backgrounds like hers to become the managers, PRs, and songwriters of tomorrow. Advocates include Lily Allen, Emeli Sandé and Wretch 32. Growing up in Harlesden, north-west London, Williams decided she wanted to work in music after watching adult singing classes in the community centre where her mum worked after school. After a stint as a youth worker, she worked with Beyoncé on the Naughty Boy-produced song Runnin’ in 2015. When the two women reconnected to write a song for Beyoncé’s Grammy-winning album Lemonade, she says, “what I was feeling at the time in terms of freedom and womanhood was the message she also wanted to put out”. The result was Freedom, a protest anthem for female and black empowerment. “It fell in line with my mission for Girls I Rate, which is what we call “operation couch”: celebration, opportunity, unity, change and hope,” Williams said. “Today, we put on academy weekenders to educate girls about the business of music. One of our events was sponsored by Island Records. Over 800 girls submitted their demos and 200 were invited to have their work heard by executives and directors from the publishing and record labels and receive direct feedback.” Following the allegations against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, the music industry has also come under scrutiny for its treatment of women. But it is not just a story of harassment and abuse, it is one of representation too. Men hold more than two-thirds of jobs in the industry and occupy the vast majority of positions of power. According to the chief executive of the PRS for Music foundation, 78% of grantees it has supported had experienced sexism in their career. Williams adds: “PRS has 21% female membership, and that’s after organisations like ours helped get girls signed up.” While she has never experienced harassment herself, Williams said she had often been put down. Once she was told to “shut up” by a group of men for speaking up about lack of opportunities, “but when the other guy was saying the same thing he wasn’t told to shut up. Then I become the aggressor.”To make change happen, companies needed to look at their employment statistics when hiring, she said. “If you have five men on the board, get five women,” she said. “Try and make those positions available. There also needs to be more financial investment in younger women’s development from labels and publishers, allowing for girls to come forward and feel like they can occupy spaces. An annual five grand here and there can go so far.” The importance of women supporting other women should not be underestimated, she added, saying: “Together we can become a powerhouse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/football-league-blog/2018/mar/07/james-brent-lays-foundations-plymouth-premier-league-dream","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T10:00:06Z","webTitle":"James Brent lays foundations for Plymouth’s dream of greater things | Ben Fisher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/mar/07/james-brent-lays-foundations-plymouth-premier-league-dream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/mar/07/james-brent-lays-foundations-plymouth-premier-league-dream","fields":{"headline":"James Brent lays foundations for Plymouth’s dream of greater things","bodyText":"Last Sunday marked seven years since a financially crippled Plymouth Argyle entered administration, a time when 40 full‑time staff went nine months without being paid. They were dark days in deepest Devon but, zoom in on a run of one defeat in 15 league matches over the past three months and, like Gary Sawyer, the captain, you, too, will be scrabbling to find the right adjective to describe an equally extraordinary transformation. Plymouth were bottom with 17 points from 20 matches in League One on the morning of 9 December 2017, at which point the club were 5,000-1 for promotion. However, since a last-minute victory against Gillingham at Home Park that hoisted them off the foot of the table they have climbed into the play-off places. “It’s madness really, from where we’ve come from,” says Sawyer, who is in his second spell at the club after joining as a schoolboy at the age of 13. Pinpointing what has been the catalyst behind an unimaginable turnaround, helmed by the manager, Derek Adams, is the million-dollar question but a few home truths after the defeat by Fleetwood Town in October, an eighth in nine league matches, helped. “It was a case of reminding ourselves of how hard we had worked to get out of League Two,” he says. “It felt like it just snowballed from there really.” A goalkeeping injury crisis also left them stumped, with Argyle having worked their way through seven goalkeepers since September, while four red cards in seven matches that same month ensured problems mounted. They had five points from their first 12 matches. James Brent, the chairman, insists the club hierarchy’s support for Adams did not oscillate; Plymouth did not wish to bloat figures that show more than a third of managers have lost their job since the start of the season, with 11 third-tier clubs among those to change personnel. “I guess we are probably not very typical of many football club boards,” the 52-year-old says. “I know supporters were asking, on a fairly regular basis, has he got one game left or two games left? It was never a debate for the board; it was how do we support our manager to get us back on to the right road? That is the approach we will continue to take, although it won’t always make you popular with supporters all of the time. But I think the board has a very clear responsibility to do the right thing, rather than the popular thing.” Sticking with his manager, who replaced John Sheridan almost three years ago, looks an increasingly prudent decision. Yet it is one of Adams’s boldest calls that seemingly kickstarted their superb turnaround. Ruben Lameiras, once a team‑mate of Harry Kane in Tottenham’s under-21 side, was deemed an unwanted commodity and found himself on trial at Oldham the Monday before Christmas. But, five days later, he made his second league start for Plymouth against Oldham, in a 4-1 win, and the Portuguese forward has not looked back. In defence, 20-year-old Bristol City loanee Zak Vyner has excelled since arriving to fill the void left by Ryan Edwards, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer in January. “It’s on everyone’s mind,” Sawyer says. “The main thing is for him to get himself back to health. Eddy has been a great part of what we have done and he is a great character in the dressing room but unfortunately he’s not with us every day at the minute while he’s getting his treatment. We have a WhatsApp group, with all of the players in it, with messages going back and forward often with Eddy, especially around game time. But because of the nature of what he’s going through, I know the lads don’t want to pepper him.” After ultimately saving Plymouth in October 2011, Brent, a former property banker, admitted he had not been to a football match for 23 years and is grateful for the wise counsel of the serial promotion‑winner Neil Warnock, whose family home is over the border in Cornwall, following his takeover. Warnock’s words of wisdom, particularly those that stressed the importance of establishing sustainability on and off the pitch in tandem, Brent says, have stuck . “He was incredibly helpful and supportive, as a total rookie chairman, when Argyle was frankly a total mess at the time,” he says. “I needed as much help as I could get.” These days, Plymouth are suddenly dreaming bigger and of a return to the Championship for the first time since 2010. Brent states he starts every season with a “hope” and an “expectation”, the latter of which has been comfortably exceeded. “Argyle will be a stronger club next season regardless of whether we got promoted or not. It’s not just about the season, it’s about continuous improvement and being better each year.” The most unpredictable and unprecedented of promotions would bring what Brent terms “quality problems”, namely putting the pressure on the mucky, ongoing redevelopment of the 1950s grandstand at the stadium they bought back from the city council for £1.7m two years ago, described as an “old lady” by the chairman. It is set to be ready for the start of the 2019-20 season, by which point, on this form at least, anything is possible. “I think, realistically, we can support the club to get into the Championship but we can’t support the club to get into the Premier League,” Brent says. “It’s just so expensive to try to make that journey. I think the deep south-west would really benefit from having a Premier League club. But it’s not something we can do and, at some point, it would be wonderful if somebody can take over the reins and take us to that position.” Talking points • Michael Jolley arrives at Grimsby Town via Cambridge University – where he achieved an MSc in economics – New York, where he worked as a HSBC trader, and AFC Eskilstuna, the Swedish second division club. His time at the latter was the League Two club’s new head coach first managerial post, this being his second. The club enthused about stepping away from the “classic managerial merry-go-round” appointment, just as MK Dons did with Dan Micciche, but with survival at stake, there is little room for error. • Peterborough United owner, Darragh MacAnthony, has sold 50% of his stake to the Canada-based businessmen Stewart Thompson and Dr Jason Neale, who have bought shares through their company, Kelgary Sports and Entertainment. MacAnthony, who will remain as the club chairman, described it as “banner news”, adding that this business will help accelerate the club’s buy-back of their London Road stadium. • Should Ryan Sessegnon be on the plane to Russia? Too early? Maybe. Fulham’s left winger does not turn 18 until May but has shown maturity beyond his years over the past couple of seasons and has been prolific for Slavisa Jokanovic’s side this term, scoring 14 goals. “I believe he can be part of the English national team for the World Cup,” Jokanovic said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/06/share-a-tip-on-a-great-football-trip-abroad-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T16:19:50Z","webTitle":"Share a tip on a great football trip abroad for the chance to win a £200 hotel voucher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/06/share-a-tip-on-a-great-football-trip-abroad-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/06/share-a-tip-on-a-great-football-trip-abroad-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","fields":{"headline":"Share a tip on a great football trip abroad for the chance to win a £200 hotel voucher","bodyText":"Watching a football match (men’s or women’s games) abroad is a great way of experiencing local culture and passions (and that’s what we want to hear about – not a report on the actual match), while going on a European city break to watch a game gives a great focal point to a trip.

Every four years, during the Six (or Five) Nations season immediately following a British and Irish Lions tour, it is as if lead weights have been attached to the legs of one nation and restorative oxygen pumped into the dressing-rooms of the rest. Spot the common theme in the following list of champions in post-Lions years since the late 1960s: France, Wales, no winner, Wales, Wales, France, Scotland, Scotland, Wales, France, France, France, France, Ireland. It is necessary to spool back 55 years to the icy early months of 1963 to find the last time England won a title in the wake of a Lions trip. Should Eddie Jones’s squad successfully defend the crown they have won for the last two seasons, they will be bucking a serious trend. If it is entirely a coincidence, it is certainly a remarkable one. France have clearly profited in the past against opposing teams full of “leggy” Lions but for Wales, Ireland and Scotland to harvest seven titles in the years in question without England winning once suggests other factors must be involved. Either way, with Ireland potentially one big weekend win over Scotland away from clinching the 2018 championship a week early, the same old story could shortly be retold. Latterly, without a doubt, the uncommonly relentless demands of the Premiership have played a part. Maro Itoje was a huge Test star in New Zealand last summer but it felt strange to see him playing four games for Saracens on the opening four weekends of an achingly long domestic season. Despite sitting out the Argentina Test in the autumn and enduring a lay-off over Christmas with a broken jaw, it should not be a total surprise he is not presently looking his freshest. His normally dynamic team-mate Mako Vunipola has also gone quiet. Other key English Lions such as Anthony Watson, Elliot Daly, Ben Te’o and Ben Youngs have had enforced injury absences; the best England forward has been Joe Launchbury, who was not chosen for the Lions adventure. But what about Ireland? Surely Conor Murray, Johnny Sexton, Tadhg Furlong, Rory Best, Iain Henderson and co should be hanging as well? True, the impact of Robbie Henshaw, Sean O’Brien, Furlong and Henderson in this Six Nations so far has been diminished by injury but Murray and Sexton have been as influential as ever. Could it partly boil down to the positions in which they play? To be a Lions forward or a boshing midfielder – two of England’s traditional strengths – is to need longer to recover, perhaps, than some of the playmaking positions. Either that or the Pro 14 offers a slightly more sympathetic environment for international players, particularly those on central contracts which reduce their workload for their provinces. This, clearly, is not a luxury available in every country. Wales, along with England, tend to find Lions tours exact a long-term toll across the board. Sam Warburton, Taulupe Faletau, Rhys Webb, Liam Williams: the list of prominent Welsh Lions who have not subsequently broken down through injury is revealingly short. Should that not indirectly favour Scotland, who did not exactly enjoy mass representation in Warren Gatland’s squad? Not in Cardiff last month, evidently, but they did look a whole load fresher . Whether England were merely feeling the effects of their heavy training schedule, designed to ensure they peak at the 2019 World Cup rather than now, remains a moot point. Equally, though, it is worth recalling the testimony of, among others, John Rutherford, Scotland’s fly-half in their memorable grand slam-winning season of 1984. Rutherford and his team-mates knew they were a half-decent squad but their self-belief really began to flourish on the 1983 Lions trip to New Zealand. “That confidence grew with the Lions because we discovered we were fitter, better and mentally stronger than some of the best players from England, Wales and Ireland.” In other words it is possible some established England squad members lose a little of their aura on a Lions trip. Maybe one or two fly home believing, conversely, they are more invincible than they actually are. There was certainly little wrong on paper with the red rose sides who finished second at Murrayfield in 1990 or came unstuck at home to Ireland in 1994. It should also be remembered France occasionally stir, having been written off, most notably in 2014 when Stuart Lancaster’s side were edged out by Gaël Fickou’s late try on the opening weekend and pipped on points difference by Ireland’s last-gasp victory in France on the final weekend. In 2018, too, a much simpler scenario could be playing out. Ireland and Scotland are fast-improving sides, Jones’s England are not as dominant as 24 wins in 26 Tests may suggest and the historic failure of any country to win three outright championship titles in a row is not remotely a coincidence. There are few tougher tournaments to win anywhere in the world and England, barring a dramatic late surge, are once again being reminded of that perennial truth. HOME AND AWAY Three rounds into the Six Nations and, Rome aside, there has been oneaway victory (Ireland in Paris, courtesy of Johnny Sexton’s remarkable late drop-goal). In games not involving Italy, there have also been only two try bonus points: Wales against Scotland and Ireland against Wales. With plenty of rain forecast in Dublin and Paris on Saturday, high-scoring away wins are not going to be easily collected. ONE TO WATCH With International Women’s Day looming, the Rugby Football Union is reporting a healthy rise in female rugby participation. There are now more than 30,000 registered female players and the successful Inner Warrior recruitment campaign has seen 12,00 women attend camps nationwide, a third of whom had never picked up a rugby ball in their lives. On Saturday, in addition to a potentially decisive Six Nations showdown in Grenoble between France and England, there is an attempt to attract a world-record crowd for a women’s club rugby game when Harlequins play Richmond at the Stoop (kick-off 3pm)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/06/sebastian-coe-should-follow-lead-roger-bannister-athletics-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T16:15:52Z","webTitle":"Sebastian Coe should follow Roger Bannister’s lead for athletics legacy | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/06/sebastian-coe-should-follow-lead-roger-bannister-athletics-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/06/sebastian-coe-should-follow-lead-roger-bannister-athletics-legacy","fields":{"headline":"Sebastian Coe should follow Roger Bannister’s lead for athletics legacy","bodyText":"At midday last Sunday, Sebastian Coe launched the IAAF’s scheme to get people interested in athletics. It is called the Heritage Collection and is a display of old athletics artefacts, medals, programmes, papers, odd bits of kit from out of the attic, Stacy Dragila’s vest and Jason Gardener’s spikes. The idea, Lord Coe explained, was to win “long-term loyalty of young fans” by showing the “historic context” of the sport. Coe spoke about taking the display on the road but ultimately the International Association of Athletics Associations wants to put it all in a “new museum for sport in Monaco”. No doubt, the Monegasque kids will be queuing along the Boulevard Louis II to see one of Gabriella Szabo’s old bibs. The public were not allowed into the opening ceremony, which was held on the top floor of Birmingham town hall. Instead the room was stuffed with functionaries from the IAAF and the city council. They chuckled politely in all the right places. Coe has the air of a man who has spent too much time in the company of people who love to laugh at his jokes. The South American Athletics Federation was donating 100 objects, one for each year since it has been founded, and the ceremony turned into a ritual exchange of handshakes, smiles and old bits of paper and tin. The news about Roger Bannister broke earlier that same morning and Coe reached for the words to describe the “historical context” of the four-minute mile, which is exactly the sort of achievement the Heritage project ought to commemorate. He spoke about how Bannister had “lifted the hearts of a nation and boosted the morale of a world still at a low ebb after the war”. He sounded like a man dictating a press release. There has been a lot of good writing about Bannister, about the multivalent legacy of a man who valued his work in science and medicine above his achievements as an athlete. There is an idea Bannister’s amateurism epitomised the best of British sportsmanship and that those ideals are long since lost – but then you hear Laura Muir talk. Muir, who won her first two world medals in Birmingham last week, is a hell of a runner. She is also one of those people who makes you feel so inadequate you resolve to get up an hour earlier the next day. Or maybe the day after. For the past four years, Muir has been balancing her athletics career with her veterinary studies. She won those medals despite the fact that she has spent the past year on rotation placements at different clinics, working night shifts and 80-hour weeks. She fits her training in around her studies because, she says, veterinary work is her real passion. She will become a full-time athlete when she graduates but is committed to a second career, too, in the charity or voluntary sector. Bannister would have loved watching her run and loved hearing her talk. With the Heritage project, Coe wants to yoke athletics’ present to its glorious past but there is an aspect of Bannister’s legacy he did not touch on in his speech. In 1971, Bannister became chairman of the British Sports Council. There, he pushed through the first tests for anabolic steroids and argued for the introduction of random testing. “That’s up there with anything I did on the track,” he told Don McRae in 2004. It frustrated him that the authorities were indifferent to what he was trying to do. “It still took 10 years to make the breakthrough – when Ben Johnson was found guilty at the Seoul Olympics in 1988.” Coe is so keen to draw on the sport’s glorious history, it is fair to ask how well he has served it himself in his time at the IAAF. Bannister’s death was not the only story on Coe’s mind on Sunday. That same morning the digital, culture, media and sport select committee released copies of its report on doping in sport. In it, the committee accuse Coe of providing misleading evidence and question the IAAF’s “commitment to fully investigate difficult issues when they arise”. Coe wrote a rebuttal in the Evening Standard, which is edited by his friend George Osborne. The two used to share an office when they were working for William Hague. In the piece, Coe argued the committee’s report can be boiled down to one simple issue: “Whether I’m a reader of emails or not.” Which is the kind of explanation you might use when you are used to being surrounded by people who nod their heads at everything you say. He also argues, fairly, that the IAAF deserves credit for its stance on Russia’s state-sponsored doping and the reforms it has made since the inquiry started. Despite that progress, Muir’s work ethic did not make the headlines on Monday because she also spoke about her uneasy relationship with Genzebe Dibaba, who beat her in the 1500m and 3,000m. Dibaba’s coach, Jama Aden, is still under investigation after he was arrested in 2016. Police found a stash of EPO in a hotel room at Aden’s training camp. Dibaba was at that camp. Like Aden, she has denied she has been involved in doping but Muir feels unsure about exactly what she is competing against. In athletics, no one is sure who to trust any more. You can see Bannister’s legacy in Muir’s life off the track. You can see Coe’s in her life on it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/fill-the-hungry-gap-with-chinese-cedar","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T06:00:24Z","webTitle":"Fill the ‘hungry gap’ with Chinese cedar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/fill-the-hungry-gap-with-chinese-cedar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/fill-the-hungry-gap-with-chinese-cedar","fields":{"headline":"Fill the ‘hungry gap’ with Chinese cedar","bodyText":"Spring is in the air! But as any allotmenteer will know, the sad irony with seeing the first signs of new life burst forth is that it is usually one of the leanest months in the British veggie patch. Traditionally known as the “hungry gap”, this period describes the window where stocks of stored autumn and winter veg are running low, but the first spring crops have yet to mature. The term is used so widely to reflect the UK season of growing that you might think it was an inescapable reality of seasonal eating at our northern latitude. Yet in other temperate parts of the world that still eat a much broader range of traditional crops, such as east Asia, this period is not known as a time of leanness but a time of plenty. As a greedy botanist fascinated with unusual edibles, what I have found most intriguing is that many of these prized Asian spring crops lead secret double lives as common ornamental plants in British gardens. Having munched my way through my fair share, both when travelling to their countries of origin and in my own back garden experiments, I would say that above all my favourite all-rounder has to be the Chinese cedar, Toona sinensis. It is lovingly referred to in Mandarin as xiang chun or “fragrant springtime”, and the young leaves of this stately tree have a deliciously warm, rich flavour and a distinctly bold onion-like aroma. In fact, for those unfamiliar with the plant, it is surprising just how “meaty” or “savoury” a leaf can taste. It’s a world away from the generic “green” or “leafy” flavour of the plethora of other veg that are almost interchangeable with kale or spinach. One of my mates, having been invited to taste the foliage, really hit the nail on the head when he came out with: “Wow! Beef-flavoured crisps!” The leaves get this flavour from a range of natural, sulphur-based compounds that they produce to protect their young growth against insect attack. Onions and garlic contain the same defence mechanism, which, as with Toona sinensis, ironically makes them super tasty to humans, too, with potential health benefits to boot. Their strangely familiar savoury flavour also means that, as with onions or garlic, they are supremely versatile in the kitchen, working well in the place of any other green veg in everything from soups and stews to sautées and stir fries. But I have saved the best aspect to last. The species, in addition to having tasty spring shoots, is also a stunningly beautiful garden tree with peeling bark, rich green leaves and fragrant flowers that the bees just love. It grows extremely rapidly to form a stately tree in a huge range of soils. Pick a variety like “Flamingo” and you will get a truly show-stopping display of powder-pink new growth that can easily upstage any flowering cherry, but with a far longer display. Want to contain its size? No problem. They are very amenable to pruning. Or should that be “harvesting”?

For many City fans though, the Argentinian’s title-clincher still sits second to Jamie Pollock’s elaborate own goal in 1998, which almost certainly doomed the club to relegation to the third tier for the first time in their history. Like Agüero, the combative midfielder showed great composure and skill to bypass a couple of players before precisely heading the ball over his own goalkeeper, leaving a packed Maine Road silent. The goal made it 2-1 to the visitors and, although City would equalise, the draw meant Joe Royle’s side needed a minor miracle on the final day at Stoke a week later. Despite a 5-2 victory, they went down. Gallows humour has always been a trait of City supporters but even they struggled to comprehend what they witnessed when Pollock decided to sum up five years of struggle in one moment. The culprit fears the fault for the goal may lie in his DVD collection. “It was funny because on the Friday – and I’ve never done this before – somebody had got me a video for Christmas of own goals and gaffes, and I said: ‘I am not watching that.’ But on the Friday, for some reason, I put it on and my wife Linzie came in and said ‘I can’t believe you’re watching that before the game’, but I was like ‘nah, I’ll be alright’ and then I actually did one. I don’t know if it was something subconscious in my mind from watching the DVD but I’ll try to blame something, it was just crazy,” Pollock says. “I watched it on the Friday and on the Saturday I tracked my runner, the ball bounced, I’ve actually knocked it over Mike Sheron’s head and then I’ve looked and Martyn Margetson was on his line so I’ve headed it back towards Martyn. As I’ve headed it, he comes running out and the ball’s beaten him and gone into the goal. Then it was like: ‘My God!’ It was horrendous and you felt the silence from the crowd; the anxiety grew from there, we kept battling on but couldn’t get the win we needed.” Many would have expected Pollock to be vilified for his moment of madness but the dressing room was understanding, aware that their predicament was not down to the midfielder’s overzealous plan to clear the danger but rather a season of poor performances. “I can remember going into the dressing room and saying: ‘Sorry lads, I can’t believe I’ve done that.’ The support was fantastic; Joe and Willie Donachie were obviously frustrated and alarmed at our plight but at no point did they point the finger of blame and I think that’s a great credit to them. It was tough walking into that dressing room knowing you’d done something like that but the lads were fantastic.” For many an event like that was enough for a club to be relegated in an instant, but Pollock had arrived late in the season as the newly-installed manager, Joe Royle, tried to form a blueprint for safety. Royle had more than 40 professionals at his disposal but few were of the relevant quality to get City out of the mess they had created for themselves. A sports psychologist was brought in and the team warmed up for matches at a nearby primary school to avoid the angry glare of fans before matches at the 32,000-capacity Maine Road. “The threat of relegation was a big worry to everybody; it was a real burden on our shoulders going on the pitch because nobody wanted to be part of a relegation of that nature for a club as big as City. I went in for 10 games and absolutely loved my time at the club. It was really good, even though City was a club which was in a lot of ways in a load of turmoil, you could still tell it was an absolutely fantastic club with a fantastic fanbase. “Joe decided at the time it was best to warm up away from the ground before matches, so we used to shoot off to a little school around the corner, we’d have a little warm-up, back into the changing rooms and out on to the pitch, so that was very different. The thinking at the time was, as a lot of players were getting a lot of stick, to protect players from that because it was a big burden playing for such a big club like City.” Although the relegation was a horrible experience for fans and players alike, it galvanised the club and Pollock, in particular, as they fought to bring City back to where they felt was their rightful place. The dramatic play-off final win against Gillingham at Wembley would potentially not have happened were it not for Pollock’s comical intervention. The shootout win against Gillingham gave the club sufficient momentum to earn a second consecutive promotion and return to the Premier League in 2000. “The own goal and the relegation were City’s lowest point and to be involved in that wasn’t ideal for me but in many respects it was the start of something new and I think that was the lowest point and from that things started to change; Joe did a fantastic job getting a lot of footballers and wages so the club got to a more sensible financial footing, David Bernstein came in as chairman, he had a vision for the club and it just seemed like the club was heading the right way but from my point of view I didn’t have all the pain of going down and down, as in the 10 games we put up a bit of a fight for it, we had a go and everything from that season onwards was all positive in trying to get promoted and then again. It was a great achievement – in my time at City we had one relegation and two promotions and it was a great experience for any footballer.” Pollock, who now runs a football academy in his native north-east, is constantly reminded of his glorious failure but will be a permanent reminder of how things have changed for City, a summation of the struggle they have gone through, providing permanent perspective for those who now live through the most glorious days. “I’ve got five kids and you can imagine they’ve all had a bit of stick in the playground and I am forever being reminded of it. I have a massive amount of respect for City and I think it’s a fantastic club. At the time I was absolutely horrified but I think, after a bit of time, even the most hardened of City fans can look back and laugh at how it happened. On the day it was horrendous but, moving on, if you didn’t laugh, you’d crack up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/my-mothers-memory-is-in-my-daughters-hands","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"My mother’s memory is in my daughter’s hands | Nikesh Shukla","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/my-mothers-memory-is-in-my-daughters-hands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/my-mothers-memory-is-in-my-daughters-hands","fields":{"headline":"My mother’s memory is in my daughter’s hands","bodyText":"My daughter has my mother’s fingers, my father’s ankles and my eyebrows. As she grows, I can see the composites of my family in her. One night, as I go to tuck her in and stroke her hair before turning off the landing light, as I do every night, for just a fragment of a second, a pregnant pause that startles me, I see my mother’s face on her. Lying there, eyes closed, still and at peace. Like the last time I saw my mother. On the table at the funeral director’s. I had gone with Dad to say goodbye. I didn’t want to, but we were both sure it was something we needed to do. My aunt had dressed Mum in a red sari and painted her fingernails red. This was why I’ll never forget her hands. Because on seeing her red nails, I crouched and let out a guttural, uncontrollable yelp, before tears streamed down my face. Mum never painted her nails. I couldn’t be convinced, that on dying, she should be immortalised in flames, cremated, with nail varnish. It didn’t feel like my mum. It felt outside the moment. I look again at my daughter and her face looks like her face. It was only for that one second that she looked like my mum. Only that one second flash – a quick stab of an image change, like you might see in a horror film for effect. Except it wasn’t scary. If anything it was comforting. There’s a framed picture of Mum overlooking her bed from my wedding day. I’ve cropped myself out because I was stressed in that particular moment and didn’t want my photo taken. But Mum did, because it was her son’s wedding day and everything about it was radiant aside from my grumpy face. My daughter knows she is dead. “Daddy, your mummy died, didn’t she?” occasionally she’ll ask. “Yes,” I’ll reply. “Why did she die?” “She got sick,” I say. “And she didn’t get better.” I don’t know how to explain lung cancer to a three-year-old yet. “Am I going to die?” she asks. “Yes,” I tell her. “But not for a very, very long time.” Often we think about the traits or memories or trinkets that remind us of those we have lost. It’s not often that we think about skin in this way. My daughter’s hands, imprinted with the same look and feel as her grandmother’s, bring me closer to Mum. Knowing she lives on, in this tiny way, helps me grieve. When Mum ballooned in weight because of the course of steroids she was on, her hands remained her hands. In her final weeks, as she became gaunt and haunted, her hands remained her hands. It was only on that funeral director’s table, fingernails painted red, that she suddenly felt not there anymore. My daughter doesn’t really understand it when I tell her that her hands remind me of my mum’s. She accepts this fact and carries on living her life. “Who is your mummy?” my daughter asks as I remind her to hold my hand. We’re walking to the shops to buy chocolate to make a cake for my wife’s birthday. “Her name was Jayshree.” “She died,” my daughter reminds me. “I have her hands now.” She lets go of my hand and holds one up. She’s wearing gloves. I stop and smile. I take a glove off and turn her hand so the back of it is face up. “See your little finger and how it is bent ever so slightly? My mummy’s hand bent like that, too. Every time I look at your hands, it reminds me of my mummy and I feel happy.” “Not sad?” she asks as I put the glove back on her. “No,” I tell her. “Not sad. Because I have you to remind me of her always. I’m sad you two will never meet, but I am happy that you make me think of her always.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/where-to-move-for-restaurants","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T08:00:18Z","webTitle":"Where to move for the best restaurants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/where-to-move-for-restaurants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/where-to-move-for-restaurants","fields":{"headline":"Where to move for the best restaurants","bodyText":"Dulwich, south London.

Caroline Nokes confirmed that the threat of accelerated deportations was part of official Home Office policy after being challenged in the Commons by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who said the letters “sound like punitive deportations for women who have dared to go on hunger strike”. Abbott raised the hunger strike in an urgent question in the Commons after visiting the detention centre in Bedfordshire last month. She said her visit with the shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, had coincided with the protest over “inhumane conditions” in the centre. She said the Home Office, Serco and G4S, who are all involved in running Yarl’s Wood, had “categorically” denied to her that there was a hunger strike under way. “It now seems that we were misled,” she said, before raising the threatened accelerated deportations. Nokes said she was first aware that detainees were refusing food and fluids at about the same time as Abbott’s visit and defended the decision to hand the protesters the letter threatening to accelerate their removal. “Of course I regard that as very serious. Nobody wants detainees to be at any risk, but it is important that they should not regard that as a route to prevent removal from this country,” she said. She told MPs the letters were handed to detainees only after an extensive welfare interview with medical professionals, which was used to explain the risks they were putting themselves under by refusing food and fluids. “We want nobody in detention to be in that situation and it is important that we explain to them the risks that are involved,” Nokes said. The Home Office letter makes clear that a continuing refusal of food or fluids “may lead to your case being accelerated and your removal from the UK taking place sooner” and states bluntly that it will not lead to removal directions being deferred or to a detainee’s release. Nokes said the letter followed the policy published on the Home Office website last November and “was agreed after consultation with NHS England, Medical Justice, the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association and other NGOs.” Medical Justice confirmed it had been consulted but said it had been highly critical of the policy. It said it had voiced concern at the time about the threat to expedite removals. “For detention to be legal, the Home Office should only exercise the power of detention for the minimum possible time in every case. [The policy] appears to suggest that this is in fact not the case and also implies that removal can be expedited as a punitive measure. That approach is wholly inappropriate and contrary to clinical best practice,” it told the Home Office last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/23/lets-move-to-eastbourne-east-sussex","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T16:29:08Z","webTitle":"Let’s move to Eastbourne, East Sussex: ‘Things may be changing’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/23/lets-move-to-eastbourne-east-sussex","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/23/lets-move-to-eastbourne-east-sussex","fields":{"headline":"Let’s move to Eastbourne, East Sussex: ‘Things may be changing’","bodyText":"What’s going for it?

Roger Greatorex London • Gazza’s tears and Cantona’s kung fu kick are often mentioned as the game-changers in popularising English football with the chattering classes and overseas fans. The person who probably did – notice the past tense – most to revolutionise the game in the modern era was, however, Arsène Wenger (Time’s up, Sport, 3 March). (Yes, more even than Sir Alex). Watching him in 2018, though, is like watching Björn Borg with his trusty wooden racket in the era of fibreglass. Wenger’s methods, eloquence and intelligence were like a blood transfusion into the domestic game. He is still perhaps the most thoughtful and insightful commentator on contemporary football. His pioneering ways were, as is the fate of all pioneers, adopted and refined by others. He should really call it a day at the end of the season. I can think of no better person to head and reform the FA. Will Goble Rayleigh, Essex • Please, Guardian, do not follow the trend, common in other media, by highlighting relatively modest achievements in the Premier League era as if football only started in 1992 – “Kane will be the third player to have scored 25+ goals in three consecutive Premier League campaigns” (Sport, 3 March). Jimmy Dunne, a Dubliner playing for Sheffield United in the first division – then the top tier – scored 42 goals in 1929/30, followed by 50 in the next season, 35 in 1931/32 and then 32 goals in 1932/33. Of further note, Jimmy’s achievements in 1931/32 included scoring in 12 consecutive top-flight league games – a feat not equaled to this day, despite the Premier League efforts of Ruud van Nistelrooy (10) and latterly Jamie Vardy, who scored in 11 consecutive PL games in 2015/16.

When my name was called, I leapt out of my seat and ran to the stage to receive two awards. I even gave a speech, though I managed to keep it short – and not cry. In the audience of 300 food writers, journalists and chefs packed into a trendy warehouse venue in London, I could see many of my heroes applauding. Previous winners of the awards for food book and investigative food work included Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Jamie Oliver and Heston Blumenthal. It should have been a moment of great triumph. But I felt like a fraud. What the hell was I doing here? I had become a food writer entirely by accident. I looked around at all these modern-day gurus on how to cook and how to eat and knew I had a very different relationship with food. I had a terrible secret. It started at school when I was 14. I was upset, because I had not been invited to a party hosted by a boy I fancied. So I went to the disabled toilet, which smelt of puke, where I knew the other girls did it, and I put my fingers down my throat. It was hard at first, there was blood. I knew there would be, it was discussed in the dorms. It always took two or three goes and plenty of saliva before a final warm release. I was disgusted, less by the vomit than the fat, unpopular girl I thought I was. I was ashamed, so deeply ashamed I was afraid to seek help. Instead it became a coping mechanism, an intermittent cycle until I was 34. Bulimia is not a word I have ever used before, not even in my diary. I used to refer to the habit as “the B thing”. Like many men and women in our modern world saturated in food and driven by stress, binge eating became a safety valve, a way to comfort and forget – even if it was momentary. NHS figures estimate that one in 12 women experience bulimia at some point in their lives. But the secretive nature of the illness and the fact that only very serious cases are picked up means that the number could be much higher. Until now, I have never fully acknowledged to myself or to anyone else I had an eating disorder. I went for months or even years without being sick and each time I was, I vowed it would be the last. I would scoff a family-sized chocolate bar in front of the telly, a loaf of homemade bread on the train, a box of chocolates in the car – then bring it all up. I would always hide the evidence, down the back of the sofa or in the foot well. I would never admit, ever, even to myself, it was happening. I knew what real bulimia was – piles of cream cakes every day. I wasn’t doing that, so it was OK, right? For a long time, I was able to pretend that this was just an occasional habit picked up at school… But winning those awards forced me to think about my relationship with food in a very different way. I remember getting on the tube after the truffle arancini and raspberry friands at the ceremony with an enormous goodie bag. It contained various kitchen implements I could not even identify and salt-cured cod that would spend months at the back of the cupboard. Who was I kidding that I was ever going to use any of these foodie gadgets? I handed out a bag of retro sweeties to a gaggle of drunken commuters, amused at my generosity, then I went home and I cried. For weeks I kept my head down, crippled with imposter syndrome. What if I was found out? My book, The Ethical Carnivore, was originally in the environment section, awarded for exposing the reality of the modern meat industry. Now it was in the food section surrounded by books on eating clean, cooking perfectly balanced meals and presenting them in an elegant Shaker kitchen. What could I possibly contribute? Food writing tends to be about an aspirational lifestyle, about men and women who you want to look like and cook like. Who wants to read the opinions of a woman who is afraid of food? For a while I tried to invent a new persona: someone worthy of these awards, someone who has kale juice for breakfast and avocado on toast for lunch. I posted colourful photographs of my meals on Instagram, I invented eccentric new recipes, I even did a cookery demonstration at River Cottage. But the worry kept niggling at the back of my mind, a guilty secret eating at my conscience: food writing, like any writing, is only any good if it is true. The moment I was forced to confront my past was going back to give a talk at my old school. The limestone boarding houses, manicured playing fields and Georgian classrooms had all shrunk. The uniform looked marginally less hideous. But the pupils were exactly the same, boisterous around one another, yet clearly self-obsessed, awkward in their growing bodies, achingly vulnerable. I couldn’t help thinking of that teenager kneeling by the toilet. I too was confident and outgoing on the outside. Inside, I was struggling with self-confidence and a troubled home life. My mother died when I was three. Her death was seldom spoken about, largely because we were all still grieving. When I was 14, my father divorced his second wife, a confusing time of split loyalties and further upheaval. My four siblings and I were loved and certainly privileged, but home was often a tense and even frightening place. At school, I told no one. I did well in classes, muddled along in sport and found myself a social status somewhere between the class clown and geek. I never questioned my bulimia – the most important thing was to be popular, to pass exams, to survive. As long as I could keep up appearances, be brave, then that was the most important thing. But is survival enough? I looked at the young faces at my talk asking difficult questions, mostly to amuse their friends, and I could see the same patterns; the need to impress peers and suppress fears. I suspect it is even worse for teenagers today. The advent of social media means that the image of the perfect body, the perfect food is even more prevalent. Young people are expected to be thin while at the same time boasting about their gastronomic exploits online. The latest NHS figures show a massive increase in the number of under-19s admitted to hospital with an eating disorder. Finding a way to nourish your body while also reflecting the unrealistic images in consumer society and your own – often unreasonable – expectations of a washboard stomach must be tough. I thought, I owe it to them, to my younger self, to tell a different story about food. Food is about more than fuelling your body or even impressing your friends on social media. It is bound up closely with emotion. We eat food to comfort ourselves, to make us happy and quell anxiety. In a growing child it can be especially difficult to recognise the difference between the hunger for food and the hunger to fit in, to be loved. When I stuck my fingers down my throat, it was not because I had been rejected by a boy I fancied. It wasn’t about the shape of my changing body or even about my dysfunctional home life. Later in life, it wasn’t about my impending deadline or the broken friendship or the failed job interview. It was the inability to deal with the emotions those experiences brought up, to express them, to seek help and to move on. Once I accepted that, I began to see a pattern. After the school visit, instead of sitting down to write about “clean” food, I wrote about my binges and the reasons for them. Why did I wander around Borough Market eating banana bread until I felt sick? Because I could not help comparing myself with all those happy people and wondering why I was so lonely. Why did I ruin a perfectly nice Sunday lunch? Because a stranger talked about my mother and I did not know how to respond, how to say I want those memories, too. Why did I eat so much wedding cake in the back of a taxi? Because I was drunk and exhausted and I could not let the image of a confident, fun person slip, even when I felt hurt and rejected. The most important question is why did I stop? I never sought professional help for bulimia, but in my early 30s, the emotions I was suppressing finally exploded on to the surface. For five years, I’d worked as environmental correspondent on a national newspaper. Crazy though it may sound, I felt responsible for waking the world up to climate change and every day I felt I was failing. A series of foreign trips to environmental disaster zones tipped me over the edge. I saw the world as a terrifying place, but struggled to explain to anyone why, or to accept that there was little I could do about it. I would run to the toilet at the newspaper office, not to vomit this time but to have panic attacks. Looking back, I can see how that resembled my bulimia: the need to find a dark corner, to force my body to extremes, to increase my heart rate, decrease my oxygen and at the end of it all to feel some form of relief. Except this time it was without my control. I knew I had to get help before the chaos I felt inside leaked into the outside and ruined my seemingly successful life. I began to see a therapist and talk about the feelings of fear, the “icy claw” gripping my heart. I discussed my family and my job. But I never discussed bulimia. I did not consider it relevant. I still thought of food as unimportant, and any discussion of eating habits seemed neurotic and embarrassing. In fact, I was still vomiting occasionally. I remember the last time: it was after an eight-hour train journey, an exhausting weekend of putting on a brave face and keeping it together for another wedding. I could not rest and I could not cry, so I ate. It was no different to any other time, I’m not even sure I made the usual vow that this would be the last. But it was. Something in me was shifting. Through simply talking, I was learning to deal with emotions, to “soothe myself”. Until now, I had never put together my recovery from bulimia with therapy. I had always thought it was about food, and it was my fault, that I was too greedy and too weak. I look back and see it was never about food, it was about my emotions. Somehow that makes it better. Food is not something I need to be afraid of any more. I still overeat occasionally. Who doesn’t? Food is not rational and expecting yourself to act in a rational manner is going to mean constantly beating yourself up. But I am lucky to have made my peace with food. This is part of me, part of my food experience. Telling my friends and family has been a revelation. I expected disgust but of course all I have found is sympathy and support. I am a food writer now and food writing is helping me to make sense of this. Perhaps being a little bit afraid of food, struggling occasionally is how a lot of people feel in 2018. Perhaps it is easier to identify with than someone who is perfect. Perhaps that could be my contribution. After The Ethical Carnivore, I wanted to write about food ethics beyond meat. I have found it to be a challenging subject. Practically every food we eat comes with a question mark over ethics, whether it is fair-trade bananas or the ubiquitous organic avocado. I found myself slipping into the old habits, trying to control everything I eat, panicking about being “clean”, punishing myself for getting it wrong. Then I remembered food is more than a label. It is a story. Yes, I can try to be an “ethical eater” and find out as much information as I can on behalf of others. But my food story is so much more than that. It is my memories and my body and my mistakes. I can’t tell you how to be thin, or cure your irritable bowel syndrome, or reverse the process of ageing. I can’t tell you everything about where your food came from, or where to shop to save the planet. But I can look back at my 14-year-old self and offer a little reassurance. It’s OK to be hurt. It’s OK to feel ashamed. It’s OK to get it wrong, for years. It’s OK to eat. It’s OK to panic. It’s OK to cry. Because, one day, you will recover.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £110 The menu at the Farm Girl Café features lots of initials. There’s V for Vegan. There’s GF for Gluten Free. There’s DF for Dairy Free. I think they’re missing a few. There should be TF for Taste Free and JF for Joy Free and AAHYWEH for Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here. If you examine the company’s website, and I would only advise doing so if you have strong teeth that can cope with a good grinding, you will learn that the Farm Girl group offers: “A holistic and healthy yet comfortingly simple approach to Australian Café culture.” Nope, me neither. Apparently, they like to use “nutritionally nurturing ingredients”, which sounds rather nice. I could have done with a bit of nurture, rather than the dishes that came our way. I have nothing against eating healthily. I have only one body and I try to look after it. My mother used to say that she hoped to die aged 98, shot dead by a jealous lover. She didn’t quite manage it, but it’s an ambition I’m happy to inherit. The menu here is omnivorous with a heavy emphasis on non-meat cookery, which is a fine thing. I like vegetables, me. They can taste really nice. But this sort of cooking does have to be done with skill, grace and, ideally, an absence of malice. The Farm Girl Café, Chelsea, is the third in a group which until now has stuck to charcoal or matcha lattes, and light lunches involving an awful lot of almond butter, avocado and something called coconut bacon, which you just know isn’t. This is the first to serve dinner, and it does indeed look like a proper restaurant in a very Chelsea sort of way. There’s a giant blue Welsh dresser behind the bar, faux wooden beams across the ceiling and banquettes in a field shade of green. It’s like a cartoon version of a farmhouse as imagined by someone who hasn’t been in one. It fills quickly on a cold winter’s evening, with blonde-tressed Chelsea women just bubbling with intolerances. They are fizzing with them, these dairy- and gluten-fearing dietary warriors, seeking sanctuary from the terrifying world of modern food. With them are their pink-cheeked, anxious-looking boyfriends, who clearly fear they are just one more rugby club, traffic-cone-on-your-head piss-up away from being chucked. A woman arrives clutching her Yorkshire terrier. They are given a corner table. The dog is offered a bowl of water and a plate of food and disappears on to the floor for dinner. At least somebody gets to eat well. From the small plates we order the whole (completely out-of-season) globe artichoke, which apparently is gluten free. It’s tough to see how it would be anything other. It has been prepared by someone who either hates globe artichokes or has never met one before: boiled until it is as soft and rank as Grandma’s cabbage, only with none of the glamour. It is just so much mushy leaf matter, and smells of a long Sunday afternoon in someone’s overheated suburban front room. The damn thing could be disposed of without the aid of teeth or, better still, using a composter. That would remove the middle man, which in this case happens to be me. “Paola’s Market Veggies” arrive in a bowl, with a grainy, deathly “carrot hummus” thickly smeared up the side, like someone had an intimate accident and decided to close the loo door and run away. At the bottom is a “cashew aioli”, which is the kind of discharge you get when you torture nuts. It tastes of raw garlic and nothing else. There are sticks of celery and hunks of cauliflower to dredge through this, alongside “seeded crisp bread” which is neither of the last two words. It is dense and hard and tasteless, as you imagine cork floor tiling might be, if it had somehow been repurposed as food. Finally, from the small plates, comes tostadas piled with jackfruit, the latest hip, unconvincing replacement for meat. It is a fibrous tangle that gets stuck in your teeth on top of a violent, acidic sludge of guacamole. The jackfruit is described as being barbecued. This means it has been smeared with a blunt barbecue sauce of the kind they serve at pubs with a flat roof. Each of these dishes costs about £8. After this vegan calamity, this extraordinary display of dismal cooking, I find myself eyeing the Yorkshire terrier, greedily. Just hand him over, give me access to the grill, and five minutes. Perhaps the kitchen can do better with something that once had a pulse. Or perhaps not. The crispy turkey schnitzel sounds nice. Apparently, it is encased in “lemon and thyme-infused breadcrumbs”, but tastes of neither of those things. It barely tastes of anything at all. The meat is overcooked and has the texture of something Timpson’s might one day think about using to re-sole my brogues. A heap of pickled cucumber and radish is piled on top helpfully, to ensure the breadcrumbs go soggy. A side dish of roasted cauliflower is so undercooked that the knife barely manages to go through it. The one edible dish is a glutinous, cloyingly sweet vegetable “curry”. It would be regarded as an utter, shameful travesty by many in south-east Asia, but it’s not actively unpleasant. We do not stay for dessert, because we have suffered enough. In any case they are mostly a list of ice creams and sorbets including a “spinach, kiwi and coconut oil gelato”, which sounds terrifying. What we’ve ordered so far, plus the second-cheapest bottle of wine, has already run up a bill of just under £100. It’s not just the dismal cooking that pains me here. It’s the squandering of ingredients and of people’s time and the tiresome narrative of “wellness” with which it’s been flogged. I feel especially bad about our waiter. Tom is a good man. He is charming, on point and utterly wasted here; he should do something more socially useful, like fly tipping or nicking cars. I whip out my phone and discover there is a branch of Honest Burgers nearby. One of their finest, served medium rare, a big heap of rosemary and salt chips and a hefty tumbler of cheap and cheerful sauvignon blanc is exactly what we need to make all those BTGW (Bad Thoughts Go Away). News bites The elegant glass box that houses the café at the Garden Museum, just south of Lambeth Bridge, gives equal billing to both meat and veg, but does so with grace and good taste. A recent menu started with winter tomatoes with tropea onions, or cockles with bacon, followed by gnocchi with wild garlic and almonds or oxtail and lentils. Stay for dessert (gardenmuseum.org.uk). There’s nothing clever about stupid high prices for food items, but it’s always good to have something to gawp at. Recently, on a trip round the refurbished Harrods food hall, I spotted Wagyu Kobe fillet A5, imported from Japan, for £62.50 per 100g. Or £625 a kilo. The minimum order is 500g. You do the maths. Restaurant no-shows have become a serious issue in the industry recently. Two weeks ago, Edinburgh chef Mark Greenaway introduced a deposit scheme after recording 450 no-shows in a month. Now the Casual Dining Group, which own brands such as Bella Italia and La Tasca, is considering introducing advance payments for large groups.

Lovers scream, bones turn to dust, streets are paved with souls and poor old Britain has been reduced to “charred remains”. So Violence’s crowning achievement is that most of this portentous nonsense is disguised by music that is often genuinely fun. To their chagrin, Editors have never managed to escape the curse of comparisons that has plagued them since their 2005 debut earned them the nickname “Boy Division”. After a mid-career foray into Coldplay-worthy platitudes, the five-piece lighten up on album six, embracing the imperious camp of Depeche Mode, with assistance from producers Leo Abrahams and Fuck Buttons’ Benjamin John Power. With a bit more razzle-dazzle, Cold, Nothingness and Darkness at the Door could be genuine goth-pop bangers à la Chvrches – brawny, hooky and tinged with the feeling that was lacking on Editors’ emotionally desolate earlier records. That tonal shift makes a huge difference. Smith allows himself more range on Violence, which goes some way to selling his daft lyrics: rasping with paranoia on the title track, desperate and determined on Magazine, whose chorus is genuinely transporting and contains the album’s sharpest lyrics. “Now talk the loudest with a clenched fist,” Smith sings, ostensibly about Trump: “Top of a hit list, gag a witness.” Apocalyptic ballads No Sound But the Wind and Belong still sound like wading through molten Tarmac, and some experimentation doesn’t land, but for the most part, Violence is a thoroughly unexpected career peak."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/anna-joness-recipes-for-peanut-noodles-and-double-ginger-soba","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T12:00:10Z","webTitle":"Anna Jones’s recipes for peanut noodles and double ginger soba","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/anna-joness-recipes-for-peanut-noodles-and-double-ginger-soba","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/anna-joness-recipes-for-peanut-noodles-and-double-ginger-soba","fields":{"headline":"Anna Jones’s recipes for peanut noodles and double ginger soba","bodyText":"I don’t often eat alone in restaurants. When I do, it is always satisfying a need for the same thing: the salvation of a bowl of noodles. There is something private about the comfort of noodles; they are not suited to being served family style; a bowl of noodles – especially a noodle soup – tends to be a very personal thing. Perhaps it is my fumbling use of chopsticks or the slurping of a noodle soup but, as I eat, I can feel myself being restored. Noodles are, of course, as diverse as pasta. This week I make two versions at home – the reliable egg noodle and the elegant soba variety – both for quick dinners. Their sauces come from opposite ends of the flavour spectrum: one sticky and sweet from chilli, honey and peanut, the other fresh as can be with a whole lime, ginger and coriander. Salvation indeed. Pine &amp; Crane peanut and cucumber noodles (pictured above) I ate a bowl of noodles in LA this winter, in a little neighbourhood restaurant called Pine &amp; Crane, and they were everything I want a bowl of noodles to be. This is my version, with a chilli-spiked peanut sauce with the freshness of cucumber, sugar snaps and coriander. Pea shoots would work here, too. Vegans can swap the egg noodles for rice or thick udon noodles. Prep 10 min Cook 10 min Serves 4 For the peanut sauce 5 tbsp smooth peanut butter 5 tsp tahini 5 tsp dark soy sauce 2 tsp sesame oil 4 tsp honey or maple syrup 5 tsp rice wine vinegar 5 tbsp chilli oil 2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped For the noodles 1 medium cucumber 150 sugar snap peas 250g dried egg noodles A small bunch of spring onions, finely sliced A large bunch of coriander, leaves picked 4 tbsp peanuts, toasted and crushed Quarter the cucumber lengthways, scoop out the watery middle and set it aside. Cut the cucumber flesh into 5cm lengths, then into matchsticks. Cut the sugar snaps into long slices. To make the sauce, put the watery middles from the cucumber into a small food processor with the peanut butter, tahini, soy, sesame oil, honey and vinegar, blitz or whisk until smooth, then stir through the chilli oil and chopped garlic. Cook the noodles in a large pot of boiling water for a minute or so less than it says on the packet (about four to five minutes), so they still have some bite. Drain the noodles and put into a serving bowl. Pour the peanut sauce on top and toss together to dress the noodles. Add the cucumber and sugar snaps, and toss again, then top with the spring onions, coriander and crushed peanuts; if you like, finish with a little extra chilli oil. Lime and double ginger weeknight soba This recipe uses a whole lime, peel and all, which brings amazing zing, backed up by a double hit of ginger and coriander. I like these noodles with tofu, but any quickly sauteed vegetables or toasted peanuts or cashews would do. I use chive flowers to add colour, but some normal chopped chives will do just as well. Prep 10 min Cook 10 min Serves 4 For the sauce 1 unwaxed lime 4 spring onions, roughly chopped A large thumb of ginger, roughly chopped A small bunch of coriander, washed 1 tsp honey 1 tbsp soy sauce, plus 1 tsp 2 tbsp rapeseed oil 300g extra-firm tofu 300g dried soba noodles A handful of radishes, cut into matchsticks 100g mixed seeds (eg black and white sesame, sunflower and pumpkin) A small bunch of chives, finely chopped (or garlic chives/chive flowers) 2 tbsp pickled sushi ginger Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, make the sauce: first chop the lime, peel included, into rough, small pieces and put into a small blender. Add the spring onions, ginger, coriander (stalks and all), honey, soy and oil and blitz to a thin, bright-green paste. Drain the tofu, pat it dry, and cut it into matchsticks or 1cm cubes. Heat a little oil in a frying pan and fry the tofu, along with a pinch or two of salt, over a medium-high heat for a few minutes, until browned on one side. Add a tiny splash more oil if needed, to prevent sticking. Toss gently once or twice, then continue cooking for another minute or so, until the tofu is firm and golden. Add the remaining teaspoon of soy, take the pan off the heat, toss the tofu in the oil and soy, then transfer it to another bowl. Boil the soba noodles according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, fill and boil the kettle. Once the noodles are cooked, drain in a sieve, then quickly rinse them with the boiling water from the kettle to stop them sticking. Put the noodles back into the pan, add the lime and green ginger paste, and toss to coat. Pile the noodles into a bowl and top with the tofu, radish, seeds, chives and pickled ginger. These noodles are also great eaten cold. Food and prop styling: Anna Jones.

Agent Moss works on a black ops programme that utilises time travel as an aid to its investigations, and she journeys into the future in order to track down the kidnapped girl and the killer. As if this were not a thrilling enough premise, Sweterlitsch stirs an intriguing end-of-the-world scenario into the mix. In every possible future investigated by naval agents, the world has come to an end – and the “Terminus” event is destined to destroy Moss’s timeline, too. How the murder inquiry and the enigma of the terminal event are linked is just one of the many enjoyable aspects of this dark, page-turning SF thriller; another is the character of Moss. Driven by the loss of a childhood friend and her own traumas in adulthood, she is a resilient, vulnerable and likable protagonist. Embers of War (Titan, £7.99), Gareth L Powell’s sixth novel and the opening volume of a trilogy, tells a familiar tale: a war criminal assumes a new identity and runs for cover, with various parties in hot pursuit. When a starship liner is shot down in a far-flung star system, Captain Sal Konstanz is tasked with rescuing survivors, and an opposing agent is sent to find the war criminal who was aboard the liner. So far so simple, but Powell skilfully complicates the situation in a compulsively readable, expansive space opera with huge alien artefacts in the form of the Gallery (a solar system whose planets have been individually carved into colossal monuments), an ancient extraterrestrial race whose quiescent power is about to be reawakened and a sentient starship with a conscience. It’s the way he forms a series of first-person narratives into a compelling and satisfying whole that lifts the book far above most run-around space capers. Another novel that sounds simplistic in precis but reveals its depths in the telling is The Bitter Twins by Jen Williams (Headline, £14.99), the second volume of the Winnowing Flame trilogy. This fantasy saga should win converts to a genre in which dragons, eldritch monsters, battles between good and evil and perilous quests have become cliches. Williams deploys all these, but brings her dark and immersive narrative to life with vivid descriptive passages, a great line in sarcastic humour and human insight. The monstrous Jure’lia are once again threatening to destroy the empire of Ebora, and the only hope of defeating them is to train and deploy the griffin-like war beasts. It falls to fell-witch Noon and swaggering sword-for-hire Tormalin to meld them into an effective fighting force. While The Bitter Twins could be read as a stand-alone, readers are advised to begin with the first book, The Ninth Rain. Spare and Found Parts by Sarah Maria Griffin (Titan, £8.99) is set 100 years after “The Turn” brought a terrible epidemic to an unnamed but thinly disguised Ireland. The country is divided into “the Pale” and “the Pasture”: the Pale is inhabited by citizens missing body parts, while the Pasture is a paradisal realm populated by those given biomechanical prostheses by Dr Julian Crane. His neglected daughter, Nell – who was born without a heart, but given a clockwork one by her father – is maudlin but spirited, and grows up in a draconian society where technology is proscribed. After finding a mechanical hand washed up on the beach, Nell dreams of creating an android companion who might understand her, but she lives in a society where computer code is considered evil. Spare and Found Parts is a truly original creation: part magical realism, part steampunk, it’s a coming-of-age allegory that examines technological progress and an individual’s place in a stratified society. Thanks to the invention of the Goettreider Engine in 1965, which creates limitless power from the Earth’s rotation, the world of 2016 is a post-scarcity utopia. Tom Barren, the narrator of Elan Mastai’s first novel, All Our Wrong Todays (Penguin, £7.99), is a thirtysomething without ambition or much of a future. He is employed on a time travel project – and that’s when the problems begin. After a tragic incident, Barren whisks himself back in time in an attempt to change the future, only to deprive the world of the Goettreider Engine. On returning to the year 2016, he finds himself inhabiting not the utopia of his own timeline but, as it seems to him, the dystopia of our own reality. What follows is an imbroglio of temporal shenanigans as Barren attempts to locate Lionel Goettreider and make amends. All Our Wrong Todays is an entertaining romp that should appeal to fans of The Time Traveler’s Wife. Eric Brown’s latest novel is Binary System (Solaris).

But tradition can go hang. Thanks to Harvey Weinstein and all that has followed in the months since his disgrace, such encounters have a strange new energy, a directness that makes short shrift of such matters as awards season and the ordeal of the red carpet. Journalists want to know if the atmosphere in meetings and on set has changed and, if so, whether such a shift is likely to be permanent; their interviewees accept that, for whatever reason, such questions cannot be ducked. For the time being, then, a certain amount of soul-searching is the order of the day. But perhaps Jason Isaacs would always have been desperate to talk about something other than Monster Family, an animated movie in which he hammily voices Dracula. For one thing, he still hasn’t seen it. For another, far too much of his head space is currently occupied by Donald Trump, a man for whom his fear and loathing seemingly know no bounds. “I’m not a breakfast television presenter,” he says. “I find it hard to go from ‘this fucking monster’ to ‘by the way, my new film opens next week’.” Most of all, though, there is the fact that Jeffrey Tambor, with whom he starred in Armando Iannucci’s satire, The Death of Stalin, is among the ever-growing list of men who now stand accused of sexual misconduct (Tambor, who has denied any wrongdoing, left the award-winning TV series Transparent last November, following allegations of inappropriate language and physical contact). “I found Jeffrey to be so incredibly charming and delightful,” he says. Does he believe that Tambor’s career is now over? “Who knows? America loves nothing more than a second act.” Isaacs, who has already reminded me that he read law at university, believes that the ongoing situation is complicated; he would, you gather, rather run the risk of being quoted out of context than give in to easy platitudes. “I feel deeply uncomfortable that people are being convicted by accusation,” he says. “It’s open to abuse. Trial by Tweet seems extremely dodgy to me. Plus, there’s a difference between rape and inappropriate comments; between kissing and sticking a hand up a skirt. These are not subtle differences for me. They’re binary. I don’t know what Jeffrey’s story is. I just hope that the truth will emerge, and that he will be judged by that. I want to listen to his accusers, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not crushed by this happening to him, because I am. His work is so brilliant. Can anyone ever truly clear their name after the mud is slung? I don’t think they can. Luckily, I live a spectacularly dull, suburban, bourgeois life. No one can accuse me of anything other than bad puns.” Isaacs has just wrapped a series of CBS’s Star Trek: Discovery (he plays Captain Gabriel Lorca); soon, he’ll return to the US to film more episodes of The OA for Netflix. So has the atmosphere changed? He’d surely know if this was the case. “Well, here’s the thing most people don’t realise,” he says: “Whenever you work for a studio, you do a half-day seminar on sexual harassment. Things are laid out very clearly and in a very extreme way. I’ve done so many of them. We’ve all sat through them so many times they’ve become places where you snigger and pass notes to each other. So, the HR rules have been in place for a long time; they certainly don’t need to be amended. It’s more a question of whether the mechanism is enforced. Who would, say, a vulnerable young woman who doesn’t yet have a job report to?” He thinks #MeToo has empowered young women, and that this can only be a good thing. But now men need to change, too. “How do we confront those who contravene the rules?” he asks, possibly thinking aloud. “Like everyone, I’ve been asked: ‘Why have you kept quiet?’ The answer is: because there are defamation laws. You can’t just say: ‘I’ve heard this person is a pig.’ I’ve heard terrible things, but I would be bankrupt if I’d repeated them. There’s one particular man I hope gets caught. Everyone in the industry hopes he’s going to jail very soon. If I have ever witnessed it [harassment], I have challenged it. I have young daughters, and I’m horrified that everywhere I turn, sex is commodified and women are judged by how they look and how much flesh is showing. I’m mortified by it. I feel like King Canute, trying to protect them from it. But I just don’t know how one legislates. The entertainment business is trying its best. Maybe it’s as basic as saying that people mustn’t have meetings in private any more.” It’s no coincidence, he insists, that these allegations have come to light at a time when America has for a president a man who “seems to be a poster boy for predation” – and it’s this non-coincidence that, in his darker moments, keeps him going. “The things Trump says and does encourage the worst instincts in people, but they also provoke change.” Nevertheless, it still seems “ludicrous” and even “a little surreal” to him that so many voters decided to throw their weight behind “such a dangerously unstable and ignorant sham of a man… I still find it bewildering: not that people felt betrayed by the political class, but that this was the man they thought would be able to help them.” Is this why he’s so active on Twitter? “I’m not sure what you mean by active,” he says. “I’m only playing with my mobile phone. I’m not leading marches down Whitehall.” So he doesn’t occasionally get into fights? A weak smile. “I do it because I’m furious. I want to punch the walls. Occasionally, I can’t stop myself. I can’t stand by and listen to that kind of bile. I’m not a saint. I look at their timelines and they’re full of white supremacists and alt-right Breitbart types.” What effect has all this had on how he’s sees the world? Perhaps it would be better not to look. He shakes his head. “I don’t think everyone’s nasty. And I think there have always been [bad] people in the shadows. But… I am fucking terrified. Beyond all the domestic issues, the trade and the tax, and even beyond his cataclysmic attitude to climate change, that the man they support should have his finger on the nuclear button… We’re seven minutes away from the destruction of the planet.” What about art? (I have to admit that I’m slightly amazed to find myself having to nudge an actor in the direction of their work.) Doesn’t it matter now more than ever? “Yes, art can, in difficult times, be cathartic. People still tell me how the characters in Angels in America spoke to them [Isaacs appeared in the first British production of Tony Kushner’s Aids-era play at the National Theatre in 1992]. But if it doesn’t effect change, it’s just a bunch of people wanking in a dark room.” Isaacs is both famous and not-quite-famous-enough. Fans of Harry Potter, for instance, know him as Lucius Malfoy, and today a PR sits vigilantly in a corner of the room (we’re in a cushion-stuffed hotel just off Oxford Street). But by his telling, he can also travel home from a red carpet event by tube and hardly draw so much as a second glance. “I am busy,” he says. “But I’m often not busy, and like everyone I know in this business, I always think: that’s it. The funnel is narrowing. There’s more work for 35-year-olds [he is 54]. That’s why, when I talk at drama schools, I always tell the students to consider taking the reins from day one. Make stuff, I say. There are deeper satisfactions to be had when you’re not placing your id on the line by waiting for someone else to endorse you.” What about his id, though? (And, for that matter, his ego.) In interviews, Isaacs always makes such a point of his abject humility, his blessedness, his determination to be a good father (he has two daughters with his partner, Emma Hewitt). Is this for real, or is it just another disguise? He insists it’s the former. “I’m just a dude who forgets to take out the rubbish,” he says. “I’ve had a good year or two, but there have been other times… I’ve been to Sundance with eight films, and only one of them came out.” Life – or the movies – has taught him to keep things in perspective. “When I was in Peter Pan [he played Mr Darling and Captain Hook in PJ Hogan’s 2003 film], it was going to be gigantic. I was told it would change my life. Be careful, they said; make sure you’ve got the right people in place. Then it came out, and it was a catastrophic flop. It killed my film career stone dead for a while. It was a great lesson. Just have a great time and do the best you can. Sometimes I wish I was more famous; you have more choices as an actor when you are. But I tend to ask: how can I be grateful for the things I’ve got, rather than for the things I haven’t got? Moaning is a waste of life.” He was born in Liverpool, the third of four sons in a tight-knit Jewish family; his father was a jeweller, like his father before him. When Isaacs was 11, they moved to the corner of northwest London where he still lives. He attended Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ School in Elstree – “I thought it was going to be like Tom Brown’s School Days, but it was a direct-grant school then, and still very mixed” – after which he went to Bristol University. “I was good at adapting. I’m quite chameleon-like, but everyone sounded like Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley; they had this ease with each other that I couldn’t even pretend to have.” One day, a bit drunk, he stumbled into an audition, where he was asked if he could do a northern accent. “And I could – that and skateboarding were my only skills – and I found that in the rehearsal room, I didn’t feel so self-conscious about where I was from. The discussions were so intimate and so elemental. It sounds pretentious, but it was all about what makes people love and hate, and I became addicted to it.” After Bristol, then, he went to drama school. Was he ambitious? “No, I drifted into acting, and it has gone well, and I like it. I don’t know if I’d have stuck at it if it hadn’t gone well.” It thrills him that he can still surprise audiences. “When I was sent the script for The Death of Stalin, my honest thought was: this is a mistake. I’m not known for being funny. That’s why I said yes immediately – that and the fact that I’ve been a fan of Armando Iannucci since university.” It was his idea to play General Zhukov with a Yorkshire accent (Brian Glover was his inspiration). Did it feel risky? Not everyone is willing to see the funny side of torture and mass murder. “Yes. I knew it could be an extraordinary misfire in terms of taste, but then I looked at the cast list, and I thought: I don’t care if it goes down in flames. Only when I saw it with an audience did I know it had worked. Fuck me, I thought. It’s brilliant!” What will we see him in next? He isn’t quite sure. Look Away, a thriller directed by Assaf Bernstein, should come out this year (it co-stars Mira Sorvino, one of Weinstein’s alleged victims). But the release date of The Palace, a film about the 2008 attacks at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai starring Dev Patel and Armie Hammer, remains unknown. “It was with the Weinstein Company,” he says. And so we end up – somehow, it seems inevitable – right back where we began. Monster Family is in cinemas and on Sky Cinema now. The Death of Stalin is out on digital, DVD &amp; Blu-ray now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-mujadara-with-spiced-chicken-livers","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T14:00:12Z","webTitle":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for mujadara with spiced chicken livers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-mujadara-with-spiced-chicken-livers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-mujadara-with-spiced-chicken-livers","fields":{"headline":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for mujadara with spiced chicken livers","bodyText":"Middle Easterners can give Italians a run for their money when it comes to comfort food, with endless bowls of warming dips, mouthwatering flatbreads and wonderful stews. Today’s recipe, mujadara, is one of my desert-island dishes: a resplendent pile of steaming rice and tender lentils topped with crisp, caramelised onions. The core ingredients may be humble, but the combination is pure luxury, especially when dressed with creamy yoghurt and sweet pomegranate. Add spiced chicken livers to the mix, and you have a quick meal that’s fit for a king. Mujadara with spiced chicken livers The flavours here are sweet and nuanced but if you love heat you can sprinkle the finished dish with Turkish chilli or the spicier cayenne. Prep 10-15 min Cook 45 min Serves 4-6 200g brown lentils 20g butter 2 tbsp olive oil 2 large red onions, peeled and finely sliced Salt and black pepper 200g basmati rice, washed 1 cinnamon stick 1 bay leaf For the livers 600g chicken livers, trimmed, pieces kept as large as possible 1 ½ tsp cumin seeds, ground 2-3 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp smoked paprika 30g butter 2 tbsp pomegranate molasses 4 tbsp Greek yoghurt, to serve Seeds from ½ pomegranate, to serve Make the mujadara first. Rinse the lentils in cold water, empty into a pan, cover with water, bring to a boil and simmer for about 15 minutes, until tender but still keeping their shape. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, melt the butter with the oil in a large, deep pan over a medium heat. Add the onions, season generously and cook, stirring often, for 20-25 minutes, until they turn golden and are starting to crisp up. Scoop out half the onions, then turn up the heat and cook the rest until dark golden and crisp at the edges. Transfer these to a bowl, then put the onions you took out earlier back in the pan with the rice, cinnamon, lentils, bay leaf and half a teaspoon of sea salt. Add 700ml boiling water, cover and leave to simmer for 15 minutes, until the rice is just cooked. Check and adjust the seasoning, then cover the rice. Put a large, heavy-based frying pan on a medium-high heat. Season the livers with salt, pepper and cumin. Once the pan is smoking hot, add a tablespoon of oil and fry a third to half the livers (the amount will depend on the size of your pan) for a minute on each side, until golden brown and firm to the touch. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining livers in one or two more batches. Once all the livers are browned, return them to the pan and add the paprika, butter and molasses. Stir to coat and, once the butter has melted and emulsified into a silky sauce, turn off the heat. Spoon the rice and lentil mix into bowls, and top with the livers and sauce. Add a dollop of yoghurt, sprinkle over the golden onions and pomegranate seeds, and serve. And for the rest of the week… If you have any leftover pomegranates, juice them and turn the results into pomegranate molasses, pomegranate ice-cream (surprisingly good) or just keep the seeds for breakfast – I love them on yoghurt and granola. Once cooked, the lentils keep for a few days: reheat in a frying pan, so you get lovely, golden, crunchy bits on the base of the pan, then pair with a crisp chicory salad.

It’s the figure skater Adam Rippon, discussing his unexpectedly good run at the Winter Olympics. A reporter asks him why he’s now skating better than ever before. He shrugs gently, with a glint of mischief in his eye, then says: “I can’t explain witchcraft.” Many people over the age of 35 will have grown up with astrology as a form of light entertainment: big, cartoonish, campy personalities like Mystic Meg and Russell Grant, hidden away in the back pages of newspapers and women’s magazines, picking lucky numbers and promising the intervention of tall, dark, handsome strangers. But the women (and men) who Broadly speaks to may have a different grasp of astrology. That’s why traffic to the site’s horoscopes is growing so rapidly. At The Cut, a site focused on fashion and trends for a similar, millennial audience, staff say that a typical horoscope post got 150% more hits last year than in 2016. There is a growing familiarity with the patterns and positions of the planets, and it’s not uncommon to hear people in their late teens and 20s talking about, say, “Mercury in retrograde” and “Saturn returns” with confidence and authority. They know that a “star sign” is a sun sign, and that for any half-decent attempt at a reading, you need to know your exact time and place of birth, so you can discuss, with equal reverence, the influence of your rising sign and moon sign, too. It’s part of a broader shift, one that finds magic and mysticism referenced regularly in popular culture. In the fashion world, labels such as Vetements and Valentino have featured zodiac signs, constellations and cosmic patterns. The high street has followed the trend. An episode of TV show Broad City used a coven of witches in Central Park as its way of digesting the election of Trump – it makes more sense if you watch it. Especially if you’re one of the estimated 800,000 Wiccans in the world. In the UK alone, 60,000 people identify as pagan. There’s also a social networking app, Co-Star, which sees just how compatible you are with your friends and lovers, based on their birth charts. “My personal belief is that people tend to turn to mysticism, spirituality and the occult in uncertain times,” Tsjeng suggests. “And I feel that young people, especially, are living in one of the most uncertain times ever, at least in my living memory. There’s an increasing willingness to question the arranged order, break out of pre-defined social norms and look for answers elsewhere.” Recently, I interviewed a young rapper, a man in his early 20s, as he was about to release his first album. On a break from a photoshoot, we got talking about the emotional ups and downs of suddenly finding oneself in the spotlight. “I guess I’m a Cancer as well,” he said, casually. “I try to be tough on the outside, but inside, I’m soft as shit.” “Are you needy?” I asked him. “That’s a Cancer thing, right?” He laughed. “I’ll never tell anybody, but I really am needy. So needy.” The ease with which we fell into using astrological language as a shorthand for personality traits was striking. It also felt like a gentle, unthreatening way of discussing deeper emotions. “Like many people, I came to astrology at a moment of personal crisis and feeling lost,” says Francesca Lisette, 30, who has spent the past decade studying the subject. “I had gone from being able-bodied to suffering with chronic and life-restricting pain, and the invisibility of my pain also led me to wonder about the invisible DNA of my personality. Perhaps I solve my pain, or at least rationalise it.” She recently completed an apprenticeship in traditional astrology and now practises readings under the name the Glitter Oracle. “I quickly drummed up a birth chart on astro-newbie favourite Café Astrology and read through it, thinking it sounded exactly like me, but was also full of contradictions,” she explains, and put its inconsistencies down to it being computer-generated. “That was the moment at which I became obsessed with understanding how to read a chart with the skill of an experienced astrologer.” The idea of turning to an existing belief system in a time of crisis is as universal as it is familiar. Daisy Jones, 25, grew up in a household where astrology was “like a religion” and regularly had her tarot cards read by her grandmother. “But I would say it was a relatively background entity until just over a year ago, when I went through a major break-up and moved house, and my life felt like it was in a state of flux,” she says. “So as somebody who isn’t religious, it felt like something to embrace during a particularly uncertain period.” Both Lisette and Jones point to the popularity of astrology among women and those who identify as queer, partly, Lisette thinks, because astrology offers an alternative to systems that no longer seem to be working – especially for outsiders. “That’s definitely something I like about it. It’s a system of beliefs not defined by hierarchy or power structures,” adds Jones. Roy Gillett is president of the Astrological Association of Great Britain, and has been a practising astrologer for the past 40 years. He says he has noticed an uptake in millennials turning not only to sun signs, but also seeking out a deeper understanding of the science on which the system is based. (Sceptics will say that it is not science-based; practitioners will argue roots in astronomy and connections to quantum physics.) “I think what’s happened to people in their late teens and 20s, and younger people even more so, is a sense of betrayal by conventional knowledge,” he explains. “I know that’s a strong statement to make, but if you think about the circumstances that a person at university finds themselves in right now, compared with me when I was at university, or even my children… There is a lack of values everywhere you look. The things you relied on don’t seem to be reliable. In that sort of culture, you look for something underpinning everything.” Gillett also points to the internet enabling people to share ideas on a scale not seen before. It’s no coincidence that there is a thriving astrological community online, from Tumblr culture to YouTube astrologers to straight-talking daily sun sign advice, even if it is communicated in pop-up notifications from an app giving an emoji thumbs-up to, say, “sex and magic” for the day. “Over most of the years I’ve been involved, the relationship between astrology and popular culture and society in general has been rather frozen in an extreme, of most people thinking it’s just the sun signs in the newspapers,” explains Gillett. “They think that anybody who follows it is away with the fairies, because it’s just so generalised.” Now, he says, there’s an articulate and informed discussion going on based on the massive expanse of knowledge people have at their fingertips. The “away with the fairies” argument is a default criticism, whether it’s Richard Dawkins debunking star signs on his documentary The Enemies of Reason, or the notion that astrology is akin to clairvoyance, that it can be used to predict lottery numbers or who’s going to win the Grand National. Lisette says she is not very good at arguing the benefits of astrology to those already set against it. “I’m not terribly invested in convincing people to see the world the way that I do. I already know that astrology works. It’s rather like somebody saying: ‘Kicking a ball around is boring and pointless.’ OK, but there are still billions of people around the world who get something out of it.” Besides, she adds, you have to extensively engage with astrology to see how it might relate to your life, and most sceptics won’t do that. With this in mind, and having spent weeks talking to people about their experiences of astrology, I decided to get my birth chart read. I found Leigh Oswald, an astrologer in my home city, and sent her an email asking if she’d give me a reading, and let me write about the experience. Oswald has been an astrologer for more than 40 years, and wrote regular columns for the magazine Artnet that leaned towards socio-political interpretations of planetary positions. After some discussion, she said she would be happy to meet me and read my chart, and answer my questions, if it would help explain some of the misconceptions about astrology. There were unavoidable issues – she was sorry she already knew I was a journalist but, of course, she would not look me up before we met. I know cynics will doubt this, but I’m certain she’d stuck to her word. Besides, Mercury rules my ascendant Virgo, so my intuition is strong. The reading was uncannily accurate and I have thought about it every day since it happened. She offered clear and precise pictures of the kinds of people I am drawn to, as friends and as partners, and why that might be. We talked about health, diet, political and social leanings, and ways of seeing the world. It felt like a detailed dissection of my personality, including parts of it that I would not offer up willingly to a stranger. It was a personal, probing and, at times, therapeutic discussion about vast, emotional life issues. It made me think about how I can address things that I have been unhappy with, and push myself in areas that I have been too afraid to. At the end of it, we hugged, and I felt extremely grateful for her time and insight. It is not a common experience, for me at least, to take that kind of time to stop and think. Whether that’s because I believe the position of the planets at my time of birth shaped my personality in some as-yet-inexplicable way, and as such can offer lessons as to how to navigate life, or whether it’s because it was a moment to stop and think about what was weighing on my mind seems largely irrelevant, given how galvanising the whole experience was. “There’s a saying that sun sign astrology is a silly nursery rhyme. A proper birth chart is a complex symphony, because we’re all so complicated,” explained Oswald. “We’re all a mess of contradictions. I’m a great believer that the more we can know about ourselves the more we can accept ourselves, and make good decisions between our weaknesses and strengths.” Zing Tsjeng has a more pragmatic approach, but nevertheless, it’s one that gets to the same beating heart of why astrology can hold such fascination, and how that can, in turn, be made useful. “When I read stuff like: ‘Pisces season is an important time for Librans not to get walked over,’ I don’t believe I’m doomed to get walked over that month just because of some random celestial moment that I have no control over,” she explains. “It just prompts me to think, hmm, is there a part of my life where I feel this way? What can I do to avoid that? It gives me a chance to check in with my own thoughts and where I’m at in my life.” Astrology: reading your stars The app: Co-Star This relatively new app provides a basic birth chart and daily horoscopes, but with the social network-ey addition of letting you see how well you’re suited to friends and loved ones who have done the same.

According to analysis of newly released figures, the sale of 126 court premises in England and Wales since 2010 has raised a total of £34m – each going for little more than the average house price. The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, has accused the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) of pursuing sell-offs aggressively before a £1bn court modernisation programme – relying on remote video hearings and online mechanisms – has proved viable. His comments have been reinforced by the justice select committee, which has written to the MoJ pointing out that plans to change the way in which travel-to-court times are measured may undermine the presumption that defendants and witnesses can attend a hearing and return within a day. The closure of Northallerton magistrates court could force court users to travel instead to Harrogate, for example, a journey by bus which takes three hours and 22 minutes one way. “We question the assumption that virtual hearings will, and should, increasingly take the place of physical access to hearing rooms,” the MPs on the committee cautioned. Since 2010, the MoJ has closed at least 230 crown, county and magistrates courts. The initial rationale was that crime levels and the number of court cases were falling. Some of the buildings have yet to be sold. The money raised and savings achieved are being diverted into the court modernisation programme. A breakdown of the figures, which were released in a parliamentary question, show that £224m has been raised so far. Almost two-thirds of that sum was generated by the sale of just nine courts on prime sites in and around London. Hammersmith magistrates court made £43m, the technology and construction court in central London fetched £25m and Horseferry Road magistrates court went for £20m. At the opposite end of the scale, Ely magistrates court was disposed of for just £1, Rochdale magistrates court was auctioned for £6,316 and Consett country court made only £13,735. The 100 cheapest courthouse disposals, Labour researchers calculated, raised just £19.8m in total. Many buildings were undistinguished, municipal architecture dating back to the 1970s and 80s. Some buildings have found other uses. Knutsford crown court, which dates back to the early 19th century, was sold for £1.6m and became a hotel and restaurant. “These figures do nothing to assuage fears that the government’s wave of court sell-offs is driven by blinkered ideology with scant regard for the impact on access to justice in whole swathes of the country,” Burgon said. “Selling off over a hundred local courts each for not much more than the average UK house price piles yet more pressure on the remaining courts and risks hearings being further delayed and rescheduled. This can have a distressing impact on victims and witnesses and creates a justice system that’s less accessible for local people. “The Conservatives justify their mass sell-off of local justice facilities with talk of the digitisation of our courts .... Despite awarding contracts worth tens of millions, the government has admitted to not undertaking sufficient research on the effectiveness of court hearings by video link and still refuses to publish the business case for this modernisation programme.” In the Commons on Tuesday, the Labour MP Ruth George said that the closure of Buxton magistrates court meant her constituents had to travel 40 miles to court. “The police say it now takes a whole day to take someone to court and back,” she said. The shadow justice minister Yasmin Qureshi called for a moratorium on court closures until the new court bill had been debated by parliament. Steve Hynes, the director of the Legal Action Group, which campaigns for better access to justice, said he feared people would decline to be witnesses or bring claims. “I can foresee real difficulties in witnesses getting to court,” he said. An MoJ spokesperson said: “This government is investing over £1bn to reform and modernise the justice system – making it more convenient, easier to use, and providing better value for the taxpayer. “Since April 2016 we have raised £115m from the sale of underused court buildings – over £34m more than forecast, and every penny of this will be reinvested as part of our modernisation plans. As we increase the use of digital services, it makes sense to consider the wider role and need for court buildings.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/06/olivier-awards-2018-complete-list-of-nominations","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T13:44:41Z","webTitle":"Olivier awards 2018: complete list of nominations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/06/olivier-awards-2018-complete-list-of-nominations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/06/olivier-awards-2018-complete-list-of-nominations","fields":{"headline":"Olivier awards 2018: complete list of nominations","bodyText":"Best actor in a supporting role in a musical Michael Jibson for Hamilton at Victoria Palace theatre Ross Noble for Young Frankenstein at Garrick theatre Jason Pennycooke for Hamilton at Victoria Palace theatre Cleve September for Hamilton at Victoria Palace theatre Best actress in a supporting role in a musical Sheila Atim for Girl from the North Country at the Old Vic Tracie Bennett for Follies at National theatre – Olivier Rachel John for Hamilton at Victoria Palace theatre Lesley Joseph for Young Frankenstein at Garrick theatre Outstanding achievement in music Everybody’s Talking About Jamie – music and orchestrations by Dan Gillespie Sells, his debut as a musical theatre composer and orchestrator at Apollo theatre Follies – the orchestra, under the music supervision of Nicholas Skilbeck and music director Nigel Lilley at National theatre – Olivier Girl from the North Country – music and lyrics by Bob Dylan, original orchestrations and arrangements by Simon Hale at the Old Vic Hamilton – composer-lyricist Lin-Manuel Miranda at Victoria Palace theatre Best new dance production Flight Pattern by Crystal Pite at Royal Opera House Goat by Ben Duke for Rambert Dance Company at Sadler’s Wells Grand Finale by Hofesh Shechter at Sadler’s Wells Tree of Codes by Wayne McGregor and the Paris Opera Ballet at Sadler’s Wells Outstanding achievement in dance Rocío Molina for pushing the boundary of flamenco in Fallen From Heaven (Caída del Cielo) at Barbican theatre Francesca Velicu for her performance in English National Ballet’s production of Pina Bausch’s Le Sacre du Printemps at Sadler’s Wells Zenaida Yanowsky for her performance in Liam Scarlett’s Symphonic Dances at Royal Opera House Best entertainment and family David Walliams’ Gangsta Granny at Garrick theatre Derren Brown: Underground at Playhouse theatre Dick Whittington at London Palladium Five Guys Named Moe at Marble Arch theatre Best theatre choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler for Hamilton at Victoria Palace theatre Bill Deamer for Follies at National theatre – Olivier Kate Prince for Everybody’s Talking About Jamie at Apollo theatre Randy Skinner for 42nd Street at Theatre Royal Drury Lane Christopher Wheeldon for An American in Paris at Dominion theatre Best musical revival 42nd Street at Theatre Royal Drury Lane Follies at National Theatre – Olivier On the Town at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre Best actor in a musical Ciarán Hinds for Girl From the North Country at the Old Vic John McCrea for Everybody’s Talking About Jamie at Apollo theatre Giles Terera for Hamilton at Victoria Palace theatre Jamael Westman for Hamilton at Victoria Palace theatre Best actress in a musical Janie Dee for Follies at National theatre – Olivier Shirley Henderson for Girl From the North Country at the Old Vic Imelda Staunton for Follies at National theatre – Olivier Josie Walker for Everybody’s Talking About Jamie at Apollo theatre Best revival Angels in America at National theatre – Lyttelton Hamlet at Almeida theatre Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

A surprisingly nimble logistical reshuffle means Elbow take to the Hydro stage just three days later than advertised, even if it means that, instead of riding a wave of rowdy Friday night excitement, the Manchester veterans are required to overcome some chilly Monday blues. It is not the first crisis Elbow have had to negotiate in recent years. Drummer and founder member Richard Jupp left the band, by all accounts abruptly, in 2016. After a brief period of soul-searching and creative readjustment, Elbow seemed to come out swinging in 2017, bookending the year with a well-received seventh album Little Fictions and a muscular, stocking-ready best-of collating the highlights of their remarkable two-decade career. But the schism still seems to have left a mark. Garvey pays heartfelt tribute to Jupp twice over the course of this show, while also taking care to warmly introduce his touring replacement, Alex Reeves. Garvey’s crumpled pub-quizzer charisma has always been Elbow’s secret weapon, a sly counterpoint to their unapologetically earnest brand of skyscraping indie rock. The singer does not even need to speak, getting his first cheers simply by theatrically supping a pint and rolling up his shirtsleeves to signal his readiness. He gently teases guitarist Mark Potter, and characterises his relationship with Potter’s keyboardist brother Craig as a “27-year power struggle”, while also rather unsportingly threatening to tickle him during the spare, heartsick piano ballad Puncture Repair. These cheeky asides – what Garvey calls “spontaneous frontmanship” – leaven a two-hour set in which the music broils like a stormy sky, bolstered by some sonic sleight-of-hand that makes Elbow’s all-female, four-piece string-and-brass section sound like an entire orchestra. If the venue is at less than capacity (Garvey reckons three-quarters of the original ticket-holders made it to the rescheduled date), the massed terrace chant of “build a rocket boys!” during the nostalgic, waltz-time sway of Lippy Kids has stadium-filling force. The showstopping Grounds for Divorce is preceded by Garvey forcefully cajoling and coaching different sections of the venue into creating an impressively harmonised chord that segues into the song’s addictive chain-gang stomp. When the band return for the encore, Garvey also brings out their impressively bearded support act, John Grant, for Kindling (Fickle Flame), a standout from Little Fictions recently reimagined and rerecorded as a duet to celebrate Grant and Elbow’s burgeoning bromance. Garvey and Grant – who, rather cutely, seem to be wearing almost identical outfits – pass off lines to each other before coming together for a series of swooning harmonies. The final song is, inevitably, One Day Like This, Elbow’s lush signature track that has proved durable enough to be synonymous with both the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. There is some expected (and extended) audience participation, although Garvey seems tickled by the addition of an extra Flower of Scotland singalong once the last chords have died away. For a country still shaking off the paralysing effects of record snowfall, Elbow’s combination of warmth and grit feels like the perfect care package.

The director general of licensing is extending strict alcohol bans in Tennant Creek, citing feedback that the town was “unrecognisable” in its improvement, however the minister, Gerry Barkly, who is also the local MP, said that was more due to people going to other towns that did not have restrictions. Following the “horrific” alleged rape of a two-year-old girl by a 24-year-old man last month, members of the Tennant Creek community accused the government of failing to address their pleas for help with high rates of alcohol and drug abuse, violence, and child protection issues. The government has since launched an action plan to improve services in Tennant Cree, including immediate increase in welfare staff and services. McCarthy, the MP for Barkly which encompasses Tennant Creek, said the community had gone through a stage of anger following the alleged assault, but had emerged with “a real sense of responsibility”. “We need to work together to be united and accept the fact that you can’t always blame government, you can’t always blame somebody,” he said. “If we know there are vulnerable children and families it’s our responsibility to wrap our arms around and direct them towards services that can support them.” When asked if that applied to family members who had raised concerns about the safety of young victim of the alleged rape with Territory Families, McCarthy said Territory Families was only one agency, there were others, and people couldn’t just rely on bureaucratic systems. McCarthy also defended the government’s response to letters it received from Tennant Creek residents last year, asking for help following a spate of suicides. He said services were provided and while the government could do better, “the community also need to change their tack”. “When you see, hear and experience significant trauma but not much changes in the general community – particularly underpinned by alcohol misuse and harm – then you have to question the integrity of how willing people are to participate in making these necessary changes.” Barb Shaw, the general manager of the Anyinginyi Health Aboriginal Corporation, said she agreed that greater personal and family responsibility was needed, but it was a “generalised comment”. “We’ve got families in Tennant Creek where dysfunction is at the point where parents themselves are not in the position to take that first step of taking responsibility,” she said. “We’ve got to work with parents so we’re helping them get to a place to take that responsibility.” Shaw said the feeling of being a “forgotten town” was real for people in Tennant Creek, and there were major issues in the way governments cared for people in regional and remote Australia, including a lack of community policing models. “It’s home, it’s country. There has to be a better way for how you roll out services to regional Australia, and they shouldn’t be knee-jerk,” she said. “It’s disappointing that what happened had to happen to make government motivated, that’s the saddest part about it.” Shaw said the community of Tennant Creek would take time to recover, but the alleged assault had sparked “fierce conversations”, and the immediate government response had been impressive and it was engaging with elders. A week-long set of emergency restriction on alcohol sales – declared by the NT director general of licensing, Cindy Bravos, after the alleged assault – was extended for another seven days. The restrictions ban the sale of takeaway alcohol outside of 3pm and 6pm, Monday to Saturday, and limit sales to one case of beer, two bottles of wine or one bottle of spirits per person. Bravos said she’d received reports of less violence, less fighting and more children staying at home, as well as anecdotal police feedback on fewer callouts and fewer incidents of domestic violence involving aggravated assault. Bravos also included excerpts from a letter written by a youth centre coordinator reporting that while they usually “dreaded” the Sunday night shift, this time the town was “unrecognisable” in its improvement. Local liquor outlets were unhappy with the impact of restrictions on their sales but Bravos said they had a vested interest and it was understandable they had a different viewpoint. McCarthy said there was “no doubt the town has quietened down” but it was more due to people leaving for places like Mount Isa and Alice Springs to avoid the restrictions. “If we continue to rely on a prohibitionist approach, we continue to provide opportunities to exploit the system, and people move into other areas,” he told Guardian Australia.

It’s costly to the country that implements the protectionism and it’s costly to everyone else.” “How damaging will it be? It remains open ... This could turn very badly though if it escalates.” The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, warned last week that the controversial plan to impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on imported aluminium could spark a trade war and lead to global recession. On Wednesday Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, quit after reportedly joining the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, in opposing the plan. Meanwhile the Australian economy grew by a weaker than expected 2.4% last year, despite a record surge in jobs, according to Bureau of Statistics data. “From a growth perspective, the Australian economy closed out 2017 in a lukewarm fashion,” Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird said. December quarter growth figures were published on Wednesday, providing the final picture for the economy for 2017. Economists say the year ended with various measures of wage and income growth increasing slightly, which was a welcome development. The annual growth rate of compensation of employees rose from 3.1% to a five-and-a-half year high of 4.8%, reflecting a lift in the number of people employed, and hours worked, in a soft wage growth environment. But since wages growth hit record lows midway through last year, households continued their trend last year of running down their savings to support consumption, pushing the household savings rate down to a minuscule 2.7% – a decline from the post-financial crisis peak of over 10%. That helped consumption growth record a surprisingly solid 1% in the final three months of last year, underpinned by a strong lift in retail sales and discretionary spending on hotels, cafes and restaurants. But economists warn it is difficult to see households being confident enough to run down their savings further in 2018. “This was a strong quarter for consumers but it is unlikely to be repeated in early 2018, with the latest retail data showing poor growth in spending over January,” AMP Capital’s Shane Oliver told his clients. The solid consumer spending in the December quarter was offset by a strong fall in private infrastructure activity, which dropped 10.3% in three months, as mining investment continued to wind down. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said he was happy with the way things were headed, because 2.4% growth was on track with the economic outlook the government provided in its midyear update. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the GDP data was a disappointing result that came in below market expectations. “At a time when the global economy is as strong as it’s been since the global financial crisis, it makes this result here in Australia even more disappointing,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/07/us-cancer-guidelines-study-british-medical-journal","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T23:30:11Z","webTitle":"US cancer network recommending expensive drugs based on weak evidence, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/07/us-cancer-guidelines-study-british-medical-journal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/07/us-cancer-guidelines-study-british-medical-journal","fields":{"headline":"US cancer network recommending expensive drugs based on weak evidence, study finds","bodyText":"Guidelines for American oncologists often recommend expensive and harmful cancer drugs for patients based on “weak evidence”, according to a new study in the British Medical Journal. The BMJ research looked at drugs recommended for conditions not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, a practice called “off-label” prescribing. Off-label prescribing, or using a drug for purposes that may be well known but not approved by a regulatory agency, is common, especially in oncology. But recently approved cancer drugs can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and have severe side-effects. “They’re not your grandpa’s old cytotoxic drugs,” said Vinay Prasad, an oncologist at the Oregon Health and Sciences University, referring to early cancer drugs. “They are $100,000 drugs. They bring $1bn per year to the drugmakers.” Prasad, the study’s lead author, said: “It would be one thing if we were talking about drugs that were cheap and have no side-effects.” He added that many recently approved cancer drugs “have risk-benefit analyses that are just tilted toward benefit. [But] you can get to a net harm condition.” Prasad’s study looked at the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a body that publishes guidelines developed by oncologists. The NCCN’s recommendations influence treatment decisions and determine which cancer drugs insurers are required to pay for. Medicare, a US public health insurance program for 55 million elderly and disabled Americans, is required to pay for all conditions NCCN recommends. Many private insurers follow suit. The NCCN’s role is similar to that of the National Institute for Health Care Excellence (Nice) in the United Kingdom. In oncology, between 50% and 75% of current prescriptions are off-label, according to some estimates. It is illegal for drugmakers to advertise drugs for off-label uses. Prasad’s study focused on 47 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2011 and 2015. The FDA approved those drug for 69 different indications. However, the NCCN recommended those drugs for 113 indications, 44 more indications than the FDA approved. Only a minority of those additional recommendations were based on either randomized controlled trials (23%), considered the gold standard, or advanced-level phase three trials (16%). The team also followed up after 20 months on whether the FDA eventually approved medications for those 44 additional indications NCCN recommended. Only 14% were eventually approved by the FDA. The study concluded that the research “raises concern that the NCCN justifies the coverage of costly, toxic drugs based on weak evidence”. The report comes after recent research that found 90% of the researchers and physicians who helped develop the NCCN received money from the pharmaceutical industry. “It’s clear with cancer drugs, one has to be very judicious about using them beyond where they’ve been studied,” said Prasad. His advice to patients who might be trying new treatments is to ask about existing evidence. “If you’re a cancer patient, I think it is so easy to get drawn into a discussion where the doctor starts to tell you of how a treatment should work,” said Prasad. “Patients have to force doctors to change the conversation from ‘how might this help me’, to ‘what is the evidence this drug helps patients like me?’” Robert Carlson, the chief executive of the NCCN, said the guidelines rely on the “strongest scientific evidence available”. “[The] NCCN’s 1,355 panel members come from 27 leading academic cancer centers in the United States,” he said. “Their expertise allows them to evaluate complex circumstances based on all available data, in order to come to a consensus about what constitutes optimal care.” This article was amended on 8 March 2018 to correct a misquote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/mar/07/brexit-mps-warn-trade-with-70-countries-could-fall-off-cliff-edge-if-government-doesnt-clarify-transition-plans-soon-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:48:53Z","webTitle":"Brexit: Hammond says UK would reject any trade deal not including financial services - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/07/brexit-mps-warn-trade-with-70-countries-could-fall-off-cliff-edge-if-government-doesnt-clarify-transition-plans-soon-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/07/brexit-mps-warn-trade-with-70-countries-could-fall-off-cliff-edge-if-government-doesnt-clarify-transition-plans-soon-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: Hammond says UK would reject any trade deal not including financial services - Politics live","bodyText":"Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has signalled that the UK would reject any UK-EU trade deal that did not include financial services. (See 5.30pm.) The EU has dismissed Theresa May’s vision for a post-Brexit trade relationship, laying out instead the offer of a deal that it concedes will be economically damaging to both the UK and the rest of Europe. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, has said there should be an “association agreement” between the UK and the EU after Brexit. Speaking at a news conference to mark the publication of a resolution on UK-EU trade, which MEPs are expected to vote for next week, he said: In order to break the deadlock we now face, I believe it is important that the UK Government now seriously considers engaging with the European Parliament’s proposal for an association agreement, as catered for by Article 217 of the EU Treaty. I am convinced this will allow both the EU and the UK to unlock a lasting deep and special partnership for the future. We look forward to receiving some further clarifications from the British government regarding citizen’s rights, as a number of outstanding issues remain unresolved. We do not accept the United Kingdom’s negotiating position that maintains discriminations between EU citizens arriving before and after the start of the transition period. The parliament’s resolution broadly reflects the position set out in the EU’s guidelines published earlier in the day. Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, said: As far as the European Parliament is concerned, the principles governing our future relations are clear: single market integrity must be preserved, a third country cannot be treated more favourably than an EU member state and a level playing field is essential. Labour has said the British government must be held partly responsible for civilian casualties in Yemen, after Jeremy Corbyn challenged Theresa May over the lavish welcome for the visiting Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The Saudi crown prince faced heavy criticism from British opposition figures at the start of a three-day visit to the UK that includes lunch with the Queen and dinner with the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. Labour has demanded that the government reverse its decision to cancel the second part of the Leveson inquiry into the press after a series of allegations by a former “blagger” about work on behalf of the Sunday Times. Technology cannot make the Irish border completely frictionless after Brexit, a leading academic in Belfast has said. As Lisa O’Carroll reports, Katy Hayward analysed every possible Brexit scenario for Northern Ireland and found that some checks and stops will be needed on the border after the UK leaves the EU. “Smart border technology is primarily a means of enhancing efficiency. It cannot make a hard border frictionless,” said Hayward, a political sociologist at Queen’s University. “A hard border is not just determined by its visibility.” A review of controversial legal aid cuts could be delayed, Justice Secretary David Gauke has told MPs. As the Press Association reports, The review of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act was promised by Gauke’s predecessor David Lidington and had been due to conclude by the summer. But Gauke said that timetable was “ambitious” and insisted it was “more important to get this right” than to meet the deadline. Although he did not give an estimate of when the work would now be completed, he told MPs on the Commons justice committee that he did not want it “slipping into next year”. When the review was launched in October 2017, MPs were told the work would be concluded by Parliament’s summer recess at the end of July. Gauke said today: I think it is more important to get this right rather than to fit a particular time frame. I think it is likely that it will take us longer to do that than the summer timetable. Former Carillion directors appeared to be more concerned about their pay deals than the operation of the company in the year leading up to its collapse, according to evidence given to MPs by City investment firm BlackRock. Female activists in the Tory party are outnumbered more than three to one by their male counterparts, and there are significantly fewer women than men in all the main parties, research has revealed. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Greg Hands, the international trade minister, was giving evidence to the Commons international trade committee this morning. His evidence got rather overlooked by everything else, but here are a couple of tweets about what he said. From the FT’s Jim Pickard From the Institute of Directors’ Allie Renison Philip Hammond has put Britain on a collision course with Brussels after he warned the government could reject any Brexit trade deal not including financial services. Speaking at the headquarters of HSBC at Canary Wharf in the heart of the financial district on Wednesday, the chancellor said a trade deal “will only happen” if it balanced the interests of both the UK and the EU. “It’s hard to see any deal that did not include financial services can look like a fair and balanced deal,” he said. His speech moves talks with Europe to yet another impasse, after the EU council president Donald Tusk warned earlier on Wednesday the UK would not be allowed to “cherry pick” what it liked in trade talks with Brussels. Tusk suggested a Canada-style free trade deal was the only one on the cards, which would be likely not to include comprehensive coverage of services. The speech also puts the chancellor in direct opposition to his French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire, who intervened on Tuesday evening to rule out financial services being part of a trade deal. “We don’t believe that financial services can be part of an FTA,” Le Maire said in a speech in London. Hammond’s speech will be seen as a rebuke to the EU’s negotiating position, while he also warned that any attempts by European countries to steal financial services business from London would backfire. He said: Those who think that the major winners for any fragmentation of London’s markets would be Paris or Frankfurt, Dublin or Luxembourg should take note. The real beneficiaries are more likely to be New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong, cutting Europe’s market share. And leaving Europe as a whole, less competitive and more reliant on distant financial centres, operating under very different rules. Verhofstadt says the EU has to be reformed to make it work. And that’s it. The press conference is over. Here is the full statement from the parliament on the resolution on a UK-EU trade deal to be debated next week. And here is the text of the resolution (pdf). Q: You propose cooperation in corporate taxation. The EU does not have cooperation on this, so why are you proposing tougher conditions for the UK on this? Verhofstadt suggests what the MEPs are proposing is in line with current practice. He suggests the EU does not want to have a country on its borders providing unfair competition on tax. Q: Where does the European parliament have a different position to the European commission’s or the European council’s? Verhofstadt says it is not a matter of having a different position; he says the point is that the parliament’s plan is more precise. Verhofstadt says MEPs are also pushing for a final deal on citizens’ rights. And he says the UK Home Office has been invited to Brussels to discuss this. Guy Verhofstadt is speaking now. He says the parliament’s resolution runs to 65 paragraphs. It will be debated on Tuesday next week, and put to a vote on Wednesday. He says the parliament’s guidelines are intended to establish a bridge between the UK’s red lines and the EU’s red lines. He says the parliament is proposing an association agreement. Without that, you could up with a relationship like the EU’s with Switzerland, which is governed by 100-plus agreements. With the UK, the parliament wants the opposite, one overarching agreement, he says. MEPs propose an “association agreement” between the EU and the UK. Antonio Tajani is speaking now. He says MEPs will not allow sector-by-sector participation in the single market. Theresa May’s red lines leave little room for any alternative, he says. He says there will have to be a free trade agreement. It could go a bit further than other ones, but the Canadian and Japanese deals will be the mothers of what gets offered to the EU. This is from AFP’s Danny Kemp. Tajani says UK-EU trade deal could go “deeper” than Canada’s. He says the European parliament is still waiting for a plan that would avoid a hard border in Ireland. He says he does not want to discuss the transition period. But MEPs will not accept anything that discriminates against EU nationals arriving in the UK during the transition. Tajani says he has to leave now because he is going to Spain. Antonio Tajani, the president of the European parliament, and Guy Verhofstadt, the parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, are about to hold a press conference on Brexit. They will present the resolution that will be put to a vote in the parliament next week setting out the parliament’s demands for a UK-EU trade deal. The European parliament is not negotiating Brexit and, although it will have to approve the final deal, in practice it is expected to rubber-stamp what the European commission and the European council have agreed. But that doesn’t make it powerless. In Legislation at Westminster, an important new academic study looking at exactly what influence parliamentarians and other players exercise when legislation is getting passed, Meg Russell and Daniel Gover write at length about the power of “anticipated reactions” - in other words, how the executive is constrained in what it tries to get through parliament by what it knows MPs and peers will and will not expect. The same principle applies in Brussels, where the parliament’s “anticipated reaction” power is significant. There is a live feed here. Here is Theresa May with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, outside Number 10. And here are protesters in Whitehall demonstrating against his visit. The EU regularly accuses the UK of wanting to cherry pick, but there is an element of cherry picking in the guidelines published earlier. While proposing a relatively standard free trade agreement, it is also demanding strong guarantees to ensure a level playing field. (See 11.55am for the relevant quotes.) These tweets from the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge help to shed some light on this. Ukip’s fishing spokesman, the MEP Mike Hookem, has also condemned the EU fishing proposal. (See 4pm.) In a statement he said: How will leaving the CFP [common fisheries policy] make any positive difference for the British fishing industry if all the rules are still set by Brussels, along with the UK’s share of what can be caught in our own waters. It’s a disgraceful situation and nothing more than a grab to secure EU dominance of UK fishing for many years to come. The European council’s latest demand acts as confirmation that unless Theresa ‘the Appeaser’ can show some steel, and stand up to the EU bullyboys, then we don’t have any hope of reclaiming our seas and keeping what remains of our ravaged fishing industry. However, I’m in no doubt that Mrs May will roll-over and allow the EU to continue its dominance of the UK’s fishing industry even after we leave the bloc. Given these ridiculous demands, my message to Theresa May is to show some British spirit and tell the EU where to go. Scottish fishermen have rejected the EU’s demands for the UK to accept “existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources” after Brexit, insisting that was applying the common fisheries policy by the backdoor. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, implied that the proposal would also betray trawlermen who voted leave to cut EU quotas in British waters. He said: There cannot be ‘fairer shares’ for our fishing communities if we maintain existing reciprocal access. This latest gambit must be rejected. When we leave the EU we leave the common fisheries policy and assume our rightful place at the table as a coastal state. Each year we will then decide who catches what, where and when. The days of the EU taking 60% of our fish are coming to an end. Armstrong’s stance was backed by David Duguid, the Scottish Tory MP for Banff and Buchan, a fishing heartland in north east Scotland won by the Tories last year in their rout of the pro-EU Scottish National party in the region. He said: The UK government must strongly defend our fishermen and coastal communities across the country who voted to take back control of our waters. I will continue to make the case, as I did in the chamber today, for a fair share for our fishermen. [We] must be in control of who comes into our waters, and how much they fish. Even so, fisheries leaders accept privately the EU will bargain hard over access to British waters, which are the largest and richest in the EU currently. The industry expects compromises but is planning to fight vigorously against significant concessions. The key reference to fishing in the draft EU guidelines published today (pdf) is in paragraph 7 i), which says “existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources should be maintained.” Here is some UK reaction to the EU draft guidelines for the trade talks published by Donald Tusk earlier. From Labour MP Chuka Umunna on behalf of Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit. The council’s guidelines are clear that it is not too late for the government to change course, but with just a year to go in the negotiations, time is running out. Given the emerging reality about the enormous costs and sheer complexity of Brexit, everyone is entitled to keep an open mind about whether it really is the right path for the country. From Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas on behalf of Best for Britain, which is opposed to Brexit and campaigning for a second referendum Donald Tusk is right - the prime minister is desperate to show that Brexit can be a success, despite all of the evidence suggesting it can’t be. From the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake The prime minister needs to drop the illusion that we can keep the benefits of the EU without being a member. From the interim Ukip leader Gerard Batten The EU wants to have its cake and to eat it. Their published guidelines today should be unacceptable to the British Government and to the 17.4m people who voted Leave. It is clearly not in the national interest to accept a free trade deal which does not involve financial services. It is incredible beyond belief that the EU has the gall to ask for free access to British fishing waters once we have left the EU. They want our money and our fisheries - this is completely unacceptable. Here are two of the lines from Philip Hammond’s Q&amp;A. Hammond, the chancellor, claimed a basic free trade agreement of the kind proposed by the EU would not deliver what both sides wanted. The aspiration that the EU itself is setting out for our future relationship, it couldn’t be contained within a straightforward FTA [free trade agreement]. The EU itself has noted that because of the proximity of the UK and the European Union, because of complexity and scale of existing trade flows, in many respects a simple free trade agreement would leave many questions unresolved that would have to be resolved. Because the relationship between the UK and European Union countries will never be the same as the relationship between Canada and European Union countries, because of the different nature of the trade. A very large proportion of our trade with the EU is ro-ro [roll-on, roll-off] trade across the Channel, whereas almost all of the trade between Canada and the EU will be containerised, sea freight or air freight. It’s a different type of trade. He downplayed the significance of the tough stance adopted by the EU today, saying that was just what you would expect from any “very skilled negotiator”. He said: The EU is a very skilled negotiator. They’ve done this many times [before] - not precisely this, but they’ve negotiated agreements with many countries. They are very skilled, very disciplined in the way they carry out their negotiation. And it does not surprise me remotely that what they’ve set out this morning is a very tough position. That’s what any competent, skilled, experienced negotiator would do. I expect that we will have a deep and constructive engagement with them and I hope that what I’ve set out here this afternoon will contribute to the discussion that we will be having. BBC News and Sky gave up on the Q&amp;A after the first three questions (and I don’t have a live feed), but Twitter still serves up copy. These are from the Sun’s Harry Cole. Q: The EU’s guidelines rule out the kind of mutual recognition regime that the prime minister proposed and that you are proposing for financial services. So why don’t you just accept that? Hammond says a straightforward free trade agreement would not achieve what the EU and the UK want. He says the UK’s trade with the EU is different from Canada’s. The UK and the EU are trying to do something that has not been tried before. Using an off-the-shelf agreement designed for a country like Canada is not credible, he says. Q: What can you say to City firms thinking of moving out of London? Hammond says the implementation period is key. The government expects to get that confirmed at the EU summit later this month. That will move forward the “cliff edge”, he says. Philip Hammond has finished his speech. He is now taking questions. Q: Don’t Tusk’s comments this morning show the huge gulf between the UK and the EU? And he also said May wanted to show that Brexit would be a success at any price, which was not the EU’s intention. Hammond says the EU is a very skilled negotiator. It does not surprise me remotely that what they have set out this morning is a very tough position. That is what any skilled negotiator would do, he says. Hammond says EU’s tough stance not surprising because they are skilled negotiators. Pressure on Mark McDonald, the former Scottish government cabinet minister who resigned from the SNP yesterday after three women accused him of unwanted and inappropriate behaviour, to quit Holyrood is growing this afternoon. The SNP’s Kirsty Blackman, whose Westminster seat overlaps with his Holyrood constituency, has said that she believes constituents want the opportunity to vote again on having McDonald, who has insisted that he will continue to serve as an independent MSP, as their representative. Blackman, a well-respected and increasingly influential figure in the SNP’s Westminster group, told the BBC: The people I have spoken to said they want the chance to vote again. They want the chance to decide whether or not they want an SNP MSP representing them or they want an independent MSP representing them. Yesterday SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also urged McDonald to quit, saying: “If his behaviour is such that he himself considers he cannot continue as an SNP MSP, then it would be appropriate to give his constituents the opportunity to elect a new MSP.” Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is delivering his Brexit speech now. Here is our preview story. As my colleague Richard Partington reports, Hammond implied that the UK would reject a trade deal that does not include financial services. UPDATE: Here is the full Hammond quote. A trade deal will only happen if it is fair and balances the interests of both sides. Given the shape of the British economy and our trade balance with the EU27, it is hard to see how any deal which didn’t include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement. I’m clear not only that it is possible to include financial services in a trade deal, but it is very much in our mutual interests to do so. Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, has said he is calling for a police investigation into alleged “blagging” at the Sunday Times. In a statement issued in response to the revelations from John Ford, who told Byline Investigations how he was paid by the Sunday Times to obtain personal information unlawfully, Brown said: According to the new evidence from John Ford - which corresponds with other information I have - there were at least 25, and up to 40, violations of the criminal law by the Murdoch group including impersonation, reverse engineering my phone and blagging, for no reason other than to discredit someone they wanted to undermine for their own reasons. This new evidence shows that even when under oath, what was then News International misled the Leveson Inquiry. I am now calling for police to investigate this criminal wrongdoing. My colleagues Dan Sabbagh and Ewen MacAskill have published a long interview with Ford which is well worth reading. Here it is. As Dan and Ewen report, the Sunday Times denies wrongdoing. It said in a statement: “The paper strongly rejects the accusation that it has in the past retained or commissioned any individual to act illegally.” Under current law obtaining private information by subterfuge is illegal, but there is an exemption for public interest journalism. Here is the full text of Tusk’s statement. Here is some comment on the EU guidelines and the Tusk press conference from journalists and commentators. (Where there’s a thread, I have just posed the first tweet, but if you click on it, the full thread should appear.) From Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform From ITV’s Robert Peston From Steve Peers, an EU law professor (thread) From Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform (thread) From the Telegraph’s Peter Foster Here are the main points from Donald Tusk’s press conference. His words are clear but, on their own, they do not do full justice to the message he conveyed. His tone was very striking; it was lugubrious, almost funereal. Remember Theresa May’s “Brexit means Brexit, and we’re going to make a success of it”? Tusk’s take could not have been more different. Here are the main points. Tusk made it clear that the EU was just offering a Canada-style deal. He said that May had made it clear that the UK was opposed to staying in the single market and the customs union and to remaining under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. He went on: Therefore it should come as no surprise that the only remaining possible model is a free trade agreement. I hope that it will be ambitious and advanced and that we will do our best, as we did with other partners, such as Canada recently. But, anyway, it will only be a trade agreement. He said that the deal should involve zero-tariffs on goods, and that it should address services. He also said the EU would want access to fishing waters and resources to be maintained. He restated the EU’s determination not to allow the UK to cherry pick. The deal would have to pass two tests, he said. The first was about maintaining a balance of rights and obligations. For example, the EU cannot agree to grant the UK the rights of Norway with the obligations of Canada. And the second test was about protecting the integrity of the single market, he said. No member state is free to pick only those sectors of the single market it likes, nor to accept the role of the ECJ only when it suits their interests. By the same token, a pick-and-mix approach for a non-member state is out of the question. We are not going to sacrifice these principles. It is simply not in our interests. He implied May was being unrealistic about what she could achieve from Brexit. In the Q&amp;A he insisted that the EU would not allow full single market access on a sector-by-sector basis, as May has broadly proposed. He said: One thing must be absolutely clear, and I’m not sure that we are on the same position here; there is no possibility to have some sort of exclusive single market for some part of our economies. And I hope that during our negotiations and debate among 27 EU leaders that we will make this position more clear for our partners in London. He also said he understood why, from a political point of view, May’s objective was to show that Brexit could be a success and that it was the right choice for the UK . He went on: “But, sorry, it is not our objective.” He said UK-EU trade would become “more complicated” after Brexit. He said: This positive approach doesn’t change the simple fact that because of Brexit we will be drifting apart. In fact, this will be the first FTA [free trade agreement] in history that loosens economic ties instead of strengthening them. Our agreement will not make trade between the UK and the EU frictionless or smoother. It will make it more complicated ... for all us. This is the essence of Brexit. He said it was important to be realistic about what could be achieved. He said: To sum up, we will enter the negotiations of the future relations with the UK with an open, positive and constructive mind, but also with realism. He insisted that the EU and the UK could remain “friends” after Brexit. He said: My proposal shows that we don’t want to build a wall between the EU and Britain. On the contrary, the UK will be our closest neighbour and we want to remain friends and partners also after Brexit, partners that are as close as possible, just like we have said from the very first day after the referendum. He said that reaching an agreement to allow British airlines to continue flying in Europe next year should be a priority. He said: I am determined to avoid that particularly absurd consequence of Brexit, that is the disruption of flights between the UK and the EU. To do so, we must start discussions on this issue as soon as possible. Now PMQs is over too. I will post a summary of the main lines from the Tusk press conference in a moment. In the meantime, here is my colleague Daniel Boffey’s story about the draft EU guidelines for the trade talks. And this is how it starts. The EU is offering a free-trade deal that will be economically damaging to the UK and has ruled out a series of demands made by Theresa May, a document on the bloc’s vision of the future relationship reveals. The prime minister’s red lines limit what Brussels can offer the UK, the paper says, and in return for even a limited free-trade agreement the British government will have to sign up to a commitment not to become a low-tax, low-regulation state undercutting the EU model. The guidelines further warn that Brussels will not push on with negotiations on trade until May signs up to a legal text that translates all the commitments made by the UK government in the first phase of negotiations, including on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. May has refused to accept the EU’s draft withdrawal agreement as it suggests Northern Ireland may need to effectively stay in the customs union and single market. The EU’s opening position on the trade talks says: “Negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full, and calls for intensified efforts on the remaining withdrawal issues. The European council reiterates that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. The press conference is now over. But in the Commons, PMQs is still going on. Asked about Saudi Arabia again, May says the UK has had a long-standing and historic relationship with the country. The UK will help the Crown Prince deliver on his vision for 2030. Whoever runs Donald Tusk’s Twitter account has just posted these. Tusk says, with regard to what Trump said on trade, he is sure the UK and the EU are still “one team”. Bettel says it is still not clear what the UK wants. And it is wrong to give the impression that the UK will be a big winner. There won’t be a winner, he says. He says there are rules. No cherry picking is a reality, he says. Tusk is now responding to questions. Tusk says he went to London to consult with May, to hear her arguments before he finalised his guidlines. One thing must be absolutely clear ... There is no possibility to have some exclusive form of single market for some parts of our economies. Tusk rules out UK have single market access for certain parts of the economy. Tusk finishes by talking about President Trump’s plans for a trade war. Trump says a trade war is good and easy to win. But trade wars are bad and easy to lose, Tusk says. He says EU leaders will have a special debate on this. Turning to trade, Tusk says May confirmed last week that the UK will leave the single market, the customs union and the remit of the ECJ. That leave a trade agreement as the only option, he says. He says he hopes it will be advanced, like the Canada one. He says it should address services as well as goods. And it should cover fishing. But this does not change the fact that “we will be drifting apart”. He says it will be the first trade agrement in history that will “loosen ties”. It will not make trade frictionless, he says. He says he will go into it with an open mind. But he has to be realistic, he says. He says two tests will apply. The EU will not offer the UK the benefits of Norway with the rights of Canada, he says. A pick-and-mix approach for a non-member state is out of the question. Tusk says offering UK a “pick-and-mix” approach is “out of the question”. Tusk says, secondly, the UK will be invited to participate in EU programmes in education and culture. Thirdly, he is determined to avoid the disruption of flights between the UK and the EU. To do that, they must start talks as soon as possible. Donald Tusk is speaking now. He says he is happy to be back in Luxembourg. He is discussing the agenda for the March European council. Two hours ago he sent out his guidelines. He hopes they will be adopted at the march European council. He says the EU does not want to build a wall. It wants to remain partners with the UK, as close as possible. He proposes cooperation in the following areas. First, they should cooperate on security, defence and foreign affairs. This is about the security of our citizens, he says. Bettel says financial services are a key issue for Luxembourg. He says he wants to end his statement expressing solidarity with Ireland. He says he deeply regrets what the UK is doing. And he praises Tusk for maintaining EU unity. He says they are going, not for a hard or soft Brexit, but for an intelligent Brexit. The UK were in, and wanted a lot of opt-outs. Now they are out, but they want a lot of opt-ins, he says. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, is starting his press conference now, alongside the PM of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel. You can watch it here. Bettel starts. He says Brexit will be a “damage limitation exercise”. He says the EU is also concerned to ensure a level playing field. He goes on: Unfortunately, there will be no winners after Brexit. Both sides will be losing. PMQs - Snap verdict: A patchy PMQs, with creditable performances by both Corbyn and May, but no stand-out winner. Corbyn says he is glad the government showed so much urgency it took four months for the task force to meet. Many people in this country are embarrassed by the level of homelessness. He reads a letter out from a volunteer who says this is a disgrace. Have cuts of 45% in homelessness services had an impact? May says, if Corbyn thinks the only way to solve a problem is by having a meeting, he is wrong. The key thing is to get out there and do something about it. Also, you have to deal with the underlying issue, she says. The government is trying to put entrenched rough sleepers into accommodation. This is not about figures, it is about people, she says. And it is about building enough homes. That is why her housing plans should be welcomed. Corbyn says what May said would not be of consolation to the rough sleepers he mets. He says the LGA says councils are struggling to quote. We are the fifth richest country in the world. Homelessnes is a source of shame. Just how will the prime minister tackle this crisis? May says she wants to deal with it by building more homes, and by ensuring tenants get a better deal. There are more council homes being built under this government than under Labour. So, if Corbyn wants to look at this, he should look at the record of the last Labour government. She says someone said the last Labour’s government record on housing was one of despair. Who said that? It was Corbyn. He was right to say Labour’s record on this was no good. Corbyn quotes the Tory former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell saying the government should not be afraid to condemn the Saudis. Why did rough sleeping fall under Labour but has doubled under the Tories? May says the Saudis are learning from mistakes made in Yemen. She says Corbyn is at odds with Emily Thornberry, who says she backed legitimate armed sales on Radio 4 this morning. On rough sleeping, she says no one wants to see that. The government is piloting an initiative on this. It wants to prevent people sleeping rough. Corbyn says Philip Hammond announced a task force in the budget. The task force has not yet met, and no money has been spent. Isn’t it a little unambitious to tackle it by 2027. May says she wants to eliminate it by 2027. The task force has met, she says. It met today. But this is not the only group looking at rough sleeping, she says. She says statutory homelessness (which is not the same as rough sleeping) is less than half its peak in 2003. This is a complex problem. It is about changing lives, he says. Jeremy Corbyn thanks May for what she said about Salisbury. We await updates, he says. He says tomorrow is international women’s day. It is a time to reflect on how far we have come, and how far we have to go. Later May will meet Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman of Saudia Arabia. There has been a sharp increase in people being jailed. Will May urge him to halt the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudia Arabia. May thanks Corbyn for reminding him about IWD. That is what is called “mansplaining”, she says. She says the link with Saudia Arabia is historic and important and has saved the lives of literally hundreds of people in this country. She says Emily Thornberry herself said this morning the link with Saudi Arabia was important. She will raise human rights, she says. Corbyn says the government is still suppressing a report about the Saudis funding extremism in this country. When will that come out? And there is a disaster in Yemen. Some 600,000 children have cholera because of the Saudi blockade. British arms sales have increased. It cannot be right that the government is colluding in what are war crimes. Will May demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen? May says the government is committed to stamping out extremism in all its form. The review gave a best picture of how extremist activities are funded. They get most of their support from domestic, not overseas sources. Privy counsellors have been allowed to read the report, although some parts were not published. On Yemen, May says we are all concerned about this, particularly the effect on women and children. The government has increased the amount is spend on Yemen. In December she raised the need to open a port to allow supplies. The Saudis did just that. It shows what engagement can achieve. And the Saudis intervened at the request of the legitimate government, she says. Simon Hoare, a Conservative, asks about housing. May says she announced earlier this week that planning laws are being reviewed “to restore the dream of home ownership”. Theresa May starts by updating MPs on the government’s response to the Salisbury incident. The police investigation is ongoing, she says. She says yesterday she chaired a meeting of the national security council, where they were updated by police. This morning Amber Rudd chaired a Cobra meeting. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. PMQs is about to start. I will be covering the opening and the May/Corbyn exchanges, but will switch to Donald Tusk when he starts speaking. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has been speaking after today’s Cobra meeting about the Salisbury suspected poisoning. She said the police now know more about the substance that seems to have poisoned the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. More information will be published this afternoon, she said. Here are key extracts from the leaked draft of the EU guidelines on a future trade relationship. (See 11.40am.) Overall objectives The European Council restates the Union’s determination to have as close as possible a partnership with the UK in the future. Such a partnership should cover trade and economic cooperation as well as other areas, in particular the fight against terrorism and international crime, as well as security, defence and foreign policy At the same time, the European Council has to take into account the repeatedly stated positions of the UK, which limit the depth of such a future partnership. Being outside the customs union and the single market will inevitably lead to frictions. Divergence in external tariffs and internal rules as well as absence of common institutions and a shared legal system, necessitates checks and controls to uphold the integrity of the EU single market as well as of the UK market. This unfortunately will have negative economic consequences. The proposed free trade deal As regards the core of the economic relationship, the European Council confirms its readiness to initiate work towards a free trade agreement (FTA), to be finalised and concluded once the UK is no longer a member state. Such an agreement cannot offer the same benefits as membership and cannot amount to participation in the single market or parts thereof. This agreement would address: 1) trade in goods, with the aim of covering all sectors, which should be subject to zero tariffs and no quantitative restrictions with appropriate accompanying rules of origin. In this context, existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources should be maintained. ii) appropriate customs cooperation, preserving the regulatory and jurisdictional autonomy of the parties and the integrity of the EU Customs Union. iii) disciplines on technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) as well as a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation. iv) trade in services, with the aim of allowing market access to provide services under host state rules, including as regards right of establishment for providers, to an extent consistent with the fact that the UK will become a third country and the union and the UK will no longer share a common regulatory, supervisory, enforcement and judiciary framework. The FTA should include ambitious provisions on movement of natural persons as well as a framework for the recognition of professional qualifications v) other areas of interest to the Union, for example access to public procurement markets, investments and protection of intellectual property rights, including geographical indications. Level playing field conditions Given the UK’s geographic proximity and economic interdependence with the EU27, the future relationship will only deliver in a mutually satisfactory way if it includes robust guarantees which ensure a level playing field. The aim should be to prevent unfair competitive advantage that the UK could enjoy through undercutting of current levels of protection with respect to competition and state aid, tax, social, environment and regulatory measures and practices. This will require a combination of substantive rules aligned with EU and international standards, adequate mechanisms to ensure effective implementation domestically, enforcement and dispute settlement mechanisms in the agreement as well as Union autonomous remedies, that are all commensurate with the depth and breadth of the EU-UK economic connectedness. And here is the Politico Europe story about the leaked draft of the EU document setting out its Brexit guidelines for the trade talks. This is how it starts. There’s only one dish on the EU’s post-Brexit, future relationship menu: a free trade agreement with zero tariffs, covering all goods — and perhaps services “to an extent.” And here is a link to the six-page draft (pdf), published by Politico. More on the EU’s draft guidelines for the Brexit trade deal. This is from Politico Europe’s David Herzenhorn. And these are from MLEx’s Matthew Holehouse. UK.gmbh is a reference to a German form of corporate ownership. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is in Malta today. In an article for the Times of Malta, he says the UK wants a free trade deal with zero tariffs on services. He writes: Both the UK and Malta have services at the heart of our economies – so a bespoke free trade deal that includes zero tariffs on services is in our mutual interest. Total bilateral trade between Malta and the UK in 2016 was valued at more than €2bn. In a statement issued by Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, the Labour MP Stephen Doughty said this suggests Davis has a weak grasp of the issues at stake. Doughty said: [Davis] says he wants a trade deal that imposes zero tariffs on services. But there are no tariffs on services. You don’t pay a tariff on legal advice at frontiers or have to get a stamp from a customs official on an email. The issue with services is about non-tariff barriers and if David Davis doesn’t get that he’s in the wrong job. Back to Labour for a moment, and Jon Lansman, the Momentum founder and candidate for Labour’s general secretary, has distanced himself from the anti-union comments from his ally Christine Shawcroft. (See 11.03am.) According to Bloomberg, the EU guidelines for the future UK-EU trade relationship propose a Canada-style trade deal, with “limited access to the EU’s single market for British financial firms”. And this is from Bloomberg’s Nikos Chrysoloras. Turning away from Brexit for a moment, a mighty row is brewing in the Labour party. As PoliticsHome reveals, Christine Shawcroft, the leftwinger and Momentum director who sits on Labour’s national executive committee and who in January was elected chair of the disputes panel, has suggested the party should break its links with the unions. On a Facebook post seen by PoliticsHome she said: Unfortunately, reviewing the disciplinary process is going to come too late for some of our comrades. This is why I am supporting Jon Lansman, or a woman in that tradition, for general secretary. Nothing would induce me to support a candidate from a major trade union, they stick it to the rank and file members time after time after time. It’s also time to support disaffiliation of the unions from the Labour party. The party belongs to us, the members. She also wrote: I was supporting Jon Lansman for general secretary before today’s NEC sub committee meetings, but after today I’m even more determined. Only someone from his tradition will support the rights of rank and file members in the CLPs (constituency Labour parties). The major trade unions are actively opposed to us, a very cursory examination of trigger ballots in mayoral “selections” will tell you that. Look at their track records before you rush to support someone. Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has already condemned Shawcroft’s comments on Twitter. Greg Hands, the international trade minister, is currently giving evidence to the Commons international trade committee. Earlier he issued this statement responding to the committee’s report accusing the government of complacency over trade deals during the transition. (See 9.23am.) Hands said: The report recognises the priority that the government has given to ensuring continuity of our trade arrangements as we leave the EU, including in providing certainty to businesses, consumers and investors. We have always been clear that this work would take into account the terms and timing of any implementation period currently being negotiated with the EU. This is a technical exercise, not an opportunity to renegotiate terms. We have already held discussions with more than 70 countries, unlike the committee, and none have displayed any interest in disrupting trade flows, or in erecting barriers to trade that do not currently exist. Politico Europe has got hold of a copy of the draft resolution on the future UK-EU trade deal drawn up by the European parliament. It is due to be formally published today, and MEPs will debate it (and almost certainly pass it, by a large majority) next week. As Maïa de La Baume reports, many of the clauses “read as a direct rebuttal of the vision of Brexit that UK prime minister Theresa May set out in her Mansion House speech last week.” In her story De La Baume says: A “deep and comprehensive” trade deal of the kind the UK says it wants with the EU would require Britain to accept a “binding convergence mechanism” with EU laws, according to a draft resolution from the European Parliament obtained by Politico .... The European parliament text states that: — “A third country [cannot] have the same benefits as a member state of the European Union, or an EFTA/EEA member.” — A “deep and comprehensive” trade deal must entail “a binding interpretation role” for the European court of justice and “does not allow cherry-picking of sectors of the internal market.” — One priority is that a “level playing field is ensured and EU standards are safeguarded and a race to the bottom avoided,” and that maintaining a level playing field means abiding by the EU’s competition and state aid rules. — “Limitations in the cross-border provisions of financial services are a customary feature of [free trade agreements].” — “Taxation matters should be integrated in any further agreement between UK and the EU to ensure a maximum level of cooperation between the EU and the UK and its dependent territories in the field of corporate taxation.” You can read the full 13-page draft here (pdf). Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, has claimed that the Scottish government “actively wants a row” with Westminster over where devolved powers should be held post-Brexit. In an article for the Scotsman, she accused the SNP of “constitutional gamesmanship” and claimed their decision to push emergency legislation on EU withdrawal through Holyrood was a “massive political power play from this SNP government”. She said: The only conclusion I can reach from the last week is that the SNP now actively wants a row. As things stand, the Scottish government has no influence over these EU powers and never has, because they are held in Brussels. The SNP has never previously complained about this and Nicola Sturgeon’s position, apparently, is that they should stay there. But because the UK government now proposes to be able to keep consistency for a temporary period before a joint UK-wide framework is agreed, all hell kicks off ... It’s the SNP, not Westminster, who are failing to respect the devolution settlement in fast-tracking unconstitutional legislation through Holyrood with minimum scrutiny. Look out for a range of MPs from all parties wearing 50:50 Parliament pins during today’s PMQs in honour of international women’s day, which falls tomorrow. 50:50 Parliament campaigns for equal representation of men and women in parliament - which is the current pace of progress continues will take more than 50 years. There are now 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015. Overall 32% of MPs are women but it’s not an even spread - 45% of Labour MPs are women, but only 21% of Conservatives. Why does it matter? There is pretty strong evidence that political representation results in better policies for women. Which is why 50:50 parliament will be pushing its #AskHerToStand campaign this week - they note that women are 50% less likely to stand for political office and need to be asked 3 times. “50:50 want women to have equal seats and equal say,” says Frances Scott, director of 50:50 Parliament. “If you know a woman who would make a good MP sign her up via 50:50’s #AskHerToStand and 50:50 will help her along the path to parliament.” Last week Theresa May ended months of waiting when she gave a speech giving details of what Britain wants after Brexit from a UK-EU trade deal. Today we will get what will arguably be an even more important statement when the EU (the more powerful of the two players in the negotiation) sets out its preliminary demands. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, is due to start a press conference halfway through PMQs. For good measure, the European parliament president, is also holding a briefing later setting out some of the parliament’s demands. British ministers seem reasonably confident that, whatever happens in the long term, at least a transition period, lasting around two years and during which nothing much will change, is close to being agreed. But overnight the Commons international trade committee has published a strong report warning against complacency. Currently, as an EU member, the UK benefits from around 40 EU trade deals facilitating trade with around 70 countries. Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade has said that rolling these over, so that they continue to apply to the UK during the transition, should be relatively easy. But the committee isn’t convinced. Here is how it summarises its report. Trade with 70 nations risks falling off a cliff edge if the government does not act quickly to roll over EU trade deals, the international trade committee has found. A report by the committee calls on the Department for International Trade to produce “a legally watertight and practically viable strategy” to achieve “transitional adoption” of trade agreements the UK is currently party to through its membership of the European Union. The government still needs to work out a number of important details before continuity can be achieved – and businesses, consumers, investors need certainty on what will happen to the trade deals as a matter of urgency. Here is a key quote from the conclusions to the report. There is a disturbing lack of precision and clarity about the legal mechanism whereby the government envisages EU trade agreements with some 70 countries being rolled over. DIT must show, Number 10 and the Cabinet Office must support, and DExEU must allow, that DIT has a legally watertight and practically viable strategy for achieving “transitional adoption” at the point when it will need to take effect, so that UK trade with around 70 countries does not face a “cliff edge”, even if no withdrawal or transition arrangements with the EU should have been agreed or ratified. And this is from the committee chair, the SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil, who is worried about the government being “naive”. The government is ... correct to have identified maintaining our rights under these agreements as a priority. However, as the committee has found over the course of our inquiry, a number of thorny issues and significant risks remain unaddressed. The government must not be naïve enough to assume that a verbal agreement to maintain the status quo constitutes a watertight guarantee – contingency plans are required. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: David Gauke, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee. 10.30am: Rob Wainwright, executive directive of Europol, gives evidence to the Lords EU home affairs sub committee about Brexit. 10.45am: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, chairs a Cobra meeting to discuss the apparent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Salisbury. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12.15pm: Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, holds a press conference in Luxembourg as he publishes the EU’s draft guidelines for the Brexit talks on a UK-EU trade deal. 2.15pm: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives a speech on Brexit. As Larry Elliott reports, he will insist that Britain can overcome EU opposition and include financial services in a post-Brexit free trade deal. 2.30pm: The Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs, and then the Deparment for International Trade, give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about Brexit. 4.30pm: Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, and Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, hold a press conference to lay out their demands for a future UK-EU trade relationship.

Shares scrambled back after White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Donald Trump’s plan could include carve-outs for Mexico and Canada. So the Dow ended down 80 points, the S&amp;P is flat and the Nasdaq gained 0.4% as Facebook and Alphabet rose 2.2% and 1.3%. Tomorrow Trump may actually release full details of his tariffs. See you then! GW Here’s our news story on Europe’s move on tariffs: The European Union has responded to Donald Trump’s threat of a trade war by warning that it will retaliate with tariffs on a range of US imports including peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. Reacting to the threat from the US president of 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on aluminium, European commissioner for trade Cecilia Malmström said on Wednesday the EU was finalising its own list of American exports that could face sanctions, including steel, industrial and agricultural products. However, Malmström also said the EU still hoped to avoid a full blown trade war, despite the escalating rhetoric between the US and its main global trading partners in recent days. “A trade war has no winners and if it does not happen for the better, then we can work with our American friends and other allies on the core issue of this problem, overcapacity,” she told reporters at a press conference in Brussels. “But if it does happen we will have to take measures to protect European jobs.” More here: No sign of a recovery on Wall Street yet. The Dow is still down 1%. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has denied acting improperly after selling $31m shares in a company dependent on steel imports. Icahn, a former special advisor to president Trump, insists that he had no knowledge of the plan to impose tariffs. In a statement, Icahn Enterprises says: “We don’t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration’s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.” Despite all these trade war worries, the UK stock market has ended the day a little higher. That’s partly thanks to Rolls-Royce, which jumped after beating profit forecasts and promising more cost savings. Time for a quick recap, for any readers just tuning in. Europe has ratcheted up the pressure on Donald Trump over steel tariffs, by drawing up a list of US goods which could be hit with retaliatory action. Peanut butter, orange juice, bourbon and cranberries are all included, along with an unspecified range of industrial and steel products. Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said Brussels hopes that Trump will not impose blanket tariffs on steel imports into America. But if he does, the EC will take proportionate action. Malmstrom told reporters in Brussels that: We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in Nato, can be a threat to international security in the US.... It is alarming that the US would invoke this article from 1962, to introduce trade restrictions that will mainly impact traditional allies of the United States. President Trump, though, is not backing down. He’s tweeted that America has suffered from bad policies and bad leadership for too long. US Steel has given Trump some good news. It’s re-opening a steel furnace in Illinois and getting hundreds of staff back to work. A group of countries, including China, have raised concerns about Trump’s planned tariffs to the World Trade Organisation. They fear that tit-for-tat retaliations could break out. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, has pledged that America will work constructively with its allies. We won’t ‘blow up the world’, he says (something administrations don’t usually have to spell out). The US stock market has fallen in early trading. Investors are concerned that the resignation of Gary Cohn as Trump’s top economic advisor raises the risk of a trade war. White House advisor Peter Navarro has just told Bloomberg TV that he’s not on the list to replace Gary Cohn. Navarro, a confirmed sceptic on free trade, says there is a “deep bench” at the White House. He also claims that metal tariffs are good for the US economy, and will strengthen national security. Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital of New Jersey, reckons Wall Street is anxious about the prospect of a trade war. He says (via Reuters): “It’s more of the same jitters we had seen recently, with investors in this case fearing that a lack of confidence in the tariffs by Trump’s own people. Investors are taking risk off the table to see how much more damage in the administration this will cause.” After that early slide the Dow has stabilised, now down 170 points (or 0.7%). Equipment and machinery giant Caterpillar is the biggest faller, down 1.5%. Demand for its trucks and diggers would fall if the global economy was hit by a trade war. Aircraft maker Boeing are down 1% -- steel tariffs could push up the cost of making new planes. Financial stocks are also in the red, with Goldman Sachs down 1.3%. DING DING! Wall Street has opened for trading, and the US stock market is taking a leg downwards. The Dow Jones industrial average shed more than 300 points at the open, a drop of 1.2%. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are also in the red, as investors get their first chance to respond to Gary Cohn’s resignation last night. Cohn’s resignation is “dominating proceedings early doors”, says Lawrence Mills of Finsa Markets. The news that Europe is drawing up a list of US goods to target, if Washington doesn’t back down over steel tariffs, is also casting a shadow over the New York stock exchange. Donald Trump’s commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has pledged that the US won’t blow the world up in its attempt to tackle trade imbalances. I guess that’s reassuring..... CNBC has the details: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Wednesday that President Donald Trump has indicated a degree of flexibility on tariffs for Canada and Mexico. “We’re not trying to blow up the world. There’s no intention of that,” Ross said in an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “The president indicated the other day he has a willingness to provide an exemption to Canada and Mexico.” “We’re not looking for a trade war. We’re going to have very sensible relations with our allies,” Ross added. “We hope and we believe that at the end of the day, there will be a process of working with the other countries that are our friends.” The jump in America’s trade deficit will add fuel President Donald Trump’s protectionist rhetoric, says Capital Economics. They add: Exports fell by 1.3% month-on-month in January, driven by a drop in goods exports, while imports were basically unchanged. In real terms, goods exports fell by 3.3%, compared to a 1.6% decline in real goods imports. Barring a big rebound in February and March, it therefore looks very likely that net trade will subtract from first quarter GDP growth, albeit by much less than the huge 1.1 percentage point drag seen in the fourth quarter. Just in: America’s trade deficit has swelled to its widest level in almost a decade. The Commerce Department reports that the trade gap jumped by 5% in January to $56.6bn. That’s more than expected. The deficit with China has widened particularly sharply -- up 16% year-on-year to $36bn. Newsflash: US Steel has announced that it is reopening some operations at its site in Granite City, in Illinois - and giving Donald Trump the credit. The company will dust off one of two blast furnaces (“B” blast furnace) and the steelmaking facilities at the site, and call back around 500 workers. CEO David Burritt says he’s responding to the president’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports: In a statement that will be welcomed by the White House, Burritt says the US has suffered from steel dumping: Our Granite City Works facility and employees, as well as the surrounding community, have suffered too long from the unending waves of unfairly traded steel products that have flooded U.S. markets The Section 232 action announced by President Trump last week recognizes the significant threat steel imports pose to our national and economic security. The President’s strong leadership is needed to begin to level the playing field so companies like ours can compete, win and create jobs that support our employees and the communities in which we operate as well as strengthen our national and economic security. We will continue to support our customers with the high-quality products they have come to expect from U. S. Steel.” Burritt has also been speaking on CNBC, saying he sees a “renaissance” in America’s steel industry. The US stock market is still on track to fall when trading begins at 9.30am New York time (2.30pm in the UK). The Dow is being called down 250 points, or around 1%. Breaking: Some blisteringly hot US jobs figures just landed. Private sector companies across America created 235,000 new jobs in February, smashing forecasts for 195,000. That indicates the US labor market remains strong (which is what you want if you’re starting a trade war). It may also be a sign that Friday’s US jobs report (Non-Farm Payroll) will be better than expected. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, says: “The job market is red hot and threatens to overheat. With government spending increases and tax cuts, growth is set to accelerate.” The threat of new tariffs on US goods being sold into Europe hasn’t forced President Trump to back down. He’s tweeted a defence of his ‘Make America Great Again’ policy: Here’s Associated Press’s take on Europe’s threat to impose tariffs on a range of US goods if Donald Trump presses on with steel and aluminium tariffs: The European Union warned Wednesday that it is ready to retaliate against the U.S. over President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, with counter-measures against iconic U.S. products like Harley Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and bourbon. Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said that the EU, the world’s biggest trading bloc, rejects Trump’s reasoning that the tariffs are backed by international legal right to protect national security. Should tariffs be introduced, the EU and other partners would take the case to the World Trade Organization, she said. “We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in NATO, can be a threat to international security in the U.S.,” Malmström told reporters in Brussels. “From what we understand, the motivation of the U.S. is an economic safeguard measure in disguise, not a national security measure.” Trump has long railed against what he deems unfair trade practices by China and others, and last week declared that his government would levy penalties of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum imports. The tariffs, he said, would remain for “a long period of time,” but it was not clear if certain trading partners would be exempt. Malmström said Trump’s motives do not appear compatible with WTO rules and that this means the EU can activate safeguards to protect its own markets. She confirmed that the EU’s counter-measures would include tariffs on U.S. steel and agricultural products, as well as other products like bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said that Harley Davidson motorcycles and Levi’s jeans could also be hit. The list is being circulated among EU member states for approval. The Commission also has plans in case steel from other producers is dumped on European markets. European Council president Donald Tusk has just weighed in on the issue, saying Donald Trump is wrong over trade wars: Tusk was speaking as the EU outlined its draft offer to Britain for trade after Brexit. He has ruled out giving the UK a ‘pick and mix’ approach to access to Europe’s markets. More details in our Politics Live blog: Newsflash: The World Trade Organisation has just revealed that 18 member states, led by China, have raised concerns over America’s steel and aluminium tariffs: Reuters has snapped the details: CHINA SPARKS WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION DEBATE OVER U.S. TARIFFS, 17 OTHER WTO MEMBERS ALSO EXPRESS STRONG CONCERNS - WTO SPOKESMAN WTO MEMBERS SPEAKING OUT OVER U.S. TARIFF PLAN INCLUDED EU, CANADA, TURKEY, RUSSIA, AUSTRALIA, SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, MEXICO, INDIA AND BRAZIL MANY WTO MEMBERS EXPRESSED BOTH COMMERCIAL AND SYSTEMIC CONCERNS ABOUT U.S. TARIFFS PLAN AND SAID THEY FEARED TIT-FOR-TAT TRADE ACTIONS - WTO SPOKESMAN Q: How quickly could the EC implement these countermeasure against the US? Cecilia Malmström says that Europe can bring a complaint to the WTO quite quickly. Implementing rebalancing measures (tariffs on American goods) would take more time, she says, perhaps two months. But the EC could hold back from counter-measures to see how things develop, as it still hopes that the US government won’t impose blanket tariffs that hurt European companies. That’s the end of the briefing. Q: Isn’t there a risk that Europe’s measures could be found illegal, and could annoy allies around the world? Cecilia Malmstrom says the Commission is taking very serious legal advice, to make sure that any countermeasures it takes against America over steel tariffs are fully legal. The EC is also talking to major steel producers, as we don’t want them to be hurt, she adds. Cecilia Malmstrom repeats that the list of US products which could face tariffs in Europe is still provisional. Changes could be made, and the final list will be made public very soon. Q: By singling out American peanut butter, orange juice and bourbon, aren’t you escalating the situation rather than trying to turn the volume down? We are eager not to escalate this, Malmstrom insists, adding: We do not want this to go out of proportion. But the EU wants to have “rebalancing” measure ready, in case necessary. We cannot just stay silent when such a major measure could be taken to the EU economy. Q: Might these proposed tariffs on US products break WTO rules, and are member states on side? Cecilia Malmström says the EC is very confident that its proposed actions are compatible with World Trade Organisation rules, and that there is “very close co-operation with member states” on this issue. Q: Are you confident that the talk of trade wars coming out of the White House will end after the special election in Pennsylvania, where there are many steel workers? Your guess is as good as mine, Cecilia Malmström replies. But she notes that Trump did promise to take action on tariffs during his race to the White House. I hope it will not happen, as a trade war has no winners, she adds. But if it does happen, action must be taken to protect European companies and workers. Q: What US products might be hit by the tariffs being drawn up by the EU? Commissioner Cecilia Malmström says that a provisional list has been drawn up. It is being shared with EU member states now, and will be published soon. The list includes steel products, industrial products, and agricultural products, she tells reporters in Brussels, adding: Certain types of bourbon are on the list, as are other items such peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, etc. Very soon that list will be public, so you will be able to plan your whisky drinking. Onto questions... Q: What do you think about Donald Trump’s claim that the EU is unfair over trade, and his threat to impose tariffs on EU cars? Cecilia Malmström insists that there are “only losers” in a trade war, so Europe will respond in a proportionate and balanced way. Two million cars are produced in the US by EU manufacturers, Malmström says, creating jobs and US exports. She concedes that the EU has higher tariffs on cars than America, but on the other hand the US has higher tariffs on trucks. The European Commission has been holding intensive talks with officials in Washington for a very long time, Cecilia Malmström continues, in the hope of getting the US to rethink its tariffs. Europe still hopes that it will be excluded from the tariffs, she continues. We have made clear that if a move is taken, it will hurt the European Union and put thousands of jobs at risk - and will be met with a firm response. EU Commissioners have decided a three-pronged response, she says: The EU will prosecute its rights under the WTO It is preparing safeguards in case steel is dumped in Europe in response to America’s tariffs New measures on US exports into Europe to match the losses suffered by EU exporters But Europe is still hoping that the US will not impose tariffs, so this retaliatory action can be avoided. Over in Brussels, European Commissioner Cecilia Malmström has warned that trans-Atlantic relations could be damaged by the looming tariffs on steel and aluminium. Malmström is speaking in Brussels now, outlining the European Union’s response to Donald Trump’s plans following a ‘college meeting’ of EU commissioners this morning. Malmström (who is sporting a natty leather jacket) says “events in the US are moving quickly”. Malmström explains that Donald Trump may, in the coming days, sign off a decision to impose 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium imports under the section 232 review of national security. We have “serious doubt” that this can be justified on national security grounds, she says. We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in Nato, can be a threat to international security in the US. We find that assumption “deeply unjust” Malmström continues: It is alarming that the US would invoke this article from 1962, to introduce trade restrictions that will mainly impact traditional allies of the United States. We also have serious doubts about whether it is compatible with the WTO rules, Malmström continues. And in a clear warning to the White House, she warns that these tariffs “would be damaging to trans-Atlantic relations...and potentially to a global rules-based trading system.” It’s almost 6am in New York, so early bird financial workers will be heading to their desks soon (perhaps via the coffee shop and the gym). And when they get to work, traders are likely to be hitting the sell button as they react to the latest turmoil at the White House. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently called down 330 points (-1.4%), with losses likely on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq too. Uh oh... Veteran City expert George Magnus isn’t impressed by the frontrunners to become Donald Trump’s new chief economic advisor: Patrick Chovanec, managing director of Silvercrest Asset Management, suggests a certain sort of candidate will be needed.... City traders are also fretting about Brexit, as well as trade. The pound has fallen 0.3% to a three-month low against the euro this morning, slipping to €1.116 for the first time since late November. That means one euro is worth 89.6p. The EU is due to release its draft guidelines for the upcoming trade talks between Brussels and London later today. That will show whether the two sides are converging, following Theresa May’s speech on Brexit last week. MPs have piled on the pressure, warning that UK trade could ‘fall off a cliff’ unless EU trade agreements with some 70 countries are rolled over soon. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: European politicians have been alarmed, and disappointed, to learn of Gary Cohn’s resignation. German economy minister Brigitte Zypries has warned that the situation over tariffs is serious, adding: “I hope Trump reconsiders. Trade promotes prosperity if it’s based on exchange, on working together.” The European Commission is set to review possible countermeasures which it could launch against the US later today, if tariffs on steel and aluminium are imposed. US-made jeans, bourbon and motorbikes are all in the firing line. European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis has already warned that the EU won’t stand idly by, saying: “We hope that eventually this initiative from the U.S. side will not be followed through... But it’s also clear that the EU is going to react if these one-sided tariffs are going to be imposed by the U.S.” Back in the UK, house price growth has slowed to a five-year low. The Halifax bank has reported that average house prices increased by 1.8% in the three months to February compared with the same period of 2017. That’s the weakest annual growth since March 2013, down from 2.2% in January. It will fuel concerns that consumer confidence is weak, with the threat of rising interest rates also deterring borrowers. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says she’s very worried by the threat of a global trade war. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, she warns that it’s very easy to start these wars, and quite difficult to finish them. When a president drives his top economic advisor to resign, it creates a vacancy. So there’s plenty of speculation over who might slide into Gary Cohn’s seat and chair the Council of Economic Advisors. One option is Peter Navarro, a fiercely protectionist voice in the White House who is famously sceptical of free trade. CNBC reports that Navarro had been kept on a tight leash by chief of staff John Kelly - even ordered to cc: Cohn on all his emails. But now, Navarro seems to have won the battle and could potentially get a promotion. That could alarm the markets... Conservative economist Larry Kudlow, who served in the Reagan administration, has also been suggested. However, he’s a free trade advocate, so it’s tricky to see how he could back new tariffs. Kudlow has already tweeted that he asked Cohn to stay on.... President Trump has tweeted that he’ll choose a successor soon: Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, has tweeted his support for Gary Cohn: The markets have been choppy this week, as investors have see-sawed over how alarmed they should be about a trade war. Share fell sharply on Friday when Trump announced his plans for tariffs on steel and aluminium, but did then claw back on Monday and Tuesday. That optimism has now been punctured. Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Bank, says investors can’t risk being blasé: “I’ve gone from being a little bit relaxed about the trade-war thing to being quite a lot more nervous. People are not giving it as much weight as they should be…I don’t think people are really thinking this through.” There’s plenty of red electronic ink on the European markets this morning, following on from the drops in Asia: Investors are worried that Gary Cohn’s departure removes a key opponent to Trump’s protectionist leanings. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, explains: The revolving door in the Whitehouse gets another spin, but the ramifications from Cohn’s exit has the potential to be huge. As his departure was announced after the US markets closed we’re yet to see a real reaction from the US. But as Cohn was Wall Street’s main man in Washington, we doubt they’ll be so happy about it. An advocate of free trade and the biggest critic of tariffs, markets fear his absence from the White House could make the tariffs inevitable. Such tariffs didn’t work out well for the Bush administration, so its difficult for markets to fathom a better outcome this time around. Mining stocks are falling this morning, helping to drag the London stock market into negative territory. That’s due to fears that a trade war will hurt global growth, and dent demand for copper, zinc, iron ore and coal. Anglo American have lost 1.8%, with Glencore shedding 1.7% and BHP Billiton down 1.3%. We’re not looking at a crash, thankfully, but the markets are certainly edgy this morning: Britain’s stock market has followed Asia’s lead, downwards. The FTSE 100 has shed 35 points, or 0.5%, at the open to 7113 -- towards the 14-month low struck on Friday when president Trump announced his tariffs. Other European markets are also dipping, as news of Gary Cohn’s departure rattles the markets. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the changes of a full-on trade war have increased: The implication is that without the restraining influence of Cohn on Trump, the president will now have a free hand to press ahead with further tariffs and generally up the ante on trade. Clearly he fought back on trade and lost. Goldman Sach’s CEO Lloyd Blankfein has tweeted his support for his former colleague, saying he’s disappointed that Gary Cohn is leaving the White House. Rob Carnell of ING fears that investors have been too complacent about the risks of a trade war blowing up: The breaking news this morning is that Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council, is resigning over the issue. Trump, for now, seems unbowed. A 25% tariff on EU cars is his response to potential retaliation to the aluminium and steel tariffs by the EU. It won’t end there. It is hard not to characterise current market behaviour as complacent. Analysts at City firm FXPro warn that Cohn’s departure removes an important voice from the White House: Markets are in risk-off mode this morning, as news broke just after the US market close yesterday that Presidents Trump’s Chief Economic Advisor, Gary Cohn, resigned after a clash with the president due to the implementation of trade tariffs. Cohn was an advocate of free trade and his resignation will dent market confidence in the administration. This leaves an imbalance in the administration, with an unopposed cadre of officials supporting trade tariffs, which could lead to a trade war developing as protectionist policies take hold. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says Trump seems to have won the argument over tariffs: With Cohn’s steadying influence no longer steering economic policy in the Trump administration, in addition to Trump’s recommitment to his nationalist trade agenda, market participants are growing increasingly nervous of where the Trump administration is going. As a result Dow futures plummet 300 points after the bell. The US dollar has hit a two-week low against a basket of currencies this morning, as traders ditch the greenback in favour of the yen. A wave of selling swept through Asia-Pacific markets after Gary Cohn’s resignation hit the wires. Nearly every market is in the red - including Australia (-1%), Hong Kong (0.9%), Tokyo (0.7%) and Shanghai (-0.75%). Money also poured into the Japanese yen - a traditional safe-haven asset. Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG in Singapore, says investors are nervously awaiting for more details of Trump’s tariff plans. “For the markets, Gary Cohn’s departure certainly points strongly to the likelihood that little can halt the President from going ahead with his tariff plans and may mark more volatility to come for markets,” said “Perhaps the biggest thing to look forward to on this topic will be the details of the plans at the moment, to gain a better gauge of the extent of the impact, whereupon more volatility may be unleashed.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade war fears are sweeping through the financial markets today after Gary Cohn became the latest official to quit the White House - over Donald Trump’s plans for new tariffs on steel and aluminium. Cohn, a former top Goldman Sach’s executive, quit as Trump’s top economic advisor after failing to persuade the president not to impose blanket tariffs on imports into America. His resignation could dash hopes that Trump might be steered away from protectionist policies -- and raises the chances of a full-blown trade war with retaliatory action from Europe, Canada and China. As we reported overnight: Cohn said in a statement issued by the White House that it had been “an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform”. Cohn’s departure represents another blow to the administration, which has suffered several high-profile resignations since the election. Hope Hicks, Trump’s close aide and communications director, quit last week, and other senior figures to have left include Trump’s former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Royal Bank of Canada analysts say Trump could be gearing up for a big fight on trade: Cohn staunchly opposed the invocation of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to impose steel and aluminum tariffs and his resignation has been taken as a strong indication Trump would go ahead with a set of less measured tariffs, risking a larger trade war. Adding to those fears, Trump is said to be considering a clampdown on Chinese investment in the US and broader tariffs in retaliation for alleged intellectual property theft. Asian markets swiftly fell - with Japan’s Nikkei losing 1.6% at one stage (more on that shortly). The futures market is predicting chunky losses on Wall Street later today, with the Dow called down around 350 points (1.4%).

Year on year, the festival talks about its increased size but each year there is a noticeable lack of companies working in innovative spaces in theatre and dance, and an increase in the comedians who are performing at Perth fringe and the Melbourne International Comedy festival but skipping Adelaide in between. And with the Royal Croquet Club threatening to withdraw from the 2018 festival if they weren’t granted a five-year licence from the Adelaide city council, many have been asking who owns the power in such a sprawling festival, and how these venues – and the money behind them – will shape the fringe in future. Still, when there are more than 1,200 shows hitting the city over five weeks, there are more than enough artistic gems to be discovered. These are my top five Adelaide fringe festival shows so far. Fleabag ABC iView’s screening of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s award-winning TV series, Fleabag, coincides with the original stage show of the same name touring Australia with Maddie Rice in the title role. This story of a young angry woman, reeling with grief and trying desperately to feel herself and hold herself together – largely through sexual encounters – comes from a dark core but the work itself is bitingly funny and heartbreakingly real. Rice as Fleabag is a beautifully affable performer. Sitting on a chair in the middle of an empty stage, augmented only by lighting changes and limited sound effects – including the voices of some scene partners – Rice is captivating. Fleabag shows us all the worst parts of herself and the way young women judge themselves as they move through the world, yet you cannot help but love her. Waller-Bridge’s script is a masterclass in writing for a solo performer: a stunning distillation of life. • Fleabag plays at The Box at the Garden of Unearthly Delights until 18 March, and then at Malthouse theatre for the Melbourne International Comedy festival, 28 March – 22 April. The Institute of Invisible Things The Adelaide central markets are a staple of the city centre. They bustle and move with produce hawkers and shoppers, the scent of fresh flowers mingling with the smell of fresh bread. Locals learn the flow of the crowds, how to lean into the steady stream of people to carry them to their favourite fruit shop. As you wait to enter The Institute of Invisible Things, held inside the Gallery Next Door, a pop-up venue inside the market, you sit and watch this familiar movement and listen to the familiar noise. Then, quietly, you are asked to go through a door into a space that feels impossibly quiet and removed. The room, inhabited by artists Emma Beech and Sarah John, is dimly lit, quiet and gentle. You’re guided alone through four spaces of stories, asking you to contemplate your place in the impossibly empty universe. The artists play with words and images: a book to read alone; the outline of a dead leaf playing in light over a steaming bowl of tea; an almost whispered conversation about the constellation that makes your family yours. In the bustle of the markets in the bustle of the festival season, Beech and John have created a beauty of a place to sit and breathe. To remember who you are; to remember you are here. Season closed Glittery Clittery: A Consensual Party It seems the Fringe Wives Club – Australian festival circuit staples Tessa Waters, Rowena Hutson and Victoria Falconer-Pritchard – have nailed the recipe for your standard fringe show: singing, dancing, comedy, audience interaction, several kilograms of sparkles, some political commentary and a rebuttal or two to a heckler. If they’ve left out the circus, they’ve replaced it with a human-sized replica of a vagina, complete with anatomy lesson – so all is forgiven. No one, it feels, is having a better time on stage this fringe festival than these women. The show is a fiercely political claiming of space – both as female artists on stage but also as women out in the world. It is, like most feminist conversations, depressing in the ways it makes you consider the truth of power and inequality, yet elating in the way these conversations create joy through empowerment. It’s a celebration of consent, of friendship and of fringe. • Glittery Clittery plays at Le Cascadeur at The Garden of Unearthly Delights until 18 March; and then at the Melba Spiegeltent for Melbourne International Comedy festival until 7 April. We Are Ian When We Are Ian opens, and large projected words tell us we will dance, we feel a bit sceptical. Slowly we get up, encouraged by these three wordless young women in white coveralls as we tentatively follow along, feeling silly and awkward, relieved when we sit down. By the end of the show, we are a messy, sweaty, dancing party. We Are Ian is documentary performance – a light bulb stands in for Ian as we hear his stories on DJing in the Manchester club scene in the 1980s. The voice leads the artists on a wild journey, balls of energy across the stage and into the audience: panting and hugging and loving. As well as being a celebration of the Manchester club scene, We Are Ian expands to comment on the need for cultural spaces and community; the way that these spaces – and, yes, the drugs that were consumed in them – created a place where young men who felt out of step with the world could embrace happiness. Its loss is traced through news footage, a contemporary history of conservative politics: from Thatcher to May; but also Hanson, Turnbull and Trump. Strange works of contemporary performance aren’t going to create a community like the world Ian knew. But they serve to remind us that art can create a family. An intense love of people you meet for only a moment and then leave as you walk off into the night. • We Are Ian plays at the Parasol Lounge at Gluttony until 18 March Wet Sounds When I was a kid, the 3m diving platform at the Adelaide aquatic centre felt impossibly high. I would stand on the edge, looking down at the water, trying to build up the energy to leap. For Wet Sounds, I float and look up at the diving platform, taken over by composer Joel Cahan, as he sits at his computer to operate the music score that takes place over and under the water. The company, perhaps, has misjudged the capacity of the pool – this is the first performance I’ve been to where I’ve been kicked square in the eye. But when you find your space and place in the water it can be incredible: I alternate between gently floating, finding places where the music melds at a point I feel it in my body, and diving as deep as I can, circling a speaker dropped low in the pool, observing this strange underworld of scuba diving performers; the legs that kick on the surface and the few other audience members who have also taken the deep plunge. Wet Sounds is not so much that you are part of the performance, but the performance is part of you: music and water becoming one in this strange place disconnected from the rest of the world.

Cate Faehrmann, who left Di Natale’s office last week, is vying to take the soon-to-be-vacant seat of Mehreen Faruqi in the NSW legislative council. But Faehrmann, who until recently was a Victorian Green, is being barred from contention, due to rules restricting the immediate transfer of individual members between states. Faehrmann has been a member of the Victorian Greens since mid-2015, although she previously held a seat in NSW parliament between September 2010 and June 2013, and joined Greens NSW in January 2004. The NSW party has decided that, because she is transferring from the Victorian party, she must serve a three-month period as a provisional member, starting at 5 February this year. The NSW Greens constitution bars provisional members from standing for preselection. The rules effectively make it impossible for her to contest the preselection, which has nomination cut-off date of 10 April. Faehrmann sought legal advice, which said the provisional period did not apply to her. She sent the legal advice to the NSW Greens but the position did not change. This week, Faehrmann launched action in the NSW supreme court, seeking an urgent hearing to decide on her eligibility. “I would have much preferred that this had been resolved without the need to go to court,” Faehrmann told Guardian Australia. “It’s an unnecessary distraction at a time when we should be focusing 100% of our efforts on the upcoming federal and state elections.” The move is a continuation of infighting within the Greens, which has included highly public and damaging stoushes between the federal Greens senator Lee Rhiannon and the NSW upper house MP Jeremy Buckingham. Rhiannon recently backed a complaint designed to oust Buckingham from the party over criticism of her on the ABC’s Four Corners but the move was eventually thwarted. Tensions also arose when Rhiannon lost the top spot on the Greens NSW Senate ticket to Faruqi. Rhiannon lost a preselection battle with Faruqi after a string of Greens, including Di Natale, Nick McKim and the former leaders Christine Milne and Bob Brown, criticised her. Faehrmann’s legal advice says transferring members are entitled to full membership. It says the NSW rules on three-month provisional members only apply to new members from the date they first pay their fees. But it understood that the NSW party believes she should be subject to the same provisional period that has been applied to other transferring members. The issue is understood to have been debated by the state delegates council last month, but there was no support for a proposal to allow transferring members to by-pass the provisional period. It is understood that there was also no support for an amendment stating that transferring members not be allowed to bypass the period. A proposal to get legal advice on the matter was also not supported. Last week, however, the Lower North Shore Greens agreed that Faehrmann be named as a full member of their local group. It told Faehrmann: “The group holds the view that: ‘After decades of service to our party we believe it unreasonable for her to be denied full membership. To do so risks bringing further unwanted negative publicity to the Greens NSW.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/08/quiz-do-women-suck-or-is-it-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"Quiz!

Or more – because women are so privileged and super-advantaged when it comes to money, property, power and are made out of unicorn pieces and cake icing. Or something. I’ve never been very good at gender roles, as I struggle to understand things that exist on a fact-free basis. Must be my lady brain! My womanly obsession with facts is why I’ve put together this fun quiz! So many women find themselves suspecting – merely on the basis of instinct, observation or just plain lived experience – that even in pretty Australia something seems desperately out of whack in regards to the statistical social, political and economic experience of women to men. So my IWD gift to you, my femme cadre, is something rare and precious you’ll never receive in an argument with a beer-garden misogynist; hard data that proves gender disadvantage is not only intersectional, but true! So pick one answer out of each five, and let’s see how attuned you are to the depressing reality of what 10,000 years of patriarchal domination can do. In the feminist spirit of gender amity and inclusion I’ve even included some answers just for “men’s rights activists” to tick, to spare them the effort of typing the very same things into the comment section after the quiz. These answers are wrong but so is anyone who ever uses the word “misandry”, always and forever. Good luck, fellas! Let’s rip! According to the NSW government, women have made up a representative 50% or more of professional occupations since the mid 2000s, but fewer than 2% of employees in the well-paid, well-unionised construction, automotive and electrical trades are women. Once upon a time (in 2005) we were told (by the likes of the Harvard University president Lawrence Summers) that women’s underrepresentation in technical roles was “because of biological differences”. Actual science, however, has suggested that deeply held cultural biases, mythology and “gender stereotypical language” shape a social perception of gender from when children are born.

On a more modest level, the Biennial also offers visitors a snapshot of the state of Australian contemporary art, featuring the work of 30 artists at venues across the city. The Art Gallery of South Australia and the Anne &amp; Gordon Samstag Museum of Art host the majority of the Biennial. At AGSA there are major installation pieces, such as Amos Gebhardt’s monumental four-screen video work Evanescence (2018) and Timothy Horn’s exquisite sculptures, scaled up from classic jewellery pieces to massive wall hangings. At the Samstag, Emily Floyd’s playful text and arctic bird sculpture, Icelandic Puffins (2017), takes up almost the entire downstairs gallery, while smaller works such as Douglas Watkin’s intriguing twin videos are tucked away behind walls. The JamFactory, the Adelaide Botanic Garden and the Museum of Economic Botany venues are much smaller in scale and have fewer works, but feature standout pieces, including Tamara Dean’s arresting commissioned photo series In Our Nature and Kirsten Coelho’s Transfigured Night (2017), an elegant collection of spotlighted pottery that recalls Morandi. Where for decades galleries elsewhere in Australia shied away from large-scale survey exhibitions by local artists – and have only recently got back into the game – the Art Gallery of South Australia has been staging the Biennial since 1990. Curatorially speaking, the survey show is a difficult balance to achieve. Although there’s no real expectation of a greater cohesion beyond what one might think of as the art world equivalent of a degustation menu, one naturally hopes that some kind of overarching logic is apparent. To the credit of Erica Green, the curator of the 2018 show, Divided Worlds manages to do two things well. The first is that Green has captured the larger concerns of the contemporary art scene, which is essentially a desire to tackle big social issues, from race relations to the environment, from gender identity and social justice, to grand themes of history and to time and space itself. Your enjoyment of that will of course vary, but I respect the effort – and sometimes the art as well. The second aspect of Divided Worlds that I found interesting was that, through all the big works and the major commissioned pieces, there are also a number of virtual outsiders to contemporary art’s big game, such as two figurative realist painters: Lisa Adams and Louise Hearman. Their works represents a different but related art world of traditional art skills mixed with an eye for the surreal. Those kinds of inclusions make for a successful show, and perhaps meet the expectation that a survey show be all things to all people. Green acknowledges the Biennial carries the weight of expectation. “It has been challenging to think through a show that [implies] it’s a survey,” she says. “At first I thought there are so many artists that have already been in all these biennials – and all the number of artists who could have been included is huge. “So it became a process of asking, who do you exclude? With 30 artists you’re not going to be able to do a survey justice. How many artists could I squeeze in? It’s a sampler of what’s happening now.” The show is a mix of well-known interstate names and local South Australian artists. The work is also a familiar mix of contemporary art media: sculpture, photography, installation, video and painting. Among the work there are some genuine surprises, such as Roy Ananda’s massive sculptural tribute to the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons – a representation of a space between an imagined world and a real one. “This is a monument to fandom, reflecting my love of the game,” Ananda says. “It transposes a map that describes an underground lair of monsters and so on, that exists within the game and on paper, but also in the imaginations of tens of millions of people. It has a relation between reality and unreality.” One of the key aspects of contemporary Australian art is a concern with its own history and how certain histories are more privileged than others. Barbara Cleveland is the collective pseudonym of the artists Kelly Doley, Francis Barrett, Kate Blackmore and Diana Baker Smith, a group formerly known as Brown Council. The collective has produced work as though Cleveland was a real person active in avant-garde art in the 1960s and 70s. In Divided Worlds, Cleveland is represented by working sketches and notes for a performance as well as a video of a Cleveland-choreographed piece. “The Barbara Cleveland project in general looks at the way particular artists are curated, and the way art historicisation works, which is pretty relevant to a show like this,” says Doley. “I guess it’s a long-term project about who is included and who’s not. We speak from a gendered position about that process.” Paris–based Australian artist Angelica Mesiti’s Mother Tongue – a sumptuous two-screen installation – is in many ways a perfect distillation of Divided World’s themes. Mesiti’s video juxtaposes the musicians and performers of immigrant communities in Aarhus, Denmark, with Danish-born choirs singing traditional songs. Like her recent work that combines music of various cultures, the video finds a commonality between people. “The political context of how Europe is treating the immigration crisis and also the rise of nationalism of rightwing parties is the environment that I’m working in right now,” says Mesiti. “Also, as an Australian artist with an immigrant heritage and policies here around those issues. A lot of us in the show are thinking about the contemporary moment and how we can respond to it.” Does living in Europe offer Mesiti a different perspective on Australian art? “I think that we have a diversity of practice here that is unique, in that we have the benefit of Indigenous culture and contemporary Indigenous practice, as well as artists who are interested in gender and sexuality. As a postcolonial nation, we have so many things that are particular to us … It’s a unique type of art.” For curator Green, Divided Worlds is a mixture of careful thought on where the exhibition sits in a national context as well as what it offers to the average art punter. “I wanted to do something distinctive, that did say something about Adelaide, that came from this place,” says Green. “I’ve seen a lot of biennials in my time and I wanted this to be a show that I would walk into and be genuinely excited. I could have done with double the space, or included this person or that person … The whole show grew from an organic dialogue with the artists. Once they were chosen, we went on a journey together.” • The 2018 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art: Divided Worlds is on until 3 June 2018 • Guardian Australia was a guest of the Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/06/gary-cohn-quits-trump-economic-adviser","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T13:06:17Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn quits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/06/gary-cohn-quits-trump-economic-adviser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/06/gary-cohn-quits-trump-economic-adviser","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn quits","bodyText":"Gary Cohn, Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, has quit, the latest in a series of high-profile departures from the Trump administration. Cohn, who heads the National Economic Council, had reportedly threatened to leave after Trump’s incendiary comments following the deadly race riot in Charlottesville, Virginia. But his decision to quit on Tuesday night comes after Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a move he and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have reportedly vehemently opposed. Futures trading pointed to a sharp 1.6% drop in shares on Wall Street when business starts again on Wednesday morning and investors take in the departure of the pro-free trade adviser. The dollar dropped against the yen in the Asian markets session but recovered the lost ground as the day progressed. Shares in Asia Pacific also dipped on Wednesday. In Japan, where the steel industry could be badly hit by tariffs, the Nikkei closed down 0.77%. Hong Kong and Sydney were both down 1%. In a statement given to the New York Times, which first broke the story, Trump said: “Gary has been my chief economic adviser and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.” Later on Tuesday, the president tweeted his intention to appoint a replacement soon, adding: “Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!” Cohn said in a statement issued by the White House that it had been “an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform”. Cohn’s departure represents another blow to the administration, which has suffered several high-profile resignations since the election. Hope Hicks, Trump’s close aide and communications director, quit last week, and other senior figures to have left include Trump’s former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. But the resignation of Cohn, a former chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, could be the most consequential. It comes after global markets were roiled by Trump’s decision to press on with plans to impose tariffs on trading allies, which investors fear could spark an international trade war. Reports that Cohn, a Democrat, might depart after Charlottesville last August also caused stock markets to wobble. Cohn had once been a Trump favourite, with the president introducing him as a former Goldman banker who had given up hundreds of millions of dollars to join the West Wing. He was once tipped to be the next head of the Federal Reserve. But he clashed frequently with Trump’s hardline supporters and, according to Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, called Trump “dumb as shit”. Cohn’s departure comes as Trump is clashing with other top Republicans including the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who have publicly urged the White House to abandon the tariffs proposal as officials in Europe, China and Canada threatened retaliation. Trump consistently promised to be tough on trade during his election campaign, and Cohn was regarded by fans and foes as a moderating voice. But since the announcement last week, Trump has doubled down on his intention to press ahead with the tariffs. He said trade wars were “good and easy to win”. On Tuesday, at a press conference with Swedish prime minister Stefan Löfven, Trump said: “The United States has been taken advantage of by other countries, both friendly and not so friendly, for many, many decades, and we have a trade deficit of $800bn per year, and that’s not going to happen with me.” He said: “The European Union has been particularly tough on the United States. They make it almost impossible to do business with them, and yet they send their cars and everything else back into the United States. They can do whatever they like but if they do that, then we put a big tax of 25% on their cars and believe me, they won’t be doing it very long.” Trump went on: “The European Union has not treated us well and it’s been a very, very unfair trade situation. One of the reasons I was elected is I’m protecting our workers, I’m protecting our companies, and I’m not going to let that happen.” Trump has previously criticised carmakers in Europe, especially in Germany, and on Saturday he warned via Twitter that he would slap a tax on them if the EU retaliated against the proposed 25% steel and 10% aluminium tariffs. A ‘loving’ trade war At the White House, Trump did offer possible concessions to other allies. But he said: “When we’re behind on every single country, trade wars aren’t so bad. When we’re down by $30bn, $40bn, $60bn, $100bn, the trade war hurts them, doesn’t hurt us. So we’ll see what happens. We’re going to straighten it out and we’ll do it in a very loving way – it’ll be a loving, loving way. They’ll like us better and they will respect us much more.” Trump spoke shortly after McConnell joined Ryan in announcing his opposition to Trump’s tariff proposal. McConnell warned that the move could trigger a trade war and damage a growing US economy. “There is a lot of concern among Republican senators that this could sort of metastasize into a larger trade war,” McConnell said. The criticism is a rare departure for the Republican leaders, who worked with Trump to pass a $1.5tn tax cut last year. Republicans doubt Trump is wed to any single plan and are hopeful he can be persuaded to accept a more modest and narrower proposal. But Cohn’s departure may change that calculus. News of Cohn’s resignation came shortly after Trump claimed that, despite recent turmoil, morale on his team was high. He said: “The White House has tremendous energy, it has tremendous spirit.” He added: “It is a great place to be working. Many, many people want every single job. Believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office, they all want a piece of the West Wing. “It’s tough. I like conflict, I like having two people with different points of view, and I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it, I like seeing it, and I think it’s the best way to go.” He said: “So many people want to come in. I have a choice of anybody. I could take any position in the White House and I’ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position – everybody wants to be there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/mar/09/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27447","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T12:00:36Z","webTitle":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,447","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/mar/09/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27447","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/mar/09/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27447","fields":{"headline":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,447","bodyText":"Across 9 disparate DISPARA(g/T)E 10 ennui (s)E(e)N (i)N( m)U(s)I(c) 11 siren double def 12 neighbour NEIGH/(a)BOU(t)/(a)R(t) [Arab = horse] 13 bar code BAR  E 14 whippet WHIP + PET 17 usher US + HER 20 geese (th)ESE EG(gs) (hidden rev) 21 solvers LOVER’S less (mis)S(ing) (anag) 22 two-step WET SPOT (anag) [Texas two-step] 24 timetable TIME(s) TABLE [S = skinhead] 26,25 touch-tone TOUCH(s)TONE [ditto] 28 apron A  N 29 love match L  ATCH Down 1 ides gobI DESert (hidden) 2 usurer (men)U/SURER 3 main course double def 4 sarnie A in SIREN (anag) 5 reviewer R(ight)/E  WER 6 mesh M(aggi)E/S(mit)H 7 uncouple UN COUPLE [French husband and wife] 8 liar L(acking)/I(ntegrity)/A(s)/R(eporter) 15 in good time IN + GOOD TIME 16 twerp (an)TWERP 18 hallmark H  K [HK = Hong Kong] 19 baseball BASE  L 22,19across,13 twelve-bar blues depression after long pub crawl 23 trusty T/RUSTY 24 trap (con)TRAP(tion) (hidden) 27 ha-ha double def"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/07/caring-for-a-suicidal-loved-one","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:09:56Z","webTitle":"Caring for a suicidal loved one | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/07/caring-for-a-suicidal-loved-one","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/07/caring-for-a-suicidal-loved-one","fields":{"headline":"Caring for a suicidal loved one","bodyText":"Amid the debate about the lack of care received by patients suffering from mental ill health, the impact this lack of care has on the “carers” must be considered (Report, 6 March). My husband recently killed himself after six years of suffering from severe depression. Four years previously he had made a very serious suicide attempt. Despite this, he was returned home from hospital the very next day as “he was not suicidal”. After 14 nightmare days he began to claw himself and was eventually admitted to a psychiatric ward. After three months on the ward, during which he had made a further suicide attempt and tried to escape on two occasions, he was discharged, still highly suicidal. Suddenly I was deemed to be his carer. I was not asked if I was happy to take on this role or if I was even capable of caring for him. I was given a leaflet on how to apply for benefits and “rewarded” with 10 yoga classes. I pointed out to a community mental health nurse that they were expecting me to care for a man who had twice attempted to abandon me and part of me hated. Living with a man seriously intent on suicide is mental torture. Now, due to the stress of trying to keep him alive for years, the shock of his suicide and the weight of my grief I am left with acute trauma. I have effectively stopped functioning, my adult son is now forced to be my carer. Two weeks ago I presented the health trust with a 24-page complaint. This comprised of the emails I had sent them over a two-year period expressing my concerns about his treatment. After two years I was too worn down to continue the fight. One of my last emails read simply “I am now completely unable to cope with [my husband]”. This must stop. Name and address supplied • While 271 deaths after NHS failures is an appalling statistic, we need to apply careful thought to what an appropriate response might be. One has to consider the impact of the “zero suicide” policy and its “every suicide is preventable” mantra. Those with mental health problems are already at risk of having their liberty taken from them when they are deemed in dire need of assessment and treatment. In 1999 research by Aaron Beck et al showed how very few people deemed to be at high risk of suicide go on to do so. They estimated that even in a group with 100 times higher risk of suicide than the average person in the street, you would need to detain and observe 500 people for one year to save one life. This is not to say that this isn’t worth doing, but that there needs to be clarity around the implications of saving a life. Those with mental health problems (one in four of us) often find that their voice does not get heard once they have entered services. I wonder how this will be helped if the interventions of staff are aimed not towards achieving the best outcomes for their patient, but ensuring that clinicians cannot be blamed if tragedy occurs. Keir Harding Wrexham • Your investigation on preventable deaths linked to mental health services, including those for children and young people, is powerful evidence of the systemic failures that frontline staff such as child psychotherapists have been trying to raise awareness of for several years. As well as being dreadful individual and family tragedies, the avoidable deaths of the young people you report demonstrate a continuing lack of specialist care that the government and local commissioners are failing to address. Evidence from Young Minds and the Royal College of Psychiatrists is that funding is not reaching the front line, and that many areas struggle to provide comprehensive services meeting the full range of needs, especially for children and young people with severe and complex conditions. According to a recent survey of therapists and counsellors in the NHS, 84% say that, over the last five years, young people have needed to have increasingly high levels of illness in order to access services. Your investigation shows that, even then, many are not receiving adequate care or effective treatment. Unless new money is ringfenced for specialist NHS services and training we will continue to fail the most vulnerable in our society in ways that are truly shocking.

The Labour leader used prime minister’s questions to accuse May of failing to stand up to the Saudis over human rights abuses and possible war crimes in Yemen. May defended her links with Bin Salman, who will meet the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, as well as senior ministers, during his three-day visit. She said engagement was the only way to have influence over the Saudis. But Corbyn urged the prime minister to stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia over its intervention in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians and worsened a humanitarian catastrophe, and take the crown prince to task on human rights. Speaking after PMQs, Corbyn’s spokesman expanded on Labour’s position, saying arms sales and the involvement of British military personnel provided a level of complicity over the situation in Yemen. “Britain has not only increased arms supplies to Saudi Arabia dramatically since the start of the war, not only supports the war, as Theresa May said in the chamber just now, but British military personnel advise the Saudi air force and military on targeting – and so there is a direct involvement in the conduct of the war,” he said. “Which as we know has led to very large numbers of civilian casualties and very clear evidence of the targeting of schools and hospitals. Very large numbers of children have been killed. “British military personnel are in the operations rooms where these military and bombing campaigns are being conducted. If they’re trying to avoid civilian casualties, it’s been a disastrous failure.” The spokesman said the apparent targeting of civilian infrastructure in Yemen, including hospitals and schools was a war crime. “It’s essential that it is stopped.” Bin Salman, 32, has promised to liberalise Saudi society and allow more rights for women. However, he has also proved an authoritarian ruler, and his accession to power has coincided with increased Saudi involvement in Yemen. Addressing May at PMQs, Corbyn said: “Despite much talk of reform, there’s been a sharp increase in the arrest and detention of dissidents; torture of prisoners is common; human rights defenders routinely sentenced to lengthy prison terms. “Unfair trials and executions are widespread, as Amnesty International confirm. As she makes her arms sales pitch, will she also call on the crown prince to halt the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia?” May responded by citing security and anti-terrorist cooperation with the Saudis, and said she would raise rights concerns with Bin Salman. On Yemen, Corbyn said Germany had halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia but UK sales had risen. “It cannot be right that her government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes,” he said. May said the government was increasing aid to Yemen, and pointed to a meeting she had with Bin Salman in Riyadh in December at which she demanded an end to the blockade of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. “I’m pleased to say that Saudi Arabia then did just that,” she said. “This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them.” The rest of the pair’s Commons exchange was devoted to homelessness, a topic introduced by Corbyn with the question: “Why does the prime minister think that rough sleeping fell under Labour but has doubled under the Conservatives?” May said the government was spending millions of pounds on the issue. In response to another question from Corbyn, she said a government rough-sleeping taskforce set up in November had met earlier on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/11/american-cornish-pasties-did-king-arthur-die-for-this","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T10:00:27Z","webTitle":"American Cornish pasties?

American “Cornish” pasties could be on their way into Britain. And yet Arthur, who swore to return if his land was imperilled, sleeps soundly still in his Tintagel cave. American Cornish pasties? Say the horrible words and savour their bitter taste. Was this desecration what Leave-voting Cornwall voted for? Did proud Cornwall want the crusty foodstuff that has made Kernow beloved worldwide replaced by a foul foreign fake? Did Arthur die on adulterous Mordred’s lance to see the sacred pasty cuckolded so? Did Henry Jenner, bard of Boscawen-Un, strive to revive Cornwall’s lost language for his cultural inheritors to ask the man in Pengenna Pasties for a King Size American? Did the noble Cornish folk want nothing more than to be Donald Trump’s Brexit pasty whores? Because that is all they are! Especially the people from London who own cottages there!! And Rick Stein!!! The Leave-voting Cornish comedian Jethro Tull has appeared twice on the Leave-voting comedian Jim Davidson’s Generation Game show, demonstrating how to make Cornish pasties. During one sequence, Tull mocked the interfering EU for insisting pasty preparers wear gloves. Now he and Davidson will be able to fly to America and see Cornish pasties being made by Hispanic slave labour from factory-farmed, hormone-ridden cattle, doused in petroleum, reduced to pulp and squeezed from automatic tubes into pre-molded pasty pastry Hot Cornwall Pockets™®. Doubtless they are delighted. If he could see the meat and potato atrocities about to be enacted in the name of his beloved Cornish pasties, Cornwall’s holy Saint Piran would turn in his grave, had his remains not been split up and sent all around the country in the 14th century. As it is, one of Saint Piran’s arms revolves in Exeter Cathedral, the other in Waltham Abbey, while his missing head spins somewhere undisclosed in St Piran’s Old Church, Perranzabuloe. In the Mad Max dystopia of our post-Brexit nation, it is unlikely hungry Britannia will have the luxury of rejecting Donald Trump’s food regulation-relaxing advances, no matter how many times she slaps his tiny hands away from her cool thigh.

The West Cornwall Pasty Company’s honest fayre is one of the comforts of the road to an endlessly touring comedian and last week I needed my Cornish culinary compensation. During these last, final weeks of my 18-month standup comedy tour around broken Brexit Britain, I have been reading the 1967 novel Ice by the science-fiction pioneer and heroin enthusiast Anna Kavan, newly rescued from oblivion by Peter Owen Publishers. Ice eerily depicts a man travelling through a Kafkaesque collapsing society, beset by an encroaching ice age, against the backdrop of some imminent but unspecified political catastrophe. What ghostly forces of guidance compelled me to read this prophetic novel at this exact moment in time? Mother? Are you there? Is that you? On Thursday night, I and my tour manager were trapped in Bristol by the Beast from the East and I was denied two days back with my resentful family in London, as we remained there until Sunday and a date in Plymouth. An audience member’s ice-skidding car had crashed into the loading doors of the Bristol theatre, where it remained for days, blocking our exit, closing the Overton window of our departure and tripling our hotel bill. I missed the kids and sat in reading Ice, worrying about their futures until my heart ached. On Sunday we set off toward Plymouth. Though the sudden snow was thawing, all along the A386 abandoned cars lay shipwrecked in laybys, ditched during Thursday’s snowstorm and now stripped clean of parts and fabrics, the Devonshire locals reverting to type at the first sign of a social breakdown. At the Fox Tor cafe in Princetown, high on Dartmoor, above the prehistoric stone rows of Merrivale, I suspended my diet to stand and scoff a Cornish pasty, looking out across the ancient, frost-flecked landscape of the nation that made me. The pasty was good eating, and authentically Cornish too, but there was a bitter aftertaste not of its own making. As I ate into the pasty, I felt the very notion of Britain itself being eaten away, like some kind of enormous metaphor. On his Cornish deathbed in 1934, the last Cornish words of the Cornish language revivalist Henry Jenner were: “Here in Cornwall, we do not need other meat and pastry products. The whole object of my life has been to inculcate into the Cornish people, and the Cornish pasties, a sense of their Cornishness. Either that chicken and mushroom slice goes or I do. Aaaagh!” How sad that Brexit befouls Jenner’s legacy and turns his Cornish pasty to cows’ dungs in our mouths. Wake, proud Arthur! Wake and bake!!

I asked his mother about my son’s arrival. It didn’t go well. I mean the conversation, not the birth. Because it soon became clear that I couldn’t remember a thing about it. “How can you not remember that?” she asked, not uncrossly. I think the reason is that I found the whole experience so stressful and terrifying that I’ve deleted it from my memory. I’ve enjoyed what’s happened since – you know, parenting – but not the birth itself. (Apparently that didn’t go well either, there were some complications, induction, a ventouse, tearing … you didn’t need to know that, did you? Erase it.) It’s not just the birth of my own children that stresses me out. I don’t enjoy other people’s, either. Worrying about things going wrong and the potential for tragedy eclipses all the joy of procreation. One Born Every Minute makes me physically tense. This series is filmed in Birmingham women’s hospital, so there’s a nice Brummieness to it now. A birth with Brummie accents is preferable; everyone should insist on it. Put it on the birth plan regardless of your location. First up are Rav and Sharon. They have got a nice story. Rav was expecting to have an arranged marriage, but then he met Sharon at work, where he was night manager. They ended up having a cheeky kiss in the security room and later fell for each other, quite hard. There was a problem though: Rav’s from the wrong caste, a lower one than Sharon and her parents weren’t happy about the match ... until they met him, and fell for him, too. We catch up with her when her waters have broken and she’s having contractions. And I’m feeling that sick, tight tension in my stomach again. Never mind, Sharon, I’ll take some gas and air please. It’s brave of her to have this intense, personal experience laid bare for the nation. Very bare, in fact, even with the pixelation. I’d have opted for extra pixelation on the birth plan, along with the gas and air and accents. Oh, that was quick and relatively easy (again, I mean for me). It – she, Reeva, 6lb 10oz (why imperial measures still for baby weight?) – is here. Turns out she’s a genius, she’s already written Rav a thank you card, thank you for being my daddy. That could be another Channel 4 idea, Baby Genius. Whose caste does Reeva take I wonder? Hopefully it won’t matter at all when it’s her time to get hitched. Anyway, there’s no time to get to know Reeva. Because it’s straight on to the next birth and this one looks potentially more problematic. Samantha had leukemia as a child and was told she might never have children herself. But after three years of trying with husband Tony, she got pregnant. The baby was premature, though – 25 weeks – and there were further complications and they lost her. Little Victoria. Oh God, I cannot even begin to imagine. Harriet the midwife also had cancer, when she was pregnant. It worked out fine, but it has given her an extra layer of compassion, she says. Harriet’s brilliant. Samantha has had another baby, a healthy boy, since. But, still, everyone at BWH is on high alert today, Tony’s a wreck, I’m a wreck, cancel the gas and air, make mine an epidural. Double. Whose ridiculous idea was it to put this on TV? The baby is born and it is fine. But Samantha has suffered severe blood loss, and the emergency buzzer is pressed; in they come, the Swat team, and Samantha is rushed to theatre, oh God … Cut to later. Tony is at home on the sofa feeding baby Arthur with a bottle. But where is Samantha? Here she is, coming in through the door and all is well. No, I’m sorry, they can’t do that – well, they can, and they did, but they shouldn’t have done. It’s not as if we’re talking about whether or not she got fired by Lord Sugar – it’s about whether or not she died. This is childbirth, about the most dramatic, emotional thing that happens in anyone’s life, and One Born Every Minute captures that well. It really doesn’t need to throw in any extra, manufactured television “drama”. Obviously (I hope!) they wouldn’t have done it like that if she hadn’t made it, but even so, too much. Maybe I’m just feeling a bit sensitive, after the trauma of watching OBEM. Time for another memory wipe. We have another birthday coming up next week in this house, a fourth one. Just four years ago, and nope, I couldn’t tell you anything about it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-diversity-in-classical-music-quality-and-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:56:08Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on diversity in classical music: quality and equality | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-diversity-in-classical-music-quality-and-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-diversity-in-classical-music-quality-and-equality","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on diversity in classical music: quality and equality","bodyText":"It is a moment that may not be as celebrated, or as headline-grabbing, as Frances McDormand’s Oscar speech urging Hollywood A-listers to consider “inclusion riders” – contractual clauses insisting that certain proportions of black and minority ethnic, disabled, women and LGBT workers be employed on their film projects. But in its own, much less glitzy and high-profile way, Britain’s classical music world is making strides towards unravelling a situation that has seen a centuries-long dominance of its ranks of musicians, conductors and composers by one particular group: white men. In 2015 Chineke!, Europe’s first majority black and minority ethnic orchestra, made its debut. Founded by British double bassist Chi-chi Nwanoku, it joyfully celebrates BME classical virtuosity and stands as a challenge for the industry to do better in terms of nurturing, recognising and hiring diverse talent. In 2017, Sound and Music, the national charity for new music, promised that it would work with equal numbers of male and female composers by 2020. Last week, the Proms, Cheltenham music festival, Aldeburgh festival and Huddersfield contemporary music festival announced they would achieve a 50-50 gender balance across composers commissioned, and performers and speakers booked, by 2022 – just some of the 45 European music festivals and conferences signing up to an initiative begun by Britain’s Performing Right Society Foundation. This week an important conservatoire, Trinity Laban in London, announced its Venus Blazing project. Music by women, from all eras, will make up more than 50% of concert programmes in its 2018/19 academic year, and it is pledging to grow its library to include more scores by historically overlooked women composers. This kind of move is especially important. The canon is currently overwhelmingly male – but, as scholarly work has made abundantly clear over the past several decades, there are legions of women composers whose work is rarely performed: this needs to change. To many, this insistence on fairness will seem utterly logical. However, such moves have met with opposition from some in the industry. They see attending to diversity as imperilling a culture of excellence in which the only criterion for inclusion ought to be quality. Others argue that, while British women composers have only recently gained a foothold in mainstream composing careers, there is, now, a level playing field. By imposing targets on equality, goes the argument, these younger women will be advantaged at the expense of older men. These arguments hold little water. Attending to diversity does not quash quality but increases it, widening the pool of talent rather than reducing it to a small, historically privileged group. And, by boldly looking outwards at the world around it – in all its richness – British classical music stands a greater chance of flourishing and growing as it should, rather than withering as so many fear. Naturally, it would be preferable if equality could be achieved without targets imposed and commitments signed up to – but Thursday’s International Women’s Day will be a fitting moment to recall that shifting traditional inequalities is a struggle, and takes more than a vague sense of optimism. The power of unconscious bias – the unreflecting process by which racism and sexism are perpetuated even by decent and fair-minded people – demands to be combated with something stronger than good intentions. A healthy cultural world is one in which all kinds of voices are heard and enjoyed. A healthy cultural world is one that honours the moral imperative to be fair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/07/eu-we-will-retaliate-to-protection-with-tariffs-on-us-imports","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T18:17:06Z","webTitle":"EU: We will retaliate to protection with tariffs on US imports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/07/eu-we-will-retaliate-to-protection-with-tariffs-on-us-imports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/07/eu-we-will-retaliate-to-protection-with-tariffs-on-us-imports","fields":{"headline":"EU: We will retaliate to protection with tariffs on US imports","bodyText":"The European Union has responded to Donald Trump’s threat of a trade war by warning that it will retaliate with tariffs on a range of US imports including peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. Reacting to the threat from the US president of 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on aluminium, European commissioner for trade Cecilia Malmström said on Wednesday the EU was finalising its own list of American exports that could face sanctions, including steel, industrial and agricultural products. However, Malmström also said the EU still hoped to avoid a full blown trade war, despite the escalating rhetoric between the US and its main global trading partners in recent days. “A trade war has no winners and if it does not happen for the better, then we can work with our American friends and other allies on the core issue of this problem, overcapacity,” she told reporters at a press conference in Brussels. “But if it does happen we will have to take measures to protect European jobs.” Malmström, a veteran of trade talks with the US, said she was eager to avoid an escalation in the war of words between Washington and Brussels over tariffs, saying: “We do not want this to go out of proportion.” But she said the EU needs to have “rebalancing” measures ready, to safeguard the EU economy and protect jobs. “We cannot just stay silent when such a major measure could be taken to the EU economy,” she said. She said a provisional list of US products that could face EU tariffs is being drawn up and will be published after consultation with member states. “Certain types of bourbon are on the list, as are other items such peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice,” she added. “Very soon that list will be public, so you will be able to plan your whisky drinking.” Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, also weighed in urging “politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to act responsibly”.EU leaders would discuss the trade dispute during a summit at the end of March in Brussels where a “proportionate response” would be discussed. “We should have a clear objective in mind: to keep world trade alive,” Tusk said. Trump announced last week in a tweet that he intended to use his powers to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, honouring a campaign pledge to support domestic smoke stack industries. He later went further by saying this could be extended to European cars following threats from EU officials of counter-measures against US imports such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon whiskey. Prime minister Theresa May told Trump in a phone conversation that she was concerned about the plan to increase tariffs, saying there were other ways of coping with an over-supply of cheap raw materials entering the US. Trump’s move triggered the resignation of his chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banker who supports free trade, late on Tuesday. Following Cohn’s decision to become the latest White House aide to quit, the president earned a rebuke from Paul Ryan, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, who said he was “extremely worried” about the plan. The threat of trade barriers prompted a sell-off on the Dow Jones Industrial index, which is down almost 2,000 points since January from a record high of 26,616. Investors sold heavily again on Wednesday following Malmström’s statement, with the Dow Jones index down about 300 point and just over 1% by 6pm (GMT). The dollar fell against the yen and euro as foreign exchange traders calculated that US firms would be hit by the extra cost of raw materials, while the pound also fell amid concerns that Britain’s open economy would be badly hit in a trade war. But Trump won plaudits from unlikely quarters in Congress and among trade unions. Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who has called for Trump to resign, said in a tweet: “I urge the administration to follow through and to take aggressive measures to ensure our workers can compete on a level playing field.” US Steel, backed by the United Steelworkers’ union, said it would reopen a mothballed facility in Granite City, Illinois, which it said had closed following “unending waves of unfairly traded steel products that have flooded US markets”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/08/labour-punish-firms-gender-pay-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T00:01:36Z","webTitle":"Labour would punish firms for not closing gender pay gaps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/08/labour-punish-firms-gender-pay-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/08/labour-punish-firms-gender-pay-gap","fields":{"headline":"Labour would punish firms for not closing gender pay gaps","bodyText":"Labour will fine employers who do not close their gender pay gaps, the party will pledge on International Women’s Day. Under a Labour government, the party said all private and public employers who have 250 workers or more would not only have to audit their gender pay, but prove they are taking action to close the gap or face a fine from the government. The party plans to publicly consult on the policy, including with businesses, trade unions and women’s organisations, including non-departmental public bodies. The government has already introduced a legal requirement for all major employers to publish their data on gender pay and bonuses by April 2018. Labour said it would go further and impose sanctions on businesses that had significant gaps in the pay of male and female staff. It will propose mandatory certification for large firms to have tailored action plans to close the gender pay gap, to be certified by the government every two years. Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler said the party believed companies needed to be sanctioned if they didn’t act on the data. “Auditing is not enough, we need action,” she said. “Some of the companies are using loopholes to get out of giving the full picture, and then there’s no real enforcement if you are found to have a huge gap. We don’t just want people to identify the pay gap, we want the pay gap to close.” Labour has already said organisations that can show they are working to close the pay gap are the only ones who will have access to government contracts. “We will only do business with people paying their employees equally,” Butler said. “It is an incentive for business to pay women better. It is an incentive for progression.” Employers that fail to obtain this certification would face further auditing and eventually fines, Labour said. Butler said the model would be like Iceland’s policy where employers are fined £355 a day if they do not submit their data or adequate plans to close the gap. “We’d be looking at doing something similar,” she said. “It’s something that could quickly mount up and that’s why it’s important we look at the business case for doing this. Huge disparity has emerged in the gender pay audit data that has been published so far this year. At easyJet, the data showed the hourly rate for women is 45% lower that of their male colleagues, and 89% of the best-paid staff are men, while 68.9% of the worst-paid are women. At Barclays, women’s median hourly rate is 43.5% lower than male colleagues and the data revealed that women’s bonuses are 73.3% lower. Travel group Tui has the largest gender pay gap reported to date by a major UK company, with its male employees paid more than double the female staff. Labour has published its own gender pay audit, which found male employees earn 4% more on average than women in the party. “We do need to close that gap, even though it is smaller than average,” Butler said. Male MPs earn 10.4% more on average than female MPs, higher than the pay gap at the BBC, analysis by the Sunday Times found last week, taking outside earnings and ministerial salaries into account. Butler said the disparity among MPs showed how a gender pay gap could emerge even when employees are ostensibly paid the same amount. “The average bonus pay gap is 46.4%, it’s similar to how male MPs end up being paid more than female MPs,” she said. “It’s a difficult one to tackle, apart from promoting more women as ministers, which is always a good thing.” An International Women’s Day flag is set to fly over parliament for the first time on Wednesday, at Butler’s suggestion, as MPs and peers mark the day with a debate in both Houses of Parliament. The Speaker of the House, John Bercow, said the flag would “remind us of what has been achieved and how far their is to go to achieve full gender equality” and said it was an initiative supported by MPs from all parties as parliamentarians commemorated 100 years of the first women getting the vote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/08/macbeth-review-kit-monkman-mark-rowley-akiya-henry","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Macbeth review – full of sound and fury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/08/macbeth-review-kit-monkman-mark-rowley-akiya-henry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/08/macbeth-review-kit-monkman-mark-rowley-akiya-henry","fields":{"headline":"Macbeth review – full of sound and fury","bodyText":"This adaptation of Shakespeare’s play was shot on a green-screen soundstage, enabling visual-effects teams to slot the performers into an intricately detailed, impossibly constructed space. It’s as if the whole shebang is unfolding in a cross between a gigantic astrolabe and a renovated gasometer, with pencilled-in architectural flourishes. Like director Kit Monkman’s previous feature (co-directed with Marcus Romer) The Knife That Killed Me, the end result creates an edgy, visually innovative background which is lush to watch but constantly upstages the foreground action, especially since, to put it politely, not everyone in the cast has the chops to handle the material. One noble exception is experienced stage performer Akiya Henry as a fierce and formidable Lady Macbeth. Sadly, Mark Rowley in the lead role is less nuanced and commanding, although some viewers may find the shot of him shirtless, showing off a chiselled physique, will represent some compensation. Purists will inevitably grumble about the cut-and-paste approach to the text which, for example, makes the “To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow” speech into Macbeth’s last words. But at least all the sound and fury of visuals creates a modern texture that might appeal to younger viewers swotting for A-levels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/mar/09/mothers-day-nightmare-films","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"Murder, monsters and massage: seven Mother's Day films to avoid at all costs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/09/mothers-day-nightmare-films","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/09/mothers-day-nightmare-films","fields":{"headline":"Murder, monsters and massage: seven Mother's Day films to avoid at all costs","bodyText":"We’ve all been there: you type “Transsiberian” into a streaming service once and spend the next three weeks fighting off the Transformers franchise. Botched film recommendations have been a thing since the VHS era. Remember the episode of One Foot in the Grave when Victor Meldrew discovers Mrs Warboys is a Mork &amp; Mindy fan and accidentally rents Alien? Given the prevalence of the “because you watched …” algorithm, here are seven films tagged “mother” that should be avoided at all costs this Sunday. Do not add to basket, and be prepared to lunge for the remote should mum’s thumb hover over play. Caution: spoilers. Robin Redbreast (1970) With a title like that, you’d be forgiven for thinking this feature-length BBC drama is a Springwatch spinoff. Possibly a show that celebrates the unspoiled gardens of yesteryear? It does, kind of. Jilted script editor Anna Cropper moves to an isolated cottage to escape from London’s “lecherous owls”. Her friends seem concerned at her pre-Good Life opting-out. Isn’t this the 70s equivalent of giving up wifi? But breaking convention is the least of our heroine’s worries when she hears wind like “voices, or a child”, and finds a halved marble on her windowsill. This unsettling drama about starting again in middle age turns into a rural chiller that foreshadows The Wicker Man. If you stick this one on, expect a traumatised mum whose only respite will come during the scenes where stuntman Andy Bradford performs nude karate in the woodlands. Only God Forgives (2013) On the surface, a safe bet. Glowing Thai location, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ryan Gosling in stubble-and-staring mode. But these ingredients combine to form a poison: within minutes of checking into her hotel, a spectacularly potty-mouthed KST is dropping the C-bomb and comparing her sons’ genitals (“Julian’s was never small, but Billy’s was … oh, it was enormous!”). When she’s off screen, the evangelical Lt Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) is lopping people’s hands off , and TV’s Cormoran Strike (Tom Burke) is drooling over underage prostitutes. Mum might need company for this one – we recommend taking as many toilet trips as you can get away with, unless you’re comfy with oedipal vivisection sequences. White Heat (1949) You can’t go wrong with a Jimmy Cagney film, surely? Unless it’s one that implies mum’s method of parenting shares traits with Ma Jarrett (Margaret Wycherly), who raised a murderous, pyromaniac gang-banger. Just because it regularly features on Turner Classic Movies doesn’t mean this is a safe film to cue up before the restaurant. You don’t want the special lady thinking she’s being likened to a woman who dismisses her son’s psychotic rages as due to “cold mountain air”, and takes a little too long with head massages. Tangled (2010) A Trojan horse from Disney. They replace the wicked stepmother trope with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), a villainess who does so much gaslighting BP could build a rig around her. Convincing the heroine that she is second best is one thing, but kidnapping her as a baby, raising her in the forest, using her hair as a paternoster lift and insisting that everyone outside of the tower is a sociopath? And then singing about it? This may send mixed messages about mum’s grounding technique. Do not screen until 12 March. The Babadook (2014) A family-centred Aussie folk story? Sort of like Dot and the Kangaroo, then? Not quite. Essie Davis is the recently widowed Amelia Vanek, whose grief is causing her to see monsters. Even Father Karras would run a mile from the croaking, top hat-sporting bogeyman who visits her. So perhaps it’s no surprise that she eventually succumbs to his power, becoming an ink-vomiting monster who has to be knocked out and chained up in the basement by her son. If you put this on for mother, she may overanalyse. Don’t be surprised if the grandkids are given pop-up books for Christmas in return. Psycho 2 (1983) The Bateses don’t make for ideal family entertainment – no one’s going to watch any of the Psycho films for their exploration of motherly love. But Richard Franklin’s underrated sequel to the 1960 mould-breaker is more than worthy of its “mother” tag: it trebles the previous film’s number of mums, with each doing some very twisted things in the name of shielding their children. If this happens to be airing while yours is having her tea, try to resist the temptation to pick up your coal shovel. 28 Weeks Later (2007) If you’re not a zombie aficionado, you might think the title belies a romcom about those tricky first two trimesters. But Juan Carlos Fresnadillo’s movie has a more grisly take on the theme of incubation. At the height of an outbreak of the “rage” virus, a mum (Catherine McCormack) was abandoned in a house filling with frenzied strangers by her husband, Robert Carlyle. But she survived! Can she forgive him? Or will she perpetrate a second outbreak by giving her cowardly bloke a contaminated snog? He probably deserves it. Expect mum to throw things at the screen every time he appears. Threads (1984) Thanks to a combination of the Doomsday Clock, a newly released US Blu-Ray and a restored UK special edition, Threads is trending. So there’s a serious chance mum might stumble across “the most terrifying film of all time” when seeking out Phantom Thread. If that happens, don’t take any chances – grab the remote from her hand, yank the power from the screen and run. Because, unless you’re harder than Matilda’s Mrs Trunchbull, Mick Jackson’s film – which follows a couple who fall pregnant on the eve of a nuclear apocalypse – is scarring. The world’s leaders decide to use their red buttons, and everything burns, shatters and rots. Governments included. Even if you’ve endured childbirth, Threads is still one hell of an ordeal. Expect it to mess mum and the rest of the family up more than universal credit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/mar/07/frankenstein-mary-shelley-sun","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T16:00:55Z","webTitle":"Just how monstrous is the Sun's 'Flakensteins' story?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/07/frankenstein-mary-shelley-sun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/07/frankenstein-mary-shelley-sun","fields":{"headline":"Just how monstrous is the Sun's 'Flakensteins' story?","bodyText":"As Sun headlines go, “Flakensteins” isn’t really up there with the classics such as “Gotcha”, “Up Yours Delors” and the immortal “Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster”, but it’s causing something of a stir nonetheless. “Snowflake students claim Frankenstein’s monster was ‘misunderstood’ – and is in fact a VICTIM” trumpeted the Sun’s story on Tuesday, echoing an earlier Times article that drew from a new edition of Mary Shelley’s 200-year-old novel. In its foreword, Exeter University’s Nick Groom writes that many students are sympathetic to the creature given life by Victor Frankenstein, despite the fact that the tortured monster then, as the Sun succinctly puts it, “murders his creator’s brother, pal and bride”. Howls of social media derision ensued, as the villagers of Twitter jovially took up their pitchforks and torches to point out that, yes, this was the whole point of Shelley’s book. On first glance, the Sun article seems to be conflating the true and the popular images of Frankenstein’s creation. In the book he is horrific to gaze upon, but intelligent and emotional, teaching himself to read and speak, tortured by his desire to live as other men do, all the while wrestling with whether he is human at all. But through the wider cultural lens, Frankenstein’s monster is a green-skinned, flat-topped colossus, tombstone of brow and heavy of eye, who grunts and groans his way through several lissom maidens. It’s interesting where that version of the monster came from, because even the early movie adaptations of the book, including the classic and instantly recognisable Boris Karloff take in the 1931 film, still present a tortured and conflicted soul. The popular idea of Frankenstein’s monster being dumb seems to stem from Scooby-Doo cartoons. However, the Sun story is not a result of a failure to grasp the basic concept of Frankenstein. They are not stupid. The received wisdom is that the average Sun reader is a flaccid, working-class Brexiter. But if that’s even remotely true, don’t make the mistake of thinking that of the people who put the paper together. Some of my best friends have worked on the Sun. They were all liberal-minded; rabid leftwingers in some cases. Most of them had even been to university. This is not a story about being too thick to understand a 200-year-old book. No, just as Mary Shelley’s novel was a meditation on humanity dressed up as a horror story, this Sun piece is purely an ideological prejudice dressed up as a cultural phenomenon. It’s about poking fun at millennials, at the brittle snowflake generation who are the beloved target of the balls-out, men’s men of the right. Ha ha, it’s saying. Look at the simpering liberal softies! They feel sorry for the big, bad murderous monster. It’s attacking empathy, because empathy has no place in the world today. Forget about the other. Look after yourselves. This thing we don’t understand is coming for us. Don’t feel sympathy for it! Lock your doors! Close your borders! Head for the hills! So while the subeditor who wrote the headline could maybe have tried a little harder, the story itself is vintage Sun, akin to their discredited claim in 2003 that asylum seekers were catching swans from London’s parks and eating them. Don’t pity the asylum seekers who might be starving, have a go at them for eating our swans. They belong to the Queen, you know! There’s an interesting postscript to all this, though. You might think that the comments under an online Sun story would be as wretched and rank as Igor’s underpants. But the overwhelming majority of the comments at the time of writing were taking the Sun to task for misunderstanding, wilfully or otherwise, what Frankenstein is actually about. Perhaps the monsters we so often believe to have been created by the Sun, like Frankenstein’s creature, have a lot more depth and understanding than we know."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/14/behemoth-joshua-freeman-history-factory-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T07:30:01Z","webTitle":"Behemoth by Joshua B Freeman review – how factories changed the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/14/behemoth-joshua-freeman-history-factory-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/14/behemoth-joshua-freeman-history-factory-review","fields":{"headline":"Behemoth by Joshua B Freeman review – how factories changed the world","bodyText":"The demise of the factory in the western world ranks high among the explanations for Brexit and Donald Trump. With it came the geographic isolation of the old factory lands from national prosperity, and the alienation of the former factory classes from the mainstream of British and American life. Furnaces lost their fires and smokestacks crashed to the ground. Industrial towns and cities grew ruinous – far too grand for the little business they now contained. People were poorer and felt that governments didn’t care. The US lost roughly 5m manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2016, while the UK lost 619,000 from 2006 to 2016 – adding in each country to the millions that had vanished in the previous three or four decades. An idea of the future also disappeared. These were regarded as “good jobs”: well paid (when they were skilled), secure, with regular hours, subsidised canteens and paid holidays. “The unionised giant factory helped create what many Americans look back at as a golden era of shared prosperity,” writes Joshua B Freeman of a recent time “when children did better than their parents and expected their children to do better than themselves.” That factories could be sites of optimism sits uneasily with our ideas of the Dickensian 19th century and Blake’s satanic mills. To Engels, factory work was “nothing less than torture of the severest kind … in the service of a machine that never stops”. In Das Kapital, Marx wrote that while in handicrafts “the workman makes use of a tool, the factory makes use of him”. And yet ever since the Lombe brothers opened their silk mill in Derby in 1721, a brighter view of the factory has always persisted. The Derby mill was probably the first successful prototype, with a square, prison-like appearance that marked many thousands of its successors, buildings that in Freeman’s definition of a factory contained “a large workforce engaged in coordinated production using powered machinery”. Daniel Defoe saw this mill as a modern marvel, reacting to a visit there with a great explosion of facts (the machinery had 26,586 wheels and could produce 318,504,960 yards of silk thread every 24 hours), starting a tradition of awe-inspiring numbers that continues to this day in China, where it can take an hour to walk from one side of a factory to the other, and where in 2016, at peaks of production, 350,000 workers were employed to make iPhones in a factory complex in Zhengzhou. After Defoe came a long line of factory tourists, including James Boswell, Alexis de Tocqueville, Robert Southey and Anthony Trollope, the last noticing that visitors like himself came to see “the triumphant perfection of British mechanism” rather than the exhausted children who worked nearby. But the truth was that factories produced a kind of dualism – a love-hate relationship – in the public mind, especially after they switched their power source from waterwheels to steam engines, and coal smoke began to blacken the swelling industrial towns. As Freeman points out, Marx’s critique of the generality of capitalism had specific roots in the booming textile factories of northern England, where the exploitation of workers outraged him. Other writers, however, saw well regulated factories as agents of social progress. It was the factory worker, after all, who drew the concern of politicians – parliament passed five Factory Acts between 1802 and 1831 – while the often harsher conditions of agricultural labourers, domestic servants and coal miners went ignored. Factories were easier places to control and improve – they concentrated employment in a single building, where workers had to obey almost military standards of discipline – and so, Freeman writes, they became the vehicle “for not only visions of ever-greater productivity and material bounty but also for the notion that a more humane version of the economic system soon to be dubbed capitalism was possible”. Freeman has written a superb account of how the material world in his phrase became “factory made”. It takes us all the way from 18th-century Derbyshire to 21st-century China and spans the factory’s social, cultural, economic and political effects, as well as its technical progress. Almost every page contains a memorable fact or an intriguing thought, and by treating factories as a global phenomenon, Freeman has freed them from the cliches of the purely national narrative, which in Britain’s case familiarised generations of schoolchildren with very few innovations later than the spinning jenny and the power loom. Of course, British industrial production continued to develop long after those inventions, but the main thrust of factory history moved elsewhere – beyond Europe, to the US and the Soviet Union before its most recent incarnation in China, which, with the increased use of robotics, may be the last society shaped by the factory as a mass employer. Women have a prominent place in this story, most notably after the factory crossed the Atlantic to New England, where cotton mills were set up on riverbanks that were often far from any large settlement. Separated from urban temptation and powered by water until after the civil war – coal deposits were inconveniently located – they enjoyed a more wholesome reputation than their smoky British ancestors. Like British textile factories, they depended on female labour to operate the machinery, while men took the better paid jobs in management and maintenance. In some New England mills, women made up 85% of the workforce. Unlike the typical Lancashire factory girl, they tended to be the literate daughters of farmers who returned to the homestead during downturns in trade rather than staying in their factory lodgings and making trouble; and thereby, as Freeman writes, “avoiding the discontent and disorder that came in England with the creation of a permanent proletariat”. Paternalistic mill owners did their best to create a moral and improving atmosphere; the Lowell mills in Massachusetts even published a magazine of poetry and fiction for its workers. But what did more to change the lives of the mill women was money – that and an interval of self-discovery between daughterhood and wifehood that living away from home allowed. “The mills … provided an escape from families, rural life, boredom and isolation, a chance to experience a new, more cosmopolitan world of independent living, consumer goods and intense sociability,” Freeman writes, quoting a woman who remembered how a worker’s first wages could effect an enormous transformation: from “depressed, modest, mincing” girls into women who looked you in the face and “sang blithely among their looms”. This was the factory effect at its gentlest. As the 19th century wore on, it showed its more brutal side, when the magnates such as Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick refused to improve the hellish conditions of their steel mills and broke up strikes ruthlessly and brutally. Freeman argues that mainstream ideology is mistaken when it associates the achievements of the industrial revolution with individual liberty and the free market. Factories often did best in the opposite conditions, growing up, like the British textile and American iron and steel industries, in a climate of “denied political rights – free speech, free assembly, rule of law”. If more examples are needed to support Freeman’s argument, look no further than China’s present role as factory to the world. Taylorism, Fordism, fascism: Freeman shows how our love-hate relationship with the factory blossomed once again in the 1920s and 30s – the production line hell of Chaplin’s Modern Times on the one hand and Diego Rivera’s heroic Detroit murals on the other.

It is one thing for a team such as Newcastle to attempt to keep the score down against top sides in the hope of a favourable goal difference at the end of the season but if the defending champions are now at it the game has obviously gone. Think of all the stick José Mourinho received when he parked the bus at Anfield in October, yet at least Manchester United emerged with a point. Chelsea got nothing from the Etihad Stadium, which was exactly what they deserved, and in the process of boring everyone half to death they amusingly managed to antagonise Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher, who found themselves unable to promote their televised product as the entertainment advertised. Much more of that and the walls of the Premier League fortress really will start to creak, though before jumping to conclusions or conspiracy theories it may be better to wait a week or so. Chelsea are at Barcelona in the Champions League next Wednesday, the tie is delicately poised at 1-1, and it is just possible Antonio Conte was trying to give his players the best chance of success at Camp Nou by not running them too hard in chasing lost causes at home. If so it would be a high-risk strategy. Defeat in Spain would draw attention to the possibility Chelsea could well be competing in the Europa League next season but Conte’s side were not that far away from Barcelona’s level at Stamford Bridge. If they play as well as they did in the first half at United last month there is a possibility Eden Hazard or Willian may find something to smile about. Equally things could end up even more pear‑shaped than they are at the moment, but that is the gamble you take when you arrive at a position where a season-saving result is necessary against one of the best teams in Europe. Consistency is what most teams strive for, it is certainly what powered Chelsea to the title last season and though United returned to second place with their last-gasp win at Crystal Palace, it could be argued Liverpool, up next at Old Trafford, are having the more consistent campaign. Take Manchester City out of the equation and the pair would be engaged in an old-fashioned ding‑dong at the top, with the meeting on Saturday being billed as a title showdown. Even with City miles out in front an encounter between United and Liverpool can hardly fail to be interesting, especially with Mourinho and Jürgen Klopp in charge. Klopp was frustrated at Anfield because United refused to come out of their defensive crouch and make a game of it, though at the same time he was unwilling to gamble too much in search of a win. United are likely to adopt a similarly cautious approach even when playing at home, because they are aware of the damage players such as Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané can do if allowed space. United are also encouraged by the knowledge defensive tactics have already worn down Tottenham and Chelsea at Old Trafford and Mourinho will doubtless want to see if he can pressure Liverpool into a mistake. Liverpool defensive blunders have not exactly been a scarce currency this season, and though to an extent they have tightened up at the back you still feel goalscoring ability is their chief advantage. Only City have scored more goals but only Liverpool have beaten City in the league and it does not seem to be in Klopp’s nature to ask his players to play within themselves. “I want my players to view each game as a battle to be won,” the Liverpool manager said recently. “If you look at the very best sportspeople in history and the present you see something in their eyes that makes you think that when they are competing they can never be happy or satisfied. This is what I want from us now. Aggression has a negative context, as does anger, but in football it can be the greatest of attributes and a massive positive. I want to see my players angry. Not satisfied or complacent but hungry, alert and aggressive.” It should be stressed Klopp was not talking about the United game there, much less having a go at Chelsea’s apparent defeatism, but setting out (in his programme notes before playing Newcastle) his general sporting principles. As it happens Chelsea’s players do seem quite angry at the moment, just not in a positive way. They could do with some of what Klopp is describing at Barcelona, though the Liverpool manager seems to suggest aggression is not easily switched on and off, even if his side could afford to cruise against Porto on Tuesday as a result of the bite shown in the first leg. While Chelsea’s position is much more precarious, if Conte gets away with this one he will be back to being a genius again and Hazard may find himself reclassified as hard to stop instead of hard to find. Pain in Spain, on the other hand, will see Chelsea discover more than they already know about anger in its negative context."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/07/spiral-audrey-fleurot-paul-anderson-peaky-blinders-tartuffe-west-end","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T14:43:59Z","webTitle":"Spiral's Audrey Fleurot and Peaky Blinders' Paul Anderson to star in West End","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/07/spiral-audrey-fleurot-paul-anderson-peaky-blinders-tartuffe-west-end","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/07/spiral-audrey-fleurot-paul-anderson-peaky-blinders-tartuffe-west-end","fields":{"headline":"Spiral's Audrey Fleurot and Peaky Blinders' Paul Anderson to star in West End","bodyText":"One is known for playing an unpredictable Birmingham gangster; the other for a ruthless Parisian lawyer. Now, the TV stars Paul Anderson (Peaky Blinders) and Audrey Fleurot (Spiral) will appear on stage together, in a new production of Molière’s satire Tartuffe. The show, at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London, claims to be the West End’s “first ever dual-language production” and will alternate between English and French languages and surtitles. Anderson, who plays Arthur Shelby Jr in the BBC’s Peaky Blinders and also starred in Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Oscar winner The Revenant, takes on the title role in the play. Tartuffe is reimagined in this version by Christopher Hampton as a radical American evangelist who uproots the life of a French movie mogul in Hollywood. Fleurot, who plays Joséphine Karlsson in the French crime series Spiral, will star as the tycoon’s cunning wife whom Tartuffe intends to seduce. Hampton’s version of Molière’s The Philanthropist was revived in the West End last year with an all-star cast. Tartuffe, directed by Gérald Garutti, will open on 25 May and runs for 10 weeks at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, which is currently up for sale. Another version of Tartuffe, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company, will open this September. Adapted by Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto, it is set in the Pakistani Muslim community in Birmingham."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/07/carillion-bosses-prioritised-pay-over-company-affairs-mps-hear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T15:19:17Z","webTitle":"Carillion bosses prioritised pay over company affairs, MPs hear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/07/carillion-bosses-prioritised-pay-over-company-affairs-mps-hear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/07/carillion-bosses-prioritised-pay-over-company-affairs-mps-hear","fields":{"headline":"Carillion bosses prioritised pay over company affairs, MPs hear","bodyText":"Former Carillion directors seemed to be more concerned about their pay deals than the operation of the company in the year leading up to its collapse, according to evidence given to MPs by City investment firm BlackRock. The allegation came during the latest hearing of a joint inquiry by two Commons select committees, in which auditor KPMG faced fresh criticism and the investment fund, Aberdeen Standard Investments, appeared to back calls for the big four accounting firms to be broken up. BlackRock managing director Amra Balic told MPs from the business and pensions committees that the investor’s last conversations with the board before Carillion’s collapse were about pay. “My team meets with the board and has interaction with the board,” Balic said. “Most recently in 2016 and 2017 that was around executive pay, where we received a letter from the remuneration committee looking to allow for more opportunity, larger bonuses for the executives and we categorically said no to that. “It seems that the board was focusing more, thinking again how to remunerate executives rather than actually what was going on at the business.” Balic added there had been “definitely too much focus at the board level around remuneration.” She also revealed that BlackRock’s customers made £36m betting that the company’s shares would fall. Her comments on pay follow disclosures that Richard Howson, who headed the company from 2012 until July 2017, pocketed £1.5m in 2016, including a £122,612 cash bonus and £231,000 in pension contributions. As part of his departure deal, Carillion had agreed to continue paying Howson a £660,000 salary and £28,000 in benefits until October 2018. Similar deals were struck for former finance director Zafar Khan and interim chief executive Keith Cochrane. The evidence session also saw leading investment firms back calls to address a lack of competition between the big four accountancy firms that audit the books of major companies, including Carillion’s auditor KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte. Murdo Murchison, the chairman of Carillion’s former largest investor Kiltearn Partners, said: “There appears to be a lack of competition in a key part of the financial system, that periodically causes a lot of participants in that system a lot of trouble.” He said Kiltearn had written to directors at other companies in which it invests that are audited by KPMG, asking them to assess the “quality of service” they are receiving. “We remain puzzled by the fact that someone can be six weeks in a job and discover material issues in accounts that have been approved [by auditors]. “There appear to have been issues that were hidden in plain sight but were not visible to auditors. That’s a puzzle.” “I do share the concern over the audit industry,” said Euan Stirling, Aberdeen Standard Investments’ head of stewardship. “There is a lack of competition.” Murchison also voiced concern about the length of time that one company can act as auditor to the same firm, pointing out that KPMG had analysed Carillion’s books since 1999. He cast doubt on claims by former Carillion directors and KPMG that the company’s finances deteriorated rapidly in spring 2017 when four key contracts were found to be underperforming. “The notion that it all happened in a matter of a couple of months in early 2017 is incredible. There must have been prior issues that were not presented to investors that cause that quite calamitous collapse,” he said. “The scale here is extraordinary. Carillion, we would argue and hope is an exception to the general rule that an investor can rely on audited accounts.” Stirling said it had become clear that Carillion’s former directors were presenting a better picture of the company’s finances than was correct. “There was a gloss to the [shareholder] presentations that we felt did not reflect true business circumstances. “Our dealings with the company suggested a confidence in their approach that wasn’t necessarily supported by the facts.” Referring to non-executive directors, who are tasked with questioning the company’s management, he said they were “hoodwinked as much as anyone else”. The Guardian approached KPMG and former directors of Carillion for comment but had not received a response from either at the time of publication."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/07/woefully-off-track-global-goals-leave-behind-over-half-worlds-children","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T18:08:47Z","webTitle":"'Woefully off track': global goals leave behind over half the world's children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/07/woefully-off-track-global-goals-leave-behind-over-half-worlds-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/07/woefully-off-track-global-goals-leave-behind-over-half-worlds-children","fields":{"headline":"'Woefully off track': global goals leave behind over half the world's children","bodyText":"More than half a billion of the world’s poorest children are invisible to the international organisations that could help them most. Children worldwide are “uncounted” in development targets because they live in countries where the data required to monitor and evaluate key areas such as education and nutrition is unavailable, Unicef has warned. According to a report on child-related sustainable development goals (SDGs), roughly 650 million children live in countries where the targets will remain unattainable unless accelerated progress is made to meet current targets. Following current trends, roughly 10 million children will die of preventable causes before their fifth birthday, while 31 million children will be stunted because they lack adequate nutrition, Unicef claims. “More than half the world’s children live in countries where we either can’t track their SDG progress, or where we can and they are woefully off track,” said Laurence Chandy, Unicef’s director for the division of data, research and policy. “Two years ago, the world agreed on an ambitious agenda to give every child the best chance in life, with cutting-edge data analysis to guide the way. Yet, what our comprehensive report on SDG progress for children reveals plainly is an abject lack of data. Most countries do not have the information even to assess whether they are on track or not.” The Unicef report measures countries’ progress in meeting child-related targets in five areas: health, learning, protection from violence and exploitation, equal opportunity and safe environment. Only a minority of nations have met the targets in learning, protection and equal opportunity, the report showed. On average, roughly 80% of child-related indicators in countries either have insufficient data or show insufficient progress. Unicef said ambitious global targets and immature monitoring frameworks were among the reasons for the paucity of data. The report also projected that, by 2030, 22 million children worldwide would not attend pre-primary education; 150 million girls would marry before their 18th birthday; and 670 million people, many of them children, would not have access to drinking water. Globally, adolescent girls and children from poorer homes and rural areas are at greater risk of being left behind than their peers, according to the report. Ethnic minorities, children with disabilities and migrant children are also considered difficult or impossible to assess given existing data. African countries are off track on twice as many child indicators than countries from any other area, with sub-Saharan Africa at the lowest end of the targets, either lacking data or requiring improvement in more than 90% of all child-related SDG indicators. In Central African Republic, for example, there is not a single indicator of progress in the five child-related SDG targets. Chandy said greater effort was needed to ensure all countries have the minimum data coverage for children, irrespective of their resources or capabilities. “The world must renew its commitments to attaining the SDGs, starting with renewing its commitment to measuring them,” he said. However, the Child Rights International Network said little progress could be made regarding children’s rights because the SDGs are not legally binding. “In neglecting a rights-based framework, the overall narrative of the SDGs is one in which children will continue to be seen as objects of charity rather than as holders of human rights,” said the network’s programme manager, Sabine Saliba Boutruche."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/09/the-divine-order-review-swiss-suffragettes-on-the-march-in-feelgood-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T11:00:34Z","webTitle":"The Divine Order review – Swiss suffragettes on the march in feelgood comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/09/the-divine-order-review-swiss-suffragettes-on-the-march-in-feelgood-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/09/the-divine-order-review-swiss-suffragettes-on-the-march-in-feelgood-comedy","fields":{"headline":"The Divine Order review – Swiss suffragettes on the march in feelgood comedy","bodyText":"The year is 1970, and the suffragettes of Switzerland are marching for the vote. Hang on a minute, 1970? Yep. Swiss women only gained the vote in 1971 (and until 1985 a man could prevent his wife from working). With this good-humoured comedy-drama, writer-director Petra Volpe gives us the fictional story of a housewife who finds her voice during the Swiss referendum. Cleverly, her focus here is on small, ordinary lives, women who will never be remembered in the history books but who risk everything because something inside can’t, won’t allow them to remain silent – though she overeggs the feelgood factor a little. Never mind 1971, it might as well be 1951 in the small village where housewife Nora (Marie Leuenberger) lives with her husband, two sons and miserable git father-in-law. There is not a miniskirt in sight here; the women still dress like the Queen, in headscarves and scratchy woollen tights. “I don’t need to be liberated,” Nora says at the start of the movie. But then her husband, Hans (Maximilian Simonischek), refuses to let her go back to work: “I won’t have my sons eating tinned ravioli.” At the same time, her teenage niece is branded a slut and sent to a young offender institution. Enough is enough: Nora teams up with a cigar-smoking elderly widow to campaign for a yes vote in the village. Her chief opponent is the local anti-women’s rights organiser – a slightly obviously written, handbag-wielding, Mary Whitehouse-style battleaxe. I do wish the comedy here was an inch or two less broad – especially when Nora and her gang travel to Zurich for a protest and find themselves at a dippy, hippy, love-your-vagina workshop. But still, there is something moving, and timely too, in the story of an inspirational wave of feminists threatening the status quo, fearlessly braving ridicule, mockery and the backlash against them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/lift-starting-strength-help-body-stay-young-weightlifting","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T06:11:51Z","webTitle":"Lift your way to strength – and help your body stay young","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/lift-starting-strength-help-body-stay-young-weightlifting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/12/lift-starting-strength-help-body-stay-young-weightlifting","fields":{"headline":"Lift your way to strength – and help your body stay young","bodyText":"Any woman can be strong. I don’t just mean strong in the metaphorical sense – I mean simply being able to exert force against gravity. You may think that strong women are born, not made. You may be thinking of Olympic weightlifters straining to clean and jerk dozens of kilos over their heads, or of bodybuilders in bikinis posing and flexing. Several of the women I interviewed for this article thought that way before they started to lift barbells. “I thought women who lifted were Amazons,” said one. “People who did stuff on TV, who were bulky. And I wasn’t interested.” Another remarked: “I couldn’t see a reason to build up all that bulk.” But strength is not just about appearances. It is a requirement for everyday life. Strength is what you need if you are hoisting your carry-on luggage into the overhead compartment on a plane. You need to be strong to be able to pick your screaming toddler up off the floor and not hurt yourself. And, most of all – especially as you get older – you need strength simply to be able to stand up without falling over. As we age, we progressively lose muscle mass, which studies have shown can lead to loss of bone density and, in general, make us weaker and more frail. In everyday terms, the actions we take for granted become more and more difficult – going up and down steps, picking up something heavy, even standing up from a seat. And with less dense bones, it becomes more likely that on the day you miss that step, or simply lose your balance, it will end with you breaking your arm, or your leg, or your hip. But while ageing is inevitable, building muscle through strength training offers the possibility of slowing down the creep of frailty. According to medical studies, it could also help alleviate some of the symptoms of other conditions of ageing, such as osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes. Barbell lifting can appear intimidating if all you have seen of it is either Olympic weightlifters or heavily muscled bros benching at your local gym. A programme that is becoming more and more commonly used is Starting Strength, which was invented by coach and former powerlifter Mark Rippetoe. The basic Starting Strength programme is composed of four different lifts. There is the squat, where you place weight on your shoulders, squat down until your hips are below your knees, and then stand up again. There are two kinds of presses: the bench press, where you lie on your back and lower weight to your chest and then raise it; and overhead press, where you hold the weight in front of your upper chest while standing up, then raise it over your head. Lastly, there is the deadlift, where you pull the weight up from the floor until you are standing upright. Trainees learn these lifts linear progression. Most people begin to learn the lifts using an empty bar, which weighs 20kg (44lb). Three times a week they perform three of the lifts (squat, either bench press or overhead press, and deadlift). If they are successful in a session, they rest to allow their muscles to recover and adapt to the weight, and then add 2.25kg (or 5lb) at the next session. A little more than two kilos does not sound like much, but if trainees can complete a full month of sessions successfully, they will have gone from being able to squat 20kg to being able to squat 47kg. Another month, and they are up to 74kg. But what if even a 20kg bar is too much? Katherine Bickford, co-host of the More Female Strength podcast and a Starting Strength coach, describes in an episode how she could barely squat down to a low stool with a plastic pipe on her back the first time she attempted to lift in late 2014. But the coach who was teaching her looked her in the eye and said: “You could one day be very strong.” That was enough to make her keep trying. Four weeks later, she successfully squatted with the empty bar. Less than three years later, her personal record for a squat is 100kg (220lb) over the bar’s weight. Liz, 39, a civil servant, came to barbell lifting after a long struggle with injury and disability. She was diagnosed with a rare adult-onset form of muscular dystrophy in her late 20s that weakened the muscles in her shoulders, hips and glutes. She turned to strength training in the hope that it might build muscle to compensate for what she was losing to the disease. When she began, she couldn’t squat because her muscles were so tight; it took weeks of work to be able to perform the lift. For Liz, the most noticeable changes were to simple, everyday tasks. “I was able to go up and down the stairs at the train station a lot more easily, carry groceries, and even put things on the tallest shelf on my closet without difficulty,” she says. Everyday tasks are also easier for senior lifters. Helen and Katie, both 74, and Debbie, 65, came to barbell lifting after having largely given up on other forms of exercise as they aged – they got injured too easily, and recovery would take a long time. “I only started to lift to make my son happy,” Helen says. Her son Owen had taken up the Starting Strength programme and enjoyed it, and encouraged (you might say nagged) his mother to give it a try. “But I knew I would do it for two to three months and then I’d have to give it up,” says Helen. “I had zero hope.” But after training for a while, she noticed big changes. “When I visited my daughter, if her baby needed something, I could pick the baby off the floor with confidence.” Debbie says that lifting helped her favourite hobby: “I love gardening and now, when I go to work in the garden, I check my posture and I know how to lift things properly.” And Katie says: “I helped some people move recently. I could be the strong person that was needed.” But barbell lifting doesn’t just offer physical strength; it also gives women emotional and mental confidence. Liz and Bickford both describe a sense of being liberated from feeling guilty about their bodies. Liz says: “I finally found a sport that doesn’t look at my body shape as an impediment.” For Bickford, learning to lift barbells was about “how good I felt existing in my body and making that better”, rather than punishing herself for having the wrong kind of body. It translated to feeling stronger mentally. “The way I deal with my feelings and external obstacles has been strengthened,” she says. Katie’s daughter Gwyn (48, who happens to be my weightlifting coach) was a ballet and modern dancer from the age of six until she was 32, and after retiring from dance still experienced the body dysmorphia that came with the art’s stringent beauty standards. She lost her self-consciousness after seeing the range of body types among women who lifted. After a while, she thought: “I don’t think I’m fat any more. In fact, I think I’m kind of scrawny!” No matter how you feel about your body, you can always become the strongest version of yourself. As Katie says: “I didn’t realise how much you could change what you had in terms of strength. I’ve never been as strong as this. Never.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/the-five-pick-of-hybrid-fruit-and-vegetables-evermild-badger-flame-oroblanco","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T07:00:23Z","webTitle":"Aprium, anyone?

One of its offerings is the Badger Flame, a beetroot of brilliant orange that a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison bred to produce a sweet and mild variety his children would enjoy. The EverMild onion The troubled reputation of agriculture giant Monsanto was built on Roundup, Agent Orange and genetically modified commodity crops. But it discovered that GM wasn’t as effective in producing new vegetables as a tried-and-tested method: crossbreeding (enhanced for the 21st century by a technique called genetic marking). Among its inventions is the EverMild onion, bred for lower levels of the pyruvate that lend onions their pungency and tear-inducing qualities. The oroblanco The oroblanco was introduced to the world in the 1980s after its development at the University of California Citrus Experiment Station. A cross between the grapefruit and a pomelo, it borrows from the latter to make a less bitter hybrid. Initially unsuccessful because it is green even when ripe, it has bounced back, partly due to success in popularising the similar Sweetie variety in Japan. Black tomatoes Scientists from the US and Israel have experimented with breeding “black tomatoes” that are red on the inside and dark on the outside. Their exterior hue derives from high levels of anthocyanin, the pigment that lends blueberries, blackberries and chokeberries their colour. Black tomatoes are commercially available in the UK under the name Indigo Rose. Apriums and pluots Developed in California in the 1980s by Floyd Zaiger, apriums and pluots are hybrids themselves descended from hybrids. Plums and apricots have been naturally cross-pollinating for centuries. The aprium and pluot were created by tinkering with proportions. The aprium is mostly apricot and part plum; the pluot the other way around."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/08/theresa-may-domestic-violence-bill-women","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T00:01:35Z","webTitle":"Theresa May: Our new domestic violence bill will outlaw economic and physical abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/theresa-may-domestic-violence-bill-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/theresa-may-domestic-violence-bill-women","fields":{"headline":"Our new domestic violence bill will outlaw economic and physical abuse","bodyText":"Last year, I pledged to bring forward new legislation as part of my longstanding commitment to end domestic abuse. Thousands of women endure unimaginable violence and other forms of abuse every single day, often at the hands of those to whom they are closest, in the places they should be safest. I have heard many heart-rending stories, and I am determined to stop others suffering. Doing so will require a change across the whole of society in the way we think about and tackle domestic abuse. Prosecutions and convictions are increasing, but it is not good enough. In 2016/17, 82 women and 13 men were killed by a partner or former partner. Nearly 2 million people – the majority of them women – live with domestic abuse every day. Young people have their childhoods destroyed by scenes of appalling domestic abuse no child should ever have to witness. The government’s new domestic abuse bill will lead the way in bringing about the change we need. I am launching a consultation on our proposals, and we want to hear from experts, charities, frontline professionals and as many people affected by abuse, from as many walks of life, as possible. Many suffering abuse still don’t talk about what is happening to them. Not all abusive behaviour is physical. Controlling, manipulative and verbally abusive behaviour ruins lives and means thousands end up isolated, living in fear. So for the first time, the bill will provide a statutory definition of domestic abuse that includes economic abuse, alongside other non-physical abuse. We will recognise the lasting impact domestic abuse can have on families by allowing for tougher sentences in cases involving children, and will better protect victims with new domestic abuse protection orders, which allow police and courts to intervene earlier. We will also create a domestic abuse commissioner to act as a national champion for victims. These proposals build on the work I started in the Home Office. It is critical that people fleeing violent partners have a safe place to go. I am committed to delivering a sustainable funding model for refuges so that there is no postcode lottery. We have provided £20m for accommodation-based services such as refuges. The best available data shows bed spaces have increased by 10% since 2010. We must also act to ensure that victims are supported at the earliest possible opportunity, before abuse escalates and they are left with no option but to flee their own homes. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a warm and loving home. It is hard for those of us who have safe and happy lives to truly walk in the shoes of those who live with domestic abuse every single day. I want everyone to live free from that threat, and every child to grow up safe and protected, just as I did. I hope that our work will provide an important step change in bringing that about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/07/betsy-devos-florida-shooting-students-marjory-stoneman-douglas-school","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T01:02:31Z","webTitle":"Florida lawmakers pass bill allowing armed teachers in classrooms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/betsy-devos-florida-shooting-students-marjory-stoneman-douglas-school","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/betsy-devos-florida-shooting-students-marjory-stoneman-douglas-school","fields":{"headline":"Florida lawmakers pass bill allowing armed teachers in classrooms","bodyText":"Florida’s lawmakers narrowly passed a controversial gun bill late on Wednesday that would allow armed teachers in the state’s classrooms, three weeks to the day after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school massacre in which 17 people were killed. The new legislation, which must now be approved by the Florida governor, Rick Scott, also raises the age at which weapons can be purchased to 21 and provides extra money for school security and mental health support. The package was backed by families of the Parkland victims, but strongly opposed by many Democrats, who failed to block its passage in a 67-50 vote. It is unclear if Scott, who has also spoken out against putting guns in classrooms, will veto the bill. “I’m going to take the time to read the bill,” Scott told reporters. “I have been clear. I don’t believe we should be arming teachers.” Earlier on Wednesday, students at Stoneman Douglas clashed with Betsy DeVos after the US education secretary toured the school. According to at least two teenagers who were present when DeVos arrived, no students were allowed to ask her questions. One claimed DeVos refused to meet or even speak with them. “You came to our school just for the publicity and avoided our questions for the 90 minutes you were actually here,” Aly Sheehy, a 12th-grade student and survivor of the shooting, said in a tweet. “How about you actually do your job?” Another student, Carly Novell, the editor of the school’s newspaper, Eagle Eye, said she was allowed to photograph DeVos but not accompany her on the campus tour. “I thought she would at least give us her ‘thoughts and prayers’, but she refused to even meet/speak with students,” Novell said in a tweet. “I don’t understand the point of her being here.” DeVos’s visit to the Parkland school was closed to the press, and came on the first full day of lessons for students since the 14 February massacre that claimed the lives of three teachers and 14 of their classmates. The final vote in Florida’s house of representatives late on Wednesday followed hours of intense debate, and marks the first time in 22 years that the state legislature has approved any kind of gun control measure. The measure would outlaw the sale of so-called bump stocks, which give semi-automatic weapons firepower similar to automatics and will allow certain school personnel, including librarians, administrators and other support staff, to be armed, following Donald Trump’s repeated calls for some teachers to carry guns. However, a ban on assault weapons such as the AR-15 used by the Parkland shooter, one of the main demands of the #neveragain movement set up by Stoneman Douglas students in the aftermath of the massacre, was missing from the proposed legislation. A final vote in Florida’s house of representatives was expected later on Wednesday. DeVos spoke briefly with reporters after what she said was “a very sobering and very inspiring visit” and contradicted the students’ account of the meeting. “There were a number of student newspaper reporters who walked around with me and they are obviously very interested in seeing what adults are going to do about this whole situation,” she said. “I give a lot of credit to the students here who have found their voices and encouraged them to continue to speak out about finding these solutions and having adults pay attention.” DeVos also addressed the controversial issue of allowing teachers to carry weapons. As a concession by state lawmakers to Scott’s stance, the legislation does not put guns in the hands of teachers whose sole responsibilities lie in the classroom, but permits those who have additional or separate non-teaching roles to carry a concealed weapon. It also leaves the final decision of allowing armed staff up to the school board in each of Florida’s 67 counties. “To say ‘arming teachers’ is an oversimplification and a mischaracterisation, really,” DeVos said. “The concept is for those schools and those communities that opt to do this, as they have in Texas, as they have in Polk county and other places around the country, to have people who are expert in being able to defend and having lots and lots of training in order to do so. “That’s a model that can be adopted and should be an option, but certainly not one that needs to be required and mandated.” DeVos was referring to a “sentinel” programme set up in Florida’s Polk county by Sheriff Grady Judd, in which volunteers in private educational establishments can carry weapons after extensive training. The families of the Parkland victims wrote a joint letter to Florida’s lawmakers on Tuesday urging them to pass the $400m legislation. “You must act to prevent mass murder from ever occurring again at any school,” they wrote in a letter signed by at least one relative from all 17 families. “This issue cannot wait. The moment to pass this bill is now. We must be the last families to suffer the loss of a loved one due to a mass shooting at a school.” Prosecutors announced on Wednesday that Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old former Stoneman Douglas student, had been indicted on 34 charges related to the shooting, 17 each of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder. Cruz, who is being held in solitary confinement in the Broward county jail, had already been charged with murder but the formal grand jury indictments allow state attorneys to progress the case against him and potentially seek the death penalty. Cruz’s public defender has said Cruz will plead guilty and avoid a trial if prosecutors take the death penalty off the table, an offer to which they have yet to respond.

But the government will come under intense pressure to hit back diplomatically if Russian involvement in the apparent poisoning of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, is proven. Rudd, who had earlier on Wednesday chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee, thanked the emergency services involved and said: “As the police have said this is an ongoing investigation and, along with the other services, they must be given the space they need to continue establishing the full facts.” Downing Street has adopted a guarded approach as fresh details about the incident have emerged, wary of prejudging the case. But MPs said the use of a nerve agent made state involvement look increasingly plausible. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the cross-party foreign affairs committee, said: “Murdering someone on the streets of the UK is bad enough but using a nerve agent puts at risk everyone nearby or who goes to help. The courageous police officer who responded is now in hospital. “Nerve agents are so toxic, it is hard to see this as anything other than a state actor. If it is shown that the Russian government is behind this we must respond.” Last November, Theresa May issued a warning to Russia over its cyber-activities, accusing it of interfering in elections in the west. “I have a very simple message for Russia. We know what you are doing. And you will not succeed,” she said. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, recently highlighted the possibility that Russia could attack the UK’s energy infrastructure, potentially causing “thousands and thousands and thousands” of deaths. But it is unclear how Britain will respond if the police investigation of the Skripal case points to Russian involvement. Pressed on the issue on Tuesday, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, pointed to a potential boycott of the forthcoming football World Cup in Russia, though officials subsequently insisted he meant the attendance of dignitaries, not the England team. Johnson also pointed to similarities with the poisoning of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. The prime minister’s spokesman said for now, the apparent attack on the Skripals remained a matter for the police. “At the moment the focus is very much on finding out the facts on the ground in Salisbury, and that’s where efforts are focused,” he said. Asked about whether investigations would reopen into earlier deaths of Russian nationals in the UK reported to be suspicious, the spokesman said the Labour MP Yvette Cooper had written to Rudd about this issue and that the home secretary would respond. But any new inquiries would be a matter for police, he added: “Politicians don’t direct police investigations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/07/california-governor-jerry-brown-jeff-sessions-immigration-lawsuit","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T18:29:30Z","webTitle":"California governor denounces Jeff Sessions over immigration lawsuit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/california-governor-jerry-brown-jeff-sessions-immigration-lawsuit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/california-governor-jerry-brown-jeff-sessions-immigration-lawsuit","fields":{"headline":"California governor denounces Jeff Sessions over immigration lawsuit","bodyText":"California’s governor, Jerry Brown, denounced Jeff Sessions on Wednesday after the US attorney general spoke in the state about a lawsuit over policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Brown told reporters shortly after Sessions’s speech to law enforcement officials on Wednesday that it was unprecedented for the attorney general to “act more like Fox News than a law enforcement officer”. The Democrat accused Sessions of lying and of trying to appease Donald Trump. He said Sessions’s actions were about dividing America. Earlier, Sessions, escalating the Trump administration’s rhetoric against the most populous US state, accused California of obstructing federal immigration enforcement efforts and vowed to stop the state’s defiance. Sessions made the remarks to a law enforcement group a day after Trump’s justice department sued Democratic-governed California over so-called sanctuary policies that try to protect illegal immigrants from deportation. “California is using every power it has – and some it doesn’t – to frustrate federal law enforcement. So you can be sure I’m going to use every power I have to stop them,” Sessions, the top US law enforcement officer, said in prepared remarks. “In recent years, California has enacted a number of laws designed to intentionally obstruct the work of our sworn immigration enforcement officers – to intentionally use every power it has to undermine duly established immigration law in America,” Sessions added. Sessions said US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carry out federal law and that “California cannot forbid them or obstruct them in doing their jobs.” The lawsuit, filed late on Tuesday in federal court in Sacramento, takes aim at three state laws passed last year that the justice department contends violate the US constitution and the supremacy of federal law over state law. Trump has made fighting illegal immigration and cracking down on illegal immigrants already in the United States a signature issue, first as a candidate and now as president. “Immigration law is the province of the federal government,” Sessions said. “I understand that we have a wide variety of political opinions out there on immigration, but the law is in the books and its purpose is clear,” Sessions added. “There is no nullification. There is no secession. Federal law is the supreme law of the land.” Sessions, who was speaking at a California Peace Officers Association conference in Sacramento, has made combating illegal immigration one of his top priorities since taking over the justice department in February 2017. A key part of that effort involves a crackdown on primarily Democratic-governed cities and states that Sessions calls “sanctuaries” that protect illegal immigrants from deportation. Governor Brown in October signed into law a bill that prevents police from inquiring about immigration status and curtails law enforcement cooperation with immigration officers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/17/my-life-on-a-plate-greg-rutherford-olympic-long-jumper","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T18:00:40Z","webTitle":"Greg Rutherford: ‘I was the one stealing from the milk-float after an all-nighter'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/17/my-life-on-a-plate-greg-rutherford-olympic-long-jumper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/17/my-life-on-a-plate-greg-rutherford-olympic-long-jumper","fields":{"headline":"Greg Rutherford: ‘I was the one stealing from the milk-float after an all-nighter'","bodyText":"As an athlete, you’re judged. If you’re in a competition and buying cake, the general public will comment. The irony is never wasted on me. If I go to a pizza restaurant I can almost guarantee that someone will come up and say, “you shouldn’t be eating that!” – even though they are. I laugh it off. I was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness and remember being told: “The world as we understand it will end. Armageddon will come.” I was tempted to reply: “Let’s hope it’s sooner rather than later, then we won’t have to go to school any more and eat the dinners.” The only religious food taboo I had, apart from no Christmas dinner, was black pudding – because of the blood. We were working class and food was very important in our house – chicken casserole, especially – because my dad, a self-employed builder, got up at 6am and came home at 8pm famished. My brother and I had competitions about how quickly we could eat. I have a very sensitive stomach. As a kid, I suffered from irritable bowel syndrome and was never in good shape. I would always see other athletes and say, “I look nothing like them. I have a very undefined tummy.” For a while, I became quite conscious of that. My coach Glen called me “fit-fat”, in the nicest possible way, when he came on board as a nutritionist in 1999. My other-half, Susie, has IBS too, and has a sister with Crohn’s disease – hopefully, our children won’t inherit either. I cook a really good leg of lamb but the first time Susie ate at my house I nipped out of the room and she scraped her dinner into her handbag. I thought she’d eaten it, until my dog Dexter went mad for her handbag. I drank alcohol at a young age, partly as a rebellion against my religious background. Also, I had friends who drank and stayed out. I was the one stealing milk from the milk float in the morning after an all-nighter. I could run fastest. But I hated the taste of milk. I take John West tuna steaks with me to competitions. I have a couple of cans with my eggs and salad for late lunch when I don’t like the meat where I am. Andrew Steele (the 400m runner) and I became obsessed with combining breakfast cereals when competing in America. I had Lucky Charms, Reese’s Pieces and other mega-sugary cereals mixed up. A “breakfast quartet” is just four. We got up to seven per bowl at one point. It is the best sugar hit you could dream of. I trained as a barista in 2012, because my dream is to run a coffee shop. I learnt about various notes within different beans and coffees, a bit like learning about wine. Nowadays, I travel with an AeroPress – there’s never a scenario where I wouldn’t have coffee. I’m keen on my children eating normally. Some athletes have children who eat the same as them, as they don’t want any other food in the house. I’m all for kids having chocolate and chips, but also avocado, eggs, nuts and fruit. My favourite things Food Because I’ve generally stayed away from it as I can react badly to gluten, I’d say dough actually remains my favourite food. I really enjoy a good pizza. Drink I enjoy a red wine, especially with my friend Rob [TV’s Judge Rinder]. There’s a shop in Islington where we have a card for free wine-tastings. Favourite place to eat Taka Sushi in the Gaslamp district of San Diego. Small inside and fantastic. Or Nick’s in Laguna Beach, California. It does incredible mac and cheese.

The chancellor is set for a dual economic boost from the improving productivity of British workers and a leap in tax returns according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, which looked at data from the Office for National Statistics to produce its own estimates ahead of the spring statement on Tuesday. The prospect of a rosier snapshot for the economy comes after a painful downgrade for Hammond from the government’s own economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, at the November budget. The latest readings on the economy show the country has beaten some of the OBR’s gloomier forecasts to give the chancellor a spring fillip. The Resolution Foundation said a jump in self-assessed tax receipts received by the Treasury had put Britain on course to undershoot the OBR’s forecast for the deficit – the difference between government spending and the income from taxes – to reach £49.9bn this financial year, up from £45.7bn in the previous 12 months. The latest figures from the ONS show that borrowing for the year to date is at its lowest levels since the financial crisis. The outcome for the financial year as a whole could be between £7bn and £11bn lower than first thought, the thinktank said. Hammond is also likely to have benefited from two of the strongest quarters for productivity growth in six years, amid signs that the measure of economic output per hour of work is finally beginning to improve after a decade of sluggish growth. While the growth in efficiency rates still remains below the pre-financial crisis trend of about 2% per year, productivity growth in 2017 came in at 0.6%, against an expectation for zero improvement from the OBR. An upswing in the global economy has also boosted economic growth in Britain, amid rising demand for goods and services around the world, helping to offset a slowdown at home sparked by rising inflation after the pound’s weakness since the Brexit vote. As a result, GDP growth in 2017 came in at 1.7%, rather than the 1.5% projected by the OBR. Hammond is attempting to make the spring statement a low-key event to prioritise the importance of the autumn budget as the year’s major tax and spending showpiece. “There will be no red box, no official document, no spending increases, no tax changes,” a spokesman for the Treasury told the Financial Times last month. “The chancellor will publish updated economic forecasts; we expect the speech to last between 15-20 minutes.” Some changes are still pencilled in to take effect over the coming weeks following the spring statement. About 11 million families will experience the impact of a freeze on benefits from 9 April, although some 1.5 million workers will also see a 4.4% pay rise when the national living wage increases to £7.83 on 1 April. The Resolution Foundation estimates a couple with two children are set to lose £315 on average, while overall benefit changes coming into effect are set to result in an average £135 income loss for the poorest third of households. The richest third of households are largely unaffected by the changes. There are still storm clouds on the horizon from Brexit, and long-term challenges for improving workers’ pay and household living standards, despite the short-term picture of improvement. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While the chancellor is firmly committed to a short spring statement, the challenges Britain faces, from weak growth to tight family finances, are likely to remain long lasting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/08/iceland-global-womens-strike-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"Decades after Iceland’s ‘day off’, our women’s strike is stronger than ever | Selma James","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/iceland-global-womens-strike-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/iceland-global-womens-strike-protest","fields":{"headline":"Decades after Iceland’s ‘day off’, our women’s strike is stronger than ever","bodyText":"On the first day of the UN Decade for Women in 1975, the women of Iceland took the day off to demonstrate the importance of all their work, waged and unwaged, in the countryside and the city.

What moved them to strike had to be moving in the souls of women everywhere: the question was: when would it manifest itself? In 1985, at the final conference of the UN decade in Nairobi, we had won the UN decision that unremunerated work at home, on the land and in the community should be measured and valued. We called Time Off for Women for 24 October and a number of countries joined us. But we could not sustain international action. It was not until 1999 that Margaretta D’Arcy, a writer, anti-war and Irish Republican activist, called for a national strike of women in Ireland to mark the new millennium on 8 March 2000 and asked the Wages for Housework Campaign to support her call. I wrote to the National Women’s Council of Ireland, telling them that if they called the Irish women out on strike, we would make it global. They didn’t, but we did. We launched the Global Women’s Strike with Margaretta and women from a number of other countries at the UN in New York in 1999. In most of the 60 countries where women went on strike it was a celebration, not a mobilisation. But we were making a variety of demands. The first was: “Payment for all caring work – in wages, pensions, land and other resources.” What was more valuable than raising children and caring for others, we asked. “Invest in life and welfare, not military budgets and prisons.” The more women went out to work, the harder it was to also be a carer, and what was most galling was the lower pay for doing a double day. Caring and pay equity have risen on the political agenda, as well as other injustices that women face, beginning with rape and domestic violence often going unpunished. Two years ago, two important movements manifested themselves. In Poland women went on strike to stop anti-abortion legislation. They succeeded in getting the government to back down. In Argentina, following police inaction after the rape and murder of a number of women, hundreds of thousands took to the streets with the slogan Ni una menos (not one less). Their call for an end to femicide swept across Latin America and beyond. This spoke to a pervasive injustice – in the UK, for example, two women a week are killed by partners or ex-partners. As a result of Poland and Argentina coming together, the International Women’s Strike was formed last year and co-ordinated by Polish women. It was agreed that each group would determine their own demands. There were regular four-hour Skype calls (with English and Spanish translation) with women from more than 30 countries exchanging information about what they would be doing. In some countries, hundreds of thousands downed tools for some part of the day, had rallies and banged pots; in others, the events were smaller. Today, the idea of women massively withdrawing labour, waged and unwaged, is not a reality yet. The actions now are often overtly anti-racist and anti-every discrimination, anti-poverty, anti-war, anti-deportation and anti-imperialist, including in Trump’s US. They are always anti-violence. In Peru, the strike slogan is: “If our lives have no value, produce and reproduce without us!” Every sector brings its own concerns. Peruvian domestic workers are launching their petition: “A living wage for caring work – in your own home and other people’s.” But how can you strike if you can’t risk being sacked or endangering those you care for? This has always been the dilemma, especially of the carer on whom vulnerable people depend. In countries such as Spain, where there is general recognition of the strike validity and even union backing, it’s easier for women to walk out for at least part of the day – hundreds of thousands are expected to do just that. In the UK, where such support is not yet forthcoming, women can still publicise our situation and what we want changed in call-ins and letters to the press, returning from lunch even 10 minutes late, banging pots in the streets or at the window, as women in Spain did against the 2003 Iraq war. The Global Women’s Strike is putting the family courts on trial for unjustly taking children from their mothers in a speak-out in the shadow of parliament; cleaners are demonstrating for a living wage; there is a sex work strike for decriminalisation in Soho; and a picket of Unilever in support of the Sisters of Rohingya’s call for disinvestment from Myanmar to end the rape and genocide there. In Germany, another possibility to improve women’s lives has opened up, which we are bringing to the strike. Some 3.4 million members of the IGMetall union are winning the right to a 28- (instead of 35-) hour week for at least two years in order to care for children and elderly parents. This is what we can win when striking and care come together. • Selma James is founder of the International Wages for Housework Campaign"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/09/tracks-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T11:00:36Z","webTitle":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Shame, Diplo, Sigrid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/09/tracks-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/09/tracks-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Shame, Diplo, Sigrid","bodyText":"Shame Lampoon Whether you’re partial to Shame’s Fat Whites-meets-Fall shtick is up to you.

The sniping whingebaggery of the press could be like that impossible Water Temple with those stupid iron boots.

The plot takes us deep into the damaged psyche of a freelance lone wolf (Joaquin Phoenix, at his best) who locates missing children. Something like Taxi Driver without the talking. A Fantastic Woman (15) (Sebastián Lelio, 2017, Chi/Ger/Spa/UK) 104 mins Deserved winner of the best foreign film Oscar last week, Lelio’s modern melodrama highlights a trans woman’s dignity in the face of considerable adversity: firstly, the death of her partner, and then the reaction from his family and the authorities. Daniela Vega is tremendous in the role. She will survive. Mom and Dad (15) (Brian Taylor, 2017, US) 86 mins From the man who brought us Crank, a grindhouse Home Alone. For mysterious reasons, millennial kids find themselves under attack from their parents. That’s especially bad news if your folks are Selma Blair and Nicolas Cage. Nasty, trashy and unpredictable (apart from Cage’s reliably unhinged performance), it fully commits to its premise of all-out generational warfare. I, Tonya (15) (Craig Gillespie, 2017, US) 119 mins What really went down with ice-skater Tonya Harding and the plot to sabotage her arch rival? This lively comedy-drama admits it doesn’t know, but spins a good yarn anyway: a tale of trailer-park aspiration that’s both sympathetic and satirical, and often laugh-out-loud funny. Margot Robbie excels as the poor but talented Harding, Allison Janney even more so as her hideously sour mother. Sweet Country (15) (Warwick Thornton, 2017, Aus) 113 mins This powerful, panoramic outback western revisits historic race issues in a way few American ones ever have. It’s an almost biblical tale: an Indigenous Australian farmhand and his wife take flight after he shoots dead a bigoted white rancher in a surreal landscape where the relationship between indigenous people and “settlers” is anything but settled.

National Gallery &amp; National Portrait Gallery, WC2 15 March to 28 May Joan Jonas This revolutionary New York artist has been questioning gender and identity since the 1960s. She was one of the first artists ever to use a video camera to record her explosive performances. In installations such as The Juniper Tree (1976), featuring a Japanese kimono, silk paintings, mirrors and video, Jonas broke all the boundaries. Tate Modern, SE1, 14 March to 5 August POP! Art in a Changing Britain As early as the 1940s, Eduardo Paolozzi collaged pages from US magazines he acquired from GIs to create the first pop art (a technique also used by his contemporary, Nigel Henderson). British pop was driven by the gap between austere postwar reality and images of US consumerism. From Richard Hamilton’s fast cars to David Hockney dreaming by his LA pool, they pictured a modern utopia. Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, to 7 April Eric Fischl How good a painter is Fischl, who became famous in 1980s New York for bringing figurative art back into fashion? He was scorned by the critic Robert Hughes, but who wasn’t? Fischl’s seriousness seems proven by the fact that he is still at it: painting eerie, unresolved scenes from American life that keep you guessing at their hidden narratives. Donald Trump appears here as a nightmare clown. He makes Pennywise look cute. Skarstedt Gallery, SW1, to 26 May Ten Days Six Nights This year’s BMW Tate Live festival celebrates the influence of Joan Jonas on performance art, video and installation.

The Duke of York’s, WC2 to 31 March; touring to 28 April Matilda Dennis Kelly and Tim Minchin capture all the gleeful nastiness of Roald Dahl’s original – then add some more. It is not just the wit of Minchin’s songs and the cleverness of Kelly’s book (often the element that lets a musical down), but how they make it look so effortless. Like their lovable heroine, this is a highly intelligent production that wears its learning lightly. Cambridge Theatre, WC2, to 10 February The York Realist The ambiguities in Peter Gill’s 2001 play, set in York in the early 1960s, are finely excavated in Robert Hastie’s delicate revival, which boasts two fine performances from Ben Batt and Jonathan Bailey as the agricultural labourer and London theatre director who fall in love during a staging of the York Mystery Plays. There are gulfs between country and town, and the middle and working classes, in a play that is full of emotional evasions and things left unsaid. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 24 March; touring to 7 April Long Day’s Journey Into Night It is a big play and it’s got the big acting to match in Richard Eyre’s revival, which stars Lesley Manville and Jeremy Irons as a couple who have spawned a deeply unhappy family. Eugene O’Neill described his 1941 play of terrible addictions as one written “in tears and blood” and it was so grounded in autobiography that he forbade it to be published until 25 years after his death. That wish was ignored, and Eyre’s production reveals it as a play of despair and rage, but also one of love. Wyndham’s Theatre, WC2, to 8 April Education, Education, Education The Wardrobe Ensemble takes you back to school and back in time to 1997 and the election of Tony Blair as PM in this sharply comic show about how governments fail schools and schools fail their pupils.

This series seeks to redress that by taking a selection of studies and making sense of the important information for teachers, as we all seek to answer the question: how can we help our students do better at school? This time, we consider growth mindset. Many students do their homework and revision while listening to music. Many of them will swear that listening to their favourite songs makes them study better. But does music help or hinder learning? And does it matter what type of music you listen to while revising? Researchers from the applied psychology department of Cardiff Metropolitan University led a study to answer this question. The authors, Nick Perham and Harriet Currie, assigned students into one of four groups: the first revised in silence, the second revised while listening to music with lyrics they liked (which included songs from One Direction and Katy Perry), the third group revised to music with lyrics they did not like (which comprised of very heavy metal bands), and the fourth group revised listening to music without lyrics. The participants then took a test on the passages they had been revising, rating how distracting their environment had been, as well as writing down their predictions for how well they thought they had done. What are the main findings? Students who revised in quiet environments performed more than 60% better in an exam than their peers who revised while listening to music that had lyrics. Students who revised while listening to music without lyrics did better than those who had revised to music with lyrics. It made no difference if students revised listening to songs they liked or disliked. Both led to a reduction in their test performance. Students who revised in silence rated their environment as less distracting and accurately predicted that this would lead to better performances in subsequent tests. Related research There are some benefits to listening to music while performing certain tasks. It can be quite motivating and it can improve mood (listening to your favourite song tends to make people smile, for example). But it does not help people learn new or complex material. The misconception that music does help us learn stems from a series of studies linked to the “Mozart effect”, which found that people performed better on a series of cognitive tasks after listening to 10 minutes of Mozart. Participants in these studies appeared to be getting smarter and performing better in tests. However, further research has since revealed this is not the case. While listening to music before a task can make someone feel better, listening to it while trying to learn something new tends not to help. This is because music – especially tunes with lyrics – can take up processing space. This conflicts with the material you are trying to learn, effectively creating a bottleneck in your memory, as there is less space to process what you are revising. What does this mean for the classroom? It is important that students are made aware of the pitfalls of listening to music when revising. Perham and Currie’s study found that students rated the quiet environment as less distracting and better for them, yet many students continue to listen to music during their homework. Why? Perhaps they’re doing so out of habit, or they confuse what improves their mood with what leads to good revision, or it alleviates boredom. Perhaps it’s simply because everyone else is doing it. Students need to know how to revise well. There may well be a time and place to listen to music during the course of their revision, but not when they are learning new and complex material. After all, silence is golden. • Bradley Busch is a registered psychologist, director at InnerDrive and author of Release Your Inner Drive.

The Vatican announced on Wednesday that Francis had approved a miracle attributed to Romero, meaning the former archbishop of San Salvador could be canonised early next year. The move follows longstanding efforts to block Romero’s canonisation from conservatives within the church who opposed his association with liberation theology. Francis began the process of declaring Romero a saint soon after becoming pope. About 250,000 people attended Romero’s beatification ceremony in San Salvador in May 2015. Romero was shot through the heart by a sniper while celebrating mass in a hospital chapel on 24 March 1980, a day after he called on the military to stop killing innocent civilians in El Salvador’s dirty war. Numerous death threats had been made against him. In his final sermon, he said: “In the name of God and this suffering population, whose cries reach to the heavens more tumultuous each day, I beg you, I beseech you, I order you, in the name of God, cease the repression.” In his diaries, he wrote: “Between the powerful and the wealthy, and the poor and vulnerable, who should a pastor side with? I have no doubts. A pastor should stay with his people.” His sermons, demanding social justice for poor people and excoriating politicians and military leaders, reached hundreds of thousands of people via radio broadcasts. Romero’s younger brother said: “To his last day, my brother believed in God and in God’s calling us to unite in love for the poor, the marginalised and the forgotten.” At his funeral, the army opened fire, killing dozens of mourners from a crowd of more than 100,000. His murder came at the start of a 12-year civil war, in which more than 75,000 people were killed and thousands disappeared. The Latin American liberation theology movement of the 1960s and 70s argued that it was not enough for the church to empathise with and care for the poor. Instead, its followers said, the church needed to push for political and structural changes to eradicate poverty, even – some believed – if this meant supporting armed struggle against oppressors. Francis, the first Latin American pope, was never a liberation theologian and criticised aspects of the movement when he was a priest in Argentina, according to papal biographers. But since becoming pontiff in 2013, he has argued the church must champion the poor and marginalised, and has repeatedly criticised capitalism and consumerism. On Wednesday, Francis also gave the go-ahead for Pope Paul VI, who oversaw the sweeping Vatican II reforms of the Catholic church in the 1960s, to be made a saint."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/16/former-judge-to-investigate-sacking-of-trinity-grammar-teacher-who-cut-students-hair","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T04:18:21Z","webTitle":"Former judge to investigate sacking of Trinity Grammar teacher who cut student’s hair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/16/former-judge-to-investigate-sacking-of-trinity-grammar-teacher-who-cut-students-hair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/16/former-judge-to-investigate-sacking-of-trinity-grammar-teacher-who-cut-students-hair","fields":{"headline":"Former judge to investigate sacking of Trinity Grammar teacher who cut student’s hair","bodyText":"A former federal court judge and Queen’s counsel will investigate the sacking of a deputy headmaster who gave a student a haircut. Raymond Finkelstein has been appointed by the elite Trinity Grammar school to conduct an independent inquiry into the firing of former deputy headmaster Rohan Brown, who lost his job after cutting a student’s hair before a school photo. The sacking sparked an administrative crisis at the prestigious Melbourne school. Students have held protests, and three members of the school’s governing council have resigned under pressure from parents and former students angered by the decision. The Old Trinity Grammarian’s Association – a group of former students – has threatened to sue the school if Brown is not reinstated. On Friday the school announced Finkelstein and barrister Renee Enbom – who represented actor Rebel Wilson in her defamation suit against Bauer Media – would lead an “independent review” of the sacking. Finkelstein and Enbom agreed to conduct the review on the understanding they would have “the full cooperation of school staff and the school council”. “The school has requested the review to be completed as soon as possible,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. “Terms of reference for the review will be made available to the school community in the coming days, as will the findings and recommendations.” The school also said it would “not adopt” resolutions made by the Old Grammarian’s association, potentially paving the way for the haircut dispute to find its way to the courts. The association has threatened legal action against Trinity if the entire council does not resign by Friday afternoon, reinstate Brown and demote the principal to interim headmaster with restricted powers. Besides his work as a federal court judge, Finkelstein was the author of an independent inquiry into media regulation in Australia in 2012. He is also a former president of the Australian Competition Tribunal and in 2011 was appointed an adjunct professor in the law faculty at Monash University. Last year Labor sought his legal advice over the citizenship cases of MP David Feeney and senator Katy Gallagher."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/24/tim-winton-geoffrey-robertson-and-cynthia-banham-on-what-theyre-reading-in-march","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T04:09:48Z","webTitle":"Tim Winton, Geoffrey Robertson and Cynthia Banham on what they're reading in March","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/24/tim-winton-geoffrey-robertson-and-cynthia-banham-on-what-theyre-reading-in-march","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/24/tim-winton-geoffrey-robertson-and-cynthia-banham-on-what-theyre-reading-in-march","fields":{"headline":"Tim Winton, Geoffrey Robertson and Cynthia Banham on what they're reading in March","bodyText":"Robert Manne On Borrowed Time Black Inc Your book in your own words: Following a diagnosis of throat cancer in spring 2016, my life was changed forever. My response provides the subject of the first piece in On Borrowed Time, a collection of recent essays. Academics who accept the title of “public intellectual”, as I now reluctantly do, must range more broadly than their university colleagues but without sacrificing depth. Through their chief weapon – the written word – they try to understand and influence even a little the trajectory of their own society and world. Because of the corrupting influence of the Murdoch media, one essay dissects our most influential conservative columnist, Andrew Bolt, and another our most influential conservative newspaper, The Australian. Yet another traces the evolution of the terrifying ideology of the post-al Qaeda group, the Islamic State. Several grapple from different angles with our era’s overwhelmingly most consequential and puzzling issue – humankind’s failure to rise to the challenge of climate change. Through this failure, are we not all living at the expense of future generations, on borrowed time? What you were reading when you wrote it: While writing, a 50-year-old four-volume collection of George Orwell’s essays sat by my desk. Orwell’s combination of lucidity, fearlessness, independence, self-deprecating humour and ability to face “unpleasant truths” provided a daunting reminder of what a political essay can be. The next Australian book you’ll read: I’m about to read Dunera Lives: A Visual History by Ken Inglis, Seumas Spark and Jay Winter and am fascinated to see whether these distinguished historians can find the language to convey a sad and curious rather than tragic second world war detention story, involving the transportation to country Australia of mainly Jewish “enemy aliens” arrested in Churchill’s Britain at the time of the Dunkirk panic, where the captors were soon apologetic and the captured, in general, unembittered. Tracy Sorensen The Lucky Galah Pan Macmillan Australia Your book in your own words: The Lucky Galah is a story about the 1969 moon landing from the point of view of a pink and grey galah. Stolen from her tree before she has even fledged, Lucky is stuck in a cage with a clipped wing, tantalised by a mammalian story of super-flight, flight beyond the stratosphere. With the help of data emitted by a decommissioned NASA-era satellite dish, she tells the story of Evan Johnson, radar technician, who has come to a remote north-west Australian town to work at the NASA tracking station. It’s about the fall of (a) man and the rise of a bird: as Evan’s fortunes fall, the galah’s fortunes rise. It’s about a woman, Evan’s wife Linda, who tries to impress with cleverly carved carrots and falls for a visiting entomologist. It’s about finally tuning in to voices that were there all along. What you were reading when you wrote it: I was reading and rereading Donald Horne’s The Lucky Country. I was taking note of elements such as the wooden salad bowl, the bead curtain and the pink roll of toilet paper, and thinking about the laconic pest inspector that appears on page 218 of the 1964 Penguin paperback. The next Australian book you’ll read: Dyschronia by Jennifer Mills. It’s a story about waking up one morning and finding that the sea has gone. As a climate change activist myself, I’m drawn to stories that take imaginative leaps into the future while holding a sense of a more familiar present. Tim Winton The Shepherd’s Hut Hamish Hamilton Your book in your own words: It’s about a 15-year-old borderline sociopath called Jaxie Clackton. Jaxie’s been beaten and cowed all his life. His father’s a vicious drunk and his mum recently died of cancer. Jaxie seems doomed to replicate his father’s violent misogyny – he’s the school bully and the local wild boy. But when he comes home one night, concussed and nursing a swollen eye, he finds his father dead in grisly circumstances and he panics and bolts into the bush with only what he can carry to keep himself alive: a high-powered rifle, a backpack full of food, and five litres of water. On the face of it, this begins as a survival story, but it turns out to be a more of a sentimental education. Out in the barren saltlands, Jaxie stumbles upon an isolated camp and his story takes another sudden turn. He encounters a ruined priest who presents an entirely different way of being a man. What you were reading when you wrote it: It’s a couple of years since I was working on the book but I remember being really impressed by Charlotte Wood’s The Natural Way of Things which was provocative and timely. I also really admired Howard Cunnell’s Fathers and Sons about a man who grew up without a father and has to learn how to father a girl he adores. His journey is complicated as his daughter transitions to being a boy. The next Australian book you’ll read: I’ve just finished a really lovely book by Jessie Cole called Staying (to be published by Text). It’s a book about the lasting effects of trauma and how it radiates through families. It’s beautifully written and I’m full of admiration for the heart and the craft in this memoir. Cynthia Banham A Certain Light Allen &amp; Unwin Your book in your own words: A Certain Light tells the story of the interrupted lives among three generations of my family. There’s my Italian grandfather, a forced labourer in Germany in the second world war. There’s my mother, who migrated to Australia when she was nine. And there is me. I was a journalist for the Sydney Morning Herald in 2007 when, on assignment in Indonesia, I was in a plane crash. I suffered horrific injuries and for years couldn’t write about what happened. It took seven years before I found a way to do it. I would back into my story, writing first about some of the traumatic experiences of family members before mine. In writing about them I found a certain solace; my sense of isolation about my own trauma lessened slightly. I wrote the book because writing is what I do. I wrote it for my son, so he would know what happened to his mother. What you were reading when you wrote it: The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million, by Daniel Mendelsohn. I read this book on the plane on the way to Europe in 2015 where I was doing research into my grandfather’s second world war experiences. Reading Mendelsohn’s incredible story of his search for the truth about his family, lost during the Holocaust, made me feel inspired but daunted as I went about my own quest. The next Australian book you’ll read: The Shepherd’s Hut, Tim Winton. I read my first Tim Winton novel for HSC English in 1989, An Open Swimmer, and love the rawness of his writing and the way he brings the landscapes and characters of Western Australia alive. I’m looking forward to seeing how he does this in his latest book. Ceridwen Dovey In the Garden of the Fugitives Penguin Your book in your own words: In the Garden of the Fugitives is my attempt to grapple with how we remember – or misremember – our own pasts, and how we invent rather than recall history as a whole. One strand of the novel dramatises the struggles of a young woman artist, Vita, to build a new identity from the rubble of the past, a confessional performance of white guilt which she tries to find a language for through psychotherapy. The other narrative strand is inspired by Sigmund Freud’s observation that “there is no better analogy for repression than the burial which was the fate of Pompeii, and from which the city was able to rise again.” Freud believed that the human psyche could be excavated like an archaeological site, made to throw up fragments. Much of my novel is set in Pompeii in the 1970s, where Royce – an Ivy League graduate, one of the silver spoon set – has followed his love interest, Kitty, an archaeologist, over to the ancient city where they spend two summers working in the ruins before something goes horribly wrong. What you were reading when you wrote it: Resurrecting Pompeii by Australian archaeologist Estelle Lazer – a fascinating account of her pioneering work on the human remains within Pompeii. Also From Pompeii: The Afterlife of a Roman Town by Ingrid D Rowland, which is a wonderful survey of the various ways the excavations at Pompeii have been interpreted by visitors over time. The next Australian book you’ll read: Kate Rossmanith’s forthcoming Small Wrongs: How We Really Say Sorry in Love, Life and Law. I’m really interested in hybrid/blended books at the moment, and this one is a close study of remorse in the criminal justice system but is also a memoir about remorse/regret within family life. Michael Mohammed Ahmad The Lebs Hachette Your book in your own words: Following the notorious Skaf gang rapes in 2000 and the 9/11 attacks on New York in 2001, an explosion of public debate concerning the lives and activities of young men from Arabic-speaking backgrounds in western Sydney spread throughout Australia. The media and politicians gave these young men many names, including Arabs, Muslims, Middle Easterners and Lebanese. But behind the barbed wire, cameras and red-brick walls of Punchbowl Boys high school, the boys went by a different name: Lebs. The Lebs is the story of Bani Adam, a second-generation Lebanese-Australian Muslim studying at Punchbowl Boys high school during a turbulent period in which the school had become a war zone of violent, racist, sexist and homophobic tensions. Bani Adam attempts to distance himself from the other Lebs within his school by reading the great works of Shakespeare, Vladimir Nabokov, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Kahlil Gibran and Ernest Hemingway. But when he is finally presented with an opportunity to join a community of white left-wing artists from Sydney’s inner west, he discovers that escaping the stereotypes about his identity will be far more difficult than he first imagined. What you were reading when you wrote it: I was reading Michael Duffy’s Drive By: Inside a Western Suburbs Crime Family just as I had started writing The Lebs. And I was thinking, “If an ignorant white guy can write a book about dumbass Lebs from western Sydney, then surely an actual dumbass Leb like me can do it.” The next Australian book you’ll read: The next Australian book I’ll read is a poetry collection called The Hijab Files (Giramondo, 2018) by Maryam Azam. Maryam identifies as a Pakistani-Australian Muslim woman from Kellyville. Her ability to blend the experiences of everyday western Sydney with the spiritual and historical language of the Muslim tradition is radical, political, subversive and unique in the purest sense of the word “literature”. Kitty Flanagan Bridge Burning and Other Hobbies Allen &amp; Unwin Your book in your own words: Rather than an autobiography, my book is a collection of funny true stories. I’ve picked out some of my life’s highlights like the time I went to my school dance dressed like a 60-year-old dowager shopkeep, and the time my car was pelted with two dozen eggs by a (justifiably) angry mob. I’ve also dissected a few of my failed relationships for your reading pleasure because I think stories of failure are funnier than tales of triumph. Plus there are even some handy life hacks, like how not to die while hitch-hiking and how to do a DIY repair on your petrol tank. In some ways I’ve written the Where’s Wally of self-help books, in that this book contains some seriously brilliant advice, you just have to look really really hard to find it. What you were reading when you wrote it: Tina Fey’s Bossypants. That’s why I didn’t write an autobiography. I haven’t had such an insanely interesting, high-powered showbiz life. I tour regional Australia and mostly hang out with my sister or my pets. I read a lot of David Sedaris while I was writing to remind me that stories about ordinary people can be funny and interesting too. The next Australian book you’ll read: The Tattooist of Auschwitz. I have been fascinated by second world war stories since I was 10 and did a school project on Nazi Germany. I found it so terrifying that I drew a ridiculously incongruous border of teddy bears around the page to try to make it less frightening. Eileen Ormsby The Darkest Web Allen &amp; Unwin Your book in your own words: The Darkest Web takes a deep-dive into three different areas of the dark web, which is like a parallel internet that can only be accessed using special software. Part one, Dark, takes the reader into the darknet markets, where drugs, guns, stolen identities, credit cards and hacking tools are bought and sold. Part two, Darker, examines online hitmen, and follows one murder in particular, as well as my own relationship with the owner of the most profitable murder-for-hire website in history. The final part, Darkest, goes to a place some readers might not want to enter: the world of hurtcore, which is even worse than it sounds. The book doesn’t merely take place online. I travelled the world to meet many of the characters behind the sites, whether attending their trials, visiting them in jail or having a beer with them. What you were reading when you wrote it: Researching The Darkest Web took me to very bleak places and I turned to Liane Moriarty for escape. She is like thinking woman’s chicklit but much sharper and funnier than that term implies. I love her quirky structuring of story and incredibly rich and nuanced characters. The next Australian book you’ll read: It may not be the very next book I’ll read, but I’m really looking forward to journalist Ginger Gorman’s book on internet trolls. Besides my obvious interest in the subject matter, I admire her depth of research and way with words. Geoffrey Robertson Rather his Own Man Knopf Australia Your book in your own words: I have reached three score years and ten so I am in my anecdotage, which seemed a good time for an autobiography. It charts my progress from pimply state schoolboy to an Old Bailey barrister and then to acting for prisoners on death rows around the world and trying to bring tyrants to justice. It’s an opportunity to think back on some of the absurdities of growing up as one of “Ming’s kids” in the 50s – the repressive censorship, the white Australia policy, fighting for Indigenous rights and against conscription for the Vietnam War. The book moves on to the life of an expatriate but never an ex-patriot in Britain and some of the cause celebres I became involved with at the Old Bailey. It’s also been an opportunity to explain my beliefs about the importance of human rights and the need to find new ways of fighting for them in a world which is becoming more polarised and less cooperative. An autobiography is an egregious exercise but I have tried to make fun of myself as well as of my opponents. What you were reading when you wrote it: Whilst writing my memoirs I mainly read the memoirs of others. David Hare’s The Blue Touch Paper was a treat and Claire Tomalin’s memoir A Life of My Own inspired me to greater self-revelation. She’s such a good writer: where I talk about the workings of Providence, she speaks of “the randomness of things” which better describes the ebbs and flows of my own life. The next Australian book you’ll read: I think I will pass on Jacquie Lambie. On this trip I only have time to read on aeroplanes so for my next short flight I bought David Marr’s book, Factions (a great title – in the Labor party, factions speak louder than words) and for longer flights, the latest Richard Flanagan, First Person. Meg and Tom Keneally The Power Game (Book Three, The Monsarrat Series) Vintage Australia Your book in your own words – Meg Keneally: When a boatman on a lonely island off the coast of Van Diemen’s Land is murdered, the authorities believe they have the perfect suspect. In 1826, Maria Island – an island dangling off an island dangling off an island, and one of Britain’s most remote penal settlements – is home to very inconvenient political prisoner. Thomas Power is the son of a baronet, and a former member of the House of Commons. He’s also an Irish revolutionary who is too popular to hang. He has been tucked away in the hopes his followers will forget him, which they show no sign of doing. The government hopes pinning the boatman’s murder on Power will dent his reputation so he can be executed without causing a revolt. But the murder victim was hardly an innocent, having read all the letters he delivered to the island and using the knowledge in a wide-ranging blackmail scheme. And when former gentleman convict Hugh Monsarrat and his friend Mrs Mulrooney are sent to investigate, they find the evidence is leading them down paths the government doesn’t want them to follow. We were very interested in exploring the idea that one person’s free speech is another’s sedition, and the ownership of communication as a path to power. What you were reading when you wrote it: The Roving Party by Rohan Wilson, which is a confronting story about a band of trackers and their prey, the Aboriginal people of northern Tasmania. It was so affecting, as tales about the massacre of innocents are, that I occasionally needed a deep-breathing break. The arrogance of the colonists, the flexible morality of the bloody business they were engaged in, and the perspective of the hunted are themes that resonated strongly with me. The next Australian book you’ll read: Terra Nullius by Claire G Coleman. This is an alternative story of the colonisation of Australia. I like speculative fiction, and my favourite kind of story is one which jolts you out of your own perspective. I’m also a sucker for novelists who use landscape as a character, which I’ve been told Coleman does to great effect. The book has won numerous awards and been nominated for the 2018 Stella prize. I’m very much looking forward to it. Martin Flanagan A Wink from the Universe Viking Your book in your own words: Melbourne’s west has always been Melbourne’s “other”. Its river, the Maribyrnong, was used as an industrial drain. Its working class community bore the brunt of the depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s. Its football club survived, but only just – its single VFL/AFL premiership, in 1954, having become a dim memory. “No one expected us to win in 2016,” says club historian Darren “Ace” Arthur. “Not even us”. Enter coach Luke Beveridge and captain Bob Murphy, the Lennon and McCartney of the Bulldog revival. The team they conjure into being suffers crippling injuries and limps into the finals in 7th place. No one gives them a chance. They beat four more highly fancied teams, three of them on their home grounds, to win the premiership. As the campaign builds, the west, now with one million people of all races and religions, finds it has a cause in common. Bulldog family stories buried for generations come zooming to life. People start seeing the dead and pray to statues. What you were reading when you wrote it: The two books I kept close by were The Book of Fame by Lloyd Jones, a novel which succeeds in being evocative and lyrical while being utterly authentic in sporting terms, and Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood, which I love not just for its language but for the author’s shrewd appreciation of ordinary life. As happens in Under Milk Wood, I wanted to create a crowd effect. The next Australian book you’ll read: Losing Streak by historian James Boyce on the Tasmanian gambling industry – fearless, informed political journalism at its best, and a book that shaped a state election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/17/offsets-for-emissions-breaches-prove-australia-has-a-carbon-market-labor-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"Offsets for emissions breaches prove Australia has a carbon market, Labor says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/17/offsets-for-emissions-breaches-prove-australia-has-a-carbon-market-labor-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/17/offsets-for-emissions-breaches-prove-australia-has-a-carbon-market-labor-says","fields":{"headline":"Offsets for emissions breaches prove Australia has a carbon market, Labor says","bodyText":"Sixteen Australian industrial sites have breached government-imposed greenhouse gas emissions limits and had to buy millions of dollars in carbon credits. The breaches came despite big emitters being granted generous carbon limits, in many cases above their highest previous pollution levels. They were revealed in the first batch of emissions data released under the Coalition’s “safeguard mechanism”, part of the Direct Action climate policy introduced by carbon pricing opponent Tony Abbott. Labor and industry body the Carbon Market Institute both said the use of Australian carbon credit units – mostly created through land-use based greenhouse gas reduction projects – was evidence the country had a carbon market despite the government claiming otherwise. The opposition climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said businesses were now trading credits at prices the Coalition had claimed would wreck the economy under Labor. He said it showed the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of the government’s approach to climate change. “The Turnbull government should stop trying to mislead the Australian people and their own backbench,” he said. “[It should] admit that carbon pricing and trading is not only needed to take effective action on climate change, but their ineffective climate change policy also includes carbon trading.” The Labor-Greens carbon price for all big emitters was $24.15 a tonne when the scheme was repealed and replaced by Direct Action under then prime minister Abbott in 2014. The price had been expected to fall to less than $10 a tonne the following year when international carbon trading began. Comparatively few credits – about 448,000 – were bought last year under the safeguard mechanism, mostly for $14-$15 a tonne, suggesting a total cost to business of more than $6m. The majority of the 154 emitters covered by the safeguard mechanism emitted less than their limit, known as a baseline, allowed last financial year. The biggest purchases of credits were by miners Anglo Coal (133,104 tonnes worth at the Capcoal mine in Queensland), Glencore (81,851 tonnes at the Tahmoor coalmine in NSW) and Rio Tinto (68,305 at the Alcan Gove bauxite mine in Arnhem Land). The environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not directly address whether Australia had a carbon market. He said the safeguard mechanism was developed through consultation with a broad cross-section of industry, and provided flexible options for businesses to comply. He said Labor had introduced a carbon tax that hit households and businesses, and was now promising a deep cut in emissions by 2030 without backing it up with a plan or costings. “In contrast, the government’s approach is to address climate change with policies that ensure we have an affordable and reliable energy system and competitive industries,” Frydenberg said. Butler said the ALP supported the further development of carbon markets. The safeguard mechanism was promised to ensure cuts paid for using the main part of Direct Action – the $2.55bn emission reduction fund – were not undone by emissions increasing in other parts of the economy. Government agency the Clean Energy Regulator sets an emissions limit for each large industrial site based on its highest level of emissions over the previous five years. But companies can apply to have the limit recalculated. Consultants RepuTex last month found 57 industrial sites had been allowed increased baselines beyond previous emissions levels, prompting claims the safeguard mechanism was pointless. The new data shows eight of these operations breached their increased baseline. The government is now considering making the safeguard mechanism less tied to historic emissions. A climate policy review released in December suggested emission limits could be loosened so they “increase with production, supporting business growth”. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said most companies were compliant under the safeguard mechanism only because the system was broken – baselines were either too high to begin with or businesses had been granted higher baselines to avoid breaches. “When you’ve got a pollution reduction policy that doesn’t reduce pollution, it’s time to start over,” he said. Environment department data shows national emissions have risen each year since 2014. Under their current trajectory, the department projects emissions would be about 2% higher in 2030 than in 2005. The government’s target is a 26% to 28% cut over that time frame; Labor has proposed a 45% cut. The Carbon Market Institute chief executive, Peter Castellas, said the safeguard mechanism data showed Australia clearly had a functioning carbon market that had been able to meet the demand of businesses that required credits. It is understood most credits purchased were from surplus emissions cuts by companies that had won contracts under the emissions reduction. The carbon price spiked to as high as $18 a tonne – well beyond the average $11.90 under the emissions reduction fund – due to limited supply. Castellas said industry had not been expected to breach the safeguard mechanism. Its operation augured well for a time when the demand for carbon credits increased. “Safeguard mechanism baselines will inevitably have to decline if we are to meet below business as usual emissions required under Australia’s Paris agreement commitments,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/16/arsene-wenger-talk-danny-welbeck-forward-dived-milan","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T00:03:13Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger will talk to Danny Welbeck if forward dived against Milan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/16/arsene-wenger-talk-danny-welbeck-forward-dived-milan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/16/arsene-wenger-talk-danny-welbeck-forward-dived-milan","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger will talk to Danny Welbeck if forward dived against Milan","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger promised he would talk to Danny Welbeck if he felt the Arsenal striker was guilty of diving. The manager said he did not see the 38th-minute flashpoint that turned this Europa League tie against Milan decisively in his team’s favour when Welbeck went down inside the area under minimal contact from Ricardo Rodríguez. Welbeck scored the penalty to make it 1-1 on the night and 3-1 on aggregate. Granit Xhaka and Welbeck would add second-half goals for a 5-1 overall win, although it was a little less comfortable than the scoreline suggested. “I haven’t seen it again,” Wenger said. “Do you want to accuse the English players to be divers? Was it a penalty or not, I don’t know. The Italian players were not happy with it and I can understand that because I don’t really know what it was. After that, Danny took the penalty in a convincing way. I will watch it again and give you my honest feeling about it. I will give him my honest feeling as well, don’t worry.” The Milan manager, Rino Gattuso, refused to criticise the officials. He pointed to the error that his goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma, made on Xhaka’s goal as evidence that anybody could make them – including referees. “Welbeck is a striker, he has to do what he does,” Gattuso said. “We cannot use that as a reference for the whole of English football – there is a great deal of fair play here. Even when I was a player, I tried to take advantage of individual situations. I don’t want to talk about the referee. I don’t want any alibi.” For the perennially under-fire Wenger, this was a tonic. “Certainly for the climate around the team, it was a vital result,” Wenger said. “We have targets now to finish as close as possible to the top four and why not benefit from a miracle? But as well focus on the quarter-final. “We had a nightmare week when we lost twice to Manchester City and at Brighton. To recover from that you need to be solid and mentally strong and show a response together. That’s what we did. Many people didn’t expect us to respond like we have. It shows the team is healthy. “The team who is biggest favourite in the Europa League is Atlético Madrid but if we get them, we get them. We have some time now to recover and prepare for it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/16/sienna-miller-headline-act-women-new-york-metoo-summit-commission-on-the-status-of-women","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T19:41:43Z","webTitle":"'A wave of change': Sienna Miller hails #MeToo movement at New York summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/16/sienna-miller-headline-act-women-new-york-metoo-summit-commission-on-the-status-of-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/16/sienna-miller-headline-act-women-new-york-metoo-summit-commission-on-the-status-of-women","fields":{"headline":"'A wave of change': Sienna Miller hails #MeToo movement at New York summit","bodyText":"The actor Sienna Miller hailed the “wave of change” enveloping the media and entertainment industries in an impassioned speech at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Friday. Speaking at an event on sexual exploitation and harassment hosted by the Guardian, UN Women and the Norwegian government, Miller praised the courage of the women who have spoken out about their experiences of harassment since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke last year. Recounting a moment when she felt professionally “undervalued and undermined” in her own career, she said: “I have really just had enough. Enough of being undervalued, enough of being undermined, enough of being disrespected, because of my gender. “A few years ago I was offered a gutsy, powerful role in a play that was close to my heart. It was a two-hander on Broadway, but I was offered less than half what my male co-star was being paid. “The decision to turn down this particular role was difficult and lonely. I was forced to choose between making a concession on my self-worth and dignity and a role that I was in love with. “It turned out to be a pivotal moment in my life. Not because I did it. But because I didn’t. “I am excited that this movement challenges the loneliness and isolation we have all felt in relatively insignificant or extreme situations. I really feel that as women, we are no longer alone.” The event, moderated by Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee, was hosted on the sidelines of the fortnight-long UN Commission on the Status of Women, the annual meeting that assesses progress towards ending discrimination in member states. The CSW, the UN’s largest meeting on gender equality, this year focuses on issues facing rural women and girls, such as improving living standards, food security and access to land. The summit also explores the efforts being made to improve women’s representation in – and access to – the media. Revelations of alleged assault by Weinstein sparked an unprecedented global movement to expose and end sexual harassment, close gender pay gaps and promote women in the media and entertainment industries. In another nod to her own experience, Miller said she was “gossip-column fodder” in her early twenties and found herself “relentlessly harassed by 15 camera-armed men on a daily basis, determined to scare me to the point of rage or tears in the name of getting a newsworthy shot. My life and career was in the hands of people intent on destruction, people who judged and vilified me in ways they would never have done if I was a man.” Alluding to an episode when she successfully sued photographers for an “intolerable campaign” of harassment and invasion of privacy, winning £37,000 in damages, Miller said: “I fought back, and changed the privacy laws.” Miller added: “For me, the strongest significance of the Time’s Up movement is that, by bringing to light the darkest moments of some of the most powerful women in Hollywood, it sends a message to those who admire and listen to them. “This message is that sexual harassment happens to everyone, even those who we think are untouchable because of their fame or celebrity status. It sends the message that being treated unfairly, cannot be an intrinsic part of being a woman.” Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the executive director of UN Women, told the packed room that the #MeToo moment was a tipping point that represented the culmination of years of work by women around the world. She said it was an opportunity for women in the public eye to “speak for other women who are outside and invisible”. “It is the first time we are seeing powerful men being made accountable,” said Mlambo-Ngcuka. “Accountability says to young men that this is not normal, this is not right.” She called on the media not to stop reporting the story. “Don’t move to the next story until gender equality is reached. Stay with the story so we make sure the pendulum doesn’t swing the other way.” Pamella Sittoni, the managing editor of the EastAfrican, a weekly newspaper published in Kenya, told attendees that before #MeToo, she had assumed harassment and discrimination was a problem only for African women. “It was quite shocking for us,” said Sittoni. “We didn’t expect it to be as pervasive as it is. It was quite eye-opening for us.” She said that, while she had not experienced harassment or open discrimination during her career, she counted herself among the lucky ones. “I know it exists. I have colleagues who are very frustrated about being put on the women’s pages. They can’t rise above that and they quit. And they are not getting equal pay,” she said. “It is important we take this [the #MeToo movement] to Africa in a bigger way.” She added #MeToo was not a women’s movement but “a humanity movement about respecting human dignity … Men shouldn’t feel that this is something targeting them. It’s a movement about [creating] a good world for all of us.” Friday’s discussion, entitled #MeToo – now what?, is one of more than 280 side events being hosted at the UN by agencies and member states over the duration of the CSW, which runs from 12-23 March. About 440 other events will be held in New York. More than 8,000 people from 1,121 civil society organisations have registered – the largest number of attendees to date. Also speaking at the event were Fatemah Farag, the founder of Welad el Belad and director of Women in News in the Middle East and North Africa, and Matthew Winkler, the co-founder and editor-in-chief emeritus of Bloomberg News. The Norwegian minister for foreign affairs, Ine Marie Eriksen Soreide, closed the event by saying that a corner had been turned. “I think we can all agree there is no going back after this, there is no room for leaders that don’t take sexual harassment seriously,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/15/trump-jr-divorce-wife-vanessa-reports","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T22:15:21Z","webTitle":"Vanessa Trump files for divorce from Donald Trump Jr – reports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/trump-jr-divorce-wife-vanessa-reports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/trump-jr-divorce-wife-vanessa-reports","fields":{"headline":"Vanessa Trump files for divorce from Donald Trump Jr – reports","bodyText":"Vanessa Trump, the wife of Donald Trump Jr, filed for divorce on Thursday, according to reports. Vanessa Trump filed for an uncontested proceeding, “meaning she’s not expecting a legal battle over custody of the couple’s five children or their assets”, the New York Post reported. On Wednesday the paper said the president’s eldest son and his wife of 13 years “were living separate lives” and that Trump Jr, 40, was “never there”. In a joint statement, the couple said they had decided to go their separate ways., adding they “will always have tremendous respect for each other” and their families. In January 2017, Trump Jr and his brother Eric took over the day-to-day management of the Trump Organization, the president’s business empire, after their father took office. Trump Jr has remained involved in politics. Trump Jr campaigned for Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania this week, as did his father. But Saccone lost the election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district to the Democrat Conor Lamb. Trump Jr’s political involvement has brought him under scrutiny from the special prosecutor Robert Mueller for his role in potential collusion between Russia and his father’s presidential campaign. In 2016, Trump Jr received an email offering compromising information on Hillary Clinton from someone claiming to represent the Russian government. “If it’s what you say, I love it,” Trump Jr replied. Trump Jr and Vanessa Trump married in November 2005. A wedding announcement from the time, posted in the New York Times, said the ceremony was held at Mar-a-Lago, Trump Sr’s membership club in Palm Beach, Florida.

On Thursday the governor general sacked Quaedvlieg for misconduct after multiple investigations into allegations he sought to arrange a job for his girlfriend at the Australian Border Force and failed to declare the relationship. The Courier Mail reported there remained disagreement over when Quaedvlieg and his girlfriend became “partners”, for the information of the Australian government security vetting agency. It said he and his partner exchanged about 14,000 text messages in the space of a year, and that ABF staff thought she was his goddaughter. Quaedvlieg did not deny the claims but on Friday said he used messaging services as “an essential part of the job”, like other public servants. “Officials are also entitled to use their official devices for reasonable private use in recognition that their public lives often consume significant portions of their time and they, like most people, have a need or want to communicate with loved ones, or to conduct minor private household transactions while engaged in work duties,” he said in a text message. “I have never had a verified total number, or a breakdown of messages sent and/or received, put to me as part of this investigation, nor does it form any part of the grounds for my termination as tabled in parliament yesterday.” A statement from the government on Thursday outlined three grounds for the sacking, including misbehaviour, misconduct, and failure to disclose a material personal interest which related to the affairs of the ABF. It said he modified policies relating to recruitment to advantage a candidate for an ABF job and personally acted to advantage their application. He also failed to disclose his relationship to the vetting agency “within a reasonable time”, it alleged, and made “a willfully or recklessly false statement” to minister, Peter Dutton, about his relationship. He also failed to disclose that he had an interest in the candidate securing the position, the statement said. It said Quaedvlieg’s sacking was “unfortunate” given his long and conspicuous career, but “the relevant conduct when beyond an isolated error of judgment and ultimately undermined his capacity to continue in the office of ABF commissioner”. Quaedvlieg maintained his denial of “those particularised grounds”. He said he had declined to resign when given the opportunity because it was “tantamount to a concession of culpability”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/18/revealed-how-increasingly-powerful-momentum-is-transforming-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T16:00:07Z","webTitle":"Revealed: how an increasingly powerful Momentum is transforming Labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/18/revealed-how-increasingly-powerful-momentum-is-transforming-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/18/revealed-how-increasingly-powerful-momentum-is-transforming-labour","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: how an increasingly powerful Momentum is transforming Labour","bodyText":"Momentum is a powerful and increasingly independent political force that is radically transforming the Labour party, with local groups challenging party orthodoxies, flouting national membership rules and fighting to get their activists selected, a Guardian investigation has revealed. A grassroots reporting project across four local parties demonstrates that Momentum, often described as a “party within a party”, has rapidly become the most powerful force on the ground with Labour members frequently defining themselves as for or against it. Some groups are even prepared to defy the wishes of Jeremy Corbyn’s office to support their chosen candidates in parliamentary selections, while a rule that bans non-Labour members from joining Momentum is frequently ignored in practice. In Mansfield, Momentum and local party officers went against the Labour leadership to reject the Corbyn aide David Prescott in favour of the council leader, Sonya Ward. Ben Timberley, a trainer with Momentum, said Ward was ideal for the seat and across the country the group wanted to back the candidate best placed for victory. “Having a local candidate, not parachuting somebody in, every constituency needs that if they are going to win,” he said. In Brighton and Hove, where party membership has tripled since 2015, Momentum’s influential city-wide group hopes to secure at least a dozen seats on the Labour-run city council in the next elections in May 2019. Greg Hadfield, a Momentum organiser, who has been suspended by Labour, said: “We have a real chance of winning the first socialist majority on Brighton and Hove city council in the elections in May next year.” Momentum says it has more than 36,000 members nationally and is signing up more than 200 people a week. But there are also signs of a fightback in other places. Momentum-backed candidates have won only a third of 45 parliamentary selections so far, according to analysis by the Guardian, though the group says it has not backed a candidate in every race. In some local parties, centrist members are actively organising to check its power. In Lewisham East, members have rallied behind the MP Heidi Alexander to limit Momentum’s influence after a series of tumultuous meetings following her resignation from Corbyn’s shadow cabinet in 2016. But the group is strong in neighbouring Lewisham Deptford, and figures banned from Labour, including Jill Mountford of the far-left Alliance for Workers’ Liberty, who stood against Labour in 2010, are influential within its ranks. Formally, Momentum obliges all its members to also be Labour party members, under a rule change made last year in part to prevent it being infiltrated by far-left groups, but in practice the rule is not strictly applied. Mountford told the Guardian, “in or out, it won’t stop me organising Momentum, and going out and canvassing for Labour”, while at a meeting she said councils should protest against government by setting “illegal budgets”. A meeting in Brighton last month also heard a personal statement from Tony Greenstein, who had only a few days earlier been expelled from Labour over allegations of anti-semitism, which he denies. A Momentum spokesperson said: “To join Momentum, you first have to be a member of the Labour party. If we receive a formal complaint about one of our 36,000 members, we will process it in accordance with Momentum’s complaints policy, code of ethics and constitution.” In Morecambe, the Momentum-backed Erica Lewis lost a campaign to be Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate in a bitter selection battle that triggered an official complaint to the party. Local Labour figures urged the party to intervene after it emerged that Lewis was able to use Momentum membership lists to canvass before her rivals; she lost out amid the backlash. Momentum-linked candidates who have already been selected to contest seats include the vicar Steven Saxby, a vocal Corbyn supporter who took part in a vigil in Walthamstow against the Labour MP Stella Creasy during a House of Commons vote on the Syria bombing. He has been selected to fight Cities of London and Westminster. Others who were successful include: Paul Farmer, a former bus driver, in Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, Labour’s top target seat in the south-west; Greg Marshall in Broxtowe, the seat of pro-EU Tory MP Anna Soubry; and the music teacher Jackie Schneider in Wimbledon. Candidates selected over Momentum candidates include Sally Keeble, the former MP for Northampton North, who has been selected to fight the seat again; and Peter Lamb, selected for Crawley and the leader of its borough council. Another is the Lancashire Labour council leader, Azhar Ali, who is the party’s nomination for Pendle. He recently signed a letter to the Times criticising Labour NEC interference in Haringey council in London. Nationally, Momentum is arguing that Labour’s membership rules should be relaxed to end a ban on members of other political parties joining. As part of a Labour democracy review, Momentum has submitted that the rule be watered down to ban only people who are members of organisations “clearly incompatible with Labour’s”, such as the Conservative party. With a general election most likely several years away, the idea of deselections is not high on the agenda among local groups. Sources said that Labour’s Hove MP, Peter Kyle, who has criticised Corbyn and supported alternative candidates in the 2015 and 2016 leadership races, could face a challenge from members wanting to have a full reselection. Momentum’s submission to the national party also calls for the introduction of a form of mandatory reselection, where sitting MPs such as Kyle would have to demonstrate positive support from party members and affiliated organisations before being chosen again as a parliamentary candidate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/16/cheltenham-gold-cup-tips-day-four-festival-might-bite","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Cheltenham Gold Cup day tips: Might Bite can strike it big","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/16/cheltenham-gold-cup-tips-day-four-festival-might-bite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/16/cheltenham-gold-cup-tips-day-four-festival-might-bite","fields":{"headline":"Cheltenham Gold Cup day tips: Might Bite can strike it big","bodyText":"If you back Might Bite (3.30) for this Cheltenham Gold Cup, then of course you must fear the risk of him wandering around on the run-in like he did in last year’s RSA. In the end, however, the greater risk lies in backing something else and being beaten by Might Bite because this is a prodigiously talented steeplechaser who will take a great deal of stopping. Had he been a more straightforward animal, he would have won two Grade Ones by about 30 lengths as a novice. He idled once he had the King George won but in this greatest test he has faced, we will see the extent of his talent. Native River faces an enormous task, trying to make all the running on this surface. Equally, the size of this 18-runner field will probably count against those, like Edwulf, who are held up in rear. Killultagh Vic and Our Duke look the big dangers. 1.30 Samcro’s impressive success on Wednesday has a tangential bearing here. When he won at Leopardstown last month, his time was two seconds slower than the race on the same card won by Mr Adjudicator. While the races may have been run differently, Mr Adjudicator showed himself to be a very fast juvenile that day and he could be the one to give the favourite, Apple’s Shakira, most to worry about. 2.10 Willie Mullins could bag both the first two prizes on this card, as he has several fine chances in this County Hurdle, having won the race four times in the past eight years. Meri Devie, who was to have been the mount of Ruby Walsh, could prove the pick of them. The trainer was still talking about running her in the Mares Hurdle when she was last seen, winning at Punchestown. Evidently, he has been tempted by the fact that the handicapper has put her up just 2lb for that. She moves like a classy animal and can travel nicely into contention here. 2.50 It is slightly surprising to find Chef Des Obeaux rivalling his stablemate Santini for favouritism, considering Santini beat the other convincingly when they met at Newbury in December and followed up here in January. The form of that last race was boosted by the runner-up, Black Op, who was still challenging Samcro at the last on Wednesday. Santini can prove he is indeed the pick of these stayers. 4.10 He could do with the ground drying out a bit but Wonderful Charm’s race comes at the right end of Festival week for that and he looks the brightest talent in this field. He could have won this race a year ago had he taken up a handier early position. He roared up the hill to be beaten just a neck by Pacha Du Polder and can turn that form around here. 4.50 Gordon Elliott was riding as an amateur for Martin Pipe 20 years ago, trying to pick up lessons from his training methods. Elliott has called Pipe his hero, won the race named after Pipe last year and can safely be assumed to be keen on doing it again. His Blow By Blow could have taken his chance in the Albert Bartlett but is on too lenient a rating to try anything else but a handicap here. A top‑class bumper horse two years ago, he is on his way to proving as good over obstacles. 5.30 Getting bought by JP McManus is the most significant thing Rock The World has done since winning this race last year. The result is that he has come back down to a beatable mark and can do it again, with Robbie Power aboard for the first time since that day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/14/told-my-husband-was-having-an-affair","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T04:59:13Z","webTitle":"A friend told me that my husband was having an affair.

I didn’t want to know","bodyText":"I have a dilemma. A friend is having an affair. Her (wonderful) husband is blissfully unaware. I asked her once, my friend with the roving eye, in the way we ask girlfriends these questions after too much wine, “If your husband were having an affair, would you want to know?” Yes, she said. An emphatic yes. She would want to know. She isn’t alone: I ask other girlfriends, “Would you want to know?” Almost without exception, they say yes. I wonder why. To mete out some kind of punishment? To save themselves from the humiliation of everybody talking about them behind their backs? Because, anyway, why should he get away with it? You see, I would once have agreed. Yes, I’d have said, confidently, “I’d want to know, absolutely.” Except, when it happened to me – when I was told, “Your husband’s had a thing” – I found I didn’t want to know. Not at all. I remember so clearly the delivery of that gut-punching news. A friend told me on a walk. I felt winded. I stopped dead. I couldn’t catch my breath, I couldn’t speak. A thing? She couldn’t stop telling me all the details: “It started at a party, somebody noticed they’d slipped away, I’m not sure where you were… ” as if my absence had been the catalyst, as if I ought to have been standing guard, as if it were my fault. I confronted my husband, of course I did – tearfully. He denied having been unfaithful. He told me I was silly – “You’re being ridiculous” – and stalked off. But if I hadn’t seen the fire, I could taste the smoke; its sourness lingered for ages, tainting everything. His dismissive rebuttal smacked much more of an indignant “How could I have been found out?” than an outraged “How could anybody say such a thing?” He never confronted the woman who accused him, and I always wondered why not: I would have done exactly that – and immediately. “How dare you make such suggestions?” I’d have demanded. He kept firmly quiet. His silence was deafening and incriminating all at the same time. Once you’ve been evicted from your comfortable, married-with-children shell of complacency, it’s difficult to get comfortable again. Once a seed of doubt has been sown, it quickly becomes a jungle of qualms, fed by every cold shoulder, every turn of the head. I began to dissect and minutely analyse everything he did, everything he’d ever done. I excavated events from years ago: I thought I remembered how he’d flirted on various occasions, abandoned me for more interesting company. I remembered overhearing him tell an attractive woman whom he met at a party that he wasn’t married. “Pffft, me, married?” he snorted and laughed at the very notion. I was standing behind him, seven months pregnant. For years after the accusation, I viewed every woman with a brittle, green-eyed gaze, “Why are you looking at her?” I’d demand as he looked into the middle distance, probably perfectly innocently. I was bitter, I made caustic comments about other women – such an unattractive trait in a woman. I stopped being spontaneous, I was a lot less fun. It unspooled my confidence. I unravelled from robust to needy: what was he missing in me that had drawn him to her? Hearing that he had been unfaithful once infected all our preceding years together and left me sore, raw and smarting until a long time later. So no. It turned out I didn’t want to know, didn’t have to know. Knowing didn’t add enough to make up for all the things it took away. In fact, knowing added precisely nothing. Infidelity isn’t rampant. But nor is it uncommon: a gazillion surveys suggest it happens in a third of committed relationships. But it takes so many shapes now – and many of those shapes are of the flaky, you’d-be-better-off-ignoring sort. And is it worth throwing five, 10, 15 years away when infidelity may amount to a momentary lapse in concentration? Delusion? Distraction? All balls, no brains? Is it worth abandoning something of substance for something that may mean nothing, that is a frivolous, transient massaging of ego? Later, much later, when I was able to rationalise all of this, when I realised that a brief lapse did not amount to him falling out of love with me, did not mean there was anything wrong with me, I was able to compute it all: to consider the numbers. A night, or two, of foolishness versus the significance of shared years, the partnership of parenthood, the joys, the grief through which we had supported each other, good times and sad that were privately ours. The ballast. But back to my friend with the unfaithful wife. “Ought I to tell him?” I ask the same girlfriends who insist they’d want to know in the same position. The response to a specific instance is very different. Oooh, they don’t know. Best not get involved, says one. Are you absolutely certain, asks another. How well do you know them both, says a third. The wisest one acknowledges it’s a tricky question: “You’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” So, my question still unanswered, I put my quandary to more friends. Men and women bat the dilemma back and forth. They all agree that it’s a tricky predicament. But nobody knows for sure. Except my husband. He shakes his head: “Don’t,” he says quietly. “Don’t tell. Telling can wreck good marriages.” It turns out that what they say is true: a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. My husband’s insight confirms what I think I know is the right answer from my own miserable experience. The friend who told me about my husband is still a friend. But she is not nearly as good a friend as she was once. And I don’t want to damage a precious relationship of many years with my cuckolded friend in the same way she spoiled ours; I’ll keep my mouth shut. The woman with whom my husband was meant to have had a dalliance pinched someone else’s husband in the end; he was easier quarry than mine. They have a baby daughter. She nags him a little too often, isn’t as pretty as she was once, seems a bit miserable. As revenge goes, that’s not bad. • Alice James is a pseudonym."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/16/mafia-state-protesters-rally-against-cambodia-pm-hun-sens-visit-to-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T07:44:17Z","webTitle":"'Mafia state': protesters rally against Cambodia PM Hun Sen's visit to Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/16/mafia-state-protesters-rally-against-cambodia-pm-hun-sens-visit-to-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/16/mafia-state-protesters-rally-against-cambodia-pm-hun-sens-visit-to-australia","fields":{"headline":"'Mafia state': protesters rally against Cambodia PM Hun Sen's visit to Australia","bodyText":"Hundreds of Cambodian-Australians have protested against the Australian visit of the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, who is accused of human rights violations in his country and abroad. They said Hun had murdered political opponents, jailed dissenters and run Cambodia “like a mafia state”. “Violence is in his blood,” Srey Kang told a crowd in Sydney’s Hyde Park. Hun is in Sydney for the Asean-Australia summit, which began on Friday. Australia is not a formal member of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations but takes part in the group’s biennial summits. In February, Hun had threatened to physically “beat up” Cambodian-Australians if they protested against his visit. “If they burn my effigy ... I will pursue them to their houses and beat them up,” he said. “I want to remind those who plan to demonstrate against me that my visit is an honour for their government.” Hun has been Cambodia’s prime minister since 1985, making him one of the world’s longest-serving leaders. He has shut down independent local media, and in November, the Cambodian supreme court officially dissolved the opposition party, which Human Rights Watch said marked the “death of democracy”. On Friday, Nairand Kay, one of the protesters, told the crowd Hun’s “time was up”. “This thug of south-east Asia rules Cambodia like a mafia state,” she said. “He sent his bodyguards unit to savagely beat up the opposition MPs in front of the Cambodia parliament in broad daylight. “Many killings happened under the nose of the Hun Sen’s government and were swept under the carpet ... The murdering of Mr Kem Ley in the middle of a busy Phnom Penh Star Mart gas station a day after his interview with Radio Free Asia was too much for us to bear. “We are here today to tell Hun Sen that his time is up. The game is over.” Srey Kang called on Malcolm Turnbull and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, to do more to condemn Hun. “It is shameful that we see this thug, Hun Sen, come to this Australia-Asean summit, walking with blood on his hands and shaking hands with prime minister Malcolm Turnbull,” she said. “Hun Sen is a violent man ... grave human rights abuses have been committed. We are here today to appeal to the leaders that are attending the Australia-Asean summit to tell Hun Sen that enough is enough.” The protesters called on Hun to release political prisoners, reinstate the opposition party and hold a free and fair election. The organisers claimed that politicians such as Labor’s Mark Butler, Penny Wong and Chris Bowen, and the federal Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, had expressed support for the protest. Those attending also heard from the Victorian Labor MP Hong Lim, a former president of the Cambodian Association of Victoria, and the Australian director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson. “Australia is trying to airbrush human rights issues from the summit ” Pearson told Guardian Australia before the protest. “The reason Hun Sen has gone so far this time is because of the lack of international response from other countries. “We don’t want this summit to just be a propaganda coup for Hun Sen and Suu Kyi and give them the global legitimacy they crave ... If this election in 2018 proceeds in Cambodia without the CNRP [the opposition party], Australia should be thinking about targeted sanctions and asset seizures against senior members of the Cambodian government.” The organiser of the protest, Genevieve Kang, said Hun had also threatened overseas Cambodian-Australians and many of them were wary of spy networks. “Hun Sen was losing power in Cambodia, nobody would vote for him any more,” she said. “The biggest problem is Cambodians who live overseas, who can speak up. He’s trying to control Cambodians overseas. “They have got spies in the community. They have infiltrated the community. Some people are too scared to come because they don’t want their face identified.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/15/arsenal-milan-europa-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T21:59:17Z","webTitle":"Danny Welbeck double eases Arsenal past Milan and into quarter-finals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/15/arsenal-milan-europa-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/15/arsenal-milan-europa-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Danny Welbeck double eases Arsenal past Milan and into quarter-finals","bodyText":"Danny Welbeck thought about it. He had felt the slightest touch from the Milan left-back, Ricardo Rodríguez, inside the area and he went down. The official behind the goal thought about it some more. The seconds ticked by. Milan were unconcerned. But then, a crackle across the airwaves and there was the Swedish referee, Jonas Eriksson, pointing to the spot. Milan erupted with rage. Arsenal could sense their place in the Europa League quarter-finals. Welbeck scored and, at long last, Arsène Wenger could feel his luck was in. The Arsenal manager’s team had trailed to Hakan Calhanoglu’s long-range blast and, at that point, things could have turned angsty. Instead, Welbeck had them back in charge. The impression it was Arsenal’s night was reinforced when Granit Xhaka made the tie safe on 71 minutes. Again, there had been little hint of danger. The midfielder’s shot from outside the area looked routine for Gianluigi Donnarumma. Yet the young hope of Italian goalkeeping fumbled dreadfully and that was that. There was even time for Welbeck to add a late third, after Donnarumma had parried Aaron Ramsey’s header. There were fears beforehand of another low Emirates Stadium turnout; more refuseniks angry at the club’s direction under Wenger. It did not materialise and there was something fortifying about the sight of a virtual full house roaring the team on. The official attendance of 58,973 looked right, for a change. Milan came to play and they were understandably aggrieved about the penalty, even if the manager, Rino Gattuso, refused to use it as an “alibi” for the defeat. Arsenal wobbled at the start and they were relieved when the Milan striker André Silva – in yards of space – found only the side-netting after 46 seconds. But Wenger’s team tried to get on to the front foot and they created chances. This competition has long since come to resemble a shot at salvation for the club and, possibly, Wenger too. The dream of crashing into the Champions League via the back door continues to burn. Calhanoglu fashioned his goal out of nothing. He cut across his right-footed shot from 25 yards and got the ball to dip and fade into the far corner. David Ospina was powerless. The fear from the Arsenal point of view was it would prompt a collective panic; a reawakening of the demons that have gripped them all too regularly this season. But as the crowd stayed with them, they responded – with a helping hand from the officials. When Welbeck went down, Wenger’s words from last month resonated. “I remember there were tremendous cases here when foreign players did it,” he said, with regard to diving. “But English players have learned very quickly and they might be the masters now.” The Italian media put questions to Gattuso about how England had once been considered as the land of fair play. Not here. Welbeck’s conversion was clinical and Milan would be further incensed moments later when Calum Chambers, who had replaced Laurent Koscielny – the victim of a back injury – felt the ball hit his hand inside the area. No penalty. Arsenal were not convincing at the back but they could point to a clutch of chances in the first half. Welbeck put a move on Leonardo Bonucci in the 25th minute before seeing Donnarumma block at the near post; Ramsey worked the goalkeeper immediately after Calhanoglu’s goal and, in first half stoppage time, Welbeck touched back for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who nodded wide, and Jack Wilshere extended Donnarumma with a decent hit. Milan’s challenge in the second half was to put the penalty decision behind them, which was hard. The injustice burned. Their supporters had whistled the big-screen replays of Welbeck’s kick during the interval. Arsenal were eager to draw Milan’s sting with periods of possession but the visitors pushed. They knew that the next goal could re-release the cat among the pigeons. Suso, who would be booked for diving, dragged a shot wide while Patrick Cutrone fluffed a volley when gloriously placed. Silva also went down in the area, looking for a penalty. He might claim that it worked for Welbeck. Mkhitaryan and Ramsey had half-chances at the beginning of the second half but it was Milan who came to knock on the door. The substitute, Nikola Kalinic, blew a free header and Wenger was sufficiently worried to introduce Mohamed Elneny as a third man in midfield. Donnarumma’s error, though, would knock the stuffing out of Milan. Arsenal had done the hard part at San Siro last Thursday, when they turned up and Milan did not but the job still had to be finished. It was possible to feel the stirrings of optimism. The draw on Friday brings possibility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/16/peter-duttons-offer-to-white-south-african-farmers-started-on-the-far-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T01:02:34Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton’s offer to white South African farmers started on the far right | Jason Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/peter-duttons-offer-to-white-south-african-farmers-started-on-the-far-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/peter-duttons-offer-to-white-south-african-farmers-started-on-the-far-right","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton’s offer to white South African farmers started on the far right","bodyText":"Peter Dutton is considering fast-track visas for white South African farmers, after the issue was put on the national agenda by News Corp papers. News’s campaign on the issue included reporting and two crucial columns by Miranda Devine and Caroline Marcus, which argued that the latest moves on land reform put the country’s farmers in grave peril. In announcing his interest in their plight, Dutton, Australia’s home affairs minister, said “I think these people deserve special attention and we’re certainly applying that special attention now”. He described them as people who would easily “integrate into our society”. Earlier, Devine had written about the kinship between Australians and “our oppressed white, Christian, industrious, rugby and cricket-playing Commonwealth cousins”, saying that they would “integrate seamlessly”. Marcus had connected the situation to a broader picture of what she described as “reverse racism”, writing that “the truth is, there are versions of this anti-white, vengeance theme swirling in movements around the western world, from Black Lives Matter in the US to Invasion Day protests back home”. By emphasising white kinship and white peril, the paper’s columnists may have gotten the result they were looking for. But they weren’t the only outlet on 12 March to urge their government to help the farmers. The same day, on the American “race realist” website, VDare, Leo Hohmann, the author of a recent book on the supposed “stealth invasion” of the west by Muslim immigrants, was saying that the farmers have “their collective heads on the block”. Land reform, Hohmann warned, threatened them with “extermination”. He demanded that Donald Trump issue an executive order to carry out a “sweeping rescue mission” and admit them as refugees. It was just the latest of many articles VDare has run asking that farmers be admitted as refugees. Stories on the alleged persecution of white farmers have also been posted in March on far-right sites from Richard Spencer’s AltRight.com to American Renaissance. The alt-right darling Lauren Southern is preparing a documentary on the issue. Fellow alt-right auteur Faith Goldy, sacked from Rebel Media after palling around too much with white supremacists in Charlottesville, described South Africa as the movement’s “flavour of the month”. And Marcus’s eye-popping claim that being a South African farmer is the most dangerous job in the world, though not supported by the evidence, certainly is supported by a range of far-right and conspiracist websites. The demand for refugee status has also been made in a year-old change.org petition, titled “Genocide of whites in South Africa”, which has so far garnered more than 19,000 signatures. For some time that petition has been heavily promoted on far-right websites and podcasts. It offers lurid but nonspecific stories of whites being killed “in the most sadistic ways imaginable”. It asks that they be prioritised over people from the Middle East. South African whites, it says, are threatened with “complete genocide” and are “compatible with our culture and civilization”. On a recent episode of alt-right podcast White Rabbit Radio, host “Horus the Avenger” urged listeners to sign the petition, remarking that the issue was receiving broader attention after being previously confined to the farthest reaches of the far-right internet. “This was the province of Stormfront five, 10 years ago, white genocide in South Africa”, he said. “Now it is mainstream.” He’s right about the far-right’s obsession with the issue, and he may be right about it becoming more broadly shared. It’s now being pushed by conservatives who are, in theory, further away from the racist fringe, but who have increasingly acted to amplify their ideas. Ann Coulter remarked last year that the farmers are the “only real refugees”. On his prime-time Fox News show earlier this month, Tucker Carlson claimed the country was “falling apart” as a result of land reform. Former Daily Mail columnist and reality show contestant Katie Hopkins is planning a documentary on the subject. Teasers released by Rebel Media, where Hopkins is now a stablemate of Mark Latham’s, focus on the alleged torture of farmers. It’s also been a big topic on the internet’s major hub for Trump supporters, The Donald. White Rabbit Radio, like many far-right outlets, exists mainly to promote that apocalyptic, racist narrative of “white genocide”. This is the idea that white populations are being replaced by people of colour, whether this is through immigration, “race mixing” or displacement and murder. Like the rest of the far right, it sees the South Africa story as being central to this narrative. For example, just last week on American Renaissance’s podcast, Jared Taylor, who advocates for a white ethnostate to be carved out of the present United States, hosted Dan Roodt, the leader of the Pro-Afrikaans Action Group, a “pro-European” white power organisation. Taylor told his guest, “We think of whites in South Africa as a canary in the coalmine” and as bellwethers for “the future Africanisation of the planet”. As reporting in Quartz pointed out in the various campaigns around the issue, the far right has managed to establish a myth that “a ‘white genocide’, targeting white farmers in particular has been under way since the ANC came to power in 1994”. More broadly, the idea that whites are under attack in various places and white solidarity against such attacks is crucial, is a basic component of the belief system known as white nationalism. As far back as 2015, experts were warning of the “globalisation of white nationalism”. Morris Dees and Richard Cohen from the Southern Poverty Law Center outlined this development in the wake of racist murders by Dylann Roof, who was obsessed and affronted by the end of white supremacist rule in South Africa’s neighbour, Rhodesia. Then, they said that “from the United States and Canada to Europe, Australia and New Zealand … white supremacists don’t see borders; they see a white tribe under attack by people of colour across the globe”. What they couldn’t have anticipated ahead of the era of Trump and the alt right is how far the tenets of white nationalism would be mainstreamed. News’s campaign on the issue certainly forwards and depends on the white nationalist logic of white kinship and white genocide. This mindset has been nurtured and developed on the far right. It follows an increasing attention to the issue in alt-right circles in recent months. And the policy being considered by a government, which also detains Middle Eastern refugees with no hope of entering the country, is equally white nationalist on its face. Already, Dutton’s move is being celebrated in white supremacist circles. It seems likely that, if implemented, it will further embolden racist movements worldwide. • Jason Wilson is a Guardian journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/16/cheltenham-festival-2018-gold-cup-day-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T17:56:27Z","webTitle":"Cheltenham Festival 2018: Native River wins the Gold Cup – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/16/cheltenham-festival-2018-gold-cup-day-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/16/cheltenham-festival-2018-gold-cup-day-live","fields":{"headline":"Cheltenham Festival 2018: Native River wins the Gold Cup – as it happened","bodyText":"And here’s Saturday’s tips: That’s about it from the Festival. Hasn’t it flown by? There have been plenty of highlights – Altior, Samcro, Footpad, Balko Des Flos, Buveur D’Air, Penhill, Presenting Percy, Lizzie Kelly, Davy Russell, Jack Kennedy, Bridget Andrews, Willie Mullins v Gordon Elliott – but nothing tops the Gold Cup, Native River beating Might Bite in a race-long duel. Thanks to Chris and Greg for their input from the track, and thanks to all of you for tuning in and taking part. I’m off for a cool down and a carrot. Bye! 1.30 Farclas (Kennedy/Elliott) 14-1 2.10 Mohaayed (Andrews/Skelton) 33-1 2.50 Kilbricken Storm (Cobden/Tizzard) 33-1 3.30 Native River (Johnson/Tizzard) 5-1 4.10 Pacha Du Polder (Tucker/Nicholls) 25-1 4.50 Blow By Blow (Meyler/Elliott) 11-1 5.30 Le Prezien (Geraghty/Nicholls) 15-2 Word is that Dresden, who fell early on, is still receiving treatment, while jockey Harry Skelton, who fell at the same fence on the second time around, is also seeing a doctor. Hoping everyone gets back OK after what was a rough final race. Davy Russell speaks: “It’s great, it’s a special place, almost a fairytale sort of place to me. All those great names – Ruby, Richard Dunwoody, AP (McCoy) – it’s great to be alongside them.” Nicholls, who dominated this Festival a decade ago, left it late but has picked up two wins. The champion trainer this year is Gordon Elliott, with a record-equalling eight wins – and he didn’t have one after opening day. His winners: Samcro, Tiger Roll, Veneer Of Charm, Shattered Love, Delta Work, The Storyteller, Farclas and Blow By Blow. In the final Bet Bright Cup standings, Ireland have beaten Britain 17-11; it could have been worse for the home team. A welcome win for Barry Geraghty to end the week – his second, and trainer Paul Nicholls’ second in the last three races. Gino Trail couldn’t hang on, but comes in second. 1 Le Prezien (B J Geraghty) 15-2 2 Gino Trail (J E Moore) 25-1 3 Top Gamble (D N Russell) 8-1 4 Theinval (J McGrath) 16-1 22 ran | 7-1 Fav North Hill Harvey Some Plan falls heavily at the last, and Le Prezien is coming through to challenge Gino Trail, who is hampered by loose horses... Gino Trail still leads by a couple of lengths, with loose horses causing trouble for the chasers – and North Hill Harvey falls at the third last! Bright New Dawn has caught up to the pack, still led by Gino Trail with Three Stars, Foxtail Hill and North Hill Harvey in pursuit... Bright New Dawn was slow to start and has already lost touch, while Dresden falls at the second fence, and Valdez unseats the rider. Gino Trail has a decent lead, chased by Three Stars... And, for one last time, they’re off! Can Davy Russell get a fifth win on Top Gamble? Can Willie Mullins grab the trainers’ title with Townshend? Let’s find out... Grand Annual betting latest: North Hill Harvey 15-2, Le Prezien 8-1, Bouvreuil 9-1, Top Gamble 10-1, Three Stars 12-1, Don’t Touch It 14-1, Dresden 16-1, Dolos 16-1, Vaniteux 16-1, Rock The World 16-1, Townshend 16-1, Theinval 16-1, rest 20-1 bar. Who’s up for one last race, then? The Grand Annual Handicap Chase is off in 10 minutes: 5.30 Grand Annual The last race of the Festival is this two-mile handicap chase, generally a test of speed, though stamina will also be necessary on this gloupy ground. Rock The World (25-1) won it last year on his first start after a wind operation. This has presumably been the plan ever since but he seems unfancied this time. His trainer, Jessie Harrington, also has one of the market-leaders in the McManus-owned Don’t Touch It. His jumping has been a problem but he won on the only occasion he wore cheekpieces, refitted today. North Hill Harvey is good enough and wears first-time cheekpieces but comes from a yard that has been below form in the past fortnight. Theinval is the only runner for Nicky Henderson. This one worked well at Kempton last month with Buveur D’Air and Might Bite, which might seem a fair achievement by the time this race is run. Vanietux has come down the weights half a stone since leaving Henderson for David Pipe. Third in the Supreme in 2014, he has the quality if he can still show it but the Pipe yard has not exactly been flying along this season. Vaniteux has had a breathing operation since he last ran. Chris Cook Congratulations to Davy Russell, who will finish the week as top jockey – he’s ridden four winners, and beats Jack Kennedy thanks to his second place in the Mares’ Hurdle. Russell has brought home Delta Work, Balko Des Flos and the Storyteller, but his storming RSA Chase win on Presenting Percy – and his emotional look to the heavens in tribute to his mother – may live longest in the memory. In the Festival’s final race, The Game Changer could be just that – even though it’s a non-runner. It means Elliott has no horse in the Grand Annual, while rival Mullins has Townshend at 20-1. Jack Kennedy was down to ride, so he can no longer catch Davy Russell in the jockey standings. News via the Racing Post that Richard Johnson will be suspended and fined for overusing the whip in that dramatic Gold Cup finale: Elliott has matched Mullins’ 2015 record with eight wins, and will be champion trainer here unless Mullins can win the last race. He’s not an emotional sort, only saying it’s “unbelievable” and thanking his team. I imagine he’d react the same if he won every race. It’s an eighth winner of the week for Gordon Elliott, in the race named after his mentor. Donagh Meyler rode the 11-1 shot like a favourite, who went out early and never looked like being caught. 1 Blow By Blow (D Meyler) 11-1 2 Discorama (D Robinson) 33-1 3 Early Doors (J J Slevin) 9-1 4 Sire Du Berlais (D J McInerney) 10-1 23 ran | 13-2 Fav Flawless Escape James Bowen makes a move on Diese Des Bieffes, with Early Doors in contention and Discorama making a late charge, but Blow By Blow still leads, and will pull away here! A tentative pace to this one, with the pack tightly bunched together – but Blow By Blow tries to turn up the heat as they head downhill, still ahead of Brillare Momento... Flawless Escape and Deal D’Estruval jostle at the front of the pack, with Blow By Blow and Brillare Momento three lengths clear. Three hurdles coming in quick succession... They’re off! Blow By Blow takes up the early running with Brillare Momento and Melrose Boy leading the chase... Seven-all in the trainer’s race between Willie Mullins and Gordon Elliott – Mullins leads on second places. Both have plenty of contenders in this big field – Mullins with Carter Mckay, Burrows Saint and Deal D’Estruval, Elliott with Blow By Blow, Sire Du Berlais, Flaxen Flare and Flawless Escape. In case you missed it, here’s Chris Cook’s report from Cheltenham, where Native River won a classic Gold Cup duel with Might Bite: Betting latest: Deal D’estruval 7-1, Flawless Escape 7-1, Sire Du Berlais 15-2, Diese Des Bieffes 8-1, Carter Mckay 12-1, Early Doors 12-1, Blow By Blow 12-1, Mr Big Shot 16-1, Burrows Saint 16-1, Melrose Boy 16-1, 20-1 bar. Can James Bowen continue his remarkable rise with a Cheltenham win? Donald McRae spoke to the teenage prodigy earlier this year: 4.50 Martin Pipe Hurdle The twist to this race is that the jockeys are ‘conditionals’, youngsters still learning their trade. James Bowen, who famously won the Welsh National at the age of 16 in January, rides Diese Des Bieffes, whose Lanzarote fifth looks really strong form. The other jockey here you’ll have heard of is Bryony Frost, aboard Brelan D’As, a McManus-owned horse who hasn’t made it as a chaser this winter but could still be really well treated over hurdles. Gordon Elliott targets this race, named after a man he has called his hero, so it is no surprise to see that his four runners include the top three in the weights. Flawless Escape is the most fancied, having been a fine third on his handicap debut behind Total Recall, who was unbeatable at the weights they carried that day. Elliott also has Blow By Blow (11-1), a Grade One bumper winner two years ago who is getting better at hurdles and looks handily treated. “It’s a dream come true really,” says Tucker. “I thought it was mad I was even riding in the Foxhunters. To win it, it’s unbelievable. Coming to about fifth out, I couldn’t believe I was still going. He still had more in the tank, he just kept going!” This was Tucker’s second race under rules, and she also reveals that her shoulder had ‘half-dislocated’ towards the end, meaning she couldn’t drive the horse on down the home straight. All in all, a pretty exceptional win. After the epic, two mile duel in the Gold Cup, an absolute scrap in the Foxhunters: Slight delay with the race result, as everyone tried to work out who came third. Turns out, Cousin Pete and Barel of Laughs couldn’t be separated – it’s a dead heat! If you have a cousin called Pete, who happens to be a bar(r)el of laughs, I hope you had a flutter. Trainer Paul Nicholls gets his first win of the week, too. It’s been quite a closing day for British stables, after all – they lead Ireland 4-1 today. “I’m really proud of Harriet, people like her never get a chance to ride, unless you give them chances,” says the trainer. It’s been a breakthrough week for female jockeys, with Tucker joining Lizzie Kelly, Katie Walsh and Bridget Andrews in the winners’ enclosure. Harriet Tucker comes through with two fences to go and holds off Top Wood to retain the Foxhunters on Pacha Du Polder! 1 Pacha Du Polder (Miss H C Tucker) 25-1 2 Top Wood (Mr S Davies-Thomas) 50-1 3 Barel Of Laughs (Mr Alex Edwards) 14-1 3 Cousin Pete (Mr N Phillips) 66-1 24 ran | 4-1 Fav Burning Ambition Caid Du Berlais and Pacha Du Polder have joined the leading group, with Top Wood still leading but struggling for pace... those two are coming through as they take on the last... Top Wood is opening up a big lead now – six or seven lengths – with Grand Vision and Cousin Pete the only others in touch. Burning Ambition moves through the field, with two to go... Top Wood takes up the lead, with Warden Hill in second as Wells De Lune drops back. Grand Vision is in touch, but Shantou Magic has fallen away. Six to jump, Minella For Value and Cousin Pete well placed... Warden Hill, Shantou Magic, Foxrock, Top Wood all jostling for position behind Minella For Value, who has reeled in Wells De Lune. First run up the home straight, 10 fences left to jump... Saddlers Encore falls at the third fence, and Vincitore unseats the rider at the next, but all are OK. Wells De Lune takes up the initiative, leading by around five lengths as they run downhill... They’re off! Bit of a scrappy start, with plenty of pushing and shoving, but they all get away. Top Wood takes up the lead ahead of Minella For Value and Warden Hill... Here we go then, in a race that’s regarded as the Gold Cup for amateur riders. It’s over the same course, and the ground, already heavy before the Gold Cup, looks pretty churned up. Foxhunters Chase betting latest: Burning Ambition 4-1F, Foxrock 6-1, Wonderful Charm 6-1, Unioniste 11-1, Caid Du Berlais 14-1, On The Fringe 14-1, Virak 14-1, Grand Vision 14-1, Sir Jack Yeats 20-1, Barel of Laughs 20-1, Rest 25-1 bar. The big one might be over, but there’s still three more races to close out the Festival – and the trainers’ and jockeys’ titles are still up for grabs. 4.10 Foxhunters Chase This is as fiercely contested as the Gold Cup, albeit with not quite so much talent on display, equine or human. That said, Jamie Codd could certainly make it as a professional jockey and his mount, Burning Ambition, is a warm favourite after a good second to a very useful sort last time. Foxrock is a second strong Irish contender who was second in the Irish Gold Cup three years ago. Wonderful Charm (7-1) stayed on stoutly but all too late to be second last year. He might prefer a sounder surface. Grand Vision flopped last year but has had a much happier preparation this time. On The Fringe won this twice but came up short last year and, at 13, is possibly on the decline. Pacha Du Polder won it last year under Bryony Frost but was well below his best on his only run since April. Perhaps odds of 20-1 underestimate his chance of bouncing back. Chris Cook So, Native River becomes the first horse to win a Gold Cup at their second attempt, after coming third last year – and champion jockey Richard Johnson ends an 18-year wait for his second Gold Cup. Here’s our race report: More good news for Tizzard – Cue Card may not have run his last race just yet: Here’s the thoughts of trainer Colin Tizzard: Here’s how Native River did it: Worth revisiting this, from before the Festival: Trainer Colin Tizzard was having a quiet season, and a terrible Festival, especially when Cue Card pulled up in the Ryanair Chase. Now he’s won the Gold Cup! Horse racing, bloody hell. Richard Johnson: “I’m speechless, he’s been a fantastic horse for me to ride. He jumps for fun, I thought four out was too early but he did it... 18 years feels a long time ago now. Might Bite ran a hell of a race, but I think the ground helped me today. This is the most important race of our calendar, and it’s just fantastic. He got so close this year, they’ve been much quieter with him this year, so thanks very much to Colin [Tizzard].” What a performance from champion jockey Johnson, holding off the favourite the whole way and finding more in the home straight! It’s his first Gold Cup win since 2000 after an almighty duel. Barry Geraghty comes through late on Anibale Fly to take third. 1 Native River (R Johnson) 5-1 2 Might Bite (Nico de Boinville) 4-1 Fav 3 Anibale Fly (B J Geraghty) 33-1 15 ran | 9-1 Road To Respect 4th Final fence: This will be a two-horse race, but Might Bite can’t get past Native River! Richard Johnson is going to win this from the front! 2 to jump: Our Duke is pulled up! It’s also the end of the race for Saphie du Rheu and Total Recall. Still a duel between Might Bite and Native River, with Road To Respect in third, four lengths down... 5 to jump: The two heavyweights at the front still sizing each other up, with a lead of about five lengths from the pack, still led by Djakadam. Our Duke is struggling, but Total Recall and Edwulf make progress... 8 to jump: As they take on the final circuit, getting a taste of the Cheltenham roar, the field closes up with Native River, Might Bite and Djakadam the top three. Our Duke having to work a little in the pack, along with Definitly Red. American has moved up to fourth... 12 to jump: Edwulf is at the back of the field on the heels of Killultagh Vic, with Native River and Might Bite still holding the lead and Djakadam, close a number of times here, at the front of the chasing pack. Still 17 runners in this... 16 to jump: Our Duke and American move into the leading pack down the outside, with Saphir du Rheu. Definitly Red is labouring a little over the jumps, with Native River pressing on... 20 to jump: Might Bite and Native River move straight to the front at a steady gallop, but Bachasson goes down at the second... Three miles, two furlongs to racing immortality... The runners have passed through the parade and are gathering for the start. Might Bite, ridden by Nico De Boinville, looks relaxed ahead of the big race. He will start as favourite, but there are contenders everywhere you look... Just over five minutes to go – here’s your Gold Cup racecard: 1 American (N Fehily/H Fry) 25-1 2 Anibale Fly (B Geraghty/A Martin) 40-1 3 Bachasson (D Mullins/W Mullins) 33-1 4 Definitly Red (D Cook/B Ellison) 8-1 5 Djakadam (P Mullins/W Mullins) 25-1 7 Edwulf (D O’Connor/J O’Brien) 20-1 8 Killultagh Vic (P Townend/W Mullins) 8-1 9 Might Bite (N De Boinville/N Henderson) 4-1 11 Native River (R Johnson/C Tizzard) 5-1 12 Our Duke (R Power/J Harrington) 9-2 13 Outlander (J Kennedy/G Elliott) 20-1 14 Road To Respect (Flanagan/Meade) 10-1 15 Saphir Du Rheu (S Twiston-Davies) 66-1 17 Tea For Two (L Kelly/N Williams) 66-1 18 Total Recall (D Mullins/W Mullins) 16-1 NR: 6 Double Shuffle, 10 Minella Rocco, 16 Shantou Flyer Will Nicky Henderson complete the first ever Champion Hurdle-Champion Chase-Gold Cup treble? He has the favourite, Might Bite: Less than twenty minutes until the big one. Here’s Chris Cook’s preview, with the latest odds: We have no previous Gold Cup winner but we do have a fascinating battle. Might Bite (4-1) is the wayward beast who was going to win the RSA easily last year before nearly throwing it away. He has looked more sensible this year, but hasn’t been back to Cheltenham since then. As the King George winner, he is the form choice. The pace will probably come from Native River (5-1), who tried to make all the running last year, at the end of a busy season. He has had a lighter campaign this time in an attempt to improve on last year’s third. Our Duke (9-2) represents Jessie Harrington, who trained Sizing John to win a year ago. This Irish National winner was last seen beating Presenting Percy, who hosed up in the RSA. Killultagh Vic (9-1), trying to end the Mullins hoodoo in this race, would probably have won the Irish Gold Cup but for falling at the last. Edwulf (16-1), who ran on to win that race, is the ‘miracle’ horse who collapsed last year. His hold-up tactics may give him a lot to do in this big field. Road To Respect (11-1) won Ireland’s Christmas Chase and that form looks excellent in light of Balko Des Flos’s win yesterday. Definitly Red (8-1) could be the first northern-trained winner for 25 years. He won impressively here in January but the balance of his form says he’s not good enough. Total Recall (20-1) has been transformed since joining Mullins but must improve again here, and may prefer next month’s Grand National. American (25-1), second that day, is an able but fragile sort now facing by far his sternest test. Anibale Fly (33-1) was the choice of Barry Geraghty from Jonjo O’Neill’s out-of-form yard, even before Minella Rocco was withdrawn. Djakadam (25-1) tries this for the fourth time, having been second twice. He doesn’t win as often as his talent would suggest and it’s three years since he won beyond two and a half miles. Bachasson (28-1) is a lovely jumper and is an interesting outsider with place possibilities. Outlander (28-1) has not shown his best in three previous visits but this is his ground. Tea For Two (66-1) is top-class in the right circumstances but has not fared well here. Saphir Du Rheu (66-1) ran above himself to be fifth in this last year and it would be a real surprise if he can improve on that now. More from Bridget Andrews, winner with Mohaayed and the third female jockey to win this week after Lizzie Kelly and Katie Walsh. “I jumped off and I think because of the ground, people are just taking their time a bit. I’d lined up to be halfway, but ended up handy. I gave him plenty of daylight and tried to find the better ground. “To be honest, I think they got quite a soft lead as we ended up going quite slow and he jumped and he travelled. I was just waiting for them to swallow me up, but he kept going.” “I always said I would never go conditional - it’s too hard. It’s hard for the boys, it’s hard for anyone to get going, but Dan approached me and asked if I’d like the job and how could I turn it down? I’m biased, but I think I’ve got the best conditional job in the country.” A landmark win for young jockey Harry Cobden, and a welcome one for trainer Colin Tizzard, who hadn’t got close previously this week. Britain lead Ireland 2-1, if you don’t count the rest of the week... Fabulous Saga got within a fence of a storming win, but tired over such a long trip, and only Kilbricken Storm had enough in the tank to pull away! 1 Kilbricken Storm (Harry Cobden) 33-1 2 Ok Corral (B J Geraghty) 16-1 3 Santini (Nico de Boinville) 11-4 Fav 20 ran | 20-1 Ballyward 4th Approaching the last, Fabulous Saga still leads, now by about 10 lengths. Can anyone bridge the gap? Kilbricken Storm is gaining ground, and Fabulous Saga looks to be out of steam! Santini, OK Corral and Ballyward come through late, but nobody will catch Kilbricken Storm... Chef Des Obeaux, Dortmund Park and Tower Bridge among those gaining ground on the outside, with Fabulous Saga back in the lead, Kilbricken Storm up to second and Chris’s Dream still in touch with two to jump... Chris’s Dream moves onto the outside of Fabulous Saga, with Kilbricken Storm moving up to fifth as Paisley Park loses ground. Still not much movement from the back of the field... Fabulous Saga is setting a fierce pace, stringing out the leading quartet with Paisley Park and Poetic Rhythm among the leaders in the chasing pack as we approach halfway... Everyone over the first four fences, with Fabulous Saga leading from Chris’s Dream by about four lengths. Mulcahys Hill and Beyond The Law are in behind, with Dortmund Park and Santini towards the back... They’re off! A maximum field of 20 will take on the three-mile trip. The last race before the big one – the Albert Bartlett – is moments away. Santini remains the hot potato, holding on to favourite status at 3-1, with Chris’s Dream moving up the board. Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle (2.50) The first of three consecutive races that had better be thrilling because, at three miles on this ground, they will go on forever ... and it will seem like forever if your fancy unseats at the first. Nicky Henderson has the first two in the betting. Santini (11-4) looks the one, having beaten his stablemate Chef Des Obeaux already, and he also won here in January, beating Black Op, who gave Samcro most to do on Wednesday. But Chef Des Obeaux has won three since his defeat to Santini, which, in all fairness, was his first run of the season, so perhaps he has improved past his rival. For good measure, Henderson has the McManus-owned OK Corral who seems to be improving; he’s only had a handful of runs and is eight years old, so he must have been fragile. The most fancied Irish runner is Chris’s Dream, from the yard of Henry de Bromhead, who had a winner yesterday. Mullins and Elliott are not represented among the market-leaders, which is probably a mistake on the market’s part. Dortmund Park has won two of his four runs for Elliott and has had a wind op since his defeat last month, so we may see him take a step forward. Betting latest: Santini 11-4, Chef Des Obeaux 11-2, Chris’s Dream 8-1, Poetic Rhythm 10-1, Dortmund Park 12-1, Calett Mad 16-1, OK Corral 16-1, Mr Whipped 16-1, Fabulous Saga 20-1, rest 25-1 bar Some quotes from trainer Dan Skelton, who watched his brother’s partner, Bridget Andrews, win the County Hurdle on Mohaayed. “I’m a professional and I shouldn’t be crying, but Bridget has just won a race at the Festival. I’m so pleased for her. She works so hard, she’s the epitome of our sport. “The English haven’t been doing that well this week, I didn’t think we had any chance. I feel like an idiot! I’m a bit speechless. I really fancied the horse three weeks ago, but it kept raining and I said to June (Watts, the owner) ‘do we run, do we not?’ and June said, ‘let’s run’. “I’d probably have pulled him out but it just shows you, sometimes it’s meant to be. It’s amazing.” Some very sad news to report – Sandsend, who fell near the end of the County Hurdle, suffered a fatal injury. We’re about an hour away from the Gold Cup. Still time to take in Greg Wood’s preview: Richard Johnson rides Native River, hoping to win the Gold Cup for the first time since 2000. Chris Cook spoke to the veteran jockey: Quite the story there, with Harry Skelton passing on Mohaayed because of the ground and riding Spritofthegames, who came sixth. Skelton’s partner, Bridget Andrews, took on Mohaayed and won the race. “The girls have shown this week they’re as good as the men, if they’re given the chances,” Skelton says afterwards. It’s a family affair – Harry and Mohaayed trainer Dan are brothers, and sons of showjumping supremo Nick Skelton. A four-horse race from the final fence, but Bridget Andrews drives Mohaayed to beat Remiluc by a couple of lengths! 1 Mohaayed (Bridget Andrews) 33-1 2 Remiluc (Harry Reed) 50-1 3 Whiskey Sour (D J Mullins) 7-1 4 Chesterfield (Daniel Sansom) 16-1 24 ran | 6-1 Fav Flying Tiger Remiluc has moved up the field into third, the pack still heavily bunched as rain falls on the course. Chesterfield and Mohaayed are making a move, cramping Whiskey Sour for room. Remiluc just leads from Whiskey Sour and Chesterfield at the last fence, with Mohaayed coming through... William H Bonney leads the chasing pack with three to take, but the leading pair continue to maintain a big gap. Moon Racer and Duca De Thaix both well placed... Tigris River and Sternrubin open a four-length lead early on, with Sandsend and favourite Flying Tiger loitering near the back. The whole field gets over the first two flights safely... They’re off in the County Hurdle! 24 runners, two miles, good luck calling this one. Davy Russell among the jockeys giving their horses a good look at the hurdles before the starter’s flag went up... Flying Tiger, trained by Nick Williams, has leapt in and looks set to be the starting favourite. Hope rather than expectation of a home win (for the trainer, anyway)? We’ll see. Next up, it’s the County Hurdle. British trainers may want to look away – Mullins and Elliott have eight runners available at less than 20-1 in this handicapped bunfight. Betting latest: Duca de Thaix, Flying Tiger, Bleu et Rouge 8-1; Whiskey Sour 9-1; Spiritofthegames, Meri Devie, Ben Dundee 12-1; Sandsend 14-1; Smaoineamh Alainn, Chesterfield 16-1; A Hare Breath, Lagostovegas, William H Bonney 20-1. Even in this mud, we might see a modicum of pace in this two-mile handicap hurdle, which sometimes features horses who could win at the highest level. Indeed, one of today’s runners, Ivanovich Gorbatov, already has, having bagged the Triumph a couple of years ago, though he has been unable to build on that. His owner, JP McManus, has a more obvious chance with the topweight, Bleu Et Rouge, who was a fine second in the Betfair Hurdle behind Kalashnikov, who went so close in Tuesday’s Supreme. Bleu Et Rouge travelled like the winner for a long way that day and may do so again, but it’s a pity he was raised 8lb for that. He’s trained by Willie Mullins, winner of this race four times in eight years, and Mullins has other excellent chances with Meri Devie (14-1), who skipped the Mares Hurdle to come here, and Whiskey Sour, who won a Grade One at Christmas when two stablemates fell at the last. Flying Tiger won the Fred Winter last year and turned in a career best last month in his prep for this; he can win something off his present rating, even if not this. Duca De Thaix represents Gordon Elliott. Chris Cook Happy to report that Noel Fehily and Stormy Ireland, who led for most of the race before falling at the last, are up and OK. Jack Kennedy is only 18, and could be one more win away from being the Festival’s top jockey. Seven wins for Gordon Elliott this week – he draws level with Willie Mullins in the trainers’ race. British trainers combined have just six, and Henderson’s favourite, Apple’s Shakira, didn’t get into that race. It’s a third win of the week for Jack Kennedy, and another win for Gordon Elliott and Gigginstown, by a length from Willie Mullins’ Mr Adjudicator, whose 33-1 shot Sayo comes in third. More Irish domination... 1 Farclas (J W Kennedy) 9-1 2 Mr Adjudicator (P Townend) 8-1 3 Sayo (D E Mullins) 33-1 9 ran | 6-5 Fav Apple’s Shakira 4th Stormy Ireland still leads by a length from Sayo and Farclas, with Mr Adjudicator coming through at a whip... Apple’s Shakira is struggling here – and Stormy Ireland falls at the last! It’s Farclas and Mr Adjudicator racing to the line... Apple’s Shakira edges closer to the leading pair, and is now bunched with Sussex Ranger and Gumball behind Stormy Ireland, setting a lively pace. Sayo is looking to make a move down the outside... Redicean and Mr Adjudicator are close to the back but going well, with Jack Kennedy’s Farclas well placed in midfield down the back straight. All nine horses still in contention... Stormy Ireland and Sussex Ranger make the running with outsiders Sayo and Gumball in touch over the first two... They’re off in the Triumph Hurdle, where Apple’s Shakira is a big favourite in a field of nine four-year-old runners... Before that, there are three races to enjoy – starting with the JCB Triumph Hurdle, in about 10 minutes. Betting latest: Apple’s Shakira 6-5F, Stormy Ireland 6-1, Redicean 13-2, Mr Adjudicator 8-1, Farclas 8-1, Saldier 16-1, Sussex Ranger 25-1, Sayo 33-1, Gumball 40-1 A nine-runner Triumph, who’d have thought we’d see the day? That’s a third of the number who took part when Oh So Risky won back in 1990. Given that Willie Mullins has four of today’s nine, it looks like other trainers are struggling to come up with Triumph contenders. It’s not as though there’s a favourite to be terrified of. Apple’s Shakira is unbeaten and has won here three times but without setting an intimidating standard. Redicean looked slick at Kempton last month but would probably prefer a drier surface. Sussex Ranger will roll through this but could be vulnerable to something quicker. The speed-figure boys will be all over Mr Adjudicator, who won on the same day as Samcro at Leopardstown last month and did so in a faster time. But his stablemate Stormy Ireland appears to be Mullins’s first string. This one hacked up in a maiden hurdle on his only start since leaving France. Chris Cook If you fancy a flutter, here’s Chris Cook’s big race preview, complete with the latest odds: We have no previous Gold Cup winner but we do have a fascinating battle. Might Bite (7-2) is the wayward beast who was going to win the RSA easily last year before nearly throwing it away. He has looked more sensible this year, but hasn’t been back to Cheltenham since then. As the King George winner, he is the form choice. The pace will probably come from Native River (5-1), who tried to make all the running last year, at the end of a busy season. He has had a lighter campaign this time in an attempt to improve on last year’s third. Our Duke (11-2) represents Jessie Harrington, who trained Sizing John to win a year ago. This Irish National winner was last seen beating Presenting Percy, who hosed up in the RSA. Killultagh Vic (9-1), trying to end the Mullins hoodoo in this race, would probably have won the Irish Gold Cup but for falling at the last. Edwulf (16-1), who ran on to win that race, is the ‘miracle’ horse who collapsed last year. His hold-up tactics may give him a lot to do in this big field. Road To Respect (10-1) won Ireland’s Christmas Chase and that form looks excellent in light of Balko Des Flos’s win yesterday. Total Recall (18-1) has been transformed since joining Mullins but must improve again here, and may prefer next month’s Grand National. Definitly Red (9-1) could be the first northern-trained winner for 25 years. He won impressively here in January but the balance of his form says he’s not good enough. American (25-1), second that day, is an able but fragile sort now facing by far his sternest test. Anibale Fly (33-1) was the choice of Barry Geraghty from Jonjo O’Neill’s out-of-form yard, even before Minella Rocco was withdrawn. Djakadam (22-1) tries this for the fourth time, having been second twice. He doesn’t win as often as his talent would suggest and it’s three years since he won beyond two and a half miles. Bachasson (28-1) is a lovely jumper and is an interesting outsider with place possibilities. Outlander (28-1) has not shown his best in three previous visits but this is his ground. Tea For Two (66-1) is top-class in the right circumstances but has not fared well here. Saphir Du Rheu (80-1) ran above himself to be fifth in this last year and it would be a real surprise if he can improve on that now. ITV have just taken us down to the track, where there’s a dramatic difference between the inside and outside over the last few fences. The ground is heavy in places out wide, but close to the rail there’s fresh turf that hasn’t been used all week. There’ll be a big scrap for the right line in the big race. If you’re looking for a romantic story in the big race, look no further than Edwulf. After collapsing last year, it’s a miracle he is here to race again, let alone contending in the Gold Cup – but he won the Irish Gold Cup and is 16-1 to land a fairytale victory: The Gold Cup might be the peak of the week’s racing, but there are still three more chances to find a winner after that, starting with the ‘amateur Gold Cup’, the Foxhunters Chase: 4.10 Foxhunters Chase This is as fiercely contested as the Gold Cup, albeit with not quite so much talent on display, equine or human. That said, Jamie Codd could certainly make it as a professional jockey and his mount, Burning Ambition, is a warm favourite after a good second to a very useful sort last time. Foxrock is a second strong Irish contender who was second in the Irish Gold Cup three years ago. Wonderful Charm (7-1) stayed on stoutly but all too late to be second last year. He might prefer a sounder surface. Grand Vision flopped last year but has had a much happier preparation this time. On The Fringe won this twice but came up short last year and, at 13, is possibly on the decline. Pacha Du Polder won it last year under Bryony Frost but was well below his best on his only run since April. Perhaps odds of 20-1 underestimate his chance of bouncing back. 4.50 Martin Pipe Hurdle The twist to this race is that the jockeys are ‘conditionals’, youngsters still learning their trade. James Bowen, who famously won the Welsh National at the age of 16 in January, rides the favourite, Diese Des Bieffes, whose Lanzarote fifth looks really strong form. The other jockey here you’ll have heard of is Bryony Frost, aboard Brelan D’As, a McManus-owned horse who hasn’t made it as a chaser this winter but could still be really well treated over hurdles. Gordon Elliott targets this race, named after a man he has called his hero, so it is no surprise to see that his four runners include the top three in the weights. Flawless Escape is the most fancied, having been a fine third on his handicap debut behind Total Recall, who was unbeatable at the weights they carried that day. Elliott also has Blow By Blow (14-1), a Grade One bumper winner two years ago who is getting better at hurdles and looks handily treated. 5.30 Grand Annual The last race of the Festival is this two-mile handicap chase, generally a test of speed, though stamina will also be necessary on this gloupy ground. Rock The World (25-1) won it last year on his first start after a wind operation. This has presumably been the plan ever since but he seems unfancied this time. His trainer, Jessie Harrington, also has one of the market-leaders in the McManus-owned Don’t Touch It. His jumping has been a problem but he won on the only occasion he wore cheekpieces, refitted today. North Hill Harvey is good enough and wears first-time cheekpieces but comes from a yard that has been below form in the past fortnight. Theinval is the only runner for Nicky Henderson. This one worked well at Kempton last month with Buveur D’Air and Might Bite, which might seem a fair achievement by the time this race is run. Vanietux has come down the weights half a stone since leaving Henderson for David Pipe. Third in the Supreme in 2014, he has the quality if he can still show it but the Pipe yard has not exactly been flying along this season. Vaniteux has had a breathing operation since he last ran. Our award-winning photographer, Tom Jenkins, has been on the ground all week getting the best shots from the Festival. You can see his gallery here, and more on the picture of Nina Carberry falling at the Chair that won him a World Press Photo award. My personal favourite of his this week doesn’t feature a horse or jockey, but captures the essence of Cheltenham: 2.50 Albert Bartlett The first of three consecutive races that had better be thrilling because, at three miles on this ground, they will go on forever ... and it will seem like forever if your fancy unseats at the first. Nicky Henderson has a fine chance of clawing back a bit of Willie Mullins’s lead in the trainers’ standings, as he has the first two in the betting. Santini (4-1) looks the one, having beaten his stablemate Chef Des Obeaux already, and he also won here in January, beating Black Op, who gave Samcro most to do on Wednesday. But Chef Des Obeaux has won three since his defeat to Santini, which, in all fairness, was his first run of the season, so perhaps he has improved past his rival. For good measure, Henderson has the McManus-owned OK Corral, fourth in the betting, who seems to be improving; he’s only had a handful of runs and is eight years old, so he must have been fragile. OK Corral’s mum is a sister to Tidal Bay, who some of you may remember as a moody, extravagantly talented chaser who won some big races and refused to play ball in others. The most fancied Irish runner is Chris’s Dream, from the yard of Henry de Bromhead, who had a winner yesterday. De Bromhead got this horse from a lower-profile trainer in January and immediately got significant improvement out of him. Mullins and Elliott are not represented among the market-leaders, which is probably a mistake on the market’s part. Dortmund Park has won two of his four runs for Elliott and has had a wind op since his defeat last month, so we may see him take a step forward. Betting movers and shakers There were three horses within half a point of each other at the top of the Gold Cup betting this morning, but Might Bite has been much the strongest in the early exchanges and he is now no better than 7-2 (from 9-2) to complete a unique treble for Nicky Henderson. Native River, last year’s Hennessy and Welsh National winner, is out to 11-2 (from 5-1), while Our Duke is now a 6-1 chance (from 11-2). There has been plenty of money too for another of Henderson’s runners: Apple’s Shakira, the favourite for the opening race, the Triumph Hurdle. A 7-4 chance overnight, she is now no better than 6-4, with plenty of bookies showing 5-4 and 6-5. Bleu Et Rouge, who took the Grade One Deloitte Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown in 2016, is solid favourite for the County Handicap Hurdle, and has a broadly similar profile to Arctic Fire, Willie Mullins’s 20-1 winner of the race 12 months ago. He was a 10-1 chance overnight, but is now in to 17-2. If you’re dropping on the Festival for the first time today, catch up with the state of play – it’s been a very good week for Willie Mullins, and Ireland in general: And why not sign up for The Recap, our weekly roundup email, while you’re here: 90 minutes until we get started. Excited? Here’s Chris Cook with previews for the day’s first two races: 1.30 Triumph Hurdle A nine-runner Triumph, who’d have thought we’d see the day? That’s a third of the number who took part when Oh So Risky won back in 1990. Given that Willie Mullins has four of today’s nine, it looks like other trainers are struggling to come up with Triumph contenders. It’s not as though there’s a favourite to be terrified of. Apple’s Shakira is unbeaten and has won here three times but without setting an intimidating standard. Redicean looked slick at Kempton last month but would probably prefer a drier surface. Sussex Ranger will roll through this but could be vulnerable to something quicker. The speed-figure boys will be all over Mr Adjudicator (8-1), who won on the same day as Samcro at Leopardstown last month and did so in a faster time. But his stablemate Stormy Ireland appears to be Mullins’s first string, judging by the fact that Ruby Walsh was booked to ride before getting injured. This one hacked up in a maiden hurdle on his only start since leaving France. 2.10 County Hurdle Even in this mud, we might see a modicum of pace in this two-mile handicap hurdle, which sometimes features horses who could win at the highest level. Indeed, one of today’s runners, Ivanovich Gorbatov, already has, having bagged the Triumph a couple of years ago, though he has been unable to build on that. His owner, JP McManus, has a more obvious chance with the topweight, Bleu Et Rouge, who was a fine second in the Betfair Hurdle behind Kalashnikov, who went so close in Tuesday’s Supreme. Bleu Et Rouge travelled like the winner for a long way that day and may do so again, but it’s a pity he was raised 8lb for that. He’s trained by Willie Mullins, winner of this race four times in eight years, and Mullins has other excellent chances with Meri Devie (14-1), who skipped the Mares Hurdle to come here, and Whiskey Sour, who won a Grade One at Christmas when two stablemates fell at the last. Flying Tiger won the Fred Winter last year and turned in a career best last month in his prep for this; he can win something off his present rating, even if not this. Duca De Thaix represents Gordon Elliott and has a tongue tie fitted for this handicap debut. He was a bit disappointing last time but can do better. Mulins and Elliott fined for late non-runners A snippet from the stewards’ room relating to yesterday’s racing: Willie Mullins not only took over as the most successful trainer in Festival history, he also picked up a £500 fine over the late scratching of Douvan from the Ryanair Chase, following his fall at the fourth-last in Wednesday’s Champion Chase. Gordon Elliott, meanwhile, was also fined £500 under the same rule, as he left Apple’s Jade, who ran in Tuesday’s Mares Hurdle, in the Stayers’ Hurdle until after the 9am deadline for scratchings. Douvan and Apple’s Jade were both taken out at around 9.40am on a “self certificate” from their trainer – a system that that has come under some scrutiny in recent months thanks to the high rate of self-certified non-runners from some stables. The stewards, however, decided that “The self certificate for Douvan was not acceptable … as it was not made without delay as required by Rule (F)97. A fixed penalty of £500 was imposed on W.P. Mullins as Douvan was declared a non-runner after 9 a.m. on the day of declaration.” An identical notice was issued regarding Elliott and Apple’s Jade. The final declarations for all the races at this year’s Festival have been made at the 48-hour stage, but while there are rules in place to stop double declarations in the novice races, these do not apply to the six non-novice Grade One events. Mullins was perfectly within his rights to declare Douvan for the Ryanair, and also to take him out on Thursday morning, as was also the case for Elliott. The problem is that they did not do it quickly enough, and so both horses were, technically at least, still in the race and therefore the betting for several hours, on one of the busiest betting days of the year. No-one can have seriously expected Douvan to run in the Ryanair after his spill on Wednesday, and ITV’s betting ring pundit Matt Chapman said on Twitter on Thursday morning that according to Rich Ricci, Douvan’s owner, the horse was already back in Mullins’s yard in County Carlow. The continued presence of both horses in most betting lists, though – and Douvan would have been a solid second-favourite for the Ryanair on form – must have exerted at least a slight drag on overall turnover, and therefore has probably cost racing some money. Punters who took prices about other runners before Douvan and Apple’s Jade were officially ruled out will also have suffered a Rule 4 deduction from any winnings. Mullins was apparently a little annoyed about being called in front of the stewards yesterday, but in the circumstances, neither trainer can really have much cause for complaint. British trainers have been left behind by their Irish rivals this week – Ireland are already guaranteed to have more winners, with an entire day to go. Lambourn’s Nicky Henderson has also lost ground to Closutton’s Willie Mullins, who overtook Henderson as the Festival’s most successful ever trainer with six wins to two this week. That said, the two that the Englishman did win were the Champion Hurdle and Champion Chase – and he has the Gold Cup favourite in Might Bite. If Henderson were to land an unprecedented treble, and leave Mullins still searching for his first Gold Cup, he can snatch a significant victory from the jaws of defeat. If you’re unfortunate enough to have a Twitter account, you can cast your vote for the greatest Gold Cup moment: Top jockeys after day three Davy Russell 4 wins; Jack Kennedy 3; Paul Townend, Ruby Walsh 2; Noel Fehily Barry Geraghty, Brian Hughes, Lizzie Kelly, Patrick Mullins, Nico De Boinville, Keith Donoghue, Katie Walsh, Mark Walsh, Noel McParlan one win A hat-trick in the space of four races yesterday propelled Russell to the top of our standings and he also leads Kennedy on a countback of second places (by one to none), so things are looking good for him. Either way, this looks like being the first Festival for 11 years at which the top jockey was neither Walsh nor Barry Geraghty. The 38-year-old Russell has never been top jockey here and would surely love to have that title just once. Top jockey betting: 1-4 Russell, 5-1 Kennedy, 16-1 Townend Top trainers after day three Willie Mullins 7 wins, Gordon Elliott 6, Nicky Henderson 2; Tom George, Mick Channon, Nick Williams, Pat Kelly, Henry De Bromhead, Warren Greatrex one win Bet Bright Cup: Ireland 15, Britain 6 So Mullins has become the most successful trainer in Festival history, though he probably needs another winner today to hold onto that title until next year because he’s only one ahead of Nicky Henderson. The race to be this year’s top trainer will be closely fought between him and Elliott, again, and my first tip for next year is that the same thing will happen in 2019. Last year, the two had 12 winners between them over the four days. This time, they’re up to 13 with a whole day left to go. Top trainer betting: 1-8 Mullins, 8-1 Elliott, 25-1 Henderson Non-runners 2.10: I Shot The Sheriff, Brahms De Clermont, Krugermac 3.30: Shantou Flyer, Double Shuffle, Minella Rocco 4.50: Amour de Nuit 5.30: The Game Changer The going It remains soft, heavy in places but fresh patches of turf have been opened up for Gold Cup day: This picture illustrates just how dramatic the difference is between the old and new ground: We have no previous winner but we do have a fascinating battle between 15 sturdy types and none can be ruled out with real confidence. Might Bite is the wayward beast who was going to win the RSA easily last year before hanging horribly to his right and nearly throwing it away. He has looked more sensible this year, but then he hasn’t been back to Cheltenham since then. As the King George winner, he is the form choice. The pace will probably come from Native River, who tried to make all the running last year, at the end of a busy season. He has had a lighter campaign this time in an attempt to improve on last year’s third. Our Duke represents Jessie Harrington, who trained Sizing John to win a year ago. This Irish National winner was last seen beating Presenting Percy, who hosed up in the RSA on Wednesday. Killultagh Vic, trying to end the Mullins hoodoo in this race (the trainer has had six seconds and no winners), would probably have won the Irish Gold Cup but for falling at the last. Edwulf, who ran on to win that race, is the ‘miracle’ horse who collapsed and was thought to have died at the last Festival. His hold-up tactics may give him a lot to do in this big field. Road To Respect won Ireland’s Christmas Chase and that form looks excellent in light of Balko Des Flos’s win here yesterday. Total Recall has been transformed since joining Mullins but must improve again to take a hand here. He is thought to be on his way to a tilt at next month’s Grand National. Definitly Red tries to be the first northern-trained winner for a quarter of a century. He won impressively here in January but that will have taken a bit out of him and the balance of his form says he’s not good enough. American, second to him that day, is a fragile sort now facing by far his sternest test, but with unplumbed reserves of ability. Minella Rocco has become a non-runner this morning, Jonjo O’Neill’s yard saying the ground is a concern. Realistically, stable form must also be a concern; O’Neill’s horses have rarely shown their best this winter. Anibale Fly was the choice of Barry Geraghty even before Minella Rocco was withdrawn, an intriguing decision. Djakadam tries this for the fourth time, having been second twice. He doesn’t win as often as his talent would suggest and it’s three years since he won at a distance beyond two and a half miles. Bachasson is a lovely jumper who stays better as he strengthens and is an interesting outsider with place possibilities, for all that this is a big ask. Outlander has not shown his best in three previous visits to Cheltenham but this is his ground. Tea For Two is top-class in the right circumstances but prefers right-handed tracks and has not fared well here. Saphir Du Rheu ran above himself to be fifth in this last year and it would be a real surprise if he can improve on that now. His only win since 2015 came at Kelso. Shantou Flyer and Double Shuffle have also become non-runners this morning. Morning all! The greatest show on turf concludes with another action-packed day and the feature race of the week – the Gold Cup. One of jump racing’s biggest prizes is very much up for grabs – might it be Might Bite? Is Our Duke your pick, or maybe Definitly Red?. You don’t have to decide just yet. Take a break from studying the form, with Tom Jenkins’ lovely gallery from the week so far: 1.30 Triumph Hurdle Mr Adjudicator 8-1 2.10 County Hurdle Meri Devie 14-1 2.50 Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle Santini 4-1 3.30 Cheltenham Gold Cup Might Bite 9-2 4.10 Foxhunter Chase Wonderful Charm 7-1 4.50 Martin Pipe Handicap Hurdle Blow By Blow 14-1 5.30 Grand Annual Handicap Chase Rock The World 25-1 The recipe for success this week has been Irish trainers or Nicky Henderson and I’m pleased, on reflection, to see that I’ve basically stuck to that formula for the Festival’s final day. The exception is the tip for Paul Nicholls’s Wonderful Charm in the Foxhunter Chase, a race the trainer has won three times and which the horse should possibly have won last year. Otherwise, this is another two for W Mullins, followed by another two for N Henderson and rounding off with one each for G Elliott and J Harrington. Other trainers: if it was possible to give you winners by simply willing it, I would do so. It’s not been a big week for shocks, despite expectations that the deep ground might throw up some surprises. Wednesday’s card ended with winners at 33-1 and 25-1 but those were as big as they were because their trainers (Elliott and Mullins, inevitably) had more fancied horses in the race. As you may recall, I had a slosh at a 100-1 shot yesterday but it was given a frankly dispiriting ride, settled comfortably in last until it was far too late, then passing half the field from the home turn. Today’s selections are more orthodox. You can read my in-depth analysis here. Congratulations to Killkennyben, who won Thursday’s competition on a final score of +24, thanks to Penhill, Missed Approach and Balko Des Flos. 10CNewton went close on +19. You could win a £100 account credit from Betfair by proving your tipping prowess on today’s races. All you have to do is give us your selections for all of today’s races at Cheltenham. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional stakes of £1 at starting price on each tip. Non-runners count as losers. Please post all your tips in a single posting, using the comment facility below, before the first race at 1.30pm. There are seven races at Cheltenham today and you must post a single selection for each race. Our usual terms and conditions, which you can read here, will apply, except that this will be a strictly one-day thing. If we get a tie after all the races have been run, the winner will be the one who posted their tips earliest out of those with the highest score. If an entrant has to repost their selections because of a non-runner, we will use the time of their later posting for tiebreak purposes. If you don’t win today … despair! This is your last chance until Royal Ascot to win a prize through us. Sifting through the field for a Gold Cup in search of the best stories could be seen as a slightly cynical way for a journalist to approach the most prestigious race of the National Hunt season. But the fact of it is, we all do it, because deadlines are deadlines, and if you fail to prepare, you are preparing to fail. And the good news for racing fans and reporters alike is that this year’s race scores very highly on the Story-ometer. Among the runners at 20-1 or shorter, we have Edwulf, a horse that seemed to have collapsed and died on the run-in 12 months ago, and also Might Bite, who got halfway up the hill in last year’s RSA Chase and then decided that walking was better than running. If Might Bite wins, meanwhile, he will complete an unprecedented treble for his trainer Nicky Henderson in the Festival’s most prestigious races. But if Willie Mullins could land the spoils with one of his four runners, it would cement his new status as the meeting’s most successful trainer, and dispense with the “best trainer in history that hasn’t won a Gold Cup” tag which is becoming a bit of a burden. Mullins has sent almost two dozen horses to the Gold Cup without success, and seen six finish as runner-up, including On His Own, who went down by a short-head to Lord Windermere four years ago and could – perhaps should – have got the race in the stewards’ room. Jessica Harrington, on the other hand, won with her first runner 12 months ago, when Sizing John landed the spoils, and has a good chance to maintain her 100pc record in the race with Our Duke. Given Mullins’s frustrating series of near-misses, that would be quite a story too. So it is all set up for a compelling race at 3.30 this afternoon, and with the bookies currently offering 9-2 the field, it promises to be one of the most open and competitive races of recent years too. Three runners – Might Bite, Our Duke and Colin Tizzard’s Native River, a mud-loving front-runner who will make it a real test – are within half a point of each other at the top of the market, while Killultagh Vic, the pick of Mullins’s squad, could easily be a pre-race steamer. There are two non-runners in the big race field. Last year’s runner-up, Minella Rocco, has been ruled out by trainer Jonjo O’Neill, who is having a poor season by his standards and has saddled only two runners so far this week – one fell and the other was pulled up. Double Shuffle, the runner-up behind Might Bite in the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day, is also an absentee. The gates will be open in half an hour, and a sell-out crowd of 70,000 is converging on a Gloucestershire spa town for one of the great days in British sport.

The rest of us shouldn't","bodyText":"The rapid rise of oligarchy and wealth and income inequality is the great moral, economic, and political issue of our time. Yet, it gets almost no coverage from the corporate media. How often do network newscasts report on the 40 million Americans living in poverty, or that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation on earth? How often does the media discuss the reality that our society today is more unequal than at any time since the 1920s with the top 0.1% now owning almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%? How often have you heard the media report the stories of millions of people who today are working longer hours for lower wages than was the case some 40 years ago? How often has ABC, CBS or NBC discussed the role that the Koch brothers and other billionaires play in creating a political system which allows the rich and the powerful to significantly control elections and the legislative process in Congress? Sadly, the answer to these questions is: almost never. The corporate media has failed to let the American people fully understand the economic forces shaping their lives and causing many of them to work two or three jobs, while CEOs make hundreds of times more than they do. Instead, day after day, 24/7, we’re inundated with the relentless dramas of the Trump White House, Stormy Daniels, and the latest piece of political gossip. We urgently need to discuss the reality of today’s economy and political system, and fight to create an economy that works for everyone and not just the one percent. We need to ask the hard questions that the corporate media fails to ask: who owns America, and who has the political power? Why, in the richest country in the history of the world are so many Americans living in poverty? What are the forces that have caused the American middle class, once the envy of the world, to decline precipitously? What can we learn from countries that have succeeded in reducing income and wealth inequality, creating a strong and vibrant middle class, and providing basic human services to everyone? We need to hear from struggling Americans whose stories are rarely told in newspapers or television. Unless we understand the reality of life in America for working families, we’re never going to change that reality. Until we understand that the rightwing Koch brothers are more politically powerful than the Republican National Committee, and that big banks, pharmaceutical companies, and multinational corporations are spending unlimited sums of money to rig the political process, we won’t be able to overturn the disastrous US supreme court decision on Citizens United, move to the public funding of elections and end corporate greed. Until we understand that the US federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and that people cannot make it on $9 or $10 an hour, we’re not going to be able to pass a living wage of at least $15 an hour. Until we understand that multinational corporations have been writing our trade and tax policies for the past 40 years to allow them to throw American workers out on the street and move to low-wage countries, we’re not going to be able to enact fair laws ending the race to the bottom and making the wealthy and the powerful pay their fair share. Until we understand that we live in a highly competitive global economy and that it is counterproductive that millions of our people cannot afford a higher education or leave school deeply in debt, we will not be able to make public colleges and universities tuition free. Until we understand that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all and that we spend far more per capita on healthcare than does any other country, we’re not going to be able to pass a Medicare for all, single-payer program. Until we understand that the US pays, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs because pharmaceutical companies can charge whatever price they want for life-saving medicine, we’re not going to be able to lower the outrageous price of these drugs. Until we understand that climate change is real, caused by humans, and causing devastating problems around the world, especially for poor people, we’re not going to be able to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into sustainable forms of energy. We need to raise political consciousness in America and help us move forward with a progressive agenda that meets the needs of our working families. It’s up to us all to join the conversation – it’s just the beginning.

Pretoria summoned Canberra’s high commissioner over Dutton’s remarks, which also included a description of white farmers facing “horrific circumstances”, a characterisation South Africa has rejected. “The South African government is offended by the statements which have been attributed to the Australian home affairs minister and a full retraction is expected,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. Commenting this week on a documentary about violent rural crime in South Africa, Dutton said the farmers deserved “special attention”. “I do think, on the information that I’ve seen, people do need help and they need help from a civilised country like ours,” Dutton said. He also pointed to plans by new president Cyril Ramaphosa to allow expropriation of land as a solution to the massive land ownership inequalities that remain more than two decades after the end of apartheid. On Friday the foreign minister Julie Bishop said Australia’s high commission has “regular discussions” with the South African government and urged it to ensure the security of its citizens. Changes to land ownership should not be “disruptive to the economy nor lead to violence”, she told ABC’s Radio National. Bishop said Australia closely monitors the murder rate and was “very concerned that there were 19,000 murders reported in South Africa in 2017”. Asked if the farmers should get special visas, Bishop said Australia had an existing offshore humanitarian visa program for which people claiming to be displaced by persecution, including in South Africa, could apply. “All claims for humanitarian visa entry into Australia are assessed on their merits, so I’m working with the home affairs minister to ascertain if any changes are needed to our existing offshore humanitarian visa program.” Gareth Newham at the Institute for Security Studies, one of South Africa’s leading authorities on crime statistics, said there was no evidence to support the notion that white farmers were targeted more than anyone else. He said: “In fact, young black males living in poor urban areas like Khayelitsha and Lange face a far greater risk of being murdered. The murder rate there is between 200 and 300 murders per 100,000 people.” The highest estimates of farm murders stand at 133 per 100,000 people, and that includes both black and white murder victims. Fact-checking organisation Africa Check, in a detailed report on the subject of farm murders in general – not just of white farmers – suggested that another credible estimate of the farm murder rate could be as low as 0.4 murders per 100,000 people. But it too concluded that an accurate figure is “near impossible” to determine due to a lack of evidence. Speaking to parliament this week, Ramaphosa said South Africa was not heading down the road towards the type of violent and chaotic seizure of white-owned farms that triggered economic collapse in Zimbabwe nearly 20 years ago. “We cannot have a situation where we allow land grabs, because that is anarchy,” Ramaphosa said. “We cannot have a situation of anarchy when we have proper constitutional means through which we can work to give land to our people.” Afriforum, a rights group that mainly represents the views of the white Afrikaner minority, describes being a white farmer as one of the most dangerous jobs in the country, saying a white farmer is twice as likely to be murdered as a police officer, and four times as likely as a private citizen. The government denies that white people are deliberately targeted and says farm murders are part of South Africa’s wider violent crime problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/16/trump-cabinet-rich-men-carson-mnuchin","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T15:22:49Z","webTitle":"Minted: the rich guys in Trump's cabinet who can't resist public money","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/16/trump-cabinet-rich-men-carson-mnuchin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/16/trump-cabinet-rich-men-carson-mnuchin","fields":{"headline":"Minted: the rich guys in Trump's cabinet who can't resist public money","bodyText":"The revelation that the US housing secretary, Ben Carson, and his wife selected a $31,000 dining set for his office at taxpayer expense has caused outrage. But Carson is far from alone among Donald Trump’s cabinet in causing controversy over use of public money. Here are the most high-profile examples. Ben Carson The housing and urban development (Hud) secretary had managed to keep his head down, more or less, since being put in charge of the sprawling department that deals with America’s under-funded public housing stock. But things changed for the ex-brain-surgeon last month when it emerged that Hud had agreed to spend $165,000 on “lounge furniture” for its Washington headquarters, in addition to a $31,000 dining set selected by Carson and his wife for his office. News of the expensive decor spending emerged after the Guardian revealed that a senior Hud employee had complained of facing retaliation after she said the budget broke the law. She said she had been told: “$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair.” The report emerged as the administration was proposing to cut $6.8bn, or 14%, of Hud’s annual budget. Steve Mnuchin The treasury secretary, a former Wall Street executive and Hollywood producer who is worth as much as $35m, managed to run up bills in excess of $800,000 in his first six months in office for travel on military jets. It’s true that Mnuchin withdrew a request for a US air force jet for his honeymoon in Scotland, France and Italy, after marrying the Scottish actor Louise Linton last summer at the Trump International hotel near the White House. But the damage to his reputation was already done – not least by a picture of Linton descending from a government plane the couple had taken to Kentucky, where Mnuchin visited Fort Knox and they viewed the solar eclipse. After the trip, Mnuchin’s wife caused a brouhaha when she posted a picture of herself on Instagram exiting the government aircraft with her husband, noting her designer clothing and accessories. “Great #daytrip to #Kentucky!” Linton wrote, listing #rolandmouret, #hermesscarf, #tomford sunnies, #valentino. When a woman from Oregon commented online: “Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable”, Linton responded: “Aw!!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?” Treasury officials have defended the travel and the department’s inspector general has said it was within the law. Scott Pruitt The environment secretary has said he has to travel first-class because of threats from members of the public who object to his climate-change-denying, regulation-slashing mission in government. Last summer he flew first-class on the short hop from Washington to New York for brief media appearances after pulling America out of the Paris climate agreement. But last week he said he was considering flying in the back of the plane, despite having complained of “unprecedented” threats and “incidents” on planes and in airports after he was appointed. One person yelled: “Scott Pruitt, you’re fucking up the environment,” an EPA staffer told CNN, although this was apparently at the airport in Atlanta, rather than in a plane. He also spent as much as $43,000 on a soundproof “privacy booth” inside his office to prevent eavesdropping on his phone calls and $9,000 for biometric locks and to have his office swept for listening devices. Earlier this month it was reported that he used $6,500 in public money to hire a private media firm with strong Republican ties to help produce a report promoting his accomplishments. David Shulkin The secretary of veterans affairs, who joined the department during the Obama administration, is reportedly wobbling on his perch over complaints that he asked a member of his security detail to accompany him to a branch of Home Depot, the home improvements chain, and then obliged the person to carry his furniture purchases into his home for him. Last month, the inspector general released a blistering report finding ethical violations in Shulkin’s trip last July to Denmark and Britain that mixed business with pleasure, including a trip to Wimbledon and a cruise down the Thames. Ryan Zinke The interior secretary is from Montana, deep in cowboy country, and is famous for riding into Washington on his horse Tonto to take up his post. But when he wanted to go riding with the vice-president, Mike Pence, he took a government-funded helicopter – one of three such journeys in 2017 that cost a total of $53,000 of public money. In addition, Zinke, who is in favor of oil, gas, coal and uranium extraction on spectacular public wilderness lands out west, took a charter flight to the US Virgin Islands. He has been rebuked by the department watchdog for failing to keep proper records of his travel expenses and to show clearly who paid for his wife to accompany him on work trips. Tom Price The health and human services secretary was forced to resign last September following revelations that he used at least $400,000 and probably more than $1m in taxpayer funds on private and military flights for himself and his staff. As a Georgia congressman, Price was a fiscal conservative, railing against the use of private jets by members of Congress. Lawmakers are normally expected to use commercial flights. When Trump told reporters “I’m not happy, OK?” about Price’s spending, it was the death knell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2018/mar/16/pre-chopped-onions-arent-pointless-if-you-cant-hold-a-knife","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"Pre-chopped onions aren't pointless if you can't hold a knife","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2018/mar/16/pre-chopped-onions-arent-pointless-if-you-cant-hold-a-knife","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2018/mar/16/pre-chopped-onions-arent-pointless-if-you-cant-hold-a-knife","fields":{"headline":"Pre-chopped onions aren't pointless if you can't hold a knife","bodyText":"This week, the Office for National Statistics has added ready-made mashed potato to the UK’s official shopping basket, which it uses to measure inflation, and people are up in arms. Who buys a pre-chopped onion that costs three times as much as a whole one? How lazy do you have to be to choose a frozen omelette over a couple of eggs? These kinds of convenience foods are an easy target. But for the 13.3 million people in Britain with disabilities – and those living with arthritis, chronic illness, recovering from injury or surgery, or undergoing cancer treatment – convenience foods aren’t just convenient: they are a lifeline. This is an issue close to my heart. I’m a professional cook, but I also have a chronic pain condition, and there are occasions when I can’t even hold a knife. In times like those, I’m never going to opt for the impenetrable whole butternut squash over one that has already been diced for me. This isn’t a problem easily solved by the right kitchen equipment. Sometimes, I am so depleted that all the gel-grip handles, lowered work surfaces and safety mats in the world couldn’t help me prepare a dinner from scratch. Most of the time, I’m well enough to cook, which makes me comparatively lucky. But when I tweeted about this topic, a woman having chemotherapy got in touch. For her, ready-meals and prepped veg are the difference between eating and not eating: she is too tired to cook, but she knows she needs to maintain her weight. Other people are working multiple jobs, or raising children on their own. For a hundred different reasons, convenience matters. Katie Squire, product developer at M&amp;S, told me its pre-prepared fruit and veg are for “time-pressed” customers, who “are seeking meals for themselves and their families that are quick and convenient to prepare, as well as being healthy”. Fair enough, I say. So, does food you prepare yourself taste better? Often, yes: I’m willing to bet that a frozen omelette doesn’t compare with the one I whip up at home. But a pre-diced onion tastes the same. It may be more expensive, but, sometimes, I don’t have a choice. Of course, there are real problems with many of our convenience foods. They often come wrapped in a huge amount of plastic – you may recall the brouhaha over cauliflower steaks. In that case, M&amp;S paled in the face of public outrage, and discontinued the product. I would much rather it had redesigned it. After all, my unmashed potatoes are often available in non-recyclable plastic sacks; my chicken thighs are wrapped in plastic on the shelf, and yet more plastic by the person at the checkout. This problem is endemic to our supermarket culture. So let’s direct our ire at the people who can effect real change. Let’s demand our supermarkets find better solutions, and hold the government to account when it doesn’t follow through on promises to curb plastic waste. It may not be as convenient as blaming convenience foods, but this is somewhere we shouldn’t be taking shortcuts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/16/dulwich-hamlet-rio-ferdinand-sadiq-khan-community-football-property-developers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T10:22:57Z","webTitle":"Why Rio Ferdinand and Sadiq Khan are playing for Dulwich Hamlet | Hugo Greenhalgh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/dulwich-hamlet-rio-ferdinand-sadiq-khan-community-football-property-developers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/dulwich-hamlet-rio-ferdinand-sadiq-khan-community-football-property-developers","fields":{"headline":"Why Rio Ferdinand and Sadiq Khan are playing for Dulwich Hamlet","bodyText":"Take a walk down south London’s Lordship Lane, past East Dulwich station and up Dog Kennel Hill, and you’ll come across a sorry sight. Tucked away next to the Sainsbury’s lies a barricaded football stadium, festooned with threatening “Trespassers will be prosecuted” signs. Until recently, this was home to one of the country’s oldest and most popular non-league clubs, Dulwich Hamlet. Just weeks ago, games at the Hamlet’s Champion Hill stadium attracted thousands of fans to a family-friendly environment, and a club with an actively anti-racist, anti-homophobic stance and a genuine interest in the community. Yet today Dulwich find themselves evicted from their stadium – which is at the centre of a bitter battle between the property developers Meadow, who own their ground and wish to build on it, and the local council, Southwark. Meadow’s proposal for development was rejected by Southwark because it fell short of the council’s 35% target for affordable housing. Meadow’s response was petulant. It dropped its financial support for the club, saddled Dulwich with a £121,000 rent bill and, just last week, evicted the club. For now, Dulwich play eight miles down the road at Tooting &amp; Mitcham United, their local rivals, who have kindly offered them use of their ground. Public representatives have rallied to back Dulwich’s cause. In parliament, Helen Hayes, the local MP, will lead an adjournment debate today on Dulwich’s situation and the wider importance of football within the community. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, and the Labour peer Lord Kennedy have also been instrumental in raising the profile of their plight and condemning Meadow’s actions. For its part, Meadow said that the eviction “follows repeated breaches of the licence by the club, together with unwarranted personal attacks on the company, which has funded the club for a number of years and without which the club would not have survived as long as it has”. Whatever the merits of the affair, it’s a situation that’s becoming all too familiar. When a football club is struggling, the property development vultures circle. What’s more worrying is that Dulwich are a genuinely well-recognised boon for the community, which has actively supported local causes such as food banks and workers’ rights campaigns. If a club such as Dulwich is allowed to fold, it could happen to anyone – and their situation is far from unique. Up and down the country clubs are in jeopardy as developers make land grabs for sites that are often in desirable locations in inner cities with good transport links. It would be easy to blame local councils for their complacency but their hands have been tied by years of vicious budget cuts from central government. Last week the National Audit Office reported that local councils are at financial breaking point due to austerity. The lack of affordable housing is a colossal problem in the UK, and the recent furore surrounding the Haringey Development Vehicle highlights how difficult it can be to solve, even for Labour councils. It’s undoubtedly something that needs to be addressed, but without jeopardising the future of essential community assets such as football clubs. The backbones of our communities require investment and love to do their work, be they libraries, hospitals or children’s centres. As these institutions are starved of resources, football clubs become rare social hubs where communities can congregate and organise. They have become one of the last bastions of community spirit. It was not so long ago that Margaret Thatcher marginalised football fans, treating them as the lowest of the low. Yet many now realise the value of football. Southwark council made a bold statement on Wednesday, with a unanimous vote in favour of an application to purchase the land from Meadow and build social housing on the site of a current car park. This may not be the end of the issue – Meadow has already rejected a £10m bid from Rio Ferdinand’s affordable housing foundation, Legacy – but could ramp up enough pressure to avoid the last resort of a compulsory purchase order. Until they can return to Champion Hill, the fight goes on for Dulwich. The fan action group Save DHFC has organised a march from nearby Goose Green to the ground tomorrow, at 12:30pm. Fans of bigger neighbours Millwall, Crystal Palace and Charlton have pledged their support, knowing that if Dulwich were to lose their ground for good, it could become the thin end of a very large wedge. • Hugo Greenhalgh co-hosts a Dulwich Hamlet podcast, Forward the Hamlet"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/16/country-diary-wheatears-on-both-sides-of-their-migratory-journey","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T04:30:10Z","webTitle":"Country diary: wheatears on both sides of their migratory journey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/16/country-diary-wheatears-on-both-sides-of-their-migratory-journey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/16/country-diary-wheatears-on-both-sides-of-their-migratory-journey","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: wheatears on both sides of their migratory journey","bodyText":"One of the first summer migrants to grace the Highland moors is the wheatear, a dressy little insectivorous “chat” so often seen at the roadside, and instantly identified by its white arse as it flits delicately to the next perch, never very far away. Just how “white arse” evolved into “wheat ear” over the centuries is a mystery to me. It has nothing to do with wheat or ears and everything to do with its flashy white rump. I was in northern Uganda on the South Sudan border in February, where wintering wheatears were abundant, already in breeding plumage, looking exactly the same as they do when they arrive here: the males dapper in black and silver-grey, rose pink at the throat, and that giveaway bob of Persil white – altogether unmistakable. Their endearing habit of perching atop a boulder, almost always confidingly close, makes Oenanthe oenanthe easy to spot and quick to identify. My wife and I felt a twinge of home and a premature gleam of the Highland spring as we fought off flocks of absurdly gaudy red-breasted bee-eaters, dazzlingly iridescent scarlet-chested sunbirds, and the constantly bickering village weavers (Ploceus cucullatus) in bright ochre and black masks. Their intricately woven nests dangled like Christmas tree baubles from the branches of the ebuli figs (Ficus ovata) that surrounded our camp. Strangely, among all that super-abundance of fabulous birdlife – Uganda boasts more than a thousand species – the wheatears held their own. Driving through semi-arid savannah and sere grasslands, we often stopped to admire their familiar pert stances on rocks and their short, flickering flights to the next nearby vantage point, exactly as they do here in our glen. We wondered how they would fare on the 4,000-mile migration across the Sahel and the Med, up through Spain and France to the windswept moors of home, theirs and ours, where they will breed. We got there in a matter of hours, of course, but it wasn’t long before they made it too. I saw my first welcome white arse in March, but none since.

It was these screams, and finding herself – a 25-year-old navy nurse – part of an “unconscionable military machine” that fixed men up only to send them straight back into bloody battle, that drove her to one of the great acts of anti-Vietnam war defiance. In 1968, Schnall hired a small plane with a pilot friend and showered 20,000 flyers over five army bases San Franscico, including the docked warship the USS Ranger, urging GIs to join an anti-war demonstration two days later. “I knew that the airforce was dropping flyers on the Vietnamese urging them to get away from the bombing and the spraying of Agent Orange, and I thought, ‘if the United States can do that there, why can’t we do that here?” said Schnall. Her anti-war statement, like so many that came after it, did not come without sacrifice. She was court martialled and sentenced to six months hard labour – though in the end never served her sentence. Schnall is just one of the dozen of veterans who are visiting Vietnam for the opening of an exhibition that honours the almost-forgotten yet pivotal role that active duty servicemen men and women played in the anti-war movement. Schnall is one of many who feature in the exhibition, held at the War Remnants museum in the former South Vietnam capital, Ho Chi Minh City. A picture of her leading the GI anti-war march days before she was court martialled will hang in pride of place, alongside newsletters, posters and handwritten letters and photographs, most of which have never been exhibited. While the stereotypical image of the Vietnam anti-war protester is hippies on campus, flowers in hand, by 1968 every major demonstration was actually led by active-duty officers. Most had returned so horrified by what they had seen and done, they became the most vocal and forceful voices in the anti-war movement. The exhibition, titled Waging Peace, opens in the midst of the 50th anniversary of the Tet Offensive – a brutal turning point in the war – and will travel to Notre Dame University in the US after Vietnam. Waging Peace has been curated by Ron Carver, who worked alongside active GIs and servicemen in the anti-war movement from 1968. For Carver and the GIs involved, telling this story in Vietnam was essential and at the exhibition opening on 19 March the US veterans will meet with their Vietnamese counterparts. Patriotic duty, then a sense of betrayal Carver helped in the network of coffeehouses, the beating heart of the anti war-movement, which were casual gathering spaces set up near army bases in the US (an estimated 300 existed across the US). Here, disaffected servicemen and army personnel would share stories of how they had become convinced the invasion was, as Carver described it, “a cruel, terrible thing,” “A lot of these soldiers felt very angry,” said Carver. “Many of them had volunteered to go into the military thinking it was a patriotic and righteous thing to do, and when they went over there and saw the Vietnamese population did not want us, saw the brutality and the war crimes that our country was committing, they felt very betrayed and were highly, highly motivated to develop resistance.” It was not just conversation that came out of these coffeehouses. They were the hubs of the underground newspapers that proliferated during the war, filled with firsthand accounts from GIs of brutality from the frontline and telling a truth the government and the military tried to suppress. It was often a DIY operation by the GIs who would put the newspapers together by hand and then photocopy them. They form a focal part of the exhibition. It is thought there were more than 5,000 underground newspapers at the height of the anti-war movement. In San Francisco, The Ally newspaper, which came out monthly, printed up to 20,000 copies each time, and they shipped batches of 100 to the soldiers in Vietnam, where they were a core part of the discord that erupted across military bases. The military fought back against the coffeehouses as best it could, using police to shut down them down and punishing GIs if they were found in possession of newspapers. They were even investigated by the FBI and, in Fort Dix, the coffeehouse was bombed by vigilantes. Yet the army came down heaviest on those whose anti-war statements were made in public defiance of orders. Among those honoured by the exhibition are the “Fort Hood Three”, a trio of soldiers who were drafted and trained but refused to report for duty in 1966. It landed them with a court martial and a three-year jail sentence, but as newspapers and posters in the exhibition reveal, they were also made into martyrs by the GI anti-war movement. “ I really began to identify with the struggle of the Vietnamese people and I began to admire them,” said JJ Johnson, one of the Fort Hood 3. “And the strength to resist grew from the knowledge. I realised, ‘to hell with them, I can’t take part in this.’ And we wanted to say it publicly so people knew this was a feeling that exists within the military.” The exhibition acknowledges that not all the sacrifices were purely public. Chuck Searcy, who worked with Carver on the exhibition, spent a year in military intelligence in Saigon in 1968 and came back vehemently against the war. He began to speak out, but was subsequently disowned by his father, a former World War Two veteran, and estranged from his family for two years. “My parents were dismayed,” he said. “It was embarrassing to them. I remember my father said ‘you’re not a good American, you’re not a patriot any more.’ He said to me, ‘what happened to you over there, did they turn you into a communist?’ So many families went through that.” Schnall, Johnson and Searcy all agreed that despite the multitudes of books and documentaries on Vietnam, the role that GIs played in fighting for peace from within has always been downplayed and overlooked. “People need to know that active duty soldiers at the height of the Vietnam war, in the belly of the beast, the belly of the green machine, were able to build a movement that ended up crippling the ground forces and stopped them being effective,” added Carver. “That should be an inspiration to people, and that’s what it’s all about.” Waging Peace: US Soldiers and Veterans who Opposed America’s War in Vietnam opens on 19 March at the War Remnants museum in Ho Chi Minh City."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/15/peter-thiel-silicon-valley-europe-regulation","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T19:08:48Z","webTitle":"Peter Thiel: Europe is cracking down on Silicon Valley out of 'jealousy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/15/peter-thiel-silicon-valley-europe-regulation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/15/peter-thiel-silicon-valley-europe-regulation","fields":{"headline":"Peter Thiel: Europe is cracking down on Silicon Valley out of 'jealousy'","bodyText":"European regulators are clamping down on Silicon Valley companies because they are “jealous” of the success of the technology industry in the US, according to PayPal co-founder and investor Peter Thiel. Speaking about the looming threat of regulation for these companies, Thiel said that the “threat is probably greater in Europe” and there are “good reasons and bad reasons”. “The good reasons are these privacy concerns and the bad reasons are there are no successful tech companies in Europe and they are jealous of the US so they are punishing us,” he said at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. Europe has a history of clamping down on technology companies such as Facebook and Google for their data collection practices and is soon to introduce new guidelines under the new General Data Protection Regulation that will govern the way personal data is collected. At the same time, Europe has produced successful technology companies, including Spotify, Skype and Asos – although none have the scale of Facebook, Apple or Google. Thiel acknowledged that “privacy in a digital era deserves to be rethought” but said that “as a libertarian I always dislike regulation”. Thiel also explained why as an investor he wasn’t particularly interested in artificial intelligence: because of its bad reputation. “The thing that struck me is how uncharismatic AI is at the point. Basically, it’s going to take our jobs and, once it takes our jobs, at the singularity [the theoretical point at which superhuman artificial intelligence is created, triggering an unprecedented cascade of technological change] it’s just going to kill everybody. I’m not sure that dystopian view is necessarily correct but that’s actually what most people believe,” he said, adding that when considering investments he tends to ask whether technologies are good and how they are going to make the world better. “The answers for things like AI are quite weak,” he said. Cryptocurrencies, biotech and anything his PayPal co-founder Elon Musk is involved in are areas of investment that pique Thiel’s interest. “I have known Elon for 18 years and you should never bet against Elon,” he said. When Thiel first invested in Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, he was sceptical that it would be able to build a reusable rocket. “I thought it was inconceivable that it could be done … and they have actually pulled it off,” he said. The company to watch, he said, was Amazon, which has expanded into a broad range of industries, from infrastructure and logistics to retail and healthcare. “Amazon is the most ferocious company in the US at this point. It’s probably the company you don’t want to be competing against,” he said. “I can’t think of any other company even close to Amazon.” Thiel also explained why he felt Silicon Valley was losing its edge as the epicentre of the technology industry and that innovation would be more distributed across the country in the future. This was partly relating to the cost of living in the Bay Area, but also because of what he described as “lemming-like” behaviour of investors and an “almost totalitarian” ideology that is unwelcoming to conservatives and libertarians. This, he said, explained why he recently decided to move to Los Angeles. “It’s striking how what had always been a very liberal place has become almost a one-party state,” he said. “When you have complete unanimity that tells you that political correctness may have gone a little bit too far.” Thiel felt this acutely when he backed Donald Trump for president. “I thought [supporting Trump] was one of the least contrarian things I did. Half the country supported him. But within the Silicon Valley context it was somehow the most contrarian thing and the least contrarian thing I’ve ever done.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/15/uks-claims-questioned-doubts-emerge-about-source-of-salisburys-novichok","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T19:53:07Z","webTitle":"UK's claims questioned: doubts voiced about source of Salisbury novichok","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/15/uks-claims-questioned-doubts-emerge-about-source-of-salisburys-novichok","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/15/uks-claims-questioned-doubts-emerge-about-source-of-salisburys-novichok","fields":{"headline":"UK's claims questioned: doubts voiced about source of Salisbury novichok","bodyText":"It was a historic moment largely ignored at the time by most of the world’s media and might have remained so but for the attack in Salisbury. At a ceremony last November at the headquarters of the world body responsible for the elimination of chemical weapons in The Hague, a plaque was unveiled to commemorate the destruction of the last of Russia’s stockpiles. Gen Ahmet Üzümcü, the director general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which works closely with the UN, was fulsome in his praise. “This is a major achievement,” he said. The 192-member body had seemingly overseen and verified the destruction of Russia’s entire stock of chemical weapons, all 39,967 metric tons. The question now is whether all of Russia’s chemical weapons were destroyed and accounted for. Theresa May – having identified the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack as novichok, developed in Russia – told the Commons on Wednesday that Russia had offered no explanation as to why it had “an undeclared chemical weapons programme in contravention of international law”. Jeremy Corbyn introduced a sceptical note, questioning whether there was any evidence as to the location of its production. The exchanges provoked a debate echoing the one that preceded the 2003 invasion of Iraq over whether UN weapons inspectors had overseen the destruction of all the weapons of mass destruction in the country or whether Saddam Hussein had retained secret hidden caches. On social media, there were arguments that the novichok could have come from some part of the former Soviet Union other than Russia, such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan or Ukraine, or some non-state group, maybe criminals. The years following the fall of the Berlin Wall were chaotic, with chemical weapons laboratories and storage sites across the Soviet Union abandoned by staff who were no longer being paid. Security was almost non-existent, leaving the sites at the mercy of criminal gangs or disenchanted staff looking to supplement their income. “Could somebody have smuggled something out?” Amy Smithson, a US-based biological and chemical weapons expert, said to Reuters. “I certainly wouldn’t rule that possibility out, especially a small amount and particularly in view of how lax the security was at Russian chemical facilities in the early 1990s.” It took almost a decade before order was restored, in part through stockpiles being transferred to Russia from other parts of the former Soviet Union and in part through help from US and other western experts. Novichok was developed at a laboratory complex in Shikhany, in central Russia, according to a British weapons expert, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, and a Russian chemist involved in the chemical weapons programme, Vil Mirzayanov, who later defected to the US. Mirzayanov said the novichok was tested at Nukus, in Uzbekistan. The former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, who visited the site at Nukus, said it had been dismantled with US help. He is among those advocating scepticism about the UK placing blame on Russia. In a blog post, he wrote: “The same people who assured you Saddam Hussein had WMDs now assure you Russian ‘novichok’ nerve agents are being wielded by Vladimir Putin to attack people on British soil.” A Russian lawyer, Boris Kuznetsov, told Reuters he was offering to pass to the British authorities a file he said might be relevant to the Salisbury case. It details an incident when poison hidden in a phone receiver killed a Russian banker and his secretary in 1995. The poison came from an employee at the state chemical facility who sold it through intermediaries – in an ampule placed in a presentation case – to help reduce his debts. The UK government case rests not just on its argument that novichok was developed in Russia, but what it says is past form, a record of Russian state-sponsored assassination of former spies. Murray, in a phone interview, is undeterred, determined to challenge the government line, in spite of having been subjected to a level of abuse on social media he had not experienced before. “There is no evidence it was Russia. I am not ruling out that it could be Russia, though I don’t see the motive. I want to see where the evidence lies,” Murray said. “Anyone who expresses scepticism is seen as an enemy of the state.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/24/bryan-cranston-interview-isle-of-dogs-wes-anderson","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T19:00:10Z","webTitle":"Bryan Cranston: ‘I’m a mutt.

I relate to that. It’s what I am’","bodyText":"Californian actor Bryan Cranston, 62, is best known for his Emmy-winning portrayal of Breaking Bad’s antihero Walter White. His film roles include Trumbo, for which he was Oscar-nominated. He’s currently starring in Network at the National Theatre and the new Wes Anderson animation, Isle of Dogs. You’re playing news anchor Howard Beale in the stage production of Network. How’s it going? Really well. It’s about to finish but I’ve enjoyed my time in London. The play is very prescient about fake news and how we’re in trouble if television falls into the wrong hands. It’s amazing how 42 years ago, [screenwriter] Paddy Chayefsky was able to see into the future. Are you thinking about the likes of Fox News? Yeah. When I was growing up, we believed that what we saw on TV was the truth. The news was simply a man, in most cases, telling you what happened today. Now it’s so opinionated, it’s difficult to decipher what’s news and what’s part of an agenda. You talk to younger people and they say “Oh, I get all my news on Twitter or Facebook”. Really? Wow. This is the world we’re living in and how the Russians were able to influence large swaths of America. That’s what the play’s all about. In my final speech, I say: “The thing we must be most afraid of is the destructive power of absolute beliefs.” It’s crazy. The staging includes a bustling studio and onstage restaurant. Has it been distracting? Surprisingly not. It’s been interesting to integrate the audience. There’s the occasional noise but whenever you’re on stage, you hear people coughing or whispering. You just have to divert your attention away. How did you land the part in Isle of Dogs? Honestly, when my agent called and said the first three words, I knew my answer. Those three words were “Wes Anderson wants…” I said yes before he’d finished the sentence. But he could have wanted anything… “Wes Anderson wants you to wash his dishes. Mow his lawn. Shovel his… sidewalk.” Still yes! Your character, Chief, leads the outcast dogs. How did you bring him to life? Wes showed me an early drawing and Chief really was a mutt. I relate to that. It’s what I am. I’m not a pedigree of any kind either. It’s said dogs and their owners grow to look alike. Do you look like Chief? In a way. We’re both rugged, haggard and weathered. We’ve seen better days and aren’t going to win any beauty contests. Chief gets a bath eventually, though. I can scrub up quite well too. He has a romance with showdog Nutmeg, played by Scarlett Johansson. Were you aiming for a Bogart and Bacall vibe? Yes. It works in animation. No live-action film would ever couple me with Scarlett Johansson. But here the plight of the characters and our vocal qualities seemed to be in line. Our exchanges were done remotely. In fact, I still haven’t met Scarlett. I guess this will break the ice when we do. We’re like Lady and the Tramp. What was it like leading the wolf pack? I spent a few days in a room with Wes and most of the other pack dogs: Bill Murray, Bob Balaban and Edward Norton. Usually you do voice work alone, so it was interesting to see the pack dynamics in action. I’d glance over and Wes would have his eyes closed, listening to our voices and imagining the visuals. Did you act like the alpha dog in the studio? The first thing I did was walk up to my microphone, lift my leg and mark my territory. Trouble was, then I had to live with the smell of the mic. Are you a dog lover yourself? Very much. I don’t have one right now. Our beloved Sugar passed two years ago. She was a rescue dog from an LA pound and we had her for 16 years. Dogs are just the surface of this film, though. Its deeper levels look into greed, fear-mongering, the segregation of immigrants and how we treat others. The anti-dog hysteria and deportation seem politically timely… They do. Audiences anywhere will be able to extract meaning, depending on what’s happening in their own country. Children save the day in the film. Could that be the case in the real world too – say, with the US gun-control debate? It will take resistance, fight and struggle. But without that, we wouldn’t have a country at all. Revolutions have to take place to topple regimes. Resistance is a force for change. I certainly hope change is coming in America. When you presented an award at last month’s Baftas, you pretended to be a dog. Was that fun? Yeah, I like to take chances. Awards shows can get rather dry, so it’s nice to rib people a little. I heard them mention dogs in my introduction, so thought I’d play the obedient pet. Besides, it’s not often you get patted on the head by Joanna Lumley. Was it powerful to see the black dress code for Time’s Up? Very. What’s happening is really beneficial. The pillars of misogyny are falling. The oppressive behaviour of rich white men has got to stop. People are nervous that it will stop workplace romances and so on, but men just need to read signals, see boundaries and show respect. What are the differences between working in the US and UK? What I love about British audiences is their deep respect for the theatre. It’s embedded in your DNA. And you don’t feel obliged to stand and give an ovation, like in the States. You have to earn it here and that’s what a performer wants. It’s the best compliment. It’s great to be in a country that not only appreciates the arts but where the government supports them too. In the US, it’s the first thing to get cut. Do you miss Walter White? Would you ever play him again? I really don’t. I loved that time and miss the people. I stay in touch with the cast and see the crew now and then. But [creator] Vince Gilligan crafted a beautiful thing with a beginning, middle and an end. Revisiting it would diminish the experience. Having said that, would I entertain being on [spin-off series] Better Call Saul? Yes. It’s a fresh story, tonally different and I love it. Breaking Bad had a huge cultural impact. How does that feel? It’s strange because that feels separate to what we did in the New Mexico desert for six years. If things become a classic, that’s for society to determine. Breaking Bad certainly seems to have created a groundswell but I assure you that it has nothing to do with us. We just told the story the best we could. Was it transformative for your career? Without question and I’m eternally grateful. I just responded to the writing. It’s what I tell young actors: take every job when you’re coming up, so you learn your craft and meet more people, but at a certain point, learn to say no and wait for good work. Good work always starts with the writing. What’s next in the pipeline? I’ve created a show for Amazon called The Dangerous Book for Boys, which comes out next week and I’m very excited about it. It’s a true family experience, filled with love, pathos and adventure. I’m focusing on that and the final week of Network, then we’ll see.

The special measures permitting soldiers to be deployed in civilian areas will initially apply for 10 days, at which point the deployment would need to be ratified by parliament, said Mano Ganesan, the Sri Lankan minister for co-existence. “There were concerns that communal violence would spread,” Ganesan told the Guardian. “We don’t want to spread communal disharmony and hate speech.” Arson attacks and riots have hit the central district of Kandy in recent days and there was similar violence in late February when mobs set fire to Muslim-owned businesses and a mosque in the east. The violence in Kandy is understood to have been sparked when a group of Muslim men in Digana town were accused of killing a man belonging to the majority Sinhala Buddhist community, who make up about 75% of the population. Muslim-owned shops were set alight in response and the violence spiralled out of control after monks from hardline Buddhist groups with a history of inciting violence in the past travelled to the town to negotiate the release of the accused men. When they failed to do so, more fires were lit, dozens of people were arrested and a curfew was imposed in two towns in the district. On Tuesday morning the body of a 24-year-old man was pulled from one of the houses set on fire the previous day. His funeral was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. The Sri Lankan prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said on Monday the violence in the town “appeared to be systemic and organised” and promised the government would take stern action. The Indian Ocean island nation has been trying to rebuild its tourism industry after a devastating 28-year-civil war between the government and Tamil separatists in the north. The last state of emergency, in place throughout the war, was allowed to lapse in November 2011. Ganesan said the fresh state of emergency also widened police powers to detain suspects. Tensions between Muslims, who make up about 10% of the population, and the majority Sinhala Buddhist community have existed for decades but have become more acute since the end of the civil war. Sinhala Buddhist mobs rampaged through southern coastal towns including Aluthgama in 2014 after reports that a Muslim man had attacked a Buddhist monk in the area. Alan Keenan, a Sri Lanka specialist with the International Crisis Group, said radical Buddhist groups had been attacking Muslims with “a significant degree of regularity” since 2012 and especially since last April. “One of the key underlying elements is the sense that many Sinhalese and Buddhists have is that Sri Lanka is a Sinhalese and Buddhist island and other community, Muslims and Tamils, are here on the sufferance of the majority,” he said. Keenan said the previous president, the staunch Sinhala nationalist Mahinda Rajapaksa, had condoned instances of anti-Muslim violence and hate speech. The renewed violence in past months could be related to the growing strength of Rajapaksa’s opposition movement, he added. Last month Rajapaksa’s party swept to victory in municipal elections in the country in his strongest electoral performance since he was defeated in the 2015 presidential elections. “Many have argued that it [the inter-communal violence] is a product of the search for a new enemy to replace the Tamils, unite the Sinhala and win votes by cultivating a sense of Sinhala Buddhists under siege,” Keenan said. “This is a small number of Sinhala Buddhists playing on more widely held fears and myths and concerns.” Amnesty International called for Sri Lankan authorities to “end the impunity” for hardline Buddhist groups accused of inciting or carrying out violence. “The failure to hold to take action against these groups has only emboldened them further and plunged minorities in a deeper state of fear,” said Dinushika Dissanayake, the group’s deputy south Asia director."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/06/football-transfer-rumour-mill-manchester-united-barcelona-samuel-umtiti-ter-stegen","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T08:32:57Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Manchester United in Barcelona triple swoop?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/06/football-transfer-rumour-mill-manchester-united-barcelona-samuel-umtiti-ter-stegen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/06/football-transfer-rumour-mill-manchester-united-barcelona-samuel-umtiti-ter-stegen","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Barcelona trio in Manchester United's sights?","bodyText":"A stoppage time Nemanja Matic wondergoal might have brought Manchester United three points at Crystal Palace last night but this morning José Mourinho is more interested in delivering three players. Not just any players, either: Barcelona players. Three of them. Their victory at Selhurst Park might have been jolly entertaining but in falling 2-0 down to a relegation-haunted side it became glaringly obvious that some current United players simply can’t be relied upon to perform to their highest level, leaving Mourinho a stark and troubling choice: either actually do a bit of coaching to improve them, or simply buy some other ones. And he’s going for option two. Don Balon reports that he is already in talks with not one, not even two, but three Catalonia-based players. In declining order of apparent unlikeliness they are Marc-André Ter Stegen, the German goalkeeper who has been identified as the ideal replacement for a possibly Madrid-bound David de Gea and who “has a €180m release clause, but Mourinho is convinced that €100 could be enough to take him”. Then there is Samuel Umtiti, a key member of the Barcelona first team when fit but whose release clause is currently set at a derisory €60m. “Mourinho,” Don Balon claims, “considers that price quite a bargain.” And finally André Gomes, the 24-year-old Portuguese midfielder, who was booed and whistled by his own fans after he came off the bench against Atlético Madrid on Sunday because they think he’s rubbish. Ramires wants to go back to Chelsea and, more importantly, thinks he can – despite leaving the club for China’s Jiangsu Suning two years ago. “I’ll always have special affection for Chelsea, and I want to play for them again before finishing my career,” he said. “I know the doors of Stamford Bridge will always be open to me, and that wearing their jersey again would be spectacular.” Eden Hazard however could be on the way out of the club: the Telegraph reports that “team-mates fear he is becoming exasperated with being asked to play in the false nine position” and that “there is genuine concern that Antonio Conte’s approach will force Hazard to consider whether or not the Blues can match his ambitions.” Another André – Milan’s Silva – is also in the news today, with speculation mounting that Wolves, who were linked with the player in January, will now fling themselves into a summer transfer tussle for the 22-year-old Portuguese international, for whom Monaco and Valencia are also ready to scrap. And talking of three-way summer transfer tussles, Arsenal have entered one of those as well, joining Liverpool and Manchester United in the race for Napoli’s Jorginho. “We’re waiting for May. We wish Napoli could win the league, then if they want to renew the contract, we talk about it,” says his agent, João Santos. “The same if they want to sell him. There are no official and concrete proposals for him from the UK. We are available to deal with.” Southampton are drawing up a shortlist of potential replacements for Mauricio Pellegrino, who they will almost certainly sack in the summer no matter what happens in the final months of the season. “Fulham’s Slavisa Jokanovic and the Ostersund chief Graham Potter are among those on the radar,” reports the Mirror."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/06/paris-saint-germain-v-real-madrid-champions-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T21:41:31Z","webTitle":"Paris Saint-Germain 1-2 Real Madrid (agg: 2-5): Champions League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/06/paris-saint-germain-v-real-madrid-champions-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/06/paris-saint-germain-v-real-madrid-champions-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Paris Saint-Germain 1-2 Real Madrid (agg: 2-5): Champions League – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s it! The 12-time European champions march on! They’re into the quarters, having dealt with PSG easily. Their dream of completing the first European Cup hat-trick since Bayern Munich managed it in the mid 1970s is still on! Meanwhile Paris Saint-Germain’s dream of their first Champions League must wait at least another year. 90 min +3: A lot of flares going off right now. The PSG fans are going out with a bang, even if the players themselves are bowing out with a whimper. 90 min +2: Bale has a hammer from 25 yards. Areola fields it without fuss. 90 min +1: It’s not been Cavani’s evening, despite his goal. He’s found on the penalty spot by Dani Alves, but can’t sort his feet out to get a shot away. The earlier anger’s gone; it’s just dejection now. 90 min: Isco pearls one from distance, looking for the top right. Areola tips it round the post. The corner isn’t worthy of note. There will be four added minutes. PSG just wish it was all over right now. 89 min: The PSG supporters are still giving it their all. None of their players have performed tonight, but they’ve really contributed to a superb atmosphere. Trouble is in the post from Uefa regarding the flares, no doubt, but that’s not the point. 87 min: Vazquez performs a few Ronaldoesque tricks down the right, before larruping an effort high and wide. He earned the right. 86 min: Ramos has a rake from the best part of 30 yards. No! “What’s French for cohesion?” wonders Ruth Purdue. “This is actually a bunch of individuals.” 85 min: Cavani is booked for a late clip on Casemiro. He’s been on a rolling boil all night, so that was kind of inevitable. Diarra comes on for Mbappe. 83 min: The superb Vazquez slips Ronaldo free down the inside-right channel. Ronaldo slashes wide in looking for the top right. Factoring in his quality, he should have scored. 82 min: Isco comes on for Asensio. Kroos attempts a curler into the top right. Ronaldo shoots for the bottom left. Nearly, nearly. That’s that, then. Any remote hope of PSG fighting their way back into this tie are gone. Ronaldo races down the right. He slips it to Vazquez on the outside. Vazquez fizzes it into the middle. Rabiot hacks clear ... but only half clear. Casemiro takes up possession on the edge of the box. He shoots, and his effort deflects off Marquinhos, over Areola and into the net. Tie over. 79 min: Real take a little of the sting out of the game by stroking it around the midfield awhile, utilising their extra man to run PSG ragged. 78 min: Ramos is booked for a late slide on Pastore in the midfield. It’s a fair decision, he can have no complaints. But he files one anyway. 77 min: Marcelo is sent scampering down the left by Asensio. His cross is deflected high into the air. Areola claims under pressure from Bale. It doesn’t take a genius to work out that this match will be an end-to-end nonsense from here on in. 76 min: Changes by both teams. Benzema is hooked and replaced by Bale. Meanwhile Draxler comes on for Di Maria. 74 min: Di Maria is robbed by Kroos in the centre circle. He feeds Benzema, who is alongside Ronaldo on the break. Real are two on one! Benzema opts to go it alone, but upon reaching the box hesitates before shooting. He tries to chip Areola, but gets it all wrong. What a waste! Imagine Ronaldo’s reaction! You can imagine it pretty accurately, can’t you. 72 min: Zinedine Zidane responds by sending on Kroos for Kovacic. There’s a pause before the restart, because the ref still isn’t happy with the flares being set off by the home supporters. But wait a minute! Di Maria makes down the left. He crosses deep. Dani Alves returns the ball into the centre from the right. Pastore stoops to head goalwards. There’s some pinball, and the ball clanks off Cavani, who doesn’t have much of a clue about what’s going on, but has a goal to his name anyway! Scrappy, but suddenly the ten men just need a couple more to take this to extra time! 69 min: Real Madrid have one foot and four toes in the quarters already, but they nearly polished PSG off for good here. Benzema made off down the left and cut the ball back. The excellent Asensio met it first time, sweeping a shot onto the base of the left-hand post from 12 yards. 68 min: Benzema combines with Marcelo down the inside-left channel. The latter reaches the byline and cuts back for Vazquez, whose effort is blocked. The hosts go up the other end, Pastore slipping a pass down the inside right to release Cavani into the area. Navas comes out to block. Cavani goes over the keeper, and claims a penalty. Thing is, he was miles offside. The flag goes up, and PSG’s frustration keeps on rising. 66 min: A second yellow for Verratti, He tangles with Vazquez in the midfield. He wants a free kick but isn’t getting it. He gets right up in the ref’s grille, and that’s a booking for dissent. And he’s off. What raging stupidity, with his team already in dire straits. 65 min: Marcelo sets Benzema off on a dribble down the left. Benzema tries to trick his way into the area, but only succeeds in confusing himself and sending the ball flying out of play for a goal kick. Shame for Real, because PSG were light at the back and Ronaldo was in the middle. 63 min: Real respond by taking a little of the sting from the game, stroking it around the midfield awhile. Then Vazquez shimmies, shakes his hips, and tries to Steve Nicol his way past Berchiche on the right. The Paris full back isn’t having any of it, sticks to him like glue, and eventually forces Vazquez out of play. Goal kick. 60 min: Pastore comes on for Motta. Berchiche glides down the left and crosses low towards the near post. Cavani nearly turns it in, but Navas isn’t to be beaten. The hosts are desperate, but at least they’re asking a few questions now. 58 min: Ronaldo dribbles into the PSG area from the left and goes over in the cheeky style. A light hand on the shoulder, but nope. He has the good grace to grin sheepishly as he gets back up. PSG go down the other end, Mbappe working hard down the inside-right channel and teeing up Cavani, whose attempted bicycle kick from 12 yards doesn’t quite come off. 57 min: Asensio romps into acres down the left. His low cross into the PSG box is fairly aimless, but there’s a reminder that it won’t take much more for the champions to snaffle another away goal and put this tie beyond all doubt. 56 min: Di Maria wins a corner with another determined run down the left. He takes the set piece himself but Kovacic bangs a clearing header miles upfield. 55 min: Verratti bustles down the inside-right channel and tries to shuttle the ball on to Alves, but the flag goes up for offside. PSG have responded well to conceding. 53 min: PSG now need three goals just to force this tie into extra time. Mbappe tries to tee up Cavani in the middle, as he should have done on 43 minutes, but his cross isn’t all that, and he’s offside anyway. The home fans haven’t stopped singing, incidentally. And this is closer. Asensio bursts down the left, then checks back before playing a delightful reverse pass down the flank for Vazquez on the overlap. Vazquez loops deep. At the far post, Ronaldo rises like only Ronaldo can rise, and smacks a header down and past the helpless Areola! 50 min: There’s quite a bit of smoke down the PSG end. Ronaldo flashes a shot just wide left from the edge of the box. Close! 49 min: Finally the corner is taken. Di Maria’s delivery is met by Silva, but his eyebrows can only brush the ball well wide of the goal. PSG come again in the very next phase of play, though, Di Maria zipping down the left and pulling back to Cavani, who tees up Motta. Motta leans back and attempts a curler into the top left from the edge of the box. It’s miles over the bar. Dreadful. Half a chance. 48 min: ...well, we don’t know yet, because the PSG fans have let off a lot of flares, and the referee isn’t happy about it. There’s an extended faff. 47 min: On BT Sport, Rio Ferdinand suggested PSG needed to up their game, and come flying out of the blocks in this second half. Dani Alves tries to comply, with a burst down the right, but Ramos stands up to him. However, Di Maria comes again down the left, and earns a corner. From which ... And we’re off again! Real get the party restarted. No changes. “Neymar would be proud of that non assist to Cavani by Mbappe,” deadpans Paul Fitzgerald. Half-time highlights from the other game. It’s goalless at Anfield, too. Barry Glendenning has the latest from that one. The whistle goes, and it’s as you were. PSG still need two goals to go through; Real still search for the away goal that’d make things even more difficult for their opponents. A dramatic second half coming up! 45 min: Di Maria floats one into the Real box from the right. Cavani has no chance of meeting it with his head, and the ball floats out for a goal kick. From the restart, Real faff about, and Navas clatters a dreadful clearance off the back of Cavani’s head as the striker closes him down. The ball flies well wide of the goal, but that could have gone anywhere. 43 min: Cavani is still fuming, but now it’s because Mbappe had been sent clear down the right, and instead of teeing one up for the man in the centre, the young chap’s had a go himself from a tight angle. His effort is saved. Cavani theatrically puts his head in his hands. 41 min: Dani Alves shapes to shoot. Instead he dinks the ball to Verratti on the edge of the PSG box. Verratti slips it right to Di Maria, who slams a low cross towards Cavani at the near post. Navas smothers and saves. Cavani is within his rights to at least go for the ball, but you know how these things always pan out. There’s some pantomime shoving, but nobody’s hurt and we all move on. 39 min: From the corner, Casemiro has a whack from distance. Nope! But that’s been a good couple of minutes for Real, who have responded well to a brief period of PSG pressure. 38 min: The best chance of the match so far, and it’s so simple. Marcelo curls a glorious pass down the left wing to release Benzema into acres. He’s one on one with Areola as he enters the area, albeit from a slightly prohibitive angle. The Paris keeper makes himself big and turns Benzema’s shot into the side netting. 36 min: Benzema buzzes down the left and earns another corner for Real. This one’s taken short, and is a total waste of time. PSG clear. But Real come back at the hosts again. Ronaldo teases them down the left, before switching the play to Vazquez on the right. Another corner. And that one comes to nothing as well. The defences well on top at these set pieces. 34 min: PSG are pressing Real back a bit. Di Maria bustles and hustles on the right. He wins the ball and fizzes it through the Real box. There’s nobody in deep blue and red making a run, taking a chance. Di Maria looks frustrated, and he’s got a point. 33 min: Di Maria whips to the near post in the hope of finding Cavani. Casemiro nips in to intercept, and is shoved in the back by Cavani, an idiotic challenge which releases the pressure on Real, who hadn’t yet cleared. 32 min: The referee is interested in booking Kovacic, though. He slides into the back of Di Maria as the former Real winger makes good down the right. A no brainer of a decision. And a free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the right of the Real area. 31 min: Ronaldo dribbles at pace down the left and runs slap-bang into Dani Alves. He wants a penalty, as the coming together occurred just inside the area, but come off it. The referee’s not interested. 30 min: A long ball lumped down the middle by Rabiot. It’s a proper old-school hoof, and it nearly catches Real out as Di Maria brings it down and battles his way down the inside-right channel. His attempt to hook the ball into the centre for Harford Cavani is deflected into the arms of Navas. Reeptastic ... and there’s nothing wrong whatsoever with mixing it up a bit. 28 min: A period of pretty possession for Paris ends when Mbappe cuts in from the left and curls towards the far stick. A shot or cross? Difficult to say. It evades Di Maria, coming in from the other side, and sails well wide of the right-hand post. But that was a controlled period of play from the home side, who were pinging it around in the triangular fashion. 26 min: Mbappe tries to do something about it, with a distinctly unscrappy dribble down the middle. His power run is brought to an abrupt halt by Casemiro, 25 yards out. Free kick, which Di Maria takes. It’s deflected over the wall for a corner on the right. The set piece is launched into the mixer. Silva challenges for it. Ramos wins the battle. 24 min: Vazquez turns on the jets along the right wing. He feeds Carvajal on the overlap. Carvajal pulls one back. Vazquez battles for it, and concedes a free kick. It’s gone scrappy again. 22 min: The first lull of a hectic evening. You wouldn’t know it by listening to the crowd, who are still giving it plenty. 20 min: Verratti is booked for stretching into a tackle and clipping Casemiro on the ankle. He can have no complaints, it was a poor, mistimed challenge, though he might want a word with Di Maria, whose loose pass caused the problem in the first place. 18 min: From the ridiculous to the sublime by Ronaldo, who one-twos wonderfully with Vazquez down the inside left. He can’t latch onto the ball in the box, but it breaks to Benzema on the penalty spot. Benzema shoots, but it’s deflected over. From the corner, Ramos sidefoots powerfully from close range, but Areola gets down marvellously to save. Vazquez hooks the rebound out of play. So nearly a crucial away goal for the champions. 16 min: Ronaldo is stopped in his tracks by Dani Alves down the left. Frustrated, he takes a kick out at the PSG full back. Luckily for him, he doesn’t make contact, because the referee would have had quite the decision to make had boot connected with flesh. That was very daft. 14 min: The noise hasn’t stopped for a second at the Parc des Princes. This is what European football is all about. Mbappe zips down the right and looks for Cavani in the middle. His low cross is clanked out for a corner, which ... yeah. 12 min: Di Maria earns PSG’s first corner of the night. He takes it, from the left. That one’s not very good, either. Real tear up the other end on the break. Asensio, on the left, finds Ronaldo in acres on the opposite flank with a spectacular crossfield rake. Ronaldo shuttles the ball inside for Benzema, whose shot from the edge of the box is deflected out for a corner ... which is no good. A nice, open feel to this game, but the set pieces aren’t much to write home about. So far. 10 min: Asensio strides down the left, and loops a cross into the centre. The ball takes a massive deflection off Carvajal, and for a second looks like looping over Areola on an absurd arc and into the top right. But the keeper handles with great confidence on the line as he backtracks at speed. 9 min: The first corner of the game as Lucas Vazquez tears down the right. He takes it himself. It isn’t up to much. This is all very hectic, and there’s not much shape to it. But both teams are on the front foot. Did anyone expect it any other way? 7 min: Di Maria crosses from the right. A rabona. Up the other end, Ronaldo is nearly sent clear down the right after instigating a one-two with a cheeky backheel inside to Vazquez. It could be that sort of game. 5 min: Berchiche snaffles possession in the midfield, and from the left-back position romps diagonally, exchanging passes with Cavani and very nearly bursting into the box down the inside-right channel. Again Ramos is wise to the grift, shepherding the ball back to Navas. 4 min: Still a bit scrappy. Motta launches one long in the general direction of Cavani, but Ramos is wise to the move, and heads clear. 2 min: All a bit scrappy in the early stages. Both teams have a stroke of the ball. A lot riding on this; it might take a while to settle down. And we’re off! The hosts get the ball rolling. Smoke wafts across the pitch, a couple of firecrackers having gone off. It’s a glorious European atmosphere. Before kick-off, there’s a minute’s silence in memory of Davide Astori. The Fiorentina captain tragically passed away in his sleep on Saturday night. It’s perfectly observed, bar the interjection of one or two desperate types. Ignore them. Thousands of good people do exactly that, drowning them out with warm, respectful applause. RIP Davide. The teams are out! There’s an astonishing atmosphere in the Parc des Princes tonight, as you’d expect with everything on the line. One of the pre-tournament favourites is going out this evening. The home heroes play in their first-choice kit: les Rouge-et-Bleu. The reigning European champions, meanwhile, are los Blancos. We’ll be off before you know it! Meanwhile here’s Matt Burtz: “I went to Youtube to check out the PSG-Real Madrid highlights from 1993 and I think you may have even undersold the comeback PSG put together. Their second and third goals were scored in the 80th and 87th minutes to take a 3-0 lead that would have been sufficient to progress, but Real responded with a tie-equalising goal from Ivan Zamorano four minutes into stoppage time. Enter Antoine Kombouare, who thumped a towering header into the net from a free kick SIX minutes into stoppage time to send PSG through. Me, I hope PSG wins it 2-0 in undramatic fashion today.” Pre-match reading. Here’s our man Paul Doyle on why PSG boss Unai Emery is currently nursing a quadruple cognac in the last-chance saloon ... ... while today’s Fiver riffs, scats and be-bops on PSG’s 2017 pain, and enjoys itself tremendously while doing so. Regular listeners of Football Weekly won’t need to make too many wild stabs in the dark at the identity of today’s author. Oh Baz! PSG make three changes to the team that went down 3-1 at the Bernabeu. Neymar is injured, while Presnel Kimpembe and Giovani Lo Celso drop to the bench. Club captain Thiago Silva takes Kimpembe’s place in the centre of defence; Lo Celso loses his anchoring role to Thiago Motta; and Angel Di Maria looks to fill Neymar’s creative boots. Real Madrid make four swaps to their starting XI in the first leg. Nacho, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Isco drop to the bench; Dani Carvajal, Lucas Vazquez, Marco Asensio and Mateo Kovacic take their places in a slightly more defensive-minded line-up. Paris Saint-Germain: Areola, Alves, Silva, Marquinhos, Berchiche, Verratti, Motta, Rabiot, Di Maria, Mbappe, Cavani. Subs: Trapp, Kimpembe, Meunier, Lo Celso, Diarra, Draxler, Pastore. Real Madrid: Navas, Carvajal, Ramos, Varane, Marcelo, Casemiro, Kovacic, Vazquez, Asensio, Benzema, Ronaldo. Subs: Casilla, Nacho, Kroos, Modric, Bale, Hernandez, Isco. Referee: Felix Brych (Germany) Paris Saint-Germain have been here before. They were in a good position three weeks ago, in the first leg at the Bernabeu, before allowing Real Madrid to score a couple of late ones and tilt this tie away from them. File alongside last season, and another Round of 16 tie, in which they let the mother and father of all advantageous situations slip. Having beaten Barcelona 4-0 at home, they proceeded to capitulate in a wild, uncontrolled fashion at Camp Nou, Barca forward Neymar inspiring a late, late triple-whammy blitz to secure a scarcely believable 6-1 win for the Catalan giants. PSG went home not so much with their tail between their legs as the appendage cut off, chopped into little bits, sautéed, spooned into a foil tray, and popped in a doggy bag to carry home. But ... Paris Saint-Germain have been here before. Recent history may not be too kind, but hark back a little further and the echoes are more pleasant to Francophile ears. The 1993-94 Cup Winners Cup, for example, when the PSG of George Weah dispatched Real Madrid from the quarter finals. Or what’s this? The quarter finals of the Uefa Cup the year before, when Emilio Butragueño, Iván Zamorano and Míchel secured a 3-1 first-leg home win for Real ... only for Weah and David Ginola to inspire a stunning comeback in the second leg, three goals in the last nine minutes putting the finishing touches to a 4-1 victory that smashed Los Merengues into a million dusty pieces. So PSG have let a good position in the Champions League slip in the past. If they’re unable to turn things around at the Parc des Princes tonight, they’ll have done it again. But they’ve bounced back from a 3-1 away loss to Real Madrid in Europe before, too. If they manage to replicate that particular feat, it’ll go a long way to banishing the ghosts of last season. They just need to stun the reigning European champions, is all. No biggie. But hey, at least they’re not facing Neymar this time. This promises to be a cracker, because with two-legged European football, you just never know. It’s the champions of Europe against one of the richest clubs in the world. It’s a fight for a place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. It’s on! Kick off: 7.45pm on the clock on the Guardian’s wall in Blighty, 8.45pm local in Paris."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/07/australia-and-timor-leste-to-sign-deal-on-contentious-gasfield","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T19:56:31Z","webTitle":"Australia and Timor-Leste to sign deal on contentious gasfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/australia-and-timor-leste-to-sign-deal-on-contentious-gasfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/07/australia-and-timor-leste-to-sign-deal-on-contentious-gasfield","fields":{"headline":"Australia and Timor-Leste to sign deal on contentious gasfield","bodyText":"Australia and Timor-Leste are expected to sign a historic maritime border treaty in New York, after decades of talks dogged by acrimonious dealings and accusations of greed and espionage. But negotiations remained bitter until the end, with former Timorese president and chief negotiator, Xanana Gusmao, accusing Australia of collusion and revealing no deal was reached on how to develop the resources. The border treaty, to be signed by Timorese minister, Agio Pereira, and Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, at the United Nations at 5pm on Tuesday (New York time), will officially mark the border at the median line between the two countries – in line with international law – and not at the edge of Australia’s continental shelf. The border would divide the Greater Sunrise gas field, estimated to be worth about $53bn, with 80% in Timor-Leste’s economic zone. Early negotiations had offered the fledgling nation less than 20% despite its closer proximity to Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste, which regained full independent from Indonesia just 16 years ago, is a struggling economy almost fully dependent on oil and gas, but current reserves are expected to run out within the decade. Jose Ramos Horta, a former president and prime minister of Timor-Leste, told the Guardian the development of Greater Sunrise was “an absolute necessity for the future wellbeing of this country”. “Because Bayu-Undan [oil field] is running out and the current expenditure of the petroleum fund can run out within 10 years or less,” he said. “So it’s absolutely vital that if not Greater Sunrise, there is some other equally sizeable gas, oil or mineral discovery, before we can develop alternative sources of revenue, like tourism, agriculture, fisheries, or small scale and light industries, to make Timor-Leste completely independent from oil.” Ramos Horta said the deal should put an end to the “acrimonious controversy” of decades of negotiations. “The friction that existed in the past, as acrimonious as they may have been, it never damaged the level of relationship [between the two countries],” he said. “Australia has remained always, even through the most acrimonious period, a steadfast partner of Timor-Leste. However on the eve of the signing a letter emerged, written by Gusmao to the UN conciliation committee, dated 28 February, accusing Australia of colluding with oil companies. In the letter obtained by the ABC, Gusmao said Australia was not neutral, and was actively supporting a Darwin pipeline, which could potentially be perceived as collusion. An offer of $100m to Timor Leste amounted to a week’s worth of revenue and Gusmao dismissed it as a PR exercise. Gusmao, who has led negotiations, has consistently pushed for the gas to be piped to Timor-Leste for processing rather than Darwin. He wrote that Timor-Leste was willing to give up an extra 10% of the revenue share in return for the gas being piped to his country, which would return $25bn in economic benefits. He suggested the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, should use the estimated $3bn extra revenue to improve the quality of life of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which Gusmao said he had noticed no change in during his decades of visiting the Northern Territory. He annexed examples of Australia’s Indigenous affairs policies and statistics to “explain the need”. The letter also accused the commission of lacking impartiality, showing a “shockingly superficial assessment” of Timor’s needs, and attempting to put forward formal recommendations on development with flawed technical information. He said Timor-Leste’s only choice was to sign the agreement confirming the boundary but make no agreement on how Greater Sunrise would be developed. Australia’s negotiations with Timor-Leste over the lucrative reserves are marred by allegations of malfeasance and espionage. Timor-Leste has maintained the border should be set at the median line, consistent with the 1982 UN convention on the laws of the sea (Uunclos). Australia has long claimed it had rights that extended over its continental shelf, a concept much of the international legally community disagree with. “The prevailing legal consensus is that if permanent maritime boundaries were established in keeping with current international law, then most, if not all, of the field would be located within Timor-Leste’s exclusive economic zone,” Tom Clarke, a Timor Sea Justice Campaign spokesman, said on Tuesday. “This debate has never been about charity, it’s always been about justice and what the Timorese are legally entitled to.” Early negotiations gave the country just 18% of revenue, and the 2007 Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea, which declared a 50-50 split, was torn up following revelations Australian spies had bugged the room of Timorese negotiators in 2004. A whistleblower from the Australian secret intelligence service (Asis), known only as Witness K, alleged that he was involved in an operation to bug Timor-Leste’s cabinet room in 2004. The bugging operation was allegedly carried out to give Australia an advantage in what were highly sensitive talks over underwater resources worth tens of billions of dollars. Timor-Leste launched action in The Hague, but the Canberra home of Timor-Leste’s lawyer, Bernard Collaery, was raided by intelligence agencies in 2013, an action Timor-Leste described as “unprecedented, improper and inexplicable”. Witness K, who had planned to give evidence at the Hague, had his passport seized, preventing him from leaving Australia. The warrants for the raids were issued by the former attorney general George Brandis, who denied they were designed to aid Australia’s case in The Hague. Witness K subsequently launched the secret proceedings to recover his passport, which were resisted by the Australian government. In 2016 Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, intervened in the case and refused to issue Witness K a passport, describing him as a threat to national security, an assessment Collaery described as “laughable”. “How could it be a prejudice to Australia’s national security for K to repeat what he has said? And that is that an unlawful operation took place abroad,” he told the ABC. That year thousands of Timorese protested the Australian embassy in Dili, accusing the country of “illegally occupying” Timorese territory. The countries agreed to enter into a fresh round of negotiations early last year, and Timor-Leste dropped its case against Australia in the Hague, as a gesture of good faith."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/06/poisoned-umbrellas-and-polonium-russian-linked-uk-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T09:13:00Z","webTitle":"Poisoned umbrellas and polonium: Russian-linked UK deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/poisoned-umbrellas-and-polonium-russian-linked-uk-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/06/poisoned-umbrellas-and-polonium-russian-linked-uk-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Poisoned umbrellas and polonium: Russian-linked UK deaths","bodyText":"Georgi Markov, September 1978 In one of the most chilling episodes of the cold war, the Bulgarian dissident was poisoned by a specially adapted umbrella on Waterloo Bridge. As he waited for a bus, Markov felt a sharp prick in his leg. The opposition activist, who was an irritant to the authoritarian communist government of Bulgaria, died three days later. A deadly 1.7mm-wide pellet containing the poison ricin was found in his skin. His unknown assassin is thought to have been from the secret services in Bulgaria, which was then in the orbit of Soviet Russia. Alexander Litvinenko, November 2006 The fatal poisoning of the former officer with the Russian spy agency FSB sparked a major international incident. Litvinenko fell ill in November 2006 after drinking a cup of tea laced with radioactive polonium. He met his killers in a ground-floor bar of the Millennium hotel in Mayfair, central London. The pair were Andrei Lugovoi – a former KGB officer turned businessman, who is now a deputy in Russia’s state Duma – and Dmitry Kovtun, a childhood friend of Lugovoi’s from a Soviet military family. Vladimir Putin denied all involvement and refused to extradite either of the killers from Moscow. German Gorbuntsov, March 2012 The exiled Russian banker survived an attempt on his life as he got out of a cab in east London. He was shot four times with a silenced pistol. He had been involved in a bitter dispute with two former business partners. Alexander Perepilichnyy, November 2012 The businessman collapsed while running near his home in Weybridge, Surrey. His death was initially attributed to natural causes, but a pre-inquest hearing heard evidence that traces of a chemical that can be found in the poisonous plant gelsemium were later found in his stomach. Before his death, Perepilichnyy was helping a specialist investment firm uncover a $230m Russian money-laundering operation, a pre-inquest hearing was told. Hermitage Capital Management claimed that Perepilichnyy could have been deliberately killed for helping it uncover the scam involving Russian officials. A further pre-inquest hearing heard that he may have eaten a popular Russian dish containing the herb sorrel on the day of his death, which could have been poisoned. The inquest is continuing and is due to resume next month. Boris Berezovsky, March 2013 The exiled billionaire was found hanged in an apparent suicide after he had spent more than decade waging a high-profile media battle against his one-time protege Putin. A coroner recorded an open verdict after hearing conflicting expert evidence about the way he died. A pathologist who conducted a postmortem examination on the businessman’s body said he could not rule out murder. Scot Young, December 2014 An associate of Berezovsky whom he helped to launder money, was found impaled on railings after he fell from a fourth-floor flat in Marylebone, central London. A coroner ruled that there was insufficient evidence that his death was suicide. But Young, who was sent to prison in January 2013 for repeatedly refusing to reveal his finances during a public divorce row, told his partner he was going to jump out of the window moments before he was found. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

This article was amended on 8 March 2018 to make it clear that an inquest into the death of Alexander Perepilichnyy is continuing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/08/i-left-my-laptop-on-a-coffee-cart-and-i-lost-my-one-true-home","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"I left my laptop on a coffee cart – and I lost my one true home | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/i-left-my-laptop-on-a-coffee-cart-and-i-lost-my-one-true-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/i-left-my-laptop-on-a-coffee-cart-and-i-lost-my-one-true-home","fields":{"headline":"I left my laptop on a coffee cart – and I lost my one true home","bodyText":"It was a 25-minute ride from Sunbury station to the airport and my Uber driver, Kuldeep, was telling me about his divorce, his Tafe assignment on the mining boom and his investment property in Mackay. He also told me he was from Delhi. “Oh, Delhi – I was there in November,” I said. “I was robbed. My wallet was in a friend’s backpack and someone took a knife and slashed his backpack and took my wallet.” “You should never go alone to Old Delhi, that’s asking to be robbed – people work in gangs there.” “I was on a street-food tour – and it was just after we had the paratha.” We were almost at the airport. Then something came to me in a flash – an awful, sudden knowledge that had the swiftness and certainty of intuition. “Stop the car! Stop the car!” “What? What? Why?” There was nowhere for him to stop. I was so panicked I tried to open the door as he was driving. “I’m locked in! Unlock the door!” “What? What is it??” “My laptop! My laptop!” I didn’t have to look in the boot or the back seat or go through my luggage. I knew it was gone. When I arrived at Sunbury station, I had gone to see if my Uber was indeed my Uber and had left my bags in a pile – and my laptop on the ledge of a closed coffee cart. When I returned, I grabbed my bags – but not the laptop – and jumped into the car. How could I have missed it? Once Kuldeep unlocked me from the car, and parked on the verge, we both leapt out and looked in the boot. “It’s not there!” said Kuldeep, who had a look of horror on his face. “No – it’s on the ledge of the coffee cart at the station.” “You sure?” he asked. “You got that bottle of water from the bakery.” (We had been talking about how the bottle of Mount Franklin cost $4.80 – “expensive for a bakery”.) “Ring the bakery!” We spun around back towards Sunbury. The mood in the car had shifted. It was weighted with dread. I was on the phone, hands shaking as I rung around – retracing my steps – few as they were. “Are you the bakery near the station with the – water – my laptop is it there?” I could scarcely get the words out – and when I did they were jumbled. I felt incredibly unwell. “Ring the station! Ring the station!” Kuldeep was urging me. We were speeding back towards Sunbury but stuck behind an annoying sedan. “C’mon, c’mon,” I muttered, as if that incantation could move cars. No one has ever wanted to get to Sunbury as quickly as I did, I was sure of it. “Ah, c’mon!” I rang the train station. Staff said they would go to check if the laptop was still there. They were away for ages. I wondered if they had hung up. Kuldeep keep asking me: “What are they saying?” It wasn’t just a MacBook. Of course, it wasn’t. It was my second consciousness. For six years I had carried it with me everywhere, every day, all over the world. I had written two books on it. And hundreds of articles. There was the beginnings of a novel in there that I had started working on, a triptych. And a dozen stories due to my employers that were partially done – an interview the day before with Fran Lebowitz half-transcribed; an afternoon I’d spent the week before in Perth, transcribing a long, funny interview with the Iranian playwright Nassim Soleimanpour. There were Word docs with ideas for a TV script. Notes for every crazy idea that I tried to grab on to. And submissions for grants I was applying for. There were the tabs I had open, the articles half-read. My other consciousness was not in the cloud, it was on that machine. And because I was at home in the world and always travelling that machine was my real home. I lived in it. And it was not backed up. Oh, what a bitter way to learn this lesson. Kuldeep was talking now, fast – while also trying to overtake the sedan – about a Facebook group in Sunbury where he would post about my laptop. We could offer a reward! Eight kilometres from the town, then five. We were stuck at the lights. C’mon, c’mon. Kuldeep was glancing at me. I was probably very pale. I wondered if I might be sick in the Uber. We pulled into the place where he had picked me up – innocent times – only 20 minutes ago. My flight to Cairns was departing soon. But what was Cairns or anywhere without my second consciousness? Both of us went to get out. Kuldeep had locked the doors again. “Kuldeep – let me out!” He raced to the bakery. I raced to the ledge of the closed coffee cart. It was not there. Into the station I ran. Three older men were sitting there. I blurted out my story. Had anyone handed it in? No. Was there CCTV? Not that we know of. They looked at me with a sort of bored contempt. I was frantic. “But can I give you my number?” “We can’t do anything about it,” one said. “So no, I can’t give you my number?” “No. Go to the police.” Hate passed between us like a current. I left the station, bereft. Kuldeep was over near the bus stop talking to people. He raced over to me. “Not there?” “No.” “I was just talking to those kids asking if they’d seen it. Red case, right?” “Yeah, red case from Delhi.” I remembered with a pang buying the case at a lovely shop in Delhi – it was red felt with a light caramel leather trim. It attracted compliments everywhere I went. It was gone. Someone had a new laptop. Someone’s lucky day. We got back in the Uber and didn’t say much. At the lights again – red – Kuldeep pointed at a group of kids and went to pull over. “I’ll go and ask them.” They looked tough. “No, Kuldeep – you’ll get bashed.” We drove to the airport. I would probably miss my flight but I didn’t care. This ride was probably going to cost me $200 but I didn’t care. I felt as wretched as I’d ever felt. Too wretched to cry. All that work gone. My creative history wiped. Kuldeep was talking a lot now about another passenger he had – a man from Afghanistan. “He lost everything, not just a laptop. He lost his brother and his mother and his two children – and he comes to Australia after trying to find them in a refugee camp only to be told they were ALL DEAD!” The dry, flat and yellow grass of the Sunbury plains turned into the outskirts of the airport – high mesh fences and rows of shipping containers. Planes took off in the distance but I didn’t want to get on one because I didn’t want to leave that other part of me behind. “You lost a laptop, that is sad – he lost his WHOLE FAMILY.” I couldn’t imagine the pain, only that it would be unbearable – so I said nothing. “Once I drove maxi taxis,” Kuldeep said. “And I had to pick up some people in wheelchairs, but I was a little late because I was doing another job.” “That’s no good,” I mumbled, not really taking anything much in. “No, what happened was the people who called the taxis left the people in the wheelchairs on the grass – and when I got there, one girl in the wheelchair had a massive cockroach between her lip and her nose, and it was just crawling on her face and she was frightened but was paralysed and she couldn’t get it off.” I stopped thinking about my laptop. “Oh my God, that’s awful. What happened? Did you get the cockroach off her face?” “Yeah, I got it off her face.” It was time to leave. I could still make my flight. But how could I leave? I knew I’d never get my laptop back, and it was gone because I was careless with the part of me that I thought could not be cleaved – but of course was removed far too easily, and that there might come a time when I could think about the baby novel in the machine, and the photos and all the stories in there and people’s words and the things I’d seen and the words I written – one day I’d be able to think about it all, but I could not think about it now, or probably for a long time to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
