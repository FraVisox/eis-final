James has been playing on the floor of his home office but wants some attention. “Hey, Daddy’s on the phone, little buddy,” Kelly tells him. But James won’t hear it – he’s only one and it’s the end of a long day. He gets to sit on his dad’s lap so that his latest interview can continue. An American academic and expert on Korean relations, Kelly, 45, spoke frequently to the global media from the apartment he shares in Busan with his wife, Jung-a Kim, Marion, four, and James. When the interviews were live, he would lock the door of his study. “This time I forgot,” he says. Kelly, a political science professor at Pusan National University, had worn a suit and tie to discuss the impeachment of South Korea’s president on BBC World News. As Jung-a Kim tried to film it on the TV in their living room for Kelly’s records, the children slipped her grasp. The couple watched what happened next on their respective screens, along with a global audience that would soon explode across social media. “I could see the picture on my screen and so immediately saw that Marion had come in behind me,” Kelly says. The girl, dressed in a bright yellow jumper, bounded up to her father’s desk. By the time Jung-a Kim had noticed the incursion on the TV and scrambled to retrieve the children, James had piled into the study on a rolling chair. “I couldn’t understand why the BBC was carrying on with the interview,” Kelly adds. “Maybe they realised right away that this was comedy gold.” It was, but it wouldn’t be funny for the family for a while. Right after the interview, Kelly joined his wife in the hallway. They were stunned. “We both assumed that was the end of my career as a talking head,” he says. “I thought I’d blown it in front of the whole world.” He opened Twitter, which he used sparingly to promote his work. About an hour after the interview, a BBC News producer asked him for his permission to share the clip. “What would that mean,” the academic replied. “Is this the kinda thing that goes ‘viral’ and gets weird?” Still not realising how weird things would get, and wary of saying no to a broadcaster he felt he had failed, Kelly agreed to the request. The academic, used only to the kind of notoriety that came with foreign policy op eds in the Wall Street Journal, was about to gain an unwanted diploma in viral fame. In the coming hours and days, calls and emails poured in from newsrooms and TV studios. Reporters doorstepped his parents in Cleveland, Ohio, as well as his current and former students. The Ellen Show wanted the family on. A lot of the interest fell on Marion, who had stolen the scene with her innocent swagger. As she became a meme in her own right, her kindergarten deployed a security guard. “They were worried some weirdos would show up,” Kelly says. While the clip was greeted with joy, the inevitable viral backlash loomed. A race row erupted when people assumed Jung-a Kim was a nanny. Then Kelly faced criticism for the way he had attempted – gently – to push Marion away from his desk. “People were reading stuff into our relationship and, oh my God, I didn’t want to get near any of that crap so we didn’t say anything,” he says. “It was a comedy of errors, a family blooper. There was nothing to say.” The attention became so intense that, five days after the interview, Kelly had been unable to work and was largely confined to his apartment. So his university organised a press conference. The family also returned to the home office to talk to James Menendez, the BBC presenter who had conducted the first interview. At last the storm began to peter out. Nine months later, the family still gets recognised, and Kelly refers to his brush with fame when he gives talks and attends conferences. The requests for expert analysis soon returned, meanwhile. “For two weeks we were the most famous family on earth,” he says, as James begins to get restless again. “I guess that’s an achievement? I don’t know, it’s still just weird more than anything else. It’s nice to think we made people happy, but it’s not really the kind of thing you’d ask for.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/26/westminster-failings-fuelling-cornish-crisis-of-democracy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T07:00:42Z","webTitle":"Westminster failings fuelling Cornish 'crisis of democracy’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/26/westminster-failings-fuelling-cornish-crisis-of-democracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/26/westminster-failings-fuelling-cornish-crisis-of-democracy","fields":{"headline":"Westminster failings fuelling Cornish 'crisis of democracy’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Cornwall is facing a political crisis because of reforms to local democracy, the failure of Westminster to understand the needs of the far south-west of Britain and Brexit, one of the UK’s longest-serving party leaders is warning. Dick Cole, who is celebrating 20 years as the leader of the Cornish party Mebyon Kernow (MK), said he feared Cornwall would lose out financially under Brexit and argued that central government was not responding to the social problems the county suffers. He also called plans to reduce the number of councillors on Cornwall council – from more than 300 when he became MK leader to less than 100 by 2021 – disgraceful. At present there are 123. “Democracy is in crisis in Cornwall,” he said. “I think it’s a dangerous moment for local democracy here.” Cole, known in county hall as the man in the woolly jumper, has become one of the most well-known and respected Cornish politicians. His party may have only four members on Cornwall council (and another 20-odd on town and parish councils) but they choose their battles well and their voices are heard clearly. When Cornwall council sent a delegation to Westminster to argue that the Cornish should have their own nationality tick box at the next census, Cole was chosen to lead the delegation. National broadcasters have also been giving MK airtime this year, though when deputy leader Loveday Jenkin appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions Jonathan Dimbleby blundered in describing her as being a member of the party for Wales. As well as being a long-serving leader (Arthur Scargill pips him as leader of the Socialist Labour party with 21 years at the helm), Cole enjoys an astonishing level of loyalty from his voters. At the last election he won 83% of the vote in the ward of St Enoder, near Newquay. Cole became leader of the progressive left-of-centre party in 1997 when devolution referendums took place in Wales and Scotland. MK hoped that this move towards devolution would also lead to the creation of a Cornish assembly. Some 50,000 people – a tenth of the Cornish population – signed a declaration in 2001 calling for a Cornish assembly. It was delivered to Downing Street, but nothing happened. “They ignored us,” said Cole. “That has been the real sadness of the last 20 years. We’ve got a strong case for devolution but it has not been heard. Central government just doesn’t get Cornwall in the way it gets Wales and Scotland. Cornwall doesn’t fit their jigsaw puzzle. Partly it’s a matter of geography – it’s a long way from London and Conservative MPs seem to see Cornwall as a good place to go on holiday but don’t understand the detail of the place.” There have been highs. In 2014 the UK government announced that the Cornish people would be classified under the European framework convention for the protection of national minorities in the same way as the UK’s other Celtic people, the Scots, the Welsh and the Irish. The news was widely celebrated across Cornwall. However, since then little has changed and the UK government was criticised by the Council of Europe for cutting funding for the Cornish language and not doing enough to raise the profile of Cornish life. “The reality is that having recognised us, they have not followed through in the articles in the agreement. Within a couple of years they had stopped funding from the centre for the Cornish language,” Cole said. He is also angry that the political integrity of Cornwall has been threatened by the possibility of a so-called “Devonwall” parliamentary constituency straddling Cornwall and Devon. A second local government boundary commission decision – that the number of elected members on Cornwall council should be cut from 123 to 87 – also attracts his ire. When he became MK leader there were more than 300 councillor posts on the county council and six district councils. The districts were disbanded in 2009 and replaced by one unitary authority. “We’re campaigning for democratic renewal but what we’re seeing is the opposite – the dismantling of our democracy and the growth of the influence of unelected bodies,” he said. Though Cornwall was one of the areas that benefitted most from EU funding, its people voted substantially to leave the EU. Cole, a backer of the remain campaign, has concerns. “There’s a lot of nervousness about post Brexit. The UK government is liaising with the devolved nations but I don’t feel Cornwall is on the radar.” Cole, who gave up his job as an archaeologist to become a full-time councillor, insists Cornwall is a great place to be. “There’s a growing confidence about identity,” he said. As for MK, he believes the party can continue to wield more influence than its size would suggest. At the next general election the party plans to focus on one or two seats and see if it can make an impact. “Our influence over the years has been much greater than size of the party,” said Cole. “Ours is a very loud voice.” Though independence is not an MK aim, he admires the determination of the Catalans to break from Spain and the Scottish nationalists’ 2014 referendum campaign. “You can take inspiration from the energy of those campaigns. We’re trying to say to Cornwall there’s a better way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/16/alabama-unions-see-doug-joness-win-as-a-victory-for-organized-labor","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"Alabama unions see Doug Jones's win as a victory for organized labor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/alabama-unions-see-doug-joness-win-as-a-victory-for-organized-labor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/alabama-unions-see-doug-joness-win-as-a-victory-for-organized-labor","fields":{"headline":"Alabama unions see Doug Jones's win as a victory for organized labor","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Union organisers are hoping that the surprise election of Democrat Doug Jones to a Senate seat in Alabama this week could be a big win for organized labor in a state that has long fought to curtail their power. As big auto factories have set up shop in southern states Republican politicians have worked hard to defeat the unions, particularly the United Auto Workers which has lost a number of key battles to anti-union forces. Jones is pledging to do something different: use his Senate office to actually help workers organise. On the stump in Alabama, Jones bragged of growing up in a union family as the grandson of unionized steelworkers both employed by US Steel in Birmingham. Jones himself worked a summer job as a member of the steelworkers at US Steel Fairfield Works in order to pay his way through college. “Doug is one of those unique guys that comes from a working-class background made good by going to law school,” said Daniel Flippo, the steelworkers director for Alabama. After law school, Jones worked as a lawyer at the firm of Whatley Drake, where he represented unions. “The steelworkers run deep in his family,” said Flippo. “To have a senator from the state of Alabama that has those roots means a lot. You don’t see that often and that is why we worked so hard on this campaign.” Jones has already told labor leaders that he is going to hire a full time labor liaison to coordinate his efforts on behalf of Alabama’s labor movement. Jones’s office could play a tremendous role in engaging political and community leaders to get behind efforts to organize the state’s growing auto industry. Once a stronghold of organized labor, Alabama traditionally boasted a unionization rate that was twice that of its southern neighbors and on par even with some states in the North. With wall-to-wall unionization at the Tennessee Valley Authority, Goodyear, United Steel, and in the coal mines of Northern Alabama, many there still have fond memories of organized labor and hail from union families like Jones. In 1993, Alabama’s union membership peaked at 14.7%. However, in recent years, Alabama’s unionization rate has dipped to a mere 8.1% of the state’s population belonging to a union. As the state’s Senator, Jones has pledged to organized labor to use his office and platform to help workers seeking to organize in the state’s growing auto industry. Already, Jones’s victory has created a renewed sense of what’s possible among those engaged in the uphill struggle to organize a 6,000-person Mercedes plant in Tuscaloosa County, where Jones won by 57%. “We’re happy about it,” said Mercedes worker Kirk Garner, who has been involved in efforts to organize the plant since 1997. “That’s one more tool that we will have and I think it will help a lot with Doug having a union background.” Many of Garner’s co-workers worked to elect Jones to the Senate and the confidence in their ability to win in tough fights could help give new energy to the UAW’s drive at the plant, which has been gaining ground in recent months. Currently, the Mercedes Alabama plant is the only non-union plant owned worldwide by Daimler AG, Mercedes’ parent company. The company claims that it would remain neutral in its attempt to organize the plant. However, the UAW has long contended that Mercedes has illegally retaliated against workers and filled multiple National Labor Relations Board complaints to protest the firings of pro-union workers. In 2014, the National Labor Relations Board found that Mercedes illegally restricted the ability of workers to distribute pro-union literature. Workers at the plant say that in order for workers succeed in unionizing, pressure will have to be applied to Mercedes to remain totally neutral. Now with an ally in Jones, workers at the plant say they feel more optimistic that they can bring to bear the type of pressure needed to organize the plant. “It’s gonna require a lot of pressure,” said Garner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/15/stoke-west-ham-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T17:14:59Z","webTitle":"Stoke City v West Ham United: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/15/stoke-west-ham-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/15/stoke-west-ham-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Stoke City v West Ham United: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The league’s most porous defences meet but, as if by magic, West Ham United’s has dramatically improved of late.

Former reality TV star Omarosa Manigault-Newman, whose departure was announced this week, went on to say that despite those exchanges, she did not consider the president a racist. She told ABC News Nightline: “Donald Trump is racial, but he is not a racist.” She went on: “Yes, I will acknowledge many of the exchanges, particularly in the last six months, have been racially charged. Do we, then, just stop and label him as a racist? No.” Manigault-Newman said there was a lack of diversity in the Trump administration and that the president’s other senior advisers “had never worked with minorities, [and] didn’t know how to interact with them”. Asked if it concerned her when Trump denounced violence “on many sides” after a rally in Charlottesville that united white supremacists and neo-Nazis in a show of strength, Manigault-Newman said: “Absolutely.” Manigault-Newman has been on an interview tour since resigning from the White House on Wednesday under disputed circumstances. A former contestant on Trump’s reality series The Apprentice, Manigault-Newman had been the director of communications for the Office of the Public Liaison, which worked on outreach to various constituencies, including minority groups. She had also been an assistant to the president. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Thursday did not directly respond to questions about reports that Manigault-Newman had to be escorted out of the building. But she said Manigault-Newman would be at the White House on Thursday afternoon, and would remain on the White House payroll through 20 January. Manigault-Newman’s exit has revived attention on the lack of diversity in the Trump White House. “As the only African American woman in this White House, as a senior staff and assistant to the president, I have seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and my people,” Manigault-Newman told ABC’s Good Morning America on Thursday. Sanders on Thursday claimed there was “a really diverse team across the board at the White House” but failed to say how many senior staffers at the White House were black. It is not yet clear who will take over Manigault-Newman’s role."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/jan/17/architect-patrik-schumacher-depicted-fascist-zaha-hadid","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T07:30:47Z","webTitle":"Architect Patrik Schumacher: 'I've been depicted as a fascist'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jan/17/architect-patrik-schumacher-depicted-fascist-zaha-hadid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jan/17/architect-patrik-schumacher-depicted-fascist-zaha-hadid","fields":{"headline":"Architect Patrik Schumacher: 'I've been depicted as a fascist'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Patrik Schumacher, who took over as head of Zaha Hadid Architects after its legendary founder’s death in early 2016, gave a speech at the World Architecture Festival in Berlin later that year, he nearly caused a riot. In the speech, which was about how to reduce sky-high urban housing prices, he proposed eliminating social housing, privatising all public spaces – including streets – and selling off most of London’s Hyde Park for development. The London Evening Standard slammed him on its front page, mayor Sadiq Kahn criticised him as “just plain wrong”, protesters showed up at his offices, and some fellow architects called for denying him any future platforms to speak or write. Schumacher was no fringe figure. He’d been a partner at Hadid’s practice and has helped design acclaimed structures ranging from the Maxxi museum in Rome to the Leeza Soho in Beijing, which will feature the world’s tallest atrium. He has a PhD in philosophy and has written a two-volume, 1,200-page book called the Autopoiesis of Architecture. When he took over at Zaha Hadid Architects he inherited one of the highest-profile jobs in global architecture, with real clout to see his ideas put into practice. So was he actually serious in that speech? “Quite serious, especially about the privatisation agenda,” he says, in the Teutonic accent that, along with his stern demeanour and penchant for frame-hugging black outfits, may have added to his being stereotyped in the English-speaking world as a cartoon villain. “If you look at public spaces today, it’s meant to be all-inclusive, but it’s strictly policed. It’s kind of generic, for some kind of mean voter-crafted space that is quite uninspired. I think there should be much more diversity. I think these public spaces are kind of wasted if they’re managed by the public, by local bureaucrats if you like. I would imagine streets gaining character if they had entrepreneurs imagining their potential – plazas, parks, gardens.” He refuses to back down on his proposals, but he admits the backlash took him by surprise. “I was a bit shocked,” says Schumacher. “I mean, I have a thick skin, but it was unexpected and troubling. And it did for a while make me pull away a bit and calm down, to hide my polemics for a little bit and let that storm kind of fly over. I was really ducking under for a while.” Schumacher is no stranger to controversy. He has immodestly claimed that “Parametricism”, his theoretical approach to architecture, should replace modernism and its successors to become the universal style of the 21st century. He doesn’t shy away from quarrelling with architecture critics on Facebook and has argued that government should no longer fund art and architecture schools. But he rather surprisingly argues that he roots his contrarian, libertarian views in the motivations of the urbanist mainstream – namely, broad-based prosperity and access to urban economies. The Berlin talk, he points out, was about how to create “housing for everyone”. “My starting point was, beyond the housing crisis itself, general lack of innovation and over-bureacratisation of the development process, which I think is a factor in the affordability crisis.” Schumacher’s earnestness is disarming; he speaks energetically and passionately about how access to cities, and their economically dynamic economies, is being hamstrung by high housing prices. One vociferous critic, Phineas Harper of the Architecture Foundation, who has urged the architecture world to stop giving Schumacher a platform, says he “seems to have his heart in the right place”. Where they differ is on the underlying causes of the housing crisis – which Schumacher believes is government regulation. “Planning rules need to loosen up in terms of land-use allocation,” Schumacher says. “Land use is fixed politically. The overall quantum to be developed is fixed exactly – the types of uses which then come into the building. When it comes to residential, the unit mix – how many four bedroom, three bedroom, two bedrooms are fixed, how many flats per core. And within each unit there are size prescriptions, facility prescriptions ... every room is kind of determined.” He argues, without citing examples, that private business can provide freer public spaces for young people. “We have a thousand publics which don’t have to be equally catered to in every single space. We could have some spaces which are more edgy, for youth, where you could slacken the rules a little bit and you don’t have to have all this law and order, anti-laddism, rules and policing. In another space, you cater for a different section of the public.” It is not just the rules he blames, but the regulators themselves. “The power of the planners gives a lot of uncertainty,” he says, and argues that Nimbyism doesn’t help. He would find a few supporters among the Yimby (“Yes In My Backyard”) movement, who have argued for more housing construction in cities, regardless of income band, as part of a wider effort to bring prices down for everyone. “London and other cities are too low density. Density is not something I abstractly promote. It’s something that’s desired.” All of this goes against the grain of the more commonly accepted method for trying to make housing more affordable; namely, increased regulation, particularly affordable housing requirements. Schumacher believes this simply backfires. “It contributes to the very lack of affordability,” he says. “If you burden all new development with 50% highly subsidised housing, then that is something that goes into the calculation of prices, and has to be put on top of apartments that are left to be sold. They then by definition become more expensive.” Schumacher fears that the current sky-high housing prices may be politically impossible to reduce. Because so many people bought homes at inflated prices, anything that restores affordability would destroy large swathes of household wealth. “There’s a kind of strange hypocrisy where they keep crying out about rising prices – but in the end they certainly don’t want falling prices. Maybe they’re trying to aim for slowly growing prices? But this would mean that the imbalances that have been created on some of these land value prices would not go away.” Like another high profile but frequently pilloried urbanist, Richard Florida, Schumacher believes cities have to continue to attract the best and brightest citizens, including immigrants, and create a “clustering” environment for creative-class industries to prosper. He uses Zaha Hadid Architects as an example. “My staff here in the firm – young professionals – they know they have to be close. They can’t afford to live miles away,” he says. “They need to be in the pub afterwards debating issues. They need to slip over to the exhibition opening or that university lecture close by. They need to go to the networking breakfast before work or be available on the weekend maybe for seminars. People feel it in their bones. They have to be in the centre.” Land prices are the biggest threat to this urban primacy. “People are moving out of LA, out of the Bay Area. They have to create other tech clusters because of land prices. Now that’s a tough choice for a young startup – to swallow these huge prices or to pull away. But pulling away means being less connected, being less productive potentially. “These are decisions we shouldn’t have to pose to ourselves. It’s the same as here in London where people pull away and try to build a kind of tech cluster in Croydon. It’s sub-optimal. It’s not necessary. They should pile in to Shoreditch and to the tech cluster there rather than pulling away to Croydon. It makes no sense.” Some of Schumacher’s critics admit he has a point on housing regulation. Writing in the Architect’s Journal, Paul Finch supported Schumacher’s call for higher densities and rethinking space standards, and Ian Ritchie called a rethink of planning regulations “legitimate”. But Schumacher loses them comprehensively with proposals such as eliminating social housing or building on Hyde Park, ideas that lack any real constituency. “Much of what he said was clearly unacceptable to those people in the audience, including myself, possessing a social conscience,” Ritchie wrote. Schumacher argues he has been misunderstood. He says his proposals were intended to address what he sees as a negative feedback loop, as regulator mandates send prices spiralling upward and force people out. “That’s what I’ve been criticising,” he says. “It’s not about me attacking vulnerable groups in society and wanting to throw them on to the street. I’ve been depicted as this kind of villain, as this fascist. I’ve got this wave of defamation and my face with Hitler moustaches. The headline premise here is how can we actually create prosperity for all.” That may be, but Schumacher was naive to believe that such radical views would not prompt a backlash. He protests that the public denunciations don’t always reflect people’s private beliefs. “I’ve been battered, but at a face-to-face level I get so much support … The opinions I am promoting are unusual, they cut against the grain, but I think they’re being picked up.” Schumacher is probably engaging in wishful thinking if he believes his neoliberal privatisation scheme is becoming broadly popular. It is also true, however, that he is holding up an uncomfortable mirror to urbanists’ own beliefs and behaviours. Like them, he embraces the dense global city, transit, the creative-class economy, immigration and diversity, and the power of architecture and design to improve lives. Unlike them, he publicly endorses the neoliberalism that underpins it. His real sin may be openly championing London’s economy instead of ritually denouncing neoliberalism publicly while enjoying its benefits in private. After all, the World Architecture Festival itself, where he gave the infamous speech, is an expression of global neoliberalism: London’s architecture industry depends on the global economy, as do its modern creative scenes, from fashion to furniture. This is the contradiction many urbanists struggle to resolve – why Sadiq Kahn might say he has a mandate to tackle the housing crisis but is unlikely to do anything truly radical about it. Schumacher’s belief that any remaining barriers to the primacy of the market should be eliminated is simply the logic of contemporary London taken to its ultimate conclusion. This could be the real message his critics find unpalatable.

It is worth remembering what a nasty piece of work this exquisitely talented rapper has been, as you contemplate Revival, his ninth album. The cover finds Marshall Mathers literally face palming, the US stars and stripes superimposed over his despair. A number of tracks find Eminem raging at an even more deplorable moral vacuum than Slim Shady: the current US president. Following on from his pugilistic freestyle at the Bet awards in October, Eminem remains on the warpath. “You ain’t ruining our country, punk,” Mathers snarls. Revival takes a word previously sacred to another musical form – Americana – and transposes its religious connotations to the national discourse. There is an enormous amount to chew over on these 19 tracks, much of it intriguing – Eminem’s roller-coastering self-esteem, plus emotive updates on Kim (Bad Husband) and his daughter Hailie (Castle, feat Skylar Grey) and, perhaps most shocking of all, Eminem’s take on the staccato sound of now, the “Migos flow” (Believe). But the headline news is Eminem’s political engagement. The apex of his patriotic horror is a track called Untouchable, which met with mixed reactions when it appeared online the other week. It finds Mathers on scathing form, tackling police brutality, institutional racism and his own white privilege. In career context, it and its anti-Trump companion piece, Like Home (feat Alicia Keys), are quite literally amazing. Who would have thought Slim Shady would one day rail against the lie of the so-called land of the free built by slaves, or explain that violence is frequently the only avenue left to desperate people, or – and you may want to lift your jaw back into position here – inveigh against military transphobia? There are issues with these issues, though. These songs’ undercarriages tend towards the string-laden, rock-leaning and bombastic, a problem that lies mainly with producer Alex Da Kid. Although not a political track, the Joan Jett-sampling Remind Me is a particular travesty; this one is Rick Rubin’s fault. Other tracks here sound far more up-to-date and minimal. Chloraseptic (featuring the only guest rapper, New York’s Phresher) is raw and skeletal, its subject matter – Eminem going for the throat like medication – taut and blistering. Offended finds Eminem gargling mercury, doing what rappers always used to aspire to: cramming syllables of scintillating wordplay into a small space without stumbling. This new, woke ’Nem hasn’t exactly been doing his intersectionality homework either. His shit-talking to Trump comes laced with the usual misogyny. The body of Ivanka Trump ends up in the trunk of a car on Framed; elsewhere he’s “hittin’ on Melania”. On Heat, Eminem admits there is one thing he agrees with Trump on: “Why do you think they call it a snatch?” he sneers over a Rick Rubin beat. Offended, meanwhile, lands firmly on the wrong side of #MeToo. “I’m still copping a feel like Bill Cosby at will,” Mathers rhymes. The context is a rhymed hip-hop simile – how other rappers are still “copying, Xeroxing” – but it’s probably still a bit early to canonise Mathers. Another setback is that Eminem’s political sentiments may have missed their moment, that “wokeness” may have moved on from stating the obvious. Even as you thrill to Mathers’s ire, you are waiting for him to tell you something you don’t already know. And yet so many of these tracks are filled with grownup remorse. As well as blistering verses about his own emotional past (“I’m sorry, Kim”), the Ed Sheeran-assisted River finds Eminem analysing a fraught romance that ends in an abortion. “This love triangle left us in a wreck tangled,” he snarls. Arose ends the album with an arresting track about Eminem’s near-death overdose. There are just too many pop stars here (Pink, Beyoncé, Kehlani) wailing anodyne hooks over glutinous beats. Perhaps the biggest problem with Revival – as with many latterday Eminem records – is the struggle of an intelligent fortysomething artist to evolve while somehow remaining true to the demands of his sniggery core audience of alienated males, one he knows he shares with Trump. Listening to Eminem trying to square this circle, it’s just one face palm after another."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/15/what-evil-plots-is-the-snow-hatching","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T17:58:46Z","webTitle":"What evil plots is the snow hatching? | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/15/what-evil-plots-is-the-snow-hatching","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/15/what-evil-plots-is-the-snow-hatching","fields":{"headline":"What evil plots is the snow hatching?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The special light in St Ives is not a media illusion (Letters, 15 December).

We are writing to urge the UK government to redouble its efforts to support peace in the country. Numbers rarely tell the whole story of a conflict but the statistics in South Sudan are truly staggering: 6 million people, half of the country’s population, are severely food insecure; 1.8 million people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries, with the Bidi Bidi camp in Uganda now the largest in the world; an adolescent girl in South Sudan is now three times more likely to die in childbirth than to complete primary school. The UK government has been at the forefront of international efforts to support the South Sudanese people. As the second-largest donor to South Sudan, the Department for International Development has funded lifesaving health, education and nutrition projects across the country. UK diplomacy, as part of the troika, continues to pressure regional governments to engage fully in the peace process. As this conflict moves into its fifth year, we are reminded that achieving peace demands that we address the conflict’s root causes. On the ground, that means investing in local-level peacebuilding and reconciliation initiatives that enable communities to heal. Churches, traditional leaders, women’s and youth groups, and refugee communities must be empowered to influence the implementation of the peace agreement. As parliamentarians, we commit to working with our government, and the South Sudanese people, at every opportunity to help bring about a peaceful future.

Woodward, the former Crewe Alexandra, Bury and Sheffield United player whose case led to the Football Association commissioning an independent inquiry, was targeted by a bogus account using a photograph of the man who abused him in the 1980s and calling itself “The Nonce”. One message showed an animation of the abuser repeatedly sucking on a lollipop and saying: “Hi Andy, fancy popping round mine?” Other messages included: “Am feeling horny,” and “Am back fuckers.” A second account was also set up purporting to be the same man. Woodward, who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, was placed on medication because of “the uncontrollable feelings and emotions and instant flashbacks” he suffered after Lewis Hawkins targeted him within two days of the former player telling his story in the hope it would encourage others to follow. The last available figures, up to 28 September, show that 748 victims have come forward and 285 suspects have been identified, with 331 clubs “impacted” and Operation Hydrant, the specialist police unit, receiving more than 2,000 football-related referrals. In one of the few cases where internet trolling has led to prison, Hawkins has now been told he will have to serve six months, with the rest on licence, after what the judge described as a “sophisticated” operation to make Woodward believe it was a genuine account. The victim was in tears as he told Chester crown court about the devastating effects on his life. Hawkins was also served with a 15-year restraining order. “The content of the messages horrified me to the point I felt dizzy,” Woodward said. “It made me feel sick. I dropped my phone on the table and I was in tears. I was home with my friends and family and virtually collapsed to the point where one of my family members had to hold me up from falling to the floor. Only two days before, I had given up my anonymity to speak publicly. I felt I had reverted to being a child and it took me back to tragic events. I was in a lot of fear. I felt vulnerable and powerless.” Hawkins, 18, of Crewe, created the Twitter account after Woodward’s case instigated what the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as a “tidal wave” and the biggest crisis he can remember in the sport. Hawkins’s father, David Riches, 45, of Crewe, initially took the blame, telling the police it was “banter” and “personal fun” and saying he did not think it would upset anyone. Riches described himself as having a “cruel sense of humour” but eventually accepted it was “a bit out of order”. However, Hawkins later confessed he had sent the messages and admitted he had asked his father to accept responsibility for what the judge at a previous hearing, Patrick Thompson, described as a “deeply disturbing and unpleasant case”. In a police interview, Hawkins said: “I was so bitter about my own life I thought I would try to upset somebody else’s.” Hawkins and Riches pleaded guilty to a charge of perverting the course of justice. Hawkins also admitted a charge under the 1988 Malicious Communications Act of sending an indecent or grossly offensive Twitter message that was intended to cause anxiety and stress. Riches, who previously went by the name David O’Brien and had a number of previous convictions for dishonesty, shoplifting and public order offences, was also informed he would have to serve half of his sentence, with the remainder on licence, after the court was told he took the blame to cover for his son. Hawkins had asked his father to “have my back” and was described by a probation officer as being “unaware of the word ‘trolling’ and not having any real knowledge of the problems around that, and the way the internet is increasingly used to terrorise people”. The teenager described himself as “not right in the head” after losing his job and a number of personal issues. As he was led away, he made a number of threats, shouting: “When I get out, I will fucking kill you.” Riches apologised to Woodward. Speaking after the case, Woodward said: “I have no doubt the intention of the person who sent these messages was to cause significant harm to me. I have had several months of online abuse and feel totally devastated about the lengths that people will go to over the subject of child abuse. Nothing, however, compares to what these messages did to me. “It has affected the way I use social media and I do not really go on it much any more to avoid any more upset and distress to me and my family. I also hope this case will act as a deterrent to other internet users and they will see the huge damage it can do to people’s lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/alternativity-review-banksy-danny-boyle-nativity-play-bethlehem","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"Alternativity review: Banksy joins Danny Boyle to make Bethlehem cool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/alternativity-review-banksy-danny-boyle-nativity-play-bethlehem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/alternativity-review-banksy-danny-boyle-nativity-play-bethlehem","fields":{"headline":"Alternativity review: Banksy joins Danny Boyle to make Bethlehem cool","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This is my second nativity play of the season. In some ways they’ve been similar – basically the same story, same night sky, same farm animals involved, etc. And both have been brilliant. In other ways, they’ve been quite different – significance for example, and the location. My first was at a primary school in north-west London. This second one is taking place just round the corner from actual Jesus’s actual birthplace, in the car park of the Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem, and in the shadow of the Israeli West Bank barrier. The Walled Off, you’ll know, is Banksy’s hotel, or one of them. There seems to be another less official Banksy guest house, and a dispute between them – possibly some kind of peace process or two-inn solution is required there too. You’d think if anywhere could agree that more rooms were needed, especially at busy times of the year, it would be Bethlehem. Banksy’s behind the project, too, so it’s not a traditional nativity play, but Alternativity (BBC2, Sunday), geddit? Actually I was surprised/relieved/a tiny bit disappointed that no one referred to him as West Banksy. Anyway, Banksy can’t direct it himself, being anonymous (though the manager of the unofficial hotel, who has met him, says he has “a real nice face and nice smile, he looks gentleman”, which narrows it down a bit). So Britain’s favourite artist asks Britain’s favourite movie director, Danny Boyle, to do it. After all, Danny did manage to make Britain look cool at the Olympics, so attaining peace in the Middle East through amateur dramatics shouldn’t be a problem. Even if the nearest he’s been to Palestine or Israel is Majorca. (Really Danny, you’ve never been to Italy or Greece? Do you know where Bethlehem is?) He sets off, not on a donkey, sadly, but on plane, taking a TV crew with him and his own camera too, to make a documentary about making a play. And, well, it’s lovely. You can shove your Strictly Come Dancing and your Apprentice finals, and Sports Personality of the Year, this was the nicest television of the weekend. Moving too. It’s not easy, putting on a play right next to the Wall, overlooked by two watchtowers manned by snipers. The Israeli army will ultimately decide whether it goes ahead. Some of the kids who are going to be in it, and going to come to it, have never been here before, and don’t even know of the Wall’s existence. Their parents are trying to protect them from the miserable reality and allow them to have childhoods. Then Sofia the sheep’s dad is detained, under suspicion of being a local leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. You’d think sourcing a donkey would be easy in Bethlehem, but even that’s difficult. They have the wrong temperament, or they’ve been abused and are scarred, or they’re not donkeys at all, but mules. In comparison making it snow is relatively easy. He makes it snow? Of course he does, he’s Danny Boyle – he made Britain look cool, he can make it snow in Bethlehem. Actually it’s Wisam, the long-suffering manager of the (official) hotel, who does that, and eventually finds a suitable donkey – he literally does the donkey work. “And I thought it was hard working for Banksy,” he sighs. Danny might not be an expert on the Middle East, but he’s respectful and sensitive to everyone, including – especially – the children, and to their innocence. He keeps some of Banksy’s ideas in check. Yes it’s not just the soldiers in the tower who are keeping an eye on the proceedings, Banksy is also looking on, wherever, whoever, he is. He does drop in, at night, to add a bit more art: angels, with a crowbar, pulling the wall apart. The performance is lovely – quite trad in content, but with mobile phones, and hip-hop, and search lights. Recognisably Boyle. The donkey behaves, as do the snipers. There are no rockets, Mary sings a beautiful song beautifully, and then it snows. He did it, they did it – Danny and Banksy and Wisam and Riham the local director and a bunch of Palestinian kids. They made Bethlehem cool."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/22/julia-donaldson-axel-scheffler-gruffalo-nterview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T09:00:49Z","webTitle":"Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler: ‘The Gruffalo’s not a curse … it can be a burden’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/22/julia-donaldson-axel-scheffler-gruffalo-nterview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/22/julia-donaldson-axel-scheffler-gruffalo-nterview","fields":{"headline":"Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler: ‘The Gruffalo’s not a curse … it can be a burden’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If Paddington Bear was a polite parable of immigration in wellies and a floppy hat, so the Gruffalo has become an unlikely emblem of Brexit – “the Brusselo”. A recent cartoon for the Guardian by his creator Axel Scheffler recast the toothsome monster in star-spangled EU blue, terrifying British voters with anti-European fears. And in an impassioned blog entitled Without the EU, There Would Be No Gruffalo, the German-born illustrator, who has lived in the UK since the early 1980s, argues that had it not been for his long-term collaboration with the writer and former children’s laureate Julia Donaldson, “The Gruffalo and all the other books I’ve illustrated would not have contributed to the British economy, creating jobs and revenue. Just unravelling the story of one ‘British product’, The Gruffalo, shows that Britain’s engagement with Europe is not simply a political issue, but an economic and cultural one.” And what a “British product” the Gruffalo – and his picture book dynasty – is. The UK’s bestselling children’s author? JK Rowling, obviously! Wrong. Donaldson was the first author to record UK sales of more than £10m for five consecutive years, making her the fourth bestselling writer in British history. To think back to the more innocent days of 2014, Donaldson’s book sales beat those of Harry Potter, Fifty Shades of Grey and Dan Brown’s books. Based on 2016 figures, she retains her crown as the UK’s reigning No 1 author. Like his predecessors Pooh and Paddington, the Gruffalo, created in 1999, is a cultural icon in his own right: a megaselling brand including Gruffalo- themed adventures and merchandising from mugs to pants; the book has become a West End theatre staple (its offspring The Gruffalo’s Child is this year’s seasonal show at London’s Lyric Hammersmith) and an animated film watched by nearly 10 million people on Christmas Day in 2009. For the next few years, a Donaldson/Scheffler film was as much a Christmas Day TV fixture as the Queen’s speech. This year it is the turn of the The Highway Rat (based on the 2011 book), starring a whiskery scoundrel (voiced by David Tennant) who mercilessly robs food from his fellow animals, to be broadcast to the bloated nation. AA Milne complained that his life and other work had been eclipsed by his most famous creation, a sentiment shared by JM Barrie. And while the Gruffalo himself might be instantly recognisable – those tusks, that wart – readers without young children may not know the names of his creators, or the fact that they have written more than 300 other books between them. Donaldson has compared herself to the plucky mouse in The Gruffalo forced to confront the larger-than-life manifestation of her own imagination. “I hate even more when people say I hate being asked about the Gruffalo,” she has said. So do they feel the equivalent of the curse of Pooh Bear? “I don’t mind The Gruffalo being so popular,” Scheffler concedes. “It is this idea of never being able to step out of this role, or whatever it is, of the Gruffalo fame, of never being not the illustrator of The Gruffalo until the end of my life. That’s a sometimes slightly claustrophobic feeling. People are full of awe, and I think I’m just Axel. It’s not a curse, but it can be a burden.” “You do get a bit sick of talking about The Gruffalo,” Donaldson agrees. “It is nice to talk about the other books.” While each has stuffed shelves of books they have produced separately, it is undoubtedly for their joint work that they are most famous (they haven’t been dubbed “the Lennon and McCartney” of children’s books for nothing). The combination of Donaldson’s sparkly verse and fable-like tales – including a frisson of danger common to most great children’s stories – and Scheffler’s bold, witty drawings tinged with darkness, is a winning formula for children and parents alike. How many are they up to now? “A Squash and a Squeeze, Gruffalo, Monkey Puzzle, Room on the Broom, The Smartest Giant in Town, The Snail and the Whale, Stick Man, Tabby McTat, Zog …” Donaldson counts them on her hands, quickly running out of fingers. She gets to 21, The Ugly Five published earlier this autumn. “I’ll take her word for it,” Scheffler says. Do they have favourites in the brood? “I do really like The Highway Rat,” Donaldson replies immediately, and not, I don’t think, because the film’s PR is hovering discreetly in the background. “I’m most proud of how I sustained the meter.” Although Donaldson says she finds it harder not to write in verse, she is at pains to stress the artistry that goes into creating these seemingly effortless jaunty tales. “I can’t see the point of writing a book in rhyme, unless it flows and scans, and there’s also some structure of a little chorus or something like a song.” Each new book is a reaction to the preceding ones. With The Highway Rat she knew she wanted “a baddie”. “It gets harder and harder to find something different, because I’ve done a dragon baddie and a witch and I suppose the Gruffalo is a baddie, so I thought of a highwayman.” Which naturally led her to the children’s poetry anthology favourite, Alfred Noyes’s “The Highwayman”, with its hypnotic, cantering rhythm. “There will be some little bits that might be in rhyme, or there might be a lovely phrase, or four nice phrases, that I think I want to recur throughout the book and that will dictate the meter. So, sorry, these other nice words and phrases – they’ve got to go. Cut cut cut.” She can “agonise” for months, or even put a story aside for years, trying to get the “nitty gritty” right. Scheffler is equally exacting, often reworking an illustration many times until the editor “just takes it away from me. I don’t think I’m a perfectionist but there’s always something I could improve. I think the imperfections of the drawings are part of the charm, maybe that’s why people can relate to them.” Donaldson’s walls are full of discarded or alternative drawings: “Occasionally there’s one that doesn’t work because the old lady’s nose is too close to the cow’s bottom, or something like that,” she explains. For such a hugely successful partnership spanning more than a quarter of a century, there is more the coy anxiety of a second date than the complacency of a long marriage about their working relationship, with both admitting to “nail-biting” awaiting approval for each new book. Donaldson has said she “writes in a vacuum”, only sending the story to Scheffler when it is ready. For most of their collaboration they have literally been miles apart: Donaldson now lives in a village in West Sussex, but brought up her three sons just outside Glasgow, where her husband, Malcolm, worked as a consultant paediatrician; Scheffler lives in Richmond, with his French partner and young daughter. They rarely meet. “We are friends, but I wouldn’t ring her up and say: ‘Let’s spend the weekend together’,” Scheffler revealed in a previous – solo – interview. Like an actor who becomes famous for a lead role because another actor dropped out, Scheffler was third choice for The Gruffalo, and apparently has turned down some of Donaldson’s stories, deciding with each new one if he “can imagine enjoying illustrating it”; and occasionally Donaldson has different ideas about how a character should look (she wanted the witch in Room on the Broom to be prettier and younger, for example). She likens the joint experience to going on holiday: “We are going to India next year; I’ve got my picture of what it will be like. I know it won’t be a bit like that but when I come back I will barely remember what I thought it was going to be.” The latest book, The Ugly Five, was in fact sparked by a safari trip Donaldson took with her husband (who has a soft spot for wildebeests) and conceived more as “a long poem, not such a knotty, twisty story” as she felt “some of the books got a bit complicated”. Now, of course, she has Axel’s style in mind while she is writing, but the characters are still “never entirely” as she envisioned. A rat on a horse, a snail on a whale – in many ways she admits she has the easier role, often presenting Scheffler with pencil-sharpening conundrums, not least in terms of perspective. “You have to forget about any aspects of realism,” Scheffler says. “You have to just put the rat on the horse and make him a lot bigger than he really would be. In a picture book anything is possible.” It used to be “a struggle”, he admits. “But over the years it became easier.” The Gruffalo was difficult. If the brouhaha following this year’s John Lewis Christmas ad, in which monster Moz bears a furry resemblance to Chris Riddell’s Mr Underbed, proves anything, it is that there are only so many monsters of our imagining. The orange-eyed Gruffalo “with his terrible claws and terrible teeth” is clearly a descendant of one of Maurice Sendak’s yellow-eyed Wild Things, with “their terrible teeth” and “terrible claws” (but somehow less scary). “Maurice Sendak is a great illustrator, but I was never a great Sendak fan. He was not an influence and I didn’t think of him when I drew the Gruffalo,” Scheffler says. “Honestly.” Surprisingly perhaps, he didn’t have many picture books as a child and was more interested in comics; his childhood love of nature is clear in his drawings. His work owes more to a European tradition, and from his richly detailed, slightly spooky fairytale backgrounds, you wouldn’t have to know that he drew studies from Hamburg forests and German towns, to guess at his roots. He cites the French artist Tomi Ungerer as the greater inspiration (“We have the same eyes in our pictures! I loved his cartoony style”). His instinct is always to go darker – legend has it that he takes revenge on his characters by sketching them meeting unfortunate ends. When Donaldson interjects to ask if he ever gets cross when people interfere with his drawings, he replies only when an editor suggests an image is unsuitable for children, such as the sawing off of a unicorn’s horn. Donaldson’s influences – Edward Lear, Lewis Caroll, Ogden Nash, Flanders and Swann – bear testimony to her years as jobbing songwriter for shows such as the 1970s Play Away: “A BBC producer would ring and say could you write a song about loose teeth, or something, for next Wednesday.” Her writing career took off relatively late when she was 44, after “a poor editor to whom I will remain eternally grateful”, listened to a tape of songs in the car with her children and thought one of them might make a good picture book. The result was A Squash and a Squeeze, published in 1993 and her first collaboration with Scheffler. It was another six years before The Gruffalo (based on a Chinese fable about a tiger) emerged to capture the children’s publishing market. She comes from a musical, lefty family, who lived in a tall Victorian house in Hampstead, shared with her grandmother, uncle and aunt; when she was six, her father started using a wheelchair after having polio. Her “first love was acting” and she studied drama and French at Bristol University. But it was only while busking round Europe after graduating that she was introduced to Malcolm Donaldson, a young medic also from Bristol, who won her heart by jumping into the Seine to rescue some props. The couple, who have been married for 45 years, have been performing together ever since, now putting on plays of Donaldson’s books to packed audiences at book festivals. “I don’t think of myself as primarily a writer, I think of myself equally as a performer,” she has said, and bringing “some drama and music to the job” was one of her goals on becoming children’s laureate in 2011; she is invariably photographed in her prop room, also the setting for her picture in the National Portrait Gallery. “Performance is a very important, enjoyable part of my work. We take it very seriously. Every time I write a story I have to think – could it work on the stage? Can just Malcolm and me act it out? Or should we do it with puppets? It’s a creative procedure in itself.” “Come and have lunch in my underground house,” Malcolm drawls unexpectedly from a dark corner of the room: his rendition of the fox is a camp, slightly tipsy Reynard to Scheffler’s German owl; his Highway Rat a swaggering Scot – the inspiration, Donaldson believes, for casting Tennant in the new film. “She writes the words, I remember them,” Malcolm says. He recently gave the first rendition of The Ugly Five at a book club (“more of an eating club really”) the couple hosted and “everyone loved joining in with the punchlines”. The comeuppance of a bully who robs the poor, The Highway Rat has obvious potential for political parable, but Donaldson is clear she doesn’t do “what you might call picture book medicine” and says she never “starts off with a message”. But she concedes a recurring David and Goliath theme (The Highway Rat, The Gruffalo). In response to criticisms of not having enough female role models in her work – the characters in The Gruffalo might all be animals, but they are male – Zog is an inverse Cinderella tale of a princess who shuns a frilly dress in favour of a stethoscope, and the clever duck who saves the day in The Highway Rat wears a bonnet (animal attire is a vexed issue for both author and illustrator). Donaldson has also observed that quite a few of her books “are subconsciously about loss”, a sad allusion to the death of her eldest son, Hamish, who killed himself in 2003 at the age of 25, having lived for most of his life with schizoaffective disorder. In a moving 2009 interview on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, she explained how the family “had done a lot of grieving before he died”. Her seventh grandchild is due this month and her eldest is seven. She is “very shy” of reading to them: “I say go and choose a book. If it is one of mine I’m always nervous, because if they wriggled or got bored I would be hurt. I’ve had so many years in between having children and performing the stories to anything between a class and an audience of a thousand. So having this one-to-one relationship goes back a long time.” Donaldson and Scheffler’s books occupy a special place not only at bedtime but as part of a child’s expanding world (my toddler doesn’t pick up sticks on walks, but stickmen; clumps of mud are Gruffalo poo, of course). As Scheffler says: “It is very strange for us, too, to think of that intimate moment between mother and child, that we are somehow there.” Finally, dear exhausted parent, a tip: when you are reading Stick Man or Room on the Broom or any of the other titles for what feels like the thousandth time, look out for the tiny Gruffalo ingeniously hidden in each of the books, the illustrator’s mischievous twist on the author’s trademark trick in the tale.

Feast on these mathematical snacks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In my puzzle blog earlier today I set you the following three questions: 1) In the image of an equilateral triangle above, what fraction of the whole triangle is the red triangle? Solution: 1/4 You could have shown this in one of at least three ways, illustrated below: by dividing the entire triangle into 8 identical small triangles, and deducing that the red triangle comprises two of them; by constructing an “envelope” shape that must have the same area as the original triangle, and deducing the red triangle is a quarter of this envelope; by dividing the triangle into four identical smaller triangles, and deducing that the red triangle has equal area to one of these smaller triangles, because if two triangles have the same base and height, they have the same area. 2) Four semicircles with radius 2 are constructed in the red square below. What is the area of the square? Solution: 8(2 + √3) In order to solve this one you need to be familiar with Pythagoras’s Theorem, which states that for right-angled triangles the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Method A: Look at the triangle in the image below left. It has hypotenuse 4 and one of the other sides is 2. If the third side has length x, Pythagoras’s Theorem tells us that x2 + 22 = 42. So x2 = 16 – 4 = 12, making x = √12 = 2√3. The red square thus has side 2 + 2√3, and area (2 + 2√3)2 = 4 + 8√3 + 12 = 16 + 8√3 = 8(2 +√3) Method B: Look at the middle image below, with a red square inside the original square. We can rearrange the triangles outside that red square to make a rectangle (below right) which has sides 2√3 and 4. The area of the large square is the area of the smaller square plus the rectangle, which is 42 + 8√3 = 16 + 8√3 = 8(2 +√3) 3) A quarter of a circle with radius 6 is shown below. Inside it are two semicircles and a circle, each of them at a tangent to the others. What are the radii of the black circle and the smaller black semicircle? Solution: The smallest circle has radius 1, and the smaller semicircle has radius 2. First, some notation, and basic deduction. Let the smallest circle have radius r, and the smaller semicircle radius R. Since the quarter-circle is of a circle with radius 6, the radius of the larger semi-circle must be 3. Method 1: Consider the right-angled triangle shown left. The hypotenuse is 3 + R, and the sides have length 3, and r + 3. So, from Pythagoras: 32 + (r + 3)2 = (3 + R)2 We also see that r + R = 3, or r = 3 – R. 32 + (6 – R)2 = (3 + R)2 which works out as 18R – 27 = 9, so R = 2. And then r = 3 – R = 1 Method 2: Consider the right-angled triangle shown left. The hypotenuse is 6 – r, and the sides are length 3 + r and 3. So, from Pythagoras, (6 – r)2 = (3 + r)2 + 32 or, 27 – 18r = 9, or r = 1. As above, since r + R = 3, R = 2. I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzles. I’ll be back in two weeks, on January 1.

That has to change, 14 December) takes aim at almost everything about universities and even manages to claim both that post-16 technical education is poor and that we should stop some young people from going to university. How could closing the only route many young people have to develop high-level skills be considered a positive step that will help them? How many universities has Jenkins actually visited? Judging from the article he might say “both of them”. But we are a diverse sector. At the University of Portsmouth we embed real-life work experience in most of our courses as well as the latest technology. For example, some of our students experience “virtual field trips”. The division between science and the humanities is also becoming obsolete – as is suggested by our own School of Creative Technologies. Indeed, in a world in which technology is challenging ethical and social norms, we need the humanities more than ever – and I say that as a professional engineer. Jenkins is enthusiastic about two-year degrees, but the reason universities are focused elsewhere is that there has been little demand for them. Even the government predicts that there will only be about 5,000 by 2022. The real issue that universities are keen to address is greater support for lifelong learning and the need to reverse the worrying collapse in part-time study. Articles like Jenkins’s help foster an environment in which people feel comfortable believing that all universities are lazy and self-interested – and that we are all the same. This demeans the excellent hard work that my dedicated colleagues engage in every day to support student success. Universities must be held to account and be open to fair criticism but it should be based on evidence and research, not facile generalisations. Professor Graham Galbraith Vice-chancellor, University of Portsmouth • Simon Jenkins is right to point out the wasteful hours that academics currently have to spend on the endless “measuring” of their teaching and research, rather than actually getting on with it. On the other hand, having benefited from a three-year degree (philosophy, politics and economics, Oxford), it seems he now wants to lift the drawbridge, withdraw this opportunity from today’s university students, and consign them to crash courses. At the same time, he takes a swipe at the humanities. I’ve always understood that PPE doesn’t prepare students for any specific career, but am now wondering if it’s good preparation for becoming a philistine. Professor Jennifer Jenkins Southampton • What might humanities degrees be good for? I suppose the ability to argue properly on the basis of a thorough understanding of a subject and its history doesn’t count for much in a democracy. Professor Michael Morris Department of philosophy, University of Sussex • Simon Jenkins is entitled to his own opinions about universities, but he is not entitled to mangle the facts about them. There was no “wiping out of polytechnics in the 1990s”. Polytechnics were allowed to become universities, giving them more autonomy and putting them on a more level playing field with the universities that already existed. Professor Trevor Curnow Lancaster • Richard Adams (Poorer students half as likely to go to university, 14 December) and Simon Jenkins raise important points about privilege and equity in the university sector. Students from deprived neighbourhoods are much less likely to go to university, but the ones who manage it are much more likely to study at a post-1992 institution where little or no research is undertaken in their subjects. For example, data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency for 2015/16 shows that one Russell Group university had only 3.1% of first-year undergraduates from deprived neighbourhoods and attracted total research income of £423,000 per member of teaching staff, whereas a former polytechnic had almost 30% of these students but only earned £6,192 per member of staff. Thus many students are being deprived, in some subjects, of the opportunity to be taught by world experts or to be involved in leading-edge projects. This is certainly no reflection on the quality of the teaching they receive or the quality of research that is being undertaken, but does indicate that they are missing something that more affluent students are getting. They are being let down by a system introduced in 1992, when the polytechnics became universities. Before then, universities received money for teaching plus funds to enable a basic amount of research to be undertaken – thus allowing them to compete for further funds from research councils, charities etc. After 1992, the older universities realised that if the former polytechnics were treated the same, there would be less money given out for research to the pre-1992 universities. And so the Research Assessment Exercise was born – a system designed specifically to starve the new universities of research income. Despite enormous efforts on the part of the newer universities, their research income is tiny in relation to the older, established institutions. It is time that a higher education system fit for the many not the few is established. Research funds from the funding councils should be allocated evenly across institutions, as they were before 1992, so that all students have the same learning opportunities. Ted Smith Preston, Lancashire • Simon Jenkins perpetuates the “one size fits all” myth surrounding higher education: everyone must have a degree. In the past we had a well-established, and respected, approach involving apprenticeships and study to City and Guilds for craftspeople and ONC/HNC for technicians. Apprenticeships were of four or five years’ duration. Students studied part-time with their employers commonly paying their fees: university was for high-flying academic types. The contribution of engineers qualified by this route is all about us; most of the country’s infrastructure was designed and constructed by them. Employment wasn’t a problem; people left school one day and started work the next. This was the heady “full employment” days of the 1950s. Now we produce graduates with no thought to their employment or career prospects, rather than the well-trained and qualified craftspeople and technicians that industry needs. The trouble is that as a nation we don’t appear to have a national strategy for the regeneration of old and the development of new industries about which to clothe future education and training policy! David Woods Lichfield, Staffordshire • Simon Jenkins says that 77% of university academics are reportedly on the political left, and that this hardly makes universities a uniquely civilising force. I would contend, as an ex-university lecturer, that they are a very important civilising force, particularly for young people, giving them time and space to not be conditioned by rightwing society.

The British prime minister, Theresa May, declared that trade talks would start “straight away”, directly contradicting the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who said they would start in March. As in the first round of talks, the sequencing will be set by the EU and has already been outlined by Juncker and in a European council text on Friday. January 2018 The European commission is to put forward recommendations on the transition arrangements that will form part of the withdrawal agreement. This may take into account the future relationship with the UK but the commission is stressing this would only be “a political declaration” of the EU’s vision. January to March 2018 The EU is to develop and produce its guidelines for the future agreement. The commission will hold five or six seminars with member states on their Brexit intentions and seek clarity from the UK about its own vision of the final relationship. The UK is to translate “faithfully” the commitments undertaken in the phase one Brexit deal “into a legally binding document”. March to October 2018 Negotiations begin on the withdrawal agreement including “preliminary and preparatory discussions” on the final deal. The political emphasis is on trade, but negotiations will also be held on key issues such as defence, security, justice, and the future of EU funding mechanisms for science such as Horizon 2020, in which the UK wants to continue to participate. The UK has opted for a two-year transition deal, but discussion on extending this can be held during this period if necessary. October 2018 The deadline for a withdrawal agreement to be put to the European council. Approval is needed from at least 20 countries or 65% of the EU population.

EU rules apply during this period. 2021 If a deal is not complete, two options follow: a “bare bones” free trade agreement with sectoral deals on aviation and fisheries is likely so as to avoid chaos.

Philip Alston, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, has completed a two-week official tour of the US by releasing an excoriating attack on the direction of the nation. Not only does he warn that the tax bill currently being rushed through Congress will hugely increase already large disparities between rich and poor, he accuses Trump and his party of consciously distorting the shape of American society in a “bid to become the most unequal society in the world”. “American exceptionalism was a constant theme in my conversations,” he writes. “But instead of realizing its founders’ admirable commitments, today’s United States has proved itself to be exceptional in far more problematic ways that are shockingly at odds with its immense wealth and its founding commitment to human rights. As a result, contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound.” In his most stark message, Alston warns that the Republicans’ declared intent to slash crucial welfare programs next year in order to pay for some of the $1.5tn tax cuts could cost American lives. “The consequences for an already overstretched and inadequate system of social protection are likely to be fatal for many programs, and possibly also for those who rely upon them,” he writes. Alston’s piercing findings present the Trump administration with a challenge. The charge that the US president is actively seeking to harm millions of Americans may be difficult to ignore, given that the report carries the imprimatur of the UN human rights council in Geneva. Trump has frequently been dismissive of the world body, complaining during the 2016 presidential campaign that “we get nothing out of the United Nations other than good real-estate prices”. But he has also shown himself to have a thin skin when it comes to criticism of him or his administration. At a press conference launching his preliminary report in Washington, Alston quipped about possible Trump reaction: “I’m hoping for a tweet”. Bernie Sanders, the US senator who has led the debate on inequality, has waded into the fray. He met the UN monitor on Friday and sounded his own alarm about the future of the country. Sanders said that as the “wealthiest country in the history of the world” the US should be providing a model in how to treat all of its citizens with dignity. “Sadly that is not the case. We are moving into 2018 – we should not be living in a country with 41 million people living in poverty and so many more in extreme poverty, and nobody even talks about it.” Alston invited Paul Ryan to meet him but was told the Republican speaker of the House was too busy. In his 15-day fact-finding mission, Alston, an Australian academic and law professor at New York University, visited Los Angeles and San Francisco, Alabama, Georgia, Puerto Rico and West Virginia, talking to low-income families as well as governmental officials. He will produce a final report next May and that in turn will go before the UN human rights council. Alston takes a strip out of the US for what he suggests are its double standards over human rights. The Trump administration, in line with previous US governments, preaches about human rights to other countries while refusing to be bound itself by international rules. “The US is alone among developed countries in insisting that while human rights are of fundamental importance, they do not include rights that guard against dying of hunger, dying from a lack of access to affordable healthcare, or growing up in a context of total deprivation. But denial does not eliminate responsibility or negate obligations.” Alston is also scathing about the attitudes of some of the politicians and officials he met on his tour, who subscribe to what he calls the caricature of rich people as industrious and entrepreneurial and poor people as “wasters, losers and scammers”. He writes: “Some politicians and political appointees with whom I spoke were completely sold on the narrative of such scammers sitting on comfortable sofas, watching color TVs, while surfing on their smartphones, all paid for by welfare. I wonder how many of these politicians have ever visited poor areas, let alone spoken to those who dwell there.” At the press conference, Alston said that current US trends were undermining democracy. “Democracy is the foundation stone upon which this country is built, the contribution of which it has been most proud internationally. And yet what we see is the lowest voter turnouts in any developed country.” He pointed to the disenfranchisement of former prisoners, as well as covert voter suppression efforts such as the imposition of voter ID requirements as examples of the way the political rights of low-income people were being eroded. Latest figures put the number of Americans living in poverty at 41 million – almost 13% of the population. Of those, almost half (19 million) are living in deep poverty, defined as having a total family income that is below one-half of the poverty threshold. In a report packed with depressing evidence, the UN rapporteur tries to give a positive spin to his findings, saying that with the wealth that abounds in the US the country is in a position to solve its poverty and inequality crisis. “The persistence of extreme poverty is a political choice made by those in power. With political will, it could readily be eliminated.” In a phrase that might reverberate around Capitol Hill and the White House, Alston concludes: “The American Dream is rapidly becoming the American Illusion since the US now has the lowest rate of social mobility of any of the rich countries.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/15/alan-sinfield-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T18:38:41Z","webTitle":"Alan Sinfield obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/15/alan-sinfield-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/15/alan-sinfield-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Alan Sinfield obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alan Sinfield, who has died aged 75, pioneered queer studies in Britain and added new dimensions to the understanding of Shakespeare. He made complex theoretical ideas accessible both in his teaching at the University of Sussex and in his writing, continually relating his readings of past texts to issues in the present. Much of his work, ranging from Elizabethan drama to popular culture, reaches beyond academia. It encompasses postwar literature, culture and politics; 20th-century theatre; Oscar Wilde, Tennyson and modern pop music. Running through it all is his concern with the relationships between cultural forms and political and economic power; with social exclusion and sexual identity; and with the collective potential to subvert or transform society and its cultures. Alan explored the intricate and often perverse intersections of sexuality with other power relations – age, race, gender and, above all, class. The Wilde Century (1994), for example, explores how notions of “queerness” – closely linked to upper-class effeminacy through much of the 20th century – were shaped by Wilde’s position as a scandalous celebrity, and contrasts this with very different expressions of same-sex desire in the Renaissance and the 18th century. He showed how shared identities are formed within queer subcultures by appropriating and transforming widely circulating stories, plays, songs and images. In Out on Stage (1999), he explores how Samuel Beckett’s absurdist plays had a particular resonance for the gay community during the HIV/Aids crisis of the early 1980s, and Gay and After (1997) analyses the ways in which the Pet Shop Boys’ hit single Go West became a gay anthem in the mid 1990s. In 1990, Alan was a co-founder of the first MA course in queer studies in Britain, Sexual Dissidence and Cultural Change. This bold and innovative programme was attacked in the redtop press, but has come to hold importance for many people who are now driving debates about sexual politics, identity and gender. Literature in Protestant England 1560-1660 (1983), a study of the responses of Renaissance writers to the tensions inherent in English Puritanism, laid the groundwork for Political Shakespeare (1985), co-edited with his then partner, Jonathan Dollimore. This book transformed the teaching of Shakespeare in British and American universities, with Alan maintaining that Shakespeare’s entrenched position in the school curriculum set up some children to fail and encouraged conformity in others. Alan aimed not simply to replace one viewpoint with another, but to investigate what lies behind the conflict between interpretations. He also insisted on the potential for finding alternative meanings, and in his book Faultlines (1992) he outlined the principle of dissident reading to expose how dominant cultural forms – whether in Shakespeare’s time or our own – are never as seamless as they might appear. Mid 20th-century productions of Julius Caesar, for example, turned the play into a warning against political engagement, portraying Brutus as a reluctant intellectual, propelled by his principles into an act of violence that inevitably rebounds. But the play is also a study of mass manipulation, and Mark Antony’s famous address to his “Friends, Romans, countrymen” exposes the use of dubious methods to gain power over people by winning their allegiance. In Shakespeare, Authority, Sexuality (2007), Alan reads Measure for Measure alongside an Amnesty International dossier on sexual violence. “Does the play finally reaffirm the idea that the state should control sexual expression?” he asks. If even Shakespeare cannot be relied on to supports ideals of truth and justice, “How can we hope to ground a concept of universal human rights, upon which Amnesty may depend?” Born in Southgate, north London, Alan was the son of Lucy (nee Seabright), a cafe assistant and Ernest Sinfield, an insurance salesman who was conscripted into the air force and lost in action over Norway in 1944. The family lived in considerable poverty on his mother’s war widow’s pension and family allowance, and Lucy contracted early-onset Parkinson’s disease soon after Ernest’s death; nonetheless, she provided a secure, loving home for Alan and his younger brother Mark. The failure of the welfare state to fully include people like Lucy made Alan acutely aware of the limitations of the postwar promise to provide equal access to the nation’s resources, which he went on to explore in Literature, Culture and Politics in Postwar Britain (1989). Alan attended the Royal Wolverhampton school, an independent boarding school originally founded as an orphanage, on a scholarship for the children of parents killed in military service. He graduated with a first-class BA from University College London in 1964, completing an MA there in 1967, and receiving a DLitt from UCL in 1987. His MA dissertation on the language of Tennyson’s In Memoriam became his first book, in 1971. In 1965 Alan was appointed as a lecturer in English at Sussex, then still a very new university with a strong commitment to breaking down disciplinary boundaries. He developed his distinctive form of cultural materialism during the late 1970s, when a group of younger lecturers arrived and disrupted what by then seemed a rather traditional English syllabus: his second book, Alfred Tennyson (1986), turned his earlier interpretation of the poet inside out. Sussex now developed its reputation as the most exciting, theoretically informed English department in the country, pioneering wider changes in the way English is taught in universities, with Alan a key figure. A generous supporter of younger colleagues, he remained at Sussex for the rest of his career, despite being wooed by American universities. Alan retired from the university as emeritus professor in 2004 when Parkinson’s disease began to affect his speech, but continued to write until this became impossible. Vincent Quinn, the partner whom he met at Sussex in the mid-1990s, became his full-time carer and made it possible for his life to end peacefully at home. He is survived by Vincent and Mark. • Alan James Sinfield, scholar of literature and queer studies, born 17 December 1941; died 2 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/shortcuts/2017/dec/18/farewell-rufus-the-guardians-record-breaking-crossword-setter","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"Farewell Rufus, the Guardian’s record-breaking crossword setter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/shortcuts/2017/dec/18/farewell-rufus-the-guardians-record-breaking-crossword-setter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/shortcuts/2017/dec/18/farewell-rufus-the-guardians-record-breaking-crossword-setter","fields":{"headline":"Farewell Rufus, the Guardian’s record-breaking crossword setter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Since Araucaria died four years ago, Roger Squires (Rufus to Guardian crossword solvers) has been our longest-serving, oldest and most popular crossword setter. From his house in Shropshire above the River Severn, looking down on the famous 1781 Iron Bridge, he has produced a regular stream of delightful puzzles. Roger has decided that, after 35 years, the time has come to call it a day. He came to the paper in 1982 when, as crossword editor of the Birmingham Post, he was invited to the London launch of a new edition of the Collins dictionary. There, he met John Perkin, then Guardian crossword editor, and the rest is history. His puzzles have subsequently been published in all the national broadsheets and in at least 100 other publications in more than 30 countries – earning him an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s most prolific crossword compiler. The event that led to this phenomenal and organised energy was that his first wife left him and their young children, so he was determined to find a steady source of income for his one-parent family that could be generated without having to leave home. Before that, he had done many things, starting as a boy seaman in the Royal Navy and ending as a lieutenant in the Fleet Air Arm (a time that included escaping from a sinking aircraft 60ft under water). After selling a puzzle to the Radio Times in 1963, he earned money as a professional crossword setter/magician/comedy actor (BBC’s Crackerjack, ITV’s Crossroads). Then, perforce, he devoted himself exclusively to crosswords. In 2012, the Guardian threw a party to celebrate Roger’s 80th birthday. His colleague Araucaria (also known as the Rev John Graham), then aged 91, was unable to come but wrote this doggerel instead.

Rustic brickwork glows in the winter sun; in bright corners the skeletal arms of buddleia seem to beckon the ghosts of bees; and everywhere you look the light is reflected by shimmering glass. There are 13 crumbling, deeply atmospheric glasshouses – the “Demanding Ladies” – most of them more than 140 years old. There’s a shaded fern house, a long, leaning peach case, a sunken glass corridor for melons and pineapples, a pelargonium house, a carnation house, a hot house with great vats that once steamed with heated water. Emma and Monty Davies bought the garden in 2010 and tried valiantly to preserve the decrepit collection of greenhouses – one of the largest in the country. Maintenance required thousands of pounds; restoration a small fortune. The couple moved into a tiny cottage in the corner of the garden, opening a café and selling a superb range of plants. But each winter left its mark, with broken panes, warped wood, and a sense of neglect that, while picturesque, felt like it might swiftly turn terminal. The walled garden had been part of the Tongswood estate, a 1,000-acre slice of Kent centred on a neo-gothic mansion owned by CE Gunther, whose father, George, invented the Oxo cube. The stately home became a prep school in 1945, and the gardens were leased to a succession of market gardeners, none of whom could afford the upkeep of the Demanding Ladies. Just as the Davieses were beginning to despair, they had a phone call from the granddaughter of Gunther’s long-serving head gardener. In 1940 she’d been evacuated from London to her grandfather’s house – Tongwood’s South Lodge. All of her life she’d carried the picture of that walled garden, those greenhouses, in her mind. Now a widow in her 80s, with no children, she wanted to leave a legacy. Thanks to a £200,000 cheque from this anonymous benefactor, restoration work has already begun. When I visited in December, the glasshouses were slick with new paint. There’s a great deal more to be done, but the Demanding Ladies can now look forward to a bright, sparkling future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/15/anna-soubry-receives-messages-calling-for-her-to-be-hanged-as-a-traitor-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T17:21:24Z","webTitle":"Anna Soubry receives messages calling for her to be hanged as a traitor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/15/anna-soubry-receives-messages-calling-for-her-to-be-hanged-as-a-traitor-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/15/anna-soubry-receives-messages-calling-for-her-to-be-hanged-as-a-traitor-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Anna Soubry receives messages calling for her to be hanged as a traitor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Anna Soubry, one of the 11 Conservative MPs who defied government whips this week when the government suffered its first Commons defeat over Brexit, has received multiple messages saying she should be hanged as a traitor. Messages received by Soubry’s office – usually seen first by her parliamentary staff – also feature abuse, with one Facebook message saying: “Go hang yourself slag.” It follows death threats to Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, who drew up the amendment to the EU withdrawal bill that passed on Wednesday by 309 votes to 305, ensuring MPs must have a final vote on any Brexit deal. The rebellion prompted a scathing response by some newspapers. The Daily Mail said 11 “self-consumed malcontents” had betrayed their leader, party and 17.4 million Brexit voters. On Twitter, a post by Soubry defending herself against the Mail’s attack prompted a reply: “You and these traitors should be hung in public.” Another Twitter user posted a link to a separate Daily Mail article that claimed Soubry and other rebels had celebrated their success with champagne, something the MP has vehemently denied. A reply to this tweet compared Soubry to William Joyce, known as Lord Haw Haw, who was hanged after the second world war for his wartime radio broadcasts from Nazi Germany. It ended: “Traitor Anna Soubry deserves to stand trial for the same crime.” Other tweets called for the Queen to seek treason charges against Soubry so she could be hanged, while another said: “Back in the day you would have walked through traitors gate and been beheaded in the tower of London, you are the true definition of a traitor.” Emails sent to Soubry’s office, and seen by the Guardian, took similar lines. One, from a man in Tonbridge, Kent – about 150 miles from Soubry’s Broxtow constituency – read: “You deserve to be HUNG for your attack on our democracy yesterday. WE VOTED OUT! OUT! OUT!” The writer, who gave his full address and telephone number, ended the email: “MAY YOU BURN IN HELL FOR ETERNITY.” Another rebel Tory MP, Sarah Wollaston, also said that she had been threatened. Soubry told the Guardian her main worry was for her staff: “As with all members of parliament they have access to my emails, they take the phone calls. So they have to read all this stuff. I think people forget it’s the parliamentary staff who feel even more intimidated than members of parliament.” The media had “fuelled a lot of this”, Soubry argued: “The words in certain newspapers are replicated – so ‘mutineer’ is then in an email saying: ‘We all know what happens to mutineers, let’s see you hanging from a lamppost or a tree.’ “I got an email from somebody yesterday saying: ‘In the past, traitors were taken out and shot.’ It’s appalling. I’m sure some of these people, if they took a step back, would actually be appalled themselves. But they are being whipped up into a frenzy by certain sections of the media that have frankly lost the plot.” While the abuse came from a tiny minority of people, Soubry said, it seemed indicative of deep divisions in the country that were not being addressed. “It’s the job of government to do everything they can to bring people together, and it’s the responsibility of everybody in public life to build a more tolerant society,” she said. The idea perpetuated in some newspapers that she and other Tory rebels were seeking to overturn Brexit was nonsense, Soubry said. “I said I will honour the result of the referendum, so I voted to trigger article 50. So, I accept we are leaving the European Union, even though the result was close. My argument now is how do we get the best deal, and I want parliament, finally, to be involved in getting the best deal for our country. Why does that make me a traitor?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/17/my-christmas-present-to-you","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"My Christmas present to you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/my-christmas-present-to-you","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/my-christmas-present-to-you","fields":{"headline":"My Christmas present to you","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The gift guides are out again! Regular readers will know how infuriated I am by those Christmas gift guides. Pages and pages of newsprint, all given over to the advice that we should consider buying our relatives a pair of socks or a bottle of wine. Adding insult to insult, they invariably divide these “ideas” into relatives (“A lipstick for your wife! A book for your mum! A bottle of wine for Grandpa!”) just to make sure that nobody shops beyond the boundaries of age and gender stereotype. Not only must we buy the same old stuff every year, we must make the same old assumptions. Women love clothes. Kids love sweets. Men love golf calendars. In defence of the Daily Mail (a phrase I hear myself using more often, these days, than I would ever have predicted), at least they made their 2017 gift guide “plastic free”. This is a refreshing and useful campaign. Unfortunately, it’s a list of plastic-free really boring things. It’s still just booze and bath salts for the usual suspects: cardboard bottle of gin for him, bamboo make-up palette for her. But regular readers will remember with a thrill of joy that I have been publishing my own gift guide for more than 10 years, helping to personalise our relations a little more. In my guide, I recommend appropriate presents for major celebrity names from the year. Thus, instead of forcing loved ones into the pigeon holes provided by the more traditional gift guides, readers can simply scroll down to find the perfect present for whichever of their uncles most closely resembles Lady Gaga. Despite its longevity, I haven’t actually published the VCM-patent Excellent Gift Guide for a couple of years. If none of the above rings a bell, that suggests you have only recently discovered the Observer, or you have avoided my contributions to it more successfully in the past than you have today, or – like me – you’ve long forgotten anything you’ve ever previously read or seen and it’s as much as you can do to remember what day you’re meant to put the bins out. I didn’t write one in 2015 because I was on maternity leave. And I didn’t write one in 2016 because everyone was dead. Every name that sprang to mind, of a person that had loomed large last year, was a name on a memorial: Victoria Wood, David Bowie, Terry Wogan, Alan Rickman, Ronnie Corbett, Prince… 2016 really was a bloody terrible year. All those deaths, of all those brilliant and lovable people, seemed to presage an annus horribilis all over the world. Everything felt suddenly terrifying and doomed. The piece I filed last December instead of the “gift guide” may be the bleakest thing I’ve ever written – and I’ve written my phone number on a stripper’s bicep. Reading that column back now, I’m cheered to discover that, however awful 2017 has intermittently been, it felt a lot worse last year. We’re on the up! Or we’ve got used to the constant relentless down! Merry Christmas! So let’s crack on with a cheery gift guide for this season, in hope of a happy new year. Retired grandpa Your grandad finally retired this year. His creaky old bones and increasing deafness were creeping up on him; the time has come to step back, smell the roses and meet new people. Or meet the roses and smell new people. Grandpa was always open-minded about that sort of thing. For Usain Bolt: an evening course in duplicate bridge. Difficult neighbour He’s noisy, obstreperous, confused and vulgar, but what can you do? There he just is. You still don’t really understand how he came to be there. The council says they can evict him but it may take another seven years. For as long as he’s in situ, you have to try to get on. If you can forge a special relationship then, while he will inevitably piss on your lawn when it suits him, at least he won’t put a petrol bomb through the letter box. For Donald Trump: a cup of sugar. Successful sister She’s always been more successful than you, ever since the first time her Mr Potato Head got a round of applause and yours fell in a bin. After Christmas, she’s starting another amazing new job. But she’s nervous; it’s a high-pressure post and she’s got big shoes to fill. After a jealous history, you want to be uncomplicatedly supportive. You want a gift that is loving and heartfelt, that reflects her individuality, that spells: I’m proud of you! You will succeed on your own terms! You will make this role your own! For Jodie Whittaker: a lovely, warm, multicoloured woollen scarf. Obstructive colleague Cocky, disrespectful, constantly trying to undermine you, this guy needs taking down a peg or two. He needs his confidence dented. He needs his self-esteem whittled away. Ultimately, he needs to be completely demoralised and made to feel like an idiot. For Grant Shapps: Only Connect, The Official Quiz Book. That’ll take the spring out of anyone’s Christmas. Unexpected guests It’s always important to have something to hand in case of surprise additions to the list. Someone turns up that you weren’t expecting to see, or someone turns up bringing someone that you weren’t expecting to see… A new twist can bring all sorts of joy and amusement – the more the merrier! – so be sure to have a little something up your sleeve to make them feel welcome. Something appropriate that they’re bound to want.

The purchase is Apple’s biggest since 2014, when it spent $3bn on headphone manufacturer Beats Electronics, and is one of the largest acquisitions this year for the British tech sector. It follows the sale of Imagination Technologies, which makes the graphics processors used in iPhones and iPads, to a Chinese private equity firm for $550m (£412m) in September. Both purchases pale in comparison to a pair of acquisitions made in 2016, however. Flight comparison site Skyscanner sold itself to Chinese tourism group Ctrip for £1.4bn in November of that year, while shortly after the EU referendum, the chip designer ARM accepted a £24.3bn offer from Japanese group SoftBank. The ARM deal, announced just weeks after the UK voted to leave the EU, was the second-largest foreign takeover of a UK-listed company ever, behind only ABInBev’s deal to buy SABMiller. That acquisition also serves as a counter to one popular explanation for the spate of buyouts: that it’s simply a function of the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Yes, the pound plummeted against the yen after the referendum – but ARM’s share price rose by a corresponding 17%, as the company makes most of its revenue in dollars. That meant that the actual price SoftBank paid for ARM rose in the weeks following the referendum. More generally, big mergers and acquisitions are often laid in place far too far in advance for the vagaries of the foreign exchange market to affect them, says Paul Hollingsworth, the senior UK economist at Capital Economics. “Whether we’re seeing any sort of Brexit or pound effect, it’s a bit too soon – it’s really going to be a couple of years before any effect appears.” Sriram Prakash, the lead for innovation M&amp;A at Deloitte, agrees. “First and foremost, in any M&amp;A transaction you buy a company not because it’s cheap, but because it’s good. And then, it might be cheap because of currency devaluations or whatever, and that might add to the speediness [and attractiveness] of the transaction, but the fundamentals are important.” For British firms, then, it’s all about the fundamentals. Those making the headlines for the size of their valuation aren’t acquired for the revenue they bring in, or the size of their existing customer base, but for their world-leading grasp of basic technologies, says Priya Guha, the general manager of startup accelerator RocketSpace. “What it comes down to is the UK strength in deep tech,” Guha says. “The UK still has some of the most amazing academic research coming out of its universities. And that is being commercialised at a rate that much higher than elsewhere in the EU and getting close to what happens in the States.” “So what that means is you have some of the most groundbreaking new technologies being developed right here in the UK. And yes, of course, that becomes a very appealing target for US companies who need that technology to be able to scale or just own a new direction for their own business.” Perhaps the poster child for that sort of acquisition is DeepMind, acquired by Google in 2014 for $650m: the company, co-founded by UCL researcher Shane Legg, with Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, retains strong links to the London university today. Even more emblematic of how a strong research background enables Britain to punch above its weight is Twitter’s acquisition in June 2016 of machine learning-based image and video compression firm Magic Pony Technology. The company had just 11 staff at the time, and while its core technology was already wowing investors, it had no revenue, nor a plan of how to get any. Yet it was acquired for $150m and now forms the core of Twitter’s machine-learning project, Cortex. While such a string of acquisitions certainly represents a massive inward flow of cash to Britain, it could have its downsides. If Britain’s most promising startups always pick guaranteed cash now, over the prospect of a much bigger payoff later, then the nation will never have its own tech giants to rival Apple, Google and Facebook. Take Snapchat: it could have accepted Facebook’s $3bn offer in 2013, but chose to reject it and try to build something that could become a Facebook competitor, not simply a department within the firm. Even now, after a rocky year following its initial public offering, the company is worth almost $20bn. Is Britain doing itself out of the chance to lead the world? Guha thinks not. “No one would suggest that DeepMind has lessened its global impact by being part of Google,” she notes. “Despite being part of the bigger Alphabet machine, DeepMind is renowned in its own right across the world.” And, she adds, if there is going to be a UK rival to the US giants, “it was not going to be Shazam. For others in the market, M&amp;A can be a really good outcome.” Prakash says he is “empathetic to both sides. On one hand, every country needs a strong tech scene, and today Britain’s looks a bit fragile if you note the amount of tech companies in the FTSE 100 and 250. But these companies cater for global markets. To be global you have to be acquired, or see whether you can scale up to that level yourself. If you can’t, what are your options?” Perhaps those who hope British companies would hold out a bit longer before being acquired should be careful what they wish for. Depending on how Brexit progresses, there is the potential for many of Britain’s strengths, from its world-leading universities to an immigration system that is comparatively open to skilled migrants, to be erased. “Clearly,” says Hollingsworth, “the pound’s drop makes it a more attractive proposition to buy UK companies, but you have to weigh that against the domestic political uncertainty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/17/twilight-zone-review-retro-anxieties-another-dimension-almeida","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T07:50:25Z","webTitle":"The Twilight Zone review – retro anxieties from another dimension","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/17/twilight-zone-review-retro-anxieties-another-dimension-almeida","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/17/twilight-zone-review-retro-anxieties-another-dimension-almeida","fields":{"headline":"The Twilight Zone review – retro anxieties from another dimension","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Can irony and fear coexist in the theatre? Anne Washburn’s ingenious adaptation of The Twilight Zone shows it’s a slippery combination. Knowingness strangles anxiety. In Mr Burns, Washburn used episodes of The Simpsons to examine a devastated America. Now she looks at her country through the television nightmares of the late 50s and early 60s. Travellers on a coach realise that one of their number must be an alien: no one can figure out who it is – though the audience gets a hint from one passenger’s whirligig eyes. A child is sucked from her cot into an otherworldly dimension. Returning to earth, an astronaut finds that his fellow voyager in space is seen only by him. There are cryogenics, terrifying plastic surgery – and the threat of nuclear annihilation. Director Richard Jones and designer Paul Steinberg evoke the black-and-white originals with added archness. The drilling theme tune is replicated, as is the stunned style of acting: John Marquez, taking the part of the sonorous narrator, is particularly good at deadpanning. As tribute turns to parody, what is lost is the hysterical belief that made the episodes so compelling, as thriller plots slithered into the supernatural, and projected the terrors of the cold war. Washburn has cut and spliced episodes, with the result that the narrative drive wavers. She does leave intact a scene in which neighbours fall out over the occupation of a nuclear bunker. It’s impressive – but underlines too heavily the political content of a series in which the uncanny begins to look penetrating. The disappearance of figures from newspaper photos, which at first seems merely spooky, carries memories of the doctoring of pictures in the former Soviet Union.

All great riders have to be. It’s the faculty that allows them to spot the moment at which to strike. The first time we saw that in Froome was when he sensed a weakness in Bradley Wiggins on the ascent of La Toussuire during the Tour de France five years ago, and had to be ordered to cease his attack on his own team leader. When Froome joined Team Sky, he was simply taking another opportunity. Born in Kenya to British-born parents and educated in South Africa, eight years ago he left behind the country of his birth, with its limited resources, to sign a contract that also helped him to win a place in Britain’s lottery-funded Olympic cycling team, run from the same building in Manchester as the professional team, with shared facilities and personnel. Maybe that piece of opportunism lay behind the reluctance of the British public, although they admired his five grand tour victories in Team Sky’s colours, to take him to their hearts. He has barely raced or even stayed in Britain. He lives in Monaco – where, presumably, he pays a friendly rate of tax on the £4m a year that makes him the highest paid competitor in his sport. If he wants to know how his popularity has been affected by Wednesday’s revelation of twice the permitted level of salbutamol, an asthma medication, in a urine sample taken during his winning ride in this year’s Vuelta, he will get a swift answer at Sunday’s BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. Third in the ante-post post betting a week ago, behind Anthony Joshua and Lewis Hamilton, he will learn from the results of the combined live phone-in and online poll whether the public has lost its faith in him. He denies that the findings of the test were the result of improper behaviour on his part. But the wider world of British cycling will also be awaiting the Spoty result and wondering whether the sport’s remarkable rise in national popularity over the past decade can withstand the latest doubts over the conduct of Team Sky. While no one would suggest that salbutamol occupies the same universe of performance enhancement as the EPO and blood-doping employed by a previous generation of riders, it may be that the steady drip of stories concerning various relatively innocuous medications is once again eroding trust. Having had to mug up on the properties of triamcinolone and fluimucil in considering the allegations against Bradley Wiggins, who denies any wrongdoing, the public might be feeling that the introduction to salbutamol is one doctor’s prescription too many. Cycling as a leisure activity was already on the upswing when the gold medals started to flow for British riders at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 under a programme masterminded by Dave Brailsford, who used the platform as the basis from which to launch Team Sky two years later. But success on road and track certainly added impetus to a phenomenon which has filled the lanes of Britain with lycra-clad weekend warriors, many of them women, and provided huge numbers of spectators for stages of the Tour de France, Tour of Britain and Tour de Yorkshire. The foundations of the revival of interest in cycling seem firm enough to help it survive the awkward questions asked of Wiggins, Britain’s and Team Sky’s first Tour winner, and now of Froome. Whether Team Sky itself will survive is another matter. Twenty four hours after this newspaper’s reporters and their colleagues at Le Monde revealed Froome’s adverse analytical finding during the Vuelta, Team Sky’s bosses had their thoughts diverted towards an announcement that may carry an even greater existential threat. Rupert Murdoch’s decision to sell a large chunk of his empire to the Disney corporation – including his 39% stake in the Sky TV channels – carries with it the fear that the satellite broadcaster’s sponsorship of the world’s No1 cycling team will not long outlast the change of ownership. Team Sky is the pet project of James Murdoch. A cyclist and a fan of the sport, the younger son of Rupert Murdoch has enjoyed being close to the team during its successes. It was he who persuaded Sky’s board to put up an initial £25m and the subsequent annual investment that began at £10m and has since risen to £23m. This makes Team Sky the richest team in a peloton whose lesser squads are required to get by on a fraction of their budget. That alone would make them an obvious target for critics, never mind their self-imposed mission to crusade for 100% clean cycling, which has always raised the hackles of those resentful of what they see as a holier-than-thou attitude. Schadenfreude, a delight in others’ misfortunes, is never far away when Sky appear to fall below their own declared high standards of behaviour. Familiar accusations of pomposity and sanctimoniousness were given a further airing this week in the wake of the Froome revelations. The employment of salbutamol by means of an inhaler does not require a therapeutic use exemption certificate, but in other forms – oral and intravenous – and bigger doses it can have a performance-enhancing effect, which is why the upper limit is imposed even via inhalation. Froome has admitted that he needed extra puffs on the inhaler – sanctioned by his team’s doctor – that day in the Cantabrian mountains, but he will be required to show, with thorough medical evidence, that other factors played a part in raising the level above the acceptable limit. The onus of providing proof of innocence in order to avoid a suspension rests entirely on Froome’s shoulders. It will be a lengthy process – and an expensive one in terms of laboratory and legal costs. Given their resources, his team can certainly afford it. In fact, they cannot afford not to make every effort to provide it, in order to defend their own reputation as much as Froome’s. The attitude of Sky’s new owners, taking stock of the terms of the present two-year rolling contract, could depend on it. Others could be forgiven for concluding that, despite all Team Sky’s achievements in a tumultuous few years, the sport would now be a better place without them: without their “marginal gains”, without their pretentious corporate culture, without the outsize budget that inflates riders’ salaries and distorts competition, without their race-suffocating tactics, and without the miasma of doubt and innuendo that has settled over them and which no fresh breeze seems able to dispel. Perhaps their job is done."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/15/late-night-hosts-on-trumps-net-neutrality-repeal-absolutely-despicable","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T16:15:57Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts on Trump's net neutrality repeal: 'Absolutely despicable'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/15/late-night-hosts-on-trumps-net-neutrality-repeal-absolutely-despicable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/15/late-night-hosts-on-trumps-net-neutrality-repeal-absolutely-despicable","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts on Trump's net neutrality repeal: 'Absolutely despicable'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night hosts discussed the FCC’s decision to repeal net neutrality, criticizing the move as “absolutely despicable”. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert detailed the effect that it would have on consumers, potentially slowing down speeds and limiting access to certain sites. “The only thing that should slow your internet speed is the number of other people also working at Starbucks on their screenplays,” he said. The deregulation is accompanied by a rule that would force companies to detail what sites they are affecting. “Get ready for more fine print from your internet provider,” Colbert said. “At least you’ll have something to read while you wait for websites to load.” Finally he referred to Ajit Pai, the man who has been pushing it through, as “FCC chairman and big and tall tooth model”. On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed Trump’s attempt to discredit Robert Mueller’s probe into his cabinet’s dealings with Russia. Agents were sending anti-Trump texts during the election which has raised accusations of a biased investigation. “An FBI agent was sending texts in 2016 calling Trump an idiot,” Noah said. “How did he know? What other secrets is the FBI hiding?” Emails about Trump have also been shared but as Noah pointed out, they don’t make a lot of sense. “If you’ve ever been in a relationship then you know how dangerous it is to read a text out of context,” he said. It’s led to a coven of Fox News pundits calling for the probe to end and some even suggesting that the FBI is dismantled. “There’s a law enforcement agency that has some bad apples and even though it’s not everyone, they’re saying that’s enough misconduct to require a complete structural reform,” Noah said. “Because you may have only caught one bad cop but the problem here isn’t that person, it’s the system. So I agree with Trump’s people on Fox News: Black Lives Matter.” On Late Night with Seth Meyers, he started by talking about FCC chairman Ajit Pai and his much-ridiculed mug. “You can’t just drink from a mug that size without any explanation,” he said. “Is the mug always that big or did you shrink? Are you sharing an office with Rick Moranis?” It’s been reported that 75% of Republicans actually support net neutrality, something that didn’t surprise Meyers. “It makes sense that Republicans favor net neutrality as otherwise they’d have to get their news from newspapers or CNN instead of Facebook group PatriotEagleMAGA1776,” he said. Meyers then moved onto ex-Apprentice contestant Omarosa Manigault-Newman, who has resigned from her position in the White House under a cloud of drama. He started out by discussing the report that she brought her bridal party to DC to take pictures. “Trump staff treat the White House the way tourists treat the M&amp;M store,” he said. In an interview on Good Morning America, she spoke about the moment that Gen John Kelly spoke to her about her resignation, which some claim was a firing, in the situation room. “I have a feeling any room Omarosa goes in becomes the situation room,” Meyers said. “You know it’s bad when they fire you in the same place they killed Osama bin Laden.” He concluded: “So Republicans and the FCC are trying to dismantle the open internet despite overwhelming opposition and the Trump White House is once again consumed by petty drama.” On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host described the decision to repeal net neutrality as “absolutely despicable” before referring to Ajit Pai as a “jackhole”. He detailed the implications while adding: “Big corporations are about to take control of the internet so Merry Christmas everybody”. Finally he made a plea for people without healthcare to sign up for 2018 coverage. “Once net neutrality is gone, we might not even have WebMD anymore,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/17/waitrose-urged-to-stop-selling-shetland-scallops-over-dredging-concerns","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T11:29:20Z","webTitle":"Waitrose urged to stop selling Shetland scallops over dredging concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/17/waitrose-urged-to-stop-selling-shetland-scallops-over-dredging-concerns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/17/waitrose-urged-to-stop-selling-shetland-scallops-over-dredging-concerns","fields":{"headline":"Waitrose urged to stop selling Shetland scallops over dredging concerns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Waitrose has been urged to suspend sales of one of its premium products, an eco-certified king scallop from Shetland, which can sell heavily at Christmas.

Shetland’s scallops, along with two types of sought-after crab, were awarded a coveted eco-label for their sustainability from the Marine Stewardship Council five years ago, and command premium prices. The three fisheries were worth £5m last year. The scallop fishery is being reassessed by the MSC as part of a five-yearly reappraisal, which is expected to see it recertified early next year. Waitrose said unless the scallops lost that accreditation, they were justified in stocking them. The MSC has robustly defended its work, but Open Seas alleges that a recommendation to recertify the Shetland fishery failed to take account of evidence that it caught critically endangered common skate and skate eggs, and 7% of its catch was rare horse mussels. The fishery also included parts of a marine protected area and a special area of conservation. “Shellfish is neither premium nor sustainable if its harvest causes significant environmental damage,” said Phil Taylor, head of policy at Open Seas. “Any retailer promising that their seafood products are from sustainable sources is asking their customers to trust them with their environmental credentials. “Waitrose should be doing much better, and should commit to selling only those scallops that do not damage our seabed.” Scallop dredging is very controversial: its critics claim the technique is akin to strip-mining the sea bed, since it involves dragging heavy gear along the seafloor, catching and killing other species. Unlike much more expensive hand-dived scallops, where divers choose only mature scallops without affecting other species, conservationists say dredging can reduce brittle, coral-like species such as maerl, sponges and other mollusc beds to rubble. Some maerl and mollusc beds were affected in Shetland, Open Seas said, but the sale of any dredged scallops raised questions for Waitrose. Its range includes dredged scallops from British waters on sale for £35 a kilo. Waitrose insists it applies stringent tests to its seafood products, and insists on full traceability of all its scallops. Its skippers and suppliers know how strict its rules are, the retailer has said. “Waitrose introduced the concept of responsibly sourced seafood into UK supermarkets more than 20 years ago and we take our role in marine conservation very seriously,” a spokeswoman said. The MSC and the Shetland Shellfish Management Organisation (SSMO), a cooperative that overseas the islands’ inshore fisheries, insist they have robust scientific evidence and conservation strategies that ensure scallop dredging in Shetland is sustainable. Even so, the MSC decided last month to suspend its certification of Shetland’s velvet crab, a highly sought-after species exported live, particularly to restaurants in Spain. It said the crab population was not at sustainable levels and needed time to recover. An MSC spokesman said the recommendation to recertify the scallop fishery was made by independent experts and Open Seas criticisms would be taken into account before a final decision was made in January 2018. If Open Seas or any other group wanted to protest again after that decision, it had 14 days to do so. “Fundamentally, we don’t agree with Open Seas that these matters have been marginalised or neglected,” the spokesman said. “We wouldn’t agree that the assessment process was unduly narrow.” If the MSC did recertify the fishery, there would also be annual monitoring of its catches. Carole Laignel, of the SSMO, said it took rigorous steps to protect the marine environment. That included monitoring of its vessels, routine reporting of any rare or endangered species caught, and the closure of some areas to conserve stocks. “There is certainly a place for a well-managed community dredge fishery within the fabulous marine environment that we enjoy in Shetland,” she said. “We recommend that Open Seas refrain from uninformed and unfair comments on what remains a highly sustainable fishery.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/why-christmas-is-for-everyone-religion-christianity-atheism","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"Why Christmas is for everyone | Julian Baggini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/why-christmas-is-for-everyone-religion-christianity-atheism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/why-christmas-is-for-everyone-religion-christianity-atheism","fields":{"headline":"Why Christmas is for everyone","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Although I’m a card-carrying atheist, I have some sympathy with those who argue that a Christmas without Christ or a mass is as meaningless as celebrating a birthday without a birth, or a jubilee without a coronation. However, traditions have a habit of breaking free from their roots. Nobody is calling for Saturday or Wednesday to be renamed because we no longer worship Saturn or Wōden, the Roman and Norse gods who gave the days their names. The fact that hundreds of years ago our pagan midwinter festival was refashioned and renamed after Jesus does not give Christianity ownership of it in perpetuity. Disgruntled Christians would do better to seek common cause with anyone else, including thoughtful atheists, who wants Christmas to stand for more than just shopping and gorging. If they did so, they would see that a good atheist Christmas looks a lot like a good Christian one. The nativity myth centres on the birth of a child, but you don’t need to believe in the tale of the manger and the Magi to use Christmas as a time to celebrate the family, in spite or perhaps even because of its strains. The distasteful consumerism of Christmas today is simply an excess of a laudable desire to put extra resources into a once-a-year coming together. This should foster gratitude, which in turn draws our attention to those who lack family support or the material resources to push the boat out. So Christmas is also a time of hospitality and generosity. Many will be inviting people outside their families to share their Christmas lunches, while seasonal charity appeals (including that run by this newspaper) show that splashing out on ourselves is not incompatible with caring for others. Most obviously, Christmas is in effect a celebration of the winter solstice, four days late. Christians might think this is impious paganism, but all human cultures mark the passage of the seasons, whether they worship gods, nature or nothing at all. We can all be cheered by the lengthening of the days and the prospect of spring. Much of the value of Christmas is the same for anyone, irrespective of religious faith, or lack of it. But just as Christians bring their own distinctive faith to the holiday, so atheists appreciate an aspect of it that remains inaccessible to believers. Atheists are not just people who don’t believe in God. Put positively, our belief is that the natural world is all that there is. Only by fully accepting this fact can we live good lives that are true to our nature. The marking of midwinter brings these truths home. It reminds us that the cycle of life and death turned for aeons before we were born and will continue its rotations for aeons after. It exemplifies the legitimate hope that darkness can be followed by light but not the false hope that we can ultimately escape the fate of all living things. In our feasting, we are asserting the value of appreciating the good things while we have them, while remembering that nothing is meant to last, for good and for bad. These beliefs are not for the most part shared with Christians. But the solemnity with which we meditate on them and the joy with which we act on them very much echoes their blend of moral seriousness and festivity at Christmas. By remembering we’re all just trying to work out how to live good lives in the harshness of a sometimes cruel and perplexing world, we can share the Yuletide hope for peace on earth and goodwill to all.

Her dad sang with the Tremeloes through her childhood then, in the 90s, she and her sister Shelly were the duo Alisha’s Attic. Since then she’s written more than 35 UK top 10 hits, working with the likes of Kylie, Galantis and David Guetta. But in the kitchen of her north London home, you’re more likely to hear classical or ambient chill than pop. “In the car, our daughter Rose always puts Capital FM on,” says Karen. “But if I played dance tunes at home, I’d be in work mode, analysing it or thinking: ‘Hmm, not sure I’d do the pre-chorus like that…’” she says. “I prefer my home to be a place where I can switch off.” Karen shares this house with her husband David Etherington, a TV music composer, and their seven-year-old daughter. But with her platinum discs hidden away in her box-room studio, the decor is more about intrigue and vintage than music business bling. “I do like a bit of 70s glitz and Studio 54 glamour, but that’s all part of my love of retro style,” she says. “The 60s and 70s were such turning points in music, fashion and art, so finding pieces that evoke those eras, be it an original film poster or a Biba-esque wallpaper, is what motivates me.” Karen and David moved to this 30s home from an Edwardian house a few streets away. “These houses are still seen as less desirable by some people, because you don’t get very grand proportions,” she says. “But I love the nooks, the Arts and Crafts-style joinery and stained glass windows – they have a lot of character.” The house was, however, decorated in a “typical granny style” that needed a revamp. Karen and David knocked through downstairs to make an open-plan kitchen-diner linking the front and back spaces with a pair of salvaged glass doors. After that, it was all about painting, papering and adding plenty of decorative touches. Karen had a style steer from Audrey Carden of Carden Cunietti for the dining room and bathroom, but the rest is the result of trawls through eBay, vintage shops and online art galleries. “It’s taken a while to come together, but that’s what makes a home feel personal,” Karen says. The living room is painted in dark Hague Blue by Farrow &amp; Ball, while wallpapers by Lucy Tiffney and Anna Hayman add vivid pattern to a bedroom and the downstairs loo. An area of Rose’s room is papered in glittery pale purple. “She wanted sparkly disco paper – I can’t imagine where she got that idea from.” Hints of Karen’s music career come in the form of framed photographs around the house. An image of Demi Moore by Dave Stewart hangs in the living room (he produced Alisha’s Attic’s first album and remains a good friend); and one by photographer Anoushka Fisz, Stewart’s wife, takes pride of place in the bedroom. Terry O’Neill’s portrait of Paul Newman in the kitchen was a wedding present from Will Young. Other art has been chosen for its atmosphere – as with the pictures by Lucas Price, aka Cyclops, and Bob Cosford in the living room – or for its retro feel. An East German disco poster and one for the 1975 film The Story of O hang in the dining room, while a geometric string-art picture from a charity shop acts as a style litmus test in the hall. “Visitors either love or hate its pure 70s-ness,” says Karen. “And that’s fine. After all, a home is all about what’s personal to you.” Karen Poole is at @kazpoole"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/what-really-thinking-the-deaf-parent","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T09:00:08Z","webTitle":"What I’m really thinking: the deaf parent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/what-really-thinking-the-deaf-parent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/what-really-thinking-the-deaf-parent","fields":{"headline":"What I’m really thinking: the deaf parent","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What’s going on?

Having recently claimed the FBI’s reputation is in “tatters”, Trump launched his latest criticism following reports that former an FBI agent watered down director James Comey’s statement – in the midst of the 2016 presidential election race – on Hillary Clinton’s private email server and text messages. “It’s a shame what’s happened with the FBI,” the president told reporters on his way to boarding the Marine One helicopter. “But we’re going to rebuild the FBI. It will be bigger and better than ever.” Edits to the Comey draft statement appeared to soften the bureau’s finding in its 2016 investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. “But it is very sad when you look at those documents,” Trump added. “And how they’ve done that is really, really disgraceful, and you have a lot of very angry people that are seeing it. It’s a very sad thing to watch, I will tell you that.” The president then flew to an FBI campus in Quantico, Virginia, where he attended a ceremony for graduates of a 10-week professional course for US and international law enforcement officers. In his usual improvisational style, Trump seemed to go off script at one point as if to offer reassurance: “By the way, you are great people, you are incredible people,” he told the gathering. “Just so you understand, you are great people doing an incredible job.” Critics regard Trump’s frequent attacks on the FBI as an attempt to undermine the credibility of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of alleged collusion between his election campaign and Russia. FBI director Christopher Wray said Trump was the first president to address a graduating class at the FBI training centre since Richard Nixon. Trump was introduced by attorney general Jeff Sessions, after the pair sat awkwardly alongside one another on stage, apparently not talking and studiously avoiding eye contact. Trump has been openly critical of his attorney general’s decision to recuse himself from oversight of the Mueller inquiry into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and with Russia. Trump said earlier this year “if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else”. In his rambling address yesterday, the president seemed intent on beginning to heal the rift with the FBI and boosting his law and order credentials. “With me as your president, America’s police will have a true friend and loyal champion in the White House – more loyal than anyone else can be.” He complained: “Police departments are overstretched, they’re under-funded and they’re totally under-appreciated, except by me... Anti-police sentiment is wrong and it’s dangerous and we will not stand for it... We believe criminals who kill police officers should get the death penalty.” The line won cheers and applause. Not for the first time, Trump bemoaned violent crime in the cities of Chicago and Baltimore, both of which have big African American populations. “What the hell is going on in Chicago?” he demanded. “What the hell is happening there?” Citing recent terrorist attacks in New York, Trump condemned chain migration which allows family members to join relatives and the diversity immigrant visa programme, also known as the green card lottery. “They have a lottery: you pick people,” he said peevishly, motioning his hand as if drawing a name out of a hat. “Do you think the country’s giving us their best people?” He held out his arms in mock incredulity. “No. What kind of a system is that? “They come in by lottery. They give us their worst people. They put ‘em in a bin but in his hand, when he’s pickin’ ‘em, is really the worst of the worst. ‘Congratulations, you’re going to the United States, it’s OK.’ What a system, lottery system.” In fact the US Department of State – not the foreign countries the applicants come from – chooses who has been accepted by the lottery. Trump added angrily: “We’re calling on Congress to end chain migration and end the visa lottery system and replace it with a merit-based system of immigration.” The tirade had echoes of the billionaire businessman’s infamous campaign launch at Trump Tower in New York in June 2015 when he declared: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Under the green card lottery, up to 55,000 visas are distributed annually to a random selection of countries with lower rates of immigration to the US. Applicants are subject to a minimum education or work requirement. Guidelines posted on the state department website list these as the equivalent of high school in the US or a comparable course of study, and at least two years of experience over the last five years in an occupation requiring a minimum of two years training or experience to perform. Trump prompted laughter among the law enforcement and family attendees when he attacked the media. “There’s the fake news back there: look!’ he said, pointing to the back of the room. “No, actually some of them are fine people. Let’s see, who’s back there. Yeah, about 30%.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/15/chelsea-southampton-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T15:36:58Z","webTitle":"Chelsea v Southampton: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/15/chelsea-southampton-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/15/chelsea-southampton-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea v Southampton: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio Conte expects to “suffer” against Southampton, which was a surprising choice of words before the visit of a team thrashed at home in midweek by Leicester.

Don’t take selfies. Don’t touch Her Majesty’s knee under the table. Don’t tweet or email when you think she isn’t looking, and in particular don’t tweet or email her. If you are sitting on her left, it means that you aren’t the guest of honour and must not attempt to engage her in conversation until the second course. She will turn to you if you don’t know which the second course is. This is a selection of the information I’ve picked up from listening to enthusiasts of The Crown discussing what they’ve seen. I haven’t watched it myself – it’s enough that the rest of the world is watching for me – but I have a special interest in royal protocol, particularly when it comes to how to behave around a dinner table. How not to look disappointed when you see who you’re sitting next to, for example. How to spread your attention fairly. Do you begin with the person on your left or the person on your right? Or do you sit far back in your chair so you can talk in both directions at once? The Queen begins by turning right, but there is no rule determining which way commoners such as ourselves must turn, only that we remember to turn the other way when the plates are changed. Why it has taken me so long to grasp this I don’t know, but I’m relieved to have it settled. The food, not the company, decides the duration of the conversation. How wise a thing is protocol! At a stroke, it takes personalities out of the equation. It’s not because I have no prospects or tell the same story over and over again that Amal Clooney suddenly averts her head from me. It’s because the cheese and biscuits have arrived. A half-century of hurt feelings falls from me. All I need is for everyone else to grasp the rules as well. That way, I will never again be left to sit there like an untouchable in a neck brace, pretending to be interested in the details of a ceiling rose, while those on either side of me remain resolutely engrossed elsewhere. “Ahem!” I am now empowered to exclaim. “Haven’t you been watching The Crown? Soup’s over. You talk to me now.” And what if, as a consequence, they both converge on me at the same time? Which one do I choose? That’s something I will be asking the Queen the next time I’m sitting next to her, whichever side I’m on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/27/gambling-style-apps-offered-on-facebook-without-age-checks","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T19:00:25Z","webTitle":"Gambling-style apps offered on Facebook without age checks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/27/gambling-style-apps-offered-on-facebook-without-age-checks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/27/gambling-style-apps-offered-on-facebook-without-age-checks","fields":{"headline":"Gambling-style apps offered on Facebook without age checks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The company behind thousands of the UK’s fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) is offering gambling-style apps on Facebook without age checks, prompting allegations that children are being exposed to the risk of addiction. Earlier this month, the industry watchdog warned that more than 60,000 children were either gambling addicts or were in danger of becoming hooked. Experts have warned that games mimicking real-life gambling are the “number one risk factor” for developing a problem later in life. Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, who has launched a party review of gambling policy, said: “It is deeply worrying that games designed to get children in the habit of gambling are being marketed and played online. The company that makes these products is cynically targeting young people, some of whom are at risk of developing gambling addictions later in life.” Scientific Games, a US firm that has provided FOBTs to Ladbrokes and casino games for several gambling websites, makes a variety of these “social games”, available as apps on Facebook. One of its apps features the children’s cartoon characters The Flintstones, while another is themed around the Rapunzel fairytale and a third is called OMG! Kittens. One Christmas feature in Jackpot Party Casino Slots, just one of a range of gambling-themed apps made by Scientific Games, is called Toys for Tots. Speaking to the Guardian, Watson urged Facebook to investigate why the games were on its platform and to consider removing them. Social gaming was among the emerging risks singled out this week in a report by the Gambling Commission. The industry regulator found that children who played social games were more likely to bet money on adult gambling products. “Among young people who have ever played online gambling-style games, a quarter had spent their own money on any gambling activity in the past week, significantly higher than the average of 12% among all 11- to 16-year-olds,” the report says. The regulator has previously highlighted the prevalence of problem gambling among adults, with more than 2 million people deemed to be either problem gamblers or at risk of addiction. The Jackpot Party Casino Slots app available via Facebook is not technically a gambling product because money is not won or lost on games of chance. Instead, the app invites users to buy “coins” to use in dozens of casino-style games similar to gambling products available only to adults. A disclaimer buried in the app’s terms of service says the game is aimed at people over 21, but no age verification is required. A test purchase by the Guardian found that it was possible to buy coins within seconds using only a mobile phone, with the cost added to a monthly contract. Anyone who signs up to the app is sent email reminders, sometimes twice a day, offering bonuses and other perks. After a “win”, players are invited to “share free coins with your friends so they can win too!” Scientific Games, based in Las Vegas, is one of the largest providers of FOBTs. Users of the controversial machines, which campaigners say are particularly addictive and are the subject of a government consultation, lost at least £1,000 in one sitting on more than 233,071 occasions last year. Scientific Games also makes online gambling software for UK firms including William Hill, Betfred and Paddy Power Betfair. The company, which boasted in a submission to the UK government in 2013 of its “unquestionable credentials as a globally responsible business”, did not return requests for comment. Facebook also declined to comment. Tim Miller, the Gambling Commission’s executive director, said: “In regulating gambling, we actively seek views and evidence about the risks children face so we can improve protections, and we think the social gaming industry should do the same, listening to the concerns of parents and others.” The revelation that an FOBT company is offering casino-style games via Facebook comes just weeks after online gaming firms were told to remove similar products featuring cartoon characters from their websites, following an investigation by the Sunday Times. Mark Griffiths, professor of behavioural addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said social games were the “number one risk factor” for children becoming problem gamblers, even if hosted on Facebook rather than a gambling site. “What games like these do is behaviourally and socially condition children from an early age to be into gambling,” he said. “The thing about social networking games is that in the end you never lose. They set up unrealistic expectations of what gambling involves. If you win all that virtual money, you might think that if you’d been playing with real money you would have won too.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/20/fury-donna-brazile-hacked-book-thomas-frank","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"The fury around Donna Brazile is symptomatic of our times | Thomas Frank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/fury-donna-brazile-hacked-book-thomas-frank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/fury-donna-brazile-hacked-book-thomas-frank","fields":{"headline":"The fury around Donna Brazile is symptomatic of our times","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donna Brazile has spent most of her life as a good soldier of the Democratic party, managing presidential campaigns, supporting the Clinton family, and (last year) stepping in to take over the Democratic National Committee after its chair was felled by scandal. But with the publication of her campaign memoir Hacks, this woman with a fondness for old-style cooking metaphors has finally succeeded in pissing off every last group on the country’s political spectrum. Supporters of Bernie Sanders were furious last year when a hacked email revealed that Brazile, then a popular CNN commentator, had supplied a primary debate question in advance to Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump went at Brazile constantly during the 2016 campaign as a matter of partisan course. Now it is Clinton supporters and mainstream liberals who are heaping the abuse. Brazile’s present offense is that her book reveals an arrangement between the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC that effectively gave the campaign control over the party apparatus well before Clinton became the party’s official presidential nominee in 2016. Brazile has given serious substantiation, in other words, to the charge that Sanders and his followers threw at the Democratic party through much of last year: that the process was rigged. Members of the punditburo blasted Sanders last year for suggesting such a thing; now they are blasting Brazile for confirming it. They vituperate even though what she and Sanders have said is, well, true. Which is to say that the fury swirling around Donna Brazile is somehow symptomatic of our times. Since she had a front-row seat to everything that happened last year, her analysis and recollections of that volcanic election are valuable by definition. But what she has to tell us doesn’t fit easily into the simple moral framework that now guides all our thinkings on politics. For example. Donna Brazile wanted Hillary Clinton to be president and worked hard to achieve that result, but she also thinks Clinton and her team blundered repeatedly. This feels like common sense to me, but in the Republic of the Righteous it is a brain-stopping contradiction; it may not be uttered. Brazile regards Donald Trump as an obvious scoundrel, yet she can also understand how he appealed to ordinary Americans in the deindustrialized states. Again, not a startling insight, really – but try saying it in the pages of any American prestige publication. The reaction to her book, Brazile said when I phoned her this month, is as though she “had broken the holy grail of politics”. “I don’t see why we can’t have two or three or four or five different versions of what happened in 2016,” she continued. Her version seems pretty straightforward. “Hillary still got the vast majority of votes, but if her campaign would have just had one ounce of passion, one ounce of energy, and not just relied on the ‘old guard’ to bring out the new vote, she would be president today. But the fact that they took these states for granted – Donald Trump didn’t need to pick the lock. He could break the firewall by simply showing up.” Her exasperation with the Clinton campaign’s arrogance still burns. “They had it won, remember? They had it won. They didn’t need us.” Who is us?, I asked. “They didn’t need voters. They had it won. Because Robby [Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager] had the analytics and the data modeling and targeting. He didn’t have to come out of the ivory tower to talk to the average Joe and Jane.” It was a sterile, math-driven campaign in an angry, populist cycle – a perfect case of professional-class hubris that will one day take its place alongside the expert-planned, systems-analyzed war in Vietnam as a parable of technocratic folly. Brazile assured me when we spoke that she has no problem with big data, microtargeting and the rest of the modern campaign palette. But when you depend on them to the exclusion of the old face-to-face politicking, “you’re going to miss something. You’re going to miss people, you’re going to miss the mood, you’re going to miss the leadership, and you’re not going to get out your vote.” Brazile’s faith in human passion is refreshing. And also understandable after the failure of an algorithm-driven campaign that was so goddamned smart it knew better than to send its principal to the battleground state of Wisconsin. But in her book we can see that more human style of politicking going into eclipse. I’m referring here not to the rise of big data but to espionage. In Hacks, Brazile tells of struggling with DNC staffers who were double agents for the Clinton campaign. She recalls how undercover rightwing operatives infiltrated and embarrassed a liberal group. She describes in detail how the DNC removed sinister malware and spyware from its computers; then, failing the first time, how they had to do it all over again. For advice on all these woes Brazile turns to a man who, from her description, sounds like a former CIA agent. And of course the FBI got involved in the election too, with James Comey driving what she calls his “18 Wheeler” investigation right through the whole thing at the last moment. That’s where we are today: spies and lies; technocrats and math; fake populism and bad algorithms. How far we have gone from the noble causes for which people like Donna Brazile once signed up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/16/the-resistance-now-organizers-on-the-ground-scored-alabama-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"The Resistance Now: organizers on the ground scored Alabama victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/the-resistance-now-organizers-on-the-ground-scored-alabama-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/the-resistance-now-organizers-on-the-ground-scored-alabama-victory","fields":{"headline":"The Resistance Now: organizers on the ground scored Alabama victory","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Activists propel Jones to victory Alabama elected Doug Jones over Roy Moore on Tuesday, a victory which relied heavily on African American voters in the state – and the impressive turnout from those voters didn’t happen by accident. Organizers on the ground worked to mobilize people to vote for Jones, while the national Democratic party also used resources to get out the message. African Americans make up 26% of the population in Alabama, but 29% of those who voted on Tuesday were black, which helped get Jones over the line. Woke Vote, an Alabama organization which encourages young people to vote, was working for months in advance of the 12 December special election. Local television station WIAT reported that Woke Vote spent weeks at colleges across Alabama ahead of the election, registering voters ahead of election day. The Collective Pac, which usually supports African American candidates, donated to Jones, CNN reported, while activists Project South, a collection of southern grassroots organizations, also travelled to Alabama in the days ahead of the vote. BlackPac, a community organization which engages black communities politically, was among the groups on the ground, the New York Times reported, those organizations knocking “on more than half a million doors” and making “tens of thousands of phone calls”. Alongside that, Senate Majority Pac, which aims to get Democrats elected to the Senate, spent $6m on the Alabama race. Some $2m of that money went towards getting out the vote. Net neutrality The federal communications commission voted to end net neutrality rules which protect an open internet on Thursday, following months of debate and protest among activists for a free internet. Net neutrality activists had always expected the FCC to vote to dismantle the rules put in place by the Obama administration. The focus of groups like Save the Internet is to pressure members of Congress to intervene and ultimately overturn the FCC decision, and activists said that focus would continue in the wake of the vote. Save the Internet has put together a package of measures where people can call their elected officials and sign petitions registering their displeasure at the FCC vote.

So, in honour of Richard Curtis’s Christmas cracker: (a) Do you believe in love at first sight? (b) Did you and your partner fall in love at first sight? If you answered yes… Sorry, but science says you’re wrong, probably. A recent Dutch study gave singles the chance to meet potential partners both online and in a series of dating events. Plenty of people reported experiencing love at first sight (perhaps unsurprisingly, men more than women). But on further investigation, this seemed to reflect nothing more than physical attraction (even though some of the dating events allowed for as much as an hour and a half of getting-to-know-you chit-chat). Heartbreakingly, not one instance of “love at first sight” was reciprocated. The authors conclude that many love-at-first sight couples are a case of the love-at-first-sight experiencer “convincing” the other in retrospect that the feeling was mutual all along.

Thanks for your company. Bye! Mark Hughes’s side are just a point above the relegation zone tonight. Loud boos from the remaining Potters fans. And, Manchester City have needed only 14 minutes to ripple Hugo Lloris’s net in the evening kick-off: Another nail in the Stoke coffin for Mark Hughes? Well, well, well ... Arnautovic is subbed off after one of those world-beating displays. The home fans give him an absolute battering. It had been coming ... Fifteen minutes to play at Stoke, who have just squandered a big chance. Adam whips in a great cross, Shawcross has a yard on his marker and times the jump well, but he heads off target. Head in hands stuff for Hughes. Up at Stoke, Arnautovic has just gone close but really should have scored against his former side. Birmingham 1-2 QPR Bolton 0-1 Burton Brentford 0-0 Barnsley Bristol City 2-1 Nottm Forest Derby 2-0 Aston Villa Ipswich 2-0 Reading Leeds 1-0 Norwich Millwall 2-1 Middlesbrough Preston 1-0 Sheff Utd Sunderland 1-0 Fulham Arsenal 1-0 Newcastle Brighton 0-0 Burnley Chelsea 1-0 Southampton Leicester City 0-3 Crystal Palace Watford 1-4 Huddersfield Rotherham have scored a last-minute equaliser at home to Plymouth. Semi Ajayi’s got it. Lots of goals but it sounds like Michael Oliver had a difficult day. It wasn’t too glamorous but they’ve done it. To make things worse for the Toon Army, Sunderland have not only kept a clean sheet but have taken victory at home – at home – to Fulham. A stalemate in Sussex. How Glenn Murray must hope he could take that penalty again. Job done for David Wagner’s side. Elsewhere, Derby have sealed victory by getting as second late on at home to Aston Villa. They’re 60 minutes behind everybody else. Less than 45 minutes until Manchester City host Tottenham. Join Barry Glendenning for the all the buildup to that one: Plymouth lead 1-0 at Rotherham, Ryan Taylor’s got it. When he was at Bristol City, he was termed the Ginger Drogba. There you go. And Oldham are level at Doncaster. “You’re getting sacked in the morning,” is the chant from the West Ham fans. To Mark Hughes, of course. Jack Butland denies former Stoke team-mate Marko Arnautovic with a smart stop. West Ham still lead 1-0 at the bet365 stadium, where kick-off was delayed by 60 minutes. Sunderland. Are. Winning. At. Home. This is not a drill. Teenager Josh Maja gets it on his league debut. What a story .. Morata heads wide for Chelsea ... Southampton are still in it – for now at least. Charlie Austin, off the bench, has just had half a chance. In League One, leaders Wigan have doubled their lead at Wimbledon, thanks to Nick Powell. They can’t, can they? Rangers 1-3 St Johnstone. Crikey ... Middlesbrough are back in with a shout after grabbing a goal at the New Den. Stewart Downing got it. Ten-man Luton are 2-0 up at Forest Green. Jonathan Hogg sent off for Huddersfield! He picks up a second yellow card after Watford crowded the referee Michael Oliver. Both sides reduced to 10 men, after Troy Deeney was dismissed in the first half. Inter have been uninspiring of late but it just gets worse: Mark Noble fires it home from 12 yards, after Erik Pieters fouled Lanzini. And crikey, Rangers are now behind at home to St Johnstone. In League One, Michael Jacobs has scored to put Wigan one-nil up at AFC Wimbledon. West Ham have a penalty .. Preston, unbeaten in five matches, lead against Sheffield United thanks to Jordan Hugill. On-loan Southampton striker Sam Gallagher has dug out an equaliser for Birmingham at home to QPR. And high-flying Shrewsbury are in front against Blackpool. A couple of Football League goals: Exeter are ahead against Stevenage thanks to Lloyd James, and Gillingham have found a fourth at home to Bristol Rovers. That’s surely game over. Gillingham are cruising at home to Bristol Rovers, they’re 3-0 up at Priestfield. It was all looking rosy for the red half of Bristol but Kieran Dowell has just struck after the break at Ashton Gate to make it 2-1 against Nottm Forest. Game on there. Later than billed, Stoke v West Ham is under way. Some half-time reading: Half-time scores Arsenal 1-0 Newcastle Brighton 0-0 Burnley Chelsea 1-0 Southampton Stoke L-L West Ham (kick-off 4pm) Watford 0-2 Huddersfield Alonso fizzes a free-kick beyond Fraser Forster. In the Championship, Bristol City are 2-0 up thanks to Joe Bryan. A clash of heads between Merino and Monreal ensures a little delay at the Emirates but they’re soon back up on their feet. In the Football League, Leeds lead Norwich, courtesy of a Pontus Jansson header. Luton have hit 50 league goals, with Alan Sheehan scoring against Forest Green. And Shawn McCoulsky has scored for Newport to nudge themeslves in front at Cambridge. Middlesbrough really aren’t having it all their own way this season. They were supposed to runaway with the Championship but they’re trailing 2-0 at Millwall. Brighton have a penalty against Burnley ... but it is Row Z stuff from Glenn Murray, who was felled and then got back up to leather it high over the bar. Meanwhile, Bristol City are 1-0 up against Nottingham Forest, via a deflected Marlon Pack strike. In League Two, Barnet lead 2-0 at home to Morecambe while Mo Eisa has scored again to pull Cheltenham level at Coventry. Troy Deeney sent off! A silly tackle gives Michael Oliver a decision to make and the Watford captain is off for a rash challenge. Perhaps a little harsh. A very bad day at the office for Marco Silva and Watford so far. In the Championship, Derby are ahead against Aston Villa. Glenn Whelan’s backpass gifts Matej Vydra the ball, before Andreas Weimann rattles it home. Elsewhere, Lloyd Dyer has put Burton 1-0 up at Bolton. And Ipswich are two goals to the good at home to Reading, thanks to Joe Garner. And it’s some finish too. The Watford defence were half-asleep as Aaron Mooy drives home to double their lead. QPR are ahead at Birmingham, where it looks to be going from bad to worse for manager Steve Cotterill. Jack Robinson has got the goal there. Elsewhere, Richarlison should have drawn Watford level at Vicarage Road while Brighton are dominating proceedings on the south coast. Down at the Amex, Brighton are well on top against Burnley, with Bruno going close. Sean Dyche won’t be too worried about that though. His team love a late goal. Southampton, meanwhile, have had to shuffle the pack again with Cedric forced off after being clattered by Gary Cahill. Huddersfield, too, have seen goalscorer Elias Kachunga leave the field on a stretcher with a leg injury. They will be playing after all. Dominic Poleon has put Bradford in front at Southend, after great work by Nicky Law. And, north of the border, Rangers went ahead at home to St Johnstone through Alfredo Morelos but have been pegged back by Blair Alston, so it’s 1-1 at Ibrox. A couple of early chances at Stamford Bridge and the Emirates. Bellerin has had an effort blocked by a wall of Newcastle bodies while Southampton are on the front foot at Chelsea. Marco Silva’s men are behind at Vicarage Road. In League Two, Coventry are ahead at home to Cheltenham. And Northampton are level against Walsall courtesy of Chris Long. Arsenal have started the better at the Emirates, with Lacazette having an early effort on goal. They’re seeing lots of the ball, as you’d expect. In the Championship, Ipswich are one-nil up against in-form Reading. Down in League One, Erhun Oztumer has scored for Walsall at Northampton. And off we go. Less than five minutes until the 3pm kick-offs get under way. Any final thoughts or worries? Dispatches from Stoke City, where Nick Ames is the bearer of good news. “The power has come back on, to cheers in the press room,” he says. “Presumably we’ll start within the next hour or so.” That win for Crystal Palace lifts them up to 14th, and really piles on the pressure on those now below them. You sense it could be a very long and miserable weekend for rock bottom Swansea, not in action until Monday at Everton, and Stoke, who, at this rate, have no idea if they will actually be playing today unless they can locate a first-rate electrician. No David Luiz again in Antonio Conte’s matchday squad at Stamford Bridge this afternoon: Another update courtesy of Nick Ames. “Kick-off definitely delayed here,” he says, surrounded by darkness. “Hopefully another update just after 3 o’clock.” Read Paul Doyle’s match report: Up at Stoke, who are meant to be playing West Ham in 40-odd minutes, there are problems. “A power surge here and kick-off possibly delayed, so we’re told,” reports colleague Nick Ames. Follow the final stages of Leicester v Crystal Palace, where the Roy Hodgson revolution continues: At Stamford Bridge, Virgil van Dijk has been dropped for Southampton, while Gary Cahill returns for Chelsea.

Another Saturday where football, and plenty of it, takes precedent over even the very thought of pounding the streets shopping for stocking fillers. Neither Everton nor Newcastle United are feeling festive, cancelling their respective Christmas bashes. The latter are in action at Arsenal, who themselves have come to a grounding halt of late. They host Newcastle looking to rediscover that feel-good feeling, and a first Premier League win in four matches. Then there’s the small matter of Chelsea at home to Southampton, plus lowly Stoke City’s match-up with lowly West Ham United. And we’ll also be keeping an eye on Champions League-chasing Burnley, who are down on the Sussex coast at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Down in the doldrums of the Football League, Derby do battle with Aston Villa while Sunderland host Fulham at the Stadium of Light. In League One, Blackburn host Charlton while it’s (almost) top v bottom in League Two, where Forest Green entertain free-scoring Luton. In the Bundesliga, can Schalke keep the good times a-rolling at Frankfurt? And in Serie A, surely Internazionale can muster up a better showing at home to Udinese than they did against Juve last Sunday?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/18/global-coal-consumption-forecast-to-slow","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T08:14:07Z","webTitle":"Global coal consumption forecast to slow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/18/global-coal-consumption-forecast-to-slow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/18/global-coal-consumption-forecast-to-slow","fields":{"headline":"Global coal consumption forecast to slow","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Every major country in the world except India reduced its consumption of coal last year, with demand for the dirty fuel forecast to stagnate for the next half decade, according to official forecasts. The International Energy Agency said 5.3bn tonnes of coal equivalent were burnt in 2016, down 1.9% on the year before and 4.2% on 2014, the fastest decline since 1990-1992, when the global economy was in recession. Global consumption of coal will stagnate over the next half decade, the IEA forecasts, confirming the last two years’ record falls for the fossil fuel were not a blip. China, the US and Europe drove the continued drop-off in demand last year, offset only partly by India, one of a few Asian countries where the burning of coal is expected to grow until 2022. “Although the IEA is very optimistic about the development of renewables and the future role of gas, in some countries coal will also provide a significant share of the electricity needs,” said Keisuke Sadamori, the agency’s director of energy markets and security. However, he added: “Overall, what we see is a stagnation of coal demand over a decade.” While solar is making huge strides in India, rapid GDP growth of 7.8% a year and prime minister Narendra Modi’s goal of bringing power to the 240 million Indians without electricity mean coal use will grow too. Coal-fired power generation in India is expected to increase by 4% a year until 2022. Greenpeace argued that the IEA was being too bearish about the growth of renewables in India, and skewing the picture for coal’s prospects. Worldwide, the IEA said it expects coal’s share of the energy mix to shrink slightly, from 27% last year to 26% in 2022. The UK had probably made the quickest transition away from coal of any country so far, Sadamori said. Coal went from 40% of the power mix in 2012 to less than 10% last year, and in the first half of this year provided just 2%. Sadamori said that declining electricity demand, an ageing coal fleet, EU pollution directives, renewables incentives and the government’s carbon tax had created a “perfect storm” to force the closure of British coal power stations. There are eight coal power stations left in the UK, and ministers have promised to phase the fuel out entirely by 2025. The IEA argued that, contrary to what some experts have said, there would be no revival for coal in the UK if gas prices go up, because power imported from Europe would be more competitive. In the US, where gas last year displaced coal as the top source of power for the first time, Donald Trump’s election and pro-coal measures were seen as providing some optimism for the sector. However, US coal demand is expected to continue declining over the next five years, albeit at a slower rate than in recent years. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/shortcuts/2017/dec/17/playing-god-should-we-revive-extinct-species","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T16:00:34Z","webTitle":"Playing God: should we revive extinct species?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2017/dec/17/playing-god-should-we-revive-extinct-species","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/shortcuts/2017/dec/17/playing-god-should-we-revive-extinct-species","fields":{"headline":"Playing God: should we revive extinct species?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It sounds like something from a sci-fi B-Movie: scientists have moved a step closer to bringing the Tasmanian tiger back from extinction. Also known as the thylacine, or Tasmanian wolf, the world’s largest carnivorous marsupial died out in its native land sometime during the 1930s. Despite almost 4,000 reports of “sightings” since, including tantalisingly inconclusive video footage as recently as 2008, most regard the species as having gone for ever. So the mapping of the thylacine’s genetic sequence, which in theory makes cloning the living animal itself possible, raises tricky questions. How far should we go to reverse the tide of extinction? And what ecological and ethical issues might this raise? Professor Andrew Pask of the University of Melbourne, who led the team sequencing the thylacine’s DNA, has no doubts about bringing back lost species, seeing a clear moral obligation to do so. “We were responsible for hunting [the thylacine] to extinction – in that case, we almost owe it to the species to bring it back”. Others are less sure. Some have accused scientists of “playing God”, while even National Geographic ran the cover headline “Reviving Extinct Species. We Can. But Should We?” But such concerns may be too late, as the genie is already out of the bottle. Scientists in Cape Town recently announced that the quagga, a dark subspecies of the familiar zebra that went extinct more than a century earlier, had been revived. The team used selective breeding of zebras, which showed characteristics of their lost cousin, to “reverse engineer” the quagga into existence. The resulting creature certainly looks like a quagga, even if it is not an exact genetic match. Critics claim that although you can breed for similar appearance, you cannot recreate the animal’s behaviour and ecology. The same may be true of a project to revive the woolly mammoth, which has yet to progress beyond the early stages. So what next? I’d personally love to see great auks swimming around St Kilda, or a dodo back on Mauritius. But I’m not holding my breath. As for the thylacine itself, even if science could make cloning possible, the discovery that the animal’s genetic health was compromised, at some point in its long history, means that any cloned animals are unlikely to survive, especially back in the wild."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/18/how-the-guardian-ranked-the-worlds-top-100-footballers-for-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T13:00:59Z","webTitle":"How the Guardian ranked the world’s top 100 footballers for 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/18/how-the-guardian-ranked-the-worlds-top-100-footballers-for-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/18/how-the-guardian-ranked-the-worlds-top-100-footballers-for-2017","fields":{"headline":"How the Guardian ranked the world’s top 100 footballers for 2017","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For our sixth annual survey we have gathered our biggest panel yet: 169 judges from 63 countries choosing the 100 best male footballers in the world in 2017.

Before streaks of orange brilliance mark the sunrise, a blackbird chortles and pitches into the remains of ripe fruits on the Kousa dogwood; blooms of the camellia Cornish Snow glow beside dark foliage and yellow spikes of fragrant mahonia; and another blackbird is prospecting myrtle berries. Southwards, beyond the vacated pastures opposite, first light catches plumes of steam and smoke rising from the wood-chip boiler that warms glasshouses growing acres of alstroemeria (Peruvian lilies) to be picked throughout the year. To the north, by breakfast time, a rainbow stretches from the old beech clump and across a skyline of fields to form a perfect arch above two crows, flying up from the sheep-trodden grass into a louring sky. Overnight, wind has knocked twigs, chunks of rotten branches and tufts of lichen into the lane that leads downhill towards the Radland and Morden millstreams. Down in those wooded valleys much land remains in shadow, but intermittent sunbeams filter through the trees to reflect on shiny leaves of harts tongue fern and ivy, illuminate moss on sides of tree trunks, pick out a spiral of gnats, and side-light a flock of sheep on the sunny side of the valley by New Houses. Streams, swollen with run-off from the steep and muddy lanes, converge and race towards the pool and weir that serve Cotehele Mill. The quarter-mile leat that flows towards the restored water wheel and the shed that houses the electric generator appears as a sky-lit ribbon above the turbulent stream, both hemmed in by bare trees. Past the mill, high tide slows the tributary’s flow, water backs up and is temporarily stilled; a gang of drakes float among the reed beds and, out in the main river, ruffled water dazzles in the morning sun. For now the quay is relatively free of visitors, the gig club’s boats remain in the yard, and a pair of swans waddle and dabble at the top of the hard. Tomorrow there will be snow on the eastern horizon of Dartmoor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/17/the-tory-rebels-are-emboldened-by-their-success-they-will-not-stop-now","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"The Tory rebels are emboldened by their success.

They won’t stop now","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The spectacle of a control freak losing control is generally satisfying, but not to Tories who are angry about the government’s first major defeat in parliament since the election. Casting around for places to allocate the blame, some fingers are being pointed at Julian Smith. The relatively new chief whip is being accused of misreading and mishandling the rebellion that saw Tory MPs combine with the opposition to insert a legal guarantee that parliament will have a vote on the eventual Brexit deal. “The first job of the chief is to be able to count,” complain some of his colleagues, echoing Lyndon Johnson’s famous saying about what most matters in politics. It is obvious that the Tory whipping operation didn’t work, since it is rule number one not to lose a vote. Gavin Williamson, Mr Smith’s predecessor as chief whip, liked to boast that he never lost a single division in the Commons, although he only kept that record intact by swerving any vote that came with the risk of defeat and getting himself promoted to defence secretary before the parliamentary slog over Brexit became seriously heavy. In truth, Mr Smith’s skill, or lack of it, at whipcracking is not the important reason why the government was defeated this time and will likely lose again in the future. The important reasons are these. The prime minister lacks authority. She may often behave as if she has a steamroller mandate, but she only has a slender parliamentary majority bought from the Democratic Unionist Party. That would make life difficult enough even without Brexit. This requires gargantuan slabs of legislation which has created a parliamentary battleground in which fiercely held principles are contested and high passions are aroused. This combination of prime ministerial weakness, precarious parliamentary arithmetic and complex and contentious legislation on a hugely divisive issue is compounded by a longer term trend which makes whipping still more difficult. Parliamentarians of all parties have been growing more rebellious over the years. We know this from the valuable work of Philip Cowley, a political scientist at Queen Mary University of London, and his colleague Mark Stuart. They have made a speciality of recording and analysing the trend. Mutiny by government backbenchers, a rarity in the 1940s and 1950s, has increased over the decades since. Labour MPs became steadily more rebellious after their party came to power in 1997. This was often disguised by the size of Tony Blair’s majorities, but not always. Even when he had a landslide majority, he came within four votes of a defeat on tuition fees. One Jeremy Corbyn voted against the whip on 428 occasions when his party was in power – and a further 189 times when it was in opposition – making a career total of 617. It is probably an encouragement to rebels of all parties that he is now Labour leader and, for some of his supporters at least, his record is taken as a signifier that he is a man of principle and authenticity. He does not wear his past disloyalty to the party whip as a mark of shame, but as a badge of pride. The Tory MPs who rebelled against Mrs May do the same. That would worry me if I were the prime minister. Tory MPs developed a taste for rebellion during Sir John Major’s tormented government in the 1990s. In those days, the revolts over Europe came from the phobic right of the party. The last people in a position to demand that loyalty to party ought to prevail over conscience are Brexiters of that vintage, some of whom were dubbed “bastards” by Sir John as they ate his government alive. What is sauce for the goose. There was even more Tory rebellion during the coalition years. In one of the coalition’s parliamentary sessions, approaching half of divisions saw one or more government MPs vote against the government. One explanation for this rising tide of backbench rebellion is that whips have lost many of the tools they once used to coax and cow their MPs. They were deprived of valuable patronage power when they had to surrender control of appointments to select committees. Arm twisting of potential rebels is more dangerous than it was in the old days when bullying was regarded as a legitimate weapon in the whips’ armoury. MPs who are leant on are much more likely to complain about it and to do so publicly. Whips can still menace a backbencher’s career prospects, but that doesn’t work terribly well if a rebel-inclined MP has already been a minister, and there are quite a lot of ex-ministers sitting on the Tory backbenches. It is notable that the majority of last week’s rebels were former ministers. “You’d be unwise to cross the prime minister” might have worked as a threat when Mrs May looked like the queen of all she surveyed. It doesn’t have so much traction when it is the working assumption of most Tories that she won’t be their leader by the time of the next election. Some of the Tory press have tried to intimidate the rebels by vilifying them as “malcontents” and “traitors”. There have also been a few hysterical bellows for de-selection. That is nasty. It also appears to be pleasingly counter-productive for the government. Some of the rebels say that the attempted character assassinations only served to strengthen their resolve and cement their comradeship. Voters usually tell interviewers that they don’t like lobby-fodder MPs and express a preference to be represented by independent-minded parliamentarians who stick to their principles. Which is precisely what Dominic Grieve and his fellow rebels were doing when they insisted on proper parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit. That leaves the whips with one ultimate threat – the nuclear weapon – which I expect they will be rolling out in future because there will be a lot more tight fights and close calls over Brexit legislation down the line. The big bogey is to try to terrify potential rebels with the idea that defeating Mrs May on anything significant could collapse the government and precipitate an election. The trouble with this as a frightener is that it is very hollow. No amount of amending of the various pieces of Brexit legislation can, by itself, cause an election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, there are two mechanisms for removing the government. One way would require either the DUP or some Tory MPs to join the opposition in support of a motion of no confidence in the government. The Queen would then ask Jeremy Corbyn to see if he could form a government which commanded the support of parliament. If he couldn’t, an election would follow. I guess we should never say never to anything these days, but it is extremely hard to see the DUP or any Tory MP voting to set off that chain of events. The alternative mechanism for ending the government would require the DUP and a wedge of Tories to vote with the opposition on a motion to call an election. Again, you have to say never say never. Again, you have to think that this looks a bit less likely than Lord Lucan turning up in Parliament Square riding Shergar. I say that not just because the DUP can’t stand the idea of Mr Corbyn in Number 10. I say it also because a hung parliament really suits them because it gives them leverage worth £1bn and counting so far. The precise effect of the rebel amendment on the Brexit process is as yet unknown. What we can say now is that it is not a good look for a government to lose a vote on flagship legislation. It is also cheering for the opposition, literally so. Cheer they did, Labour, Lib Dem and Nationalist MPs when the tellers read out the numbers on Wednesday night. Rebellions in the Commons have another effect, which is that they tend to embolden the House of Lords to be difficult. It has long been thought in government that the Brexit legislation will face its roughest passage when the bills reach the upper house. The majority of peers were opposed to Brexit. Tory lords and ladies are less than a third of the total population of the upper house. They are easily outnumbered by opposition peers and the crossbenchers. For the government to get its way, ministers were relying on the unelected upper house’s traditional reluctance to defy the clearly expressed will of the Commons. If the government is being defeated in the Commons, peers are more likely to stand firm on their objections to the Brexit legislation. A final reason for Mrs May and her whips to worry about this defeat is that rebellion can be contagious. As one veteran rebel against his party once put it to me: “It’s like murder is said to be. The first time is the hardest. The more often you do it, the easier it gets.” The EU withdrawal bill is only the first course of the groaning menu of Brexit legislation that will be served up to parliament over the coming months. There are at least eight more bills to be chewed through. Mrs May and her whips had better get accustomed to the sour taste of defeat because this first one is unlikely to be the last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/22/the-complete-statistics-behind-our-list-of-2017s-best-footballers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T11:38:40Z","webTitle":"The complete statistics behind our list of 2017's best footballers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/22/the-complete-statistics-behind-our-list-of-2017s-best-footballers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/22/the-complete-statistics-behind-our-list-of-2017s-best-footballers","fields":{"headline":"The complete statistics behind our list of 2017's best footballers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Our 169 experts from 63 nations cast nearly 7,000 votes in total to choose the world’s top 100 male footballers for 2017.

In 36 years in the system, I have observed – and perhaps therefore been complicit in – the behaviours you highlight. However, your championing of Ofsted does not mention its own central role in creating this environment in the first place. With performance table data being the major determinant of Ofsted outcomes, the inspection system itself fuels the behaviours it condemns. Additionally, many schools remain uninspected for years and are in a position to pursue “performance” at whatever cost – that cost often being passed on to other schools. What is needed is a broader approach to inspections that recognises (via Ofsted outcomes) the brilliant work of the many inclusive schools that, because of their reluctance to move disadvantaged students on and their willingness to accept those moved on by other schools, might not always hit the thresholds held so dear by the inspection framework. Let’s hope that Amanda Spielman will use her new role to “walk the talk” in this. Ken Hall Knaresborough, North Yorkshire Some real-life context is urgently required for Ofsted’s annual report on the education system’s treatment of vulnerable children and the Observer’s coverage of it (“Vulnerable pupils abandoned by school system, says Ofsted chief”, News, last week). In both of those, and in Lord Adonis’s comment on “the cancer of school expulsions”, the reality is ignored of school provision for all pupils – and especially the vulnerable – enduring prolonged cuts and damaging change. Your editorial fully endorsing this “champion of the deprived” accepts that expulsions are linked to league tables; it assumes that schools are simply cynically gaming the system. Is it really not apparent that teachers, as well as parents, are now “ill-equipped” to meet these children’s needs? Let the child and adolescent mental health services and the counsellors, teaching assistants, special educational needs budgets, pastoral workers and specialist teachers that have been removed, be restored, then assess who has “lost sight of the purpose of education”. League tables build in comparisons of schools with huge, incurable, widening disparities, automatically disadvantaging some by the very nature of their location and the effects of austerity. How can Ofsted be regarded as independent when it furthers this government’s agenda of academisation and, ultimately, privatisation? This government is surely the power to whom truth must be spoken, not the system it is decimating. Jane Price Minehead, Somerset Amanda Spielman’s denunciation of the treatment of disadvantaged children is welcome, especially her comments on the practice of “off-rolling”. However, two things seem to be missing. First, schools are under pressure to conform to the standards laid down by whichever secretary of state most recently left his or her mark on the assessment criteria. If schools are to be passed or failed on some formula for GCSE results, is it any wonder that they game the system to maximise their scores? And would Spielman not accept that Ofsted has some responsibility for establishing and sustaining the climate in which schools operate, and hence for demagnetising their moral compass? Second, Spielman acknowledges that “dealing with students of different needs isn’t always easy”. No, and it isn’t cheap either, because such children often need one-to-one support and specialist input. Suppose a headteacher decides to keep and nurture every student, resisting the results pressure from Ofsted, not to mention the pressure from parents of other children; decides, in Spielman’s words, “to do what’s right by children”. Fine, but where is the money to come from?

We had to take back control","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The referendum told us to leave the EU, but it was completely silent on how we do so. Indeed, some in the leave campaign said we should stay in the single market. Yet, how we choose to leave the EU (not whether we do) will have a significant effect on people and businesses across our country, and it is the most significant and complex constitutional decision this country must make for a generation. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial that this decision is made by parliament, and by each of us on behalf of our constituents. Anything else would be an abdication of our duty as MPs. That is why I voted for amendment 7 on Wednesday, the effect of which was to give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal – and resulted in the loss of my job as vice-chair of the Conservative party. The European parliament will vote on the final deal before it is concluded, and this is enshrined in article 50. Numerous national, and even potentially regional, parliaments across the EU27 may also have a vote on the deal. So surely the UK parliament must at least have these same rights over the final deal if it is to be considered sovereign? This amendment does not stop or delay Brexit. In fact, this amendment enshrines in law the government’s existing commitment to give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. However, it was essential that this promise was incorporated into the bill to curtail the vast increase in ministerial powers in clause 9. I took no pleasure in voting against the government and my party for the first time on Wednesday night. It was a very difficult decision, but I believe it was the right one. There did not have to be a rebellion, it was completely avoidable. My colleagues and I had raised our concerns with the government three months ago, and we have been trying to work with the government to find a solution that everybody would be happy with. In the end, the minor concessions offered 15 minutes before the vote unfortunately failed to address the issues being raised. Therefore, I had to vote with my conscience and put my country and constituency first. The passing of amendment 7 does not undermine the government or the prime minister, nor does it make it more likely that Jeremy Corbyn will become prime minister. The evidence for this is clear, as the EU27 have just agreed to move to the next phase of talks. The talk of delay is just what whips say to try to scare MPs, and what the newspapers say to make a story. Governments do not fall because amendments are passed at committee stage; this is just a normal part of scrutinising legislation. Since the vote, there have been calls for me to be deselected from standing for the Conservative party again. I find it quite strange that I should be subject to deselection calls after one rebellion, as for the past 12 years I have always previously supported the government. I do not take much notice of abuse on social media. I am accountable only to my constituents, and the vast majority of comments I have received since the vote have been very positive. My constituency voted very heavily to remain, and so it is fully understandable that they want to ensure parliament will have control over the Brexit process and a say on the final terms of the agreement. At the core of the leave campaign was a promise to “take back control” – and now parliament can do just that, to ensure we can fully scrutinise and decide on the most significant constitutional change for a generation on behalf of our constituents. It is somewhat ironic that it takes a remain campaigner like me to deliver what the leave campaigners claimed they wanted all along. • Stephen Hammond is Conservative MP for Wimbledon.

The England captain had got the big call right and they had two in a hurry. After a horrid collapse before lunch, and an imposing start for Australia, England were suddenly back in the day, with Craig Overton looking more dangerous by the delivery. But the upshot of the hours to come was always going to rest on how they went when the next guy walked out, Root’s opposite number, Steve Smith. “Buts” don’t come bigger in international cricket. When he gets it right, and so often he does, Australia almost always win. Only two of his 21 centuries have been reached in losing teams – and England cannot afford to lose here. It is binary. Get Smith or get stuffed. From the moment the home captain walked out he batted in a manner that suggests he gets this, too. He is fully aware of his role as the main character in every story these teams write. In the series opener, his job was a shock absorber; to exhaust the England bowlers. Here it was different. A higher-octane contest required a high-tempo innings to heap scoreboard pressure back on to Root. Especially after England left so many runs behind in their innings. So Smith went to work. Two thumping off-drives came in the first 10 deliveries he faced. The first time Overton gave him an opportunity he repeated the stroke. A fourth strike came before tea. The extent that Smith was in control was highlighted by the last ball of that session, when Overton got it to spit before smashing into Smith’s thumb and head before rolling towards his stumps. Yet he had the presence of mind to get his stinging hand back on to the bat to parry the ball away. For Root, it must have been as ominous as any of the drives. Nothing was breaking Smith’s concentration. In the space of 24 balls, the complexion of the game had changed. Smith was on one – and everyone knew it. Wisden’s editor, Lawrence Booth, formerly of this parish, put it best shortly after the interval. “Can anyone look nailed on for a hundred with 63 runs still to go?” he tweeted. In the space of a spell, Smith made Stuart Broad look a spent force. After disdainfully pulling for six, he middled him past point off the balls of his feet like it was not one of the hardest shots in the game. Off the pads he clipped with immaculate timing to the rope once more. Then for his final trick he adjusted mid-stroke to a bouncer that did not get up, bisecting two fielders. He flashed a knowing grin in response. Broad didn’t. Neither did Root. He knows the deal. Smith probably reminds him of himself on the days when he is playing by different rules to the rest. When Usman Khawaja was on 32, Root did not get a hand to a chance at second slip. Related to what the Australian numero uno was up to? Surely. Smith responded by bringing up his half-century – in 58 balls, if you don’t mind – by launching into another cover drive. At the final drinks break, an interview with Smith appeared on the big screen where he described his century in the corresponding fixture in 2013. It was the knock that changed it all, the moment where he proved to himself that he could really do it. Three boundaries in a row followed the beverage. Then a deft late cut. This was history repeating itself at the Waca. With stumps looming, he put it away. The ton can wait for day three. But one last run took Australia to an even 200 behind, his stay successfully redefining the terms of reference for the contest. “He’s the sort of guy when he gets into a rhythm you don’t want to break it up,” Khawaja said afterwards. “More impressive is how Smudge bats in terms of the margin for error when you bowl to him is so little, as the English found out today.” The lesson for Root through his side’s final intervention of the day, Woakes trapping Khawaja a couple of overs after being brought into the attack, was that they can make the game move fast, too. Smith showed him how it is done. Now it is his move. Ashes diary: day two in Perth Notting Hill prop finds home A little piece of Hugh Grant lives at the Waca. Well, his character William Thacker more accurately. Two of the most iconic scenes in Notting Hill feature a park bench with the touching inscription, as read by Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) in the film: “For June who loved this garden, from Joseph who always sat beside her.” From London in 1999, it landed in Perth in 2002 when a local man bought it for his beloved. When their relationship didn’t last he gave it to Perth city council to sit in the Queens Gardens next to the ground. Happily ever after. AC Rising cost of playing the fool Perth is a city with a reputation and, after a couple of mining booms over the last decade and a half, a price tag to match. But the Waca scoreboard revealed hyperinflation of Weimar Republic levels. In Adelaide, the levy for partaking in “disorderly and offensive conduct” was $560. Here? A cool $6,000 (roughly £3,400), a 971% increase. Probably not the place to pour a beer over a mate’s head, then. AC Fancy dress leaves fan in a sweat Spare a thought for one England fan in a Morph suit. At a shade-free venue like the Waca, wearing these body stockings must be akin to sitting on a griddle. Behold one gentleman in St George’s cross colours, boasting a physical form of the sort the suits were not designed to accommodate. Clearly intrepid, he went it alone as a Barmy Army representative, invading the section of Richie Benaud impersonators. “Give us a song, Richies,” he demanded, and danced in the midday sun as they complied. One can only imagine the scenes that evening when he finally peeled the suit off. Drain the swamp, indeed.

Speaking among palm trees and tower blocks in the working-class district of Nou Barris, Domènech called for a three-way left coalition made up of the pro-independence Esquerra Repúblicana (Republican Left), the Socialists and his own party, the Catalan version of Podemos, named Catalunya en Comú-Podem. “We are the key, so that people don’t have to choose between one bloc or another,” said Domènech. “We are not going to play Russian roulette with our country, we will create a government that represents all Catalans,” he added, promising a new start after last October’s unilateral declaration of independence, which plunged Spain into a constitutional crisis. There was little nationalist sentiment on display at the meeting where, rather than the ubiquitous pro-independence flags, people carried the red, gold and purple flag of the second republic that was overthrown by General Franco in 1939. For the last big meeting before Thursday’s election, Comú brought out the big guns to support Domènech, among them the Barcelona mayor, Ada Colau. She said: “People power is what counts. We are unstoppable. We know what the polls say, but we might surprise them. All the polls were against us when we were running for mayor, but we won.” She condemned “the irresponsible unilateralists who have brought nothing but pain and sorrow to Catalonia. This campaign is an opportunity to recognise that error. Never again must Catalonia be driven to the precipice.” When Colau ran for mayor in 2015 she made it clear that she did not favour independence but instead appealed to Barcelona’s long and deep tradition of radical, communitarian politics. The message appeared to resonate. Domènech, a historian with a radical pedigree, – his father was an avant-garde conceptual artist in the 1970s and his mother an activist in the anarchist CNT union – hopes that a campaign focused on social, not sovereignty, issues will have the same resonance. However, while this may win him votes, not all of them will be transformed into seats, as the Catalan electoral system is heavily biased in favour of rural constituencies. In rural Lleida, 20,000 votes are needed to win a seat, 46,000 to win one in Barcelona. Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos in Spain, said: “We need to stop treating the issue like it was a football match between Barça and Real Madrid. Spain ... is a complex country made up of different identities, and the issue can’t be solved with judges and the police. Spain is pluri-national.” Before the meeting, Elisenda Alamany, number two on the Comú list of candidates, told the Observer that for the coalition to work, both Esquerra and the socialists would have to make concessions. “Esquerra would have to renounce unilateralism and the socialists would have to renounce their support for direct rule from Madrid,” she said. “We believe we could come to an agreement based on a pact to get a binding referendum, on better self-financing, a guaranteed level of social spending and tax on the highest incomes, that is 50% on incomes above €100,000. We think we can reach a broad consensus on these issues.” Comú would not countenance joining a coalition that included the right-wing People’s party, deposed president Carles Puigdemont’s Junts per Catalunya or the centre-right Ciutadans. “We couldn’t support Junts per Catalunya because of its neo-liberal policies and public spending cuts but for the same reason we couldn’t support Ciutadans,” Alamany said. “Ciutadans has benefited from a situation of polarization and has presented itself as the party that will put a stop to the independence process. They only talk about stopping the process because the reality is their social policy is the same as the Popular party. They are simply benefiting from people’s weariness with the process.” According to the polls, Domènech’s party has been inching its way up the rankings. By law there can be no more polls now before Thursday but there remains a real chance that Comú could hold the balance of power. If they can pull it off, Catalonia may take a turn to the left, with social policy taking precedence over nationalism. If not, a hung parliament and prolonged uncertainty looks the most likely outcome."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/17/care-homes-sector-time-to-throw-the-financiers-out-private-equity","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T08:00:26Z","webTitle":"Old and vulnerable people and financial whiz-kids don’t mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/17/care-homes-sector-time-to-throw-the-financiers-out-private-equity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/17/care-homes-sector-time-to-throw-the-financiers-out-private-equity","fields":{"headline":"Old and vulnerable people and financial whiz-kids don’t mix","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"You would be forgiven for thinking that any connection between wealthy financiers and Four Seasons would involve luxury hotel chains. But last week the relationship of rich investors with a very different type of property has been making headlines. The private equity-owned care home business Four Seasons, which cares for 17,000 older and vulnerable residents, has been teetering on the brink of collapse. It has been a long time coming: loaded with more than £500m of debt by its owners, its £50m-a-year interest payments have become unsustainable. An 11th-hour intervention from the regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), resulted in an agreement with the hedge fund that owns much of its debt. But how long will it be before we are here again? In the last 20 years the influence of private equity in the UK’s care home chains has grown. Southern Cross, once the UK’s largest provider, collapsed in 2011 when it could no longer service its debt. The demise came after its owners sold and leased back the care homes they ran and used the cash to finance overly aggressive expansion. These cases raise serious questions about our care homes, home to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people. What would happen if another care provider collapsed, and other providers weren’t willing to take over homes the way they did for Southern Cross? How have the worlds of private equity finance and state-financed older care come to collide, with potentially disastrous consequences for the people who live under their care? To understand how we got here, we need to go back 30 years, when more than 90% of care homes were owned and operated by local councils. But from the 1980s onwards councils were incentivised to subcontract care to privately run homes. Today 92% of care home beds are supplied by the independent sector; eight in 10 by for-profit companies, and just over one in 10 by the not-for-profit sector. “There has been a major shift in care provision from the public to the private sector,” says Richard Humphries, senior fellow at the King’s Fund thinktank. “This has happened by stealth – there’s been no public debate.” The state, however, remains by far the biggest buyer: only 40% of care home residents wholly fund themselves. In the age of austerity, that government funding has been in steep decline. This means fewer people are getting state help with the costs of care. But it also filters down into the lower rates councils are paying care homes. Jane Townson, chief executive of Somerset Care, a not-for-profit social enterprise that runs 28 homes, says: “Providers like us are up against it due to a toxic combination of unviable local authority rates and rapidly escalating costs that include the ‘national living wage’, the new apprenticeship levy, higher regulatory fees and inflationary pressures.” She says council fees cover at best 70% of her costs. She would like to pay her staff more than the national living wage, but cannot afford to. The CQC warned last year that the care market was approaching a tipping point. Many providers have been cross-subsidising state-funded care home places by charging private payers more: self-funders are paying on average £12,000 a year more than councils. Some are opting out of providing state-funded care, leading to fears of a two-tier system. Care homes rated as outstanding by the CQC have a significantly higher proportion of private payers than those rated inadequate. For the majority of smaller “ma-and-pa” operators, the financial squeeze starts and ends there. But when it comes to the UK’s largest for-profit chains, there is a darker side to the tale. Private equity finance has flooded in since cheap debt became available in the 2000s, with funds buying up chains such as Southern Cross, Four Seasons and HC-One. They have introduced opaque ownership structures, including offshore subsidiaries. Professor Karel Williams at Manchester Business School argues there is a fundamental mismatch between the risky, high-return world of private equity and care homes, which are more suited to low-risk, low-return, long-term financing. Private equity financiers typically expect returns of 12%. This sort of figure simply becomes impossible in the crunch situation of falling state funding and rising costs. “In the event of liquidation, the owner can walk away after losing only a small amount of equity, offset by any cash extracted since purchase, and the state is left with responsibility for the residents,” Williams says. The state could borrow far more cheaply than these businesses. Four Seasons is paying interest in excess of 12% on a chunk of its debt; in 2008 its debt repayments were estimated to be adding £100 to the weekly cost of a care home bed. This is money that could be spent increasing wages in what is a very low-paid sector, or on provision for residents. “This financial engineering is a major contributor to chain fragility and care quality problems, so that private gain comes at the expense of costs for residents, staff and the state,” says Williams. He also believes it stifles innovation: “The chains rebuild care homes in a standard institutional style with 60-plus beds, driven by an operating model which requires care homes large enough to pay management overheads and make a return on capital.” Everyone agrees the care system needs more cash. “What’s been happening at Four Seasons is the price we have to pay for a lack of public funding,” says Humphries. But Williams points out that, in the private-equity-owned slice of the sector, extra state funding is more likely to find its way to hedge funds via interest payments than being spent on care delivery: “Giving the financialised chains more money is like pouring water into a leaky bucket.” So more money will not, by itself, be enough. The government must also unravel the financial engineering that it has allowed to balloon in the provision of a vital service on which vulnerable people’s lives depend. There is a glaringly obvious answer to this conundrum. Care homes provide the sort of low-risk, steady returns that make them ideal candidates not just for long-term investors but for the state. The majority of care home stock will need replacing in years to come. Like affordable housing, it is something in which the government should be borrowing to invest. Instead it has, by omission, taken the crazy decision to hope that private equity will do it for us, borrowing at three times the rate available to the government, regardless of the cost to taxpayers and residents. It’s high time to sever the link with the financiers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/17/censorship-sexual-harassment-theatre-art","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T00:05:16Z","webTitle":"Spare us the moral hysteria that threatens a new age of censorship | Rachel Cooke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/censorship-sexual-harassment-theatre-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/censorship-sexual-harassment-theatre-art","fields":{"headline":"Spare us the moral hysteria that threatens a new age of censorship","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"To the casual eye, George Devine made for an unlikely-seeming revolutionary. In Howard Coster’s 1934 photograph, in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, he looks like nothing so much as a master at Greyfriars School, his spectacles horn-rimmed, his hair neatly oiled. Only the flamboyant angle of the hand that holds his cigarette suggests the reality: this was the actor who, as the director of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre, would produce John Osborne’s 1956 play Look Back in Anger. According to Irving Wardle, the nearest thing he has to a biographer, Devine was “personally inconspicuous”. If creating an “open space” for “rebel artists” took courage – it’s difficult to grasp, now, how incendiary Osborne’s words seemed at the time – it also involved a certain quietness. The work would speak for itself. Last Friday, the Royal Court’s current director, Vicky Featherstone, showed a little of the same quiet courage. Twenty-four hours after cancelling a production of Andrea Dunbar’s Rita, Sue and Bob Too in the wake of the news that its original co-director, Max Stafford-Clark, had stepped down following allegations of sexual harassment, she issued a further statement in which she admitted to having been shocked by the claims of censorship levelled at her, and had therefore changed her mind. The Court will stage the play, with its themes of “grooming” and “male power” (its words, not mine). It is, I think, a measure of the current atmosphere that so uncontroversial a move – the production has been touring since September, and the play, with its wild, working-class teenage heroines, has been loved and admired ever since Stafford-Clark discovered its 19-year-old author in the early 1980s – seemed weirdly momentous: significant enough to make the main news bulletins. When I heard about it, I poured myself another drink. Of course, it should have been obvious to everyone involved right from the beginning that the Royal Court, like all subsidised theatres, is required to be the polar opposite of a so-called “safe space” in artistic terms; plays, all you babies out there, don’t groom people – although I do take the point of the friend who joked to me that she’d once been harassed by some late-period Tom Stoppard. But then, it’s hardly as if the Court is alone when it comes to being lily-livered. This is just one in a long line of recent instances of mimsy self-censorship in the arts and, in the months and years ahead, I predict many more, the fear and trembling among institutions growing exponentially as further cases of harassment and abuse are revealed, and some of those we know about already perhaps pass through the courts. Anxiety in this matter should not, moreover, be a new thing. It certainly isn’t for me. Although it gives me no pleasure to say so, I saw all this coming. Last April, when Harvey Weinstein was still protected by his ghastly network and the liverish glow of his formerly high-wattage power, I wrote a long piece about the increasingly nervous attitudes of galleries to “difficult” work in which I speculated that, among other artists, Balthus, some of whose subjects are pubescent girls, would probably soon find himself in trouble. And so it came to pass. Earlier this month, a woman called Mia Merrill launched an online petition calling on the Metropolitan Museum of Art to remove his 1938 painting, Thérèse Dreaming. More than 11,500 people signed it, on the grounds that they find it “disturbing” (Thérèse sits in such a way that her underwear can be seen). Again, it tells you something that while the petition didn’t surprise me, the fact that the Met held its nerve did. People talk of a “reckoning”. At last, they say, women need no longer be silent about what they’ve suffered at the hands of men; our idea of what constitutes sexual assault has changed forever. I have no problem with this. I wrote my own #MeToo column five years ago, when people were busy wondering how Jimmy Savile had got away with his crimes for so long. (Not that anyone noticed: after it was published, I did not receive a single supportive message from the sisterhood). But we need to be careful. This is a dangerous moment as well as an important one. You don’t have to look very hard to see that we’re beginning to conflate sexual mistakes of all kinds with abuse, that beneath the surface of this debate conservative forces are at work, as well as reforming, liberal ones. In the New Republic recently, a writer described a happy, consensual relationship she had had with her university tutor. Buried in the middle of her account was a line about extramarital affairs more generally that terrified me. She spoke of the way “transgressors” who leave their partners are “forgiven” if they go on to remarry and have children: “a toxic concept”, she said. What? Are we going to outlaw love affairs now? Isn’t forgiveness supposed to be a good thing? (I write as someone who has had to do quite a lot of forgiving down the years.) The effect of this muddle on relationships is a subject for another time, another column. But its effect on the arts is going to be – this is my bet – grim. The mob can be whipped up in as long as it takes to hit a keyboard; institutions are risk averse, worrying about funding and audience development with freedom of expression seen as mere tinsel atop the tree. Pressure comes from the police, who can’t afford to protect those who refuse their “advice” when they deem something to be inflammatory, and from both left (take a look at the behaviour of some Momentum types) and right (the Daily Mail). Add the febrile mood surrounding Weinstein and co to this and you see in which direction we’re heading. The line between art and biography has long been fraught; I’ve written about it before with reference to Philip Larkin and Eric Gill. But let me ask the question once again: who chooses the artists with morals so impeccable they will take the place of those we’re going to throw under our hurtling bus? There are endless reasons to resist censorship, most so manifest I can hardly be bothered to articulate them (start with the idea that art is supposed to make us think, and work your way from there). But when it comes to old art, rather than new, there’s rarely any good reason to expunge it from the record. Read a book or watch a play, and see how you/we have changed. Prescience isn’t a straightforward thing; rather magically, art sometimes updates itself. In the 21st century, Osborne’s anti-establishment hero, Jimmy Porter, appears to us as a conservative figure, a man whose diatribes against the status quo don’t quite hide the fact that part of him clings to it. An update might have him supporting Brexit, and that in itself would be a reason to see it – though, alas, I have to tell you that he’ll never not be a sexist pig."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/16/australia-mitchell-marsh-century-bad-place-england-perth-ashes-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T13:32:52Z","webTitle":"Mitchell Marsh makes his Ashes mark after coming through ‘bad place’ | Adam Collins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/16/australia-mitchell-marsh-century-bad-place-england-perth-ashes-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/16/australia-mitchell-marsh-century-bad-place-england-perth-ashes-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Mitchell Marsh makes his Ashes mark after coming through ‘bad place’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Mitchell Marsh has never hidden behind his all‑rounder status to shirk his primary responsibility. To play for Australia, he has always known, hinges on whether he can hold down the No6 spot with the bat. That means tons. But until Saturday, he had not saluted. His reflexive response to the first question flung at him when leaving the field showed how heavy that weight had been, now lifted with this lavish triumph. “It’s only taken 22 Tests.” Many judges were convinced this would never happen when he returned home from India in March needing shoulder surgery and sporting a Test batting average that gave ammunition to usual suspects who need little encouragement. With his surname, cries of nepotism are a given. Headlines followed that he was the worst No6, statistically, the game had ever seen. “I certainly had moments throughout my shoulder rehab when I thought I wouldn’t get back,” Marsh said in the afterglow of what he had achieved nine months on from that. With Cricket Australia’s top brass briefing during the pre-Ashes Sheffield Shield rounds that they were after a player for 20 for four not 200 for four his name was barely in the conversation. Playing Test cricket, he freely admits, was the last thing he thought he would be doing now. But there he was, walking out at 248 for four. On to his home ground, with his parents and grandparents sitting in the seats they always do but directed never to leave their seats while he bats, even for the loo. Probably uncomfortable for them by stumps in that case, but Marsh had never felt more at ease. “The whole buildup to this game I have been a lot more confident than I have been in the past,” he said. This mindset, he explained, was a product of thorough planning with his batting coach, Scott Meuleman, to ready himself for the next chance. As he forced England into the dirt, it was Meuleman who he could not wait to call after play. “He has changed the way I defend and think about the game,” Marsh said. “When I got back from India, I was in a pretty bad place with my cricket but he got a hold of me and changed my game. I finally worked out after eight years I can’t just plonk on to the front foot.” While that front-foot lunge might not be the only setting in the Marsh 2.0 machine, it remains the most attractive. Entering with Australia still 155 in arrears (even if it did not feel like it because of Steve Smith’s antics) he crushed the ball straight at every opportunity. A lot was made before the series about how important Shane Watson had been four years ago to balance Australia’s XI, now Marsh was holding his pose like him as his drives hit the rope. When slaying Stuart Broad twice to the rope before tea, Marsh took off on a joyous sprint to mark reaching three figures. His teeth were visible from the enormous smile. The Australian balcony was as emotional as he was, his brother Shaun in the front row leading the applause. When Shaun had his own special moment in Adelaide, the younger Marsh sent him a text telling him that he loved him. It is not hard to understand why he is such a popular young man. The Barmy Army played The Great Escape on loop, but there would be none. In Perth, it is the middle session that breaks the spirit of fielding teams. When they went wicketless in those two hours, their fate was sealed. “England are gone,” Simon Katich said on radio when 50 runs in the black but looking as though they were 200 behind. That they were. Joe Root did what he could with zany fields at Smith and reviews too. But it was beyond that now. As for this week’s statsgasm on the Australian captain, he reached his 22nd century in 14 innings faster than Matthew Hayden. Don Bradman is the only Australian to get there faster. Smith now averages 105 batting in the first innings of home Tests, and this is also his highest score and first double-ton in Australia. But for all that, he will not mind that today is for Marsh. It is a story that he understands well as another who was considered no good to begin with. As the personal milestones added up, their partnership is paused at 301, the same score that was on the board when Marsh’s father, Geoff, batted all day with Mark Taylor on the opening day at Trent Bridge in 1989. As a boy, he grew up looking at a photo of the moment they walked off the ground at stumps. After play, he was off to visit them for a family barbeque where he might have caught a glimpse of it again. When they return on Sunday, will Marsh make his ton a double or more? Or overtake Smith, who started with a 116‑run head start? Maybe. What is certain, though, is that he has proved the big stage is where he now belongs. At last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/01/scottish-labour-seen-as-radicals-by-young-people-new-leader-says","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T11:59:24Z","webTitle":"Young people see Labour as Scotland's radicals, new leader says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/01/scottish-labour-seen-as-radicals-by-young-people-new-leader-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/01/scottish-labour-seen-as-radicals-by-young-people-new-leader-says","fields":{"headline":"Young people see Labour as Scotland's radicals, new leader says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Young people now see Labour as the radicals in Scotland, according to the party’s new leader, Richard Leonard. In his first UK newspaper interview since his convincing victory in November’s leadership election, Leonard also said treating Scotland differently as Nicola Sturgeon demanded because it voted to remain in the EU would be like cordoning off Glasgow because the city voted yes to independence. The former GMB officer, whose leadership campaign was directed by former Jeremy Corbyn aide Simon Fletcher, and who won with strong union backing and tacit support of the Westminster leadership, insisted that “I do not consider myself to be a Corbynista”. He also believed that Sturgeon’s push for a second independence referendum last year had led to a fragmentation of the yes movement and attracted the sort of personal hostility he had not seen “since the days of Margaret Thatcher”. And, as claims are made at a UK level that the leftwing pressure group Momentum is attempting to remove more moderate council and parliamentary candidates, Leonard confirmed that all candidates who stood in this year’s general election in Scotland “should at the very least be on the shortlist” for the next selection, regardless of their affiliations. Leonard is the fourth leader of the party in as many years, since the resignation of Johann Lamont after Scottish Labour’s bruising participation in the pro-union campaign in 2014, when she famously described Westminster as treating Scottish Labour as a “branch office”. How does he propose to make explicit that he leads the Scottish party, particularly given his closeness to Corbyn? “What I’m not going to do is look for manufactured disputes [with the UK party],” he said, suggesting that where differences did arise he expected them to be around policy, with taxation and Trident being current examples. “I was clear in the leadership contest and I’ll be clear in this role that my mandate came from the members of the Scottish Labour party and it’s to them I’ll be accountable.” As for Corbyn, Leonard said: “I’ve been a member of the Labour party for 35 years, I’ve never been in a faction, I’ve never been beholden to any individual and I don’t intend to start now. “I do not consider myself to be a Corbynista. The similarities between myself and Jeremy Corbyn are about our approach to politics. I’ve been a longstanding member of the Labour party, and my views have been pretty consistent. That’s meant I’ve been off-message and out of step from time to time, but I do think that the result of the leadership election signifies that maybe I am now in step and I do represent the direction that members of the Scottish Labour party want the party to go in.” Scottish Labour activists reported a significant change on the doorstep during their general election campaigning, in particular among younger voters who they might formerly have expected to be supporting the SNP. “Over the past few months we’ve started to win back lost Labour voters, people who voted SNP, Green in recent elections, there’s a definite shift taking place. There’s a buzz amongst young people. They are seeing the Labour party as the radical party.” Leonard himself believes that the linkage of a second independence vote to Brexit was “a very polarising political manoeuvre” by the SNP which resonated badly on the doorsteps. “People went from being reasonably benign about Nicola Sturgeon as a politician to being either supportive or absolutely hostile in a way that I’ve not seen hostility towards a political leader since the days of Margaret Thatcher.” “I also found quite a lot of people who were yes supporters who were absolutely apoplectic that they had voted to leave the EU and their vote to leave was being completely ridden roughshod over by this supposition that everybody who supports the SNP supports independence in Europe.” “So I think there was a fragmentation of support around the yes campaign that in turn has laid the ground for people to be more receptive to the radical politics of where the Labour party now is. And now we are the party of change that wants to see a redistribution of power, that’s a really powerful message.” Leonard said that party policy was still to vote with the SNP against the EU withdrawal bill as put before Holyrood “because the shape of the Tory Brexit deal doesn’t look a very attractive one”. But he said that he had no regrets about voting for article 50 in a symbolic vote in the Scottish parliament, despite the fact that the majority of Scots – and Scottish Labour supporters – voted to remain within the EU. “Those people that were suggesting that we should block article 50 included those that took the view that the political elite had some sort of mandate over and above the mandate they were given by the people, and I think that’s one of the reasons why politics has been drawn into some disrepute. In my view elected politicians have to respect the view of the people.” Does he feel out of step with the view of Scottish people, given that 62% voted to remain in the EU in 2016? “I feel comfortable and in step with my own democratic principles. The franchise for the 2016 referendum was the UK and you can’t try and change the goalposts afterwards. It’s like saying in 2014 Glasgow voted yes, Dundee voted yes, therefore they should be cordoned off. It doesn’t work like that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/16/england-creeping-ashes-dread-materialises-day-flagellation-waca","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T11:46:14Z","webTitle":"England’s creeping dread materialises in day of Ashes flagellation at the Waca | Ali Martin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/16/england-creeping-ashes-dread-materialises-day-flagellation-waca","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/16/england-creeping-ashes-dread-materialises-day-flagellation-waca","fields":{"headline":"England’s creeping dread materialises in day of Ashes flagellation at the Waca","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Less than an hour into play on the third morning, after Steve Smith had chalked up his second century of the series, the brass section of the Barmy Army on the western hill here began playing the theme tune to the Great Escape. Though Australia were three down and still 180 runs in arrears at this stage, it was pitch-perfect in its reflection of creeping English dread. This was already shaping up to be a day of flagellation at the hands of the mighty Australian captain, whose blade had looked so thick and utterly impenetrable while chipping off the eight runs he required for Test century No22. By the end it could easily have been The Last Post. Australia had lost one wicket, Smith’s personal score had swollen to career-best unbeaten 229, Mitchell Marsh was savouring his maiden Test hundred and the lead had switched around to 146 in favour of the hosts. Rain is forecast and a famous rearguard may yet follow but the destiny of the Ashes looks locked in. Kudos must of course go to Smith. As Dileep Premachandran of this parish tweeted, he was simply doing to England what Virat Kohli had achieved in Mumbai last winter by “bending the script to his will”. This was a modern-day master proving again why there is clear daylight between himself and the chasing pack in the Test rankings. Marsh thrived in his slipstream and then outscored him, ridiculing the old adage about not changing a winning team by replacing Peter Handscomb and slapping England’s beleaguered attack to all parts of his home ground. He also drew his own family level with the tourists in terms of centuries in this series after older brother, Shaun hit an unbeaten 126 in Adelaide. And England? They were left wearing the badge of honour that Jonny Bairstow had spoken of the previous evening when he compared the achievement of blunting Australia’s pace attack to a day spent chasing leather for little reward. Though talking specifically about his 237-run stand with Dawid Malan, the wicketkeeper’s words were prescient. What followed was a smorgasbord of bereft English imagery, such as Root sending an lbw against Smith upstairs only to find Jimmy Anderson had overstepped for the first time in three years, Craig Overton twisting up in the boundary rope after an umpteenth failed chase or the local jeers as Stuart Broad became the second of four bowlers to bring up a century. Flat is the word that summed up the bowlers after England lost their final six wickets for 35 runs on the second day and it was no doubt chuntered about the surface throughout this grim slog. But when Tim Paine was taking balls above his head on day one, and Bairstow was pouching them at waist height from the outset of the second, it once again highlighted what is required in these parts and what Joe Root so badly lacks. Anderson, Broad and Chris Woakes all crave lateral movement and at home they challenge the very tightest techniques. Without it, the homogenous nature of their right-arm fast-medium can be exploited; just as Kohli exposed a dearth of spin bowlers last winter, Smith and co are doing the same in terms of pace bowlers. This may be too simple a diagnosis; a hark back to the days staring enviously at the West Indian quicks or Shane Warne’s fizzing leg-breaks. But given this was the ninth time in the past year they have spent 129 overs or more in the field – and the fifth in the past two years they have shipped 500-plus runs – it is not too great a stretch to suggest one honking issue is a lack bowlers who can transcend conditions of little or no assistance. Perhaps one of the saddest sights has been watching Moeen Ali bowl. One of the leading lights of the English summer has been neutered such that, while he did claim the solitary wicket when Shaun Marsh nibbled behind at lunch, he is operating with a new action that betrays the utter funk he is in. Smith’s salty assertion that Malan’s leg-spin was superior stung because it was true. Overton spent the third day stoically bowling through the pain of a cracked rib, again underlining the attitude he possesses. But with the blow originally inflicted by Pat Cummins in Adelaide and only scanned after he fell awkwardly on the second day here, perhaps we can add medical to the list of England departments feeling a bit sheepish right now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/16/missing-monet-painting-gallery-found-online","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T20:30:11Z","webTitle":"Out of the fog: ‘missing’ Monet found through the power of the web","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/16/missing-monet-painting-gallery-found-online","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/16/missing-monet-painting-gallery-found-online","fields":{"headline":"Out of the fog: ‘missing’ Monet found through the power of the web","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Tracking down lost works of art usually involves poring over obscure documents in galleries, archives and libraries, searching for clues. But the curator of a forthcoming National Gallery exhibition on Claude Monet will be featuring a “missing” painting that he found through a startlingly straightforward route – a Google search. The art historian Richard Thomson knew the painting, Effet de Brouillard, from a postage stamp-sized image in the definitive catalogue of works by the impressionist master. It was listed as being in a private collection. Thomson, who is Watson Gordon professor of fine art at Edinburgh University, told the Observer: “It’s a picture that’s been off the beaten track, off the radar, and we’re going to have it in the show. Its whereabouts weren’t known… It’s exciting.” Effet de Brouillard is an atmospheric scene that depicts Argenteuil, near Paris, the rural retreat where Monet lived between 1871 and 1878. It was here that he produced some of his most sublime masterpieces. Thomson thought that the 1872 painting, a hazy view of houses shrouded in fog, would be perfect for his exhibition, Monet &amp; Architecture. He had already secured loans from private and public collections, and this seemed like a missing piece in the jigsaw. To his astonishment, some Googling revealed that the painting had just been sold in America, by a New Orleans dealer. Art historians had apparently also missed its 2007 sale by Christie’s, whose catalogue entry notes just three previous exhibitions, in 1874, “possibly” in London, and in 1895, in Boston and New York. The New Orleans dealer put Thomson in contact with the new owners, who were happy to see their painting displayed in the National Gallery. According to Thomson, the work was featured in Paul Hayes Tucker’s 1982 book Monet at Argenteuil, in black and white, and in a 1990s catalogue in colour, where it was “only the size of a Christmas-card postage stamp”. He joked: “I’ve done my time buried away in archives and libraries. Every now and then one has to use other options.” Effet de Brouillard will be among 75 works in the National Gallery exhibition, which opens in April. It will include 10 paintings of Argenteuil and the Parisian suburbs, seven Rouen cathedrals and eight London paintings. A substantial proportion of the loans – about a quarter – are from private collections. “There are some fantastic unknown pictures,” Thomson said. The exhibition will reflect how, through buildings, Monet explored “the play of sunshine, fogs and reflections”. As the artist put it in 1895: “Other painters paint a bridge, a house, a boat … I want to paint the air that surrounds the bridge, the house, the boat – the beauty of the light in which they exist.” While Monet is typically portrayed as a painter of landscape, of the sea, and in his later years, of gardens, an exhibition focusing on his work in terms of architecture had not been undertaken until now, the National Gallery said. The artist is a huge draw for the public. The Royal Academy’s 1999 blockbuster show, Monet in the 20th Century, attracted more than 700,000 visitors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/16/steve-smith-double-hundred-mitchell-marsh-australia-england-ashes-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T10:09:56Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith’s double ton has Australia motoring out of England’s Ashes sight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/16/steve-smith-double-hundred-mitchell-marsh-australia-england-ashes-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/16/steve-smith-double-hundred-mitchell-marsh-australia-england-ashes-report","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith’s double ton has Australia motoring out of England’s Ashes sight","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"England have been this way before so a sense of foreboding is rife. In the 21st century a first-innings score in excess of 400 guarantees nothing and they know that better than most. A year ago, on their tour of India, England amassed 400 in Mumbai and 477 in Chennai. On both occasions they lost the match by an innings. The numbers are looking ominously similar here in Perth. Despite England’s 403, Australia led by 146 and they had six wickets in hand at the end of the third day. On a sleeping pitch England tend to do a lot of fielding. Despite all the plans and funky fields, which sometimes look more of a hindrance than a help, they struggle even with the presence of their record-breaking bowlers. So it was here on the third day when, for the second time in history, England were tormented by a New South Welshman and a Marsh – or two. In 1989, Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh batted all of the first day of the Trent Bridge Test, while scoring 301. Here, Steve Smith from Sydney, with the same sense of inevitability that greets an incoming tide, batted flawlessly for hour after hour in the company of a Marsh, Shaun for 55 minutes and Mitchell for the rest of the day. While Smith cruised effortlessly to his highest Test score, 229, Mitchell Marsh standing massively tall, hit his maiden Test century, during which he struck the ball with greater power than anyone else in the match, finishing the day on 181. The partnership is worth 301. The home crowd revelled in the success of their state captain, the son of Geoff, younger brother of Shaun and now the third man in his family to score a Test century against England. Marsh’s innings capped another wonderful day for Australia – and their selectors. There have been some criticisms of the recall of the Marsh brothers – especially from those residing in the eastern states. But now the figures speak for themselves. Mind you, there is no more reassuring a sight for an incoming batsman than the presence of Smith at the other end. He began the day on 92 not out and before a ball was bowled on Saturday there was talk of him passing his career best of 215. Once play started there was no reason to doubt that he could break a few other records as well. England began with a funky field to him for the pacemen with five men on the leg side and a solitary slip. These unorthodox placements are supposed to perplex the batsman, who becomes preoccupied about the nature of the opposition’s cunning plan. But here they seemed to make Smith feel like a million dollars – as well as opening up gaps in the field for easy runs. Smith now surely welcomes such unorthodoxy, which requires the bowlers to offer no width whatsoever, a line that reduces the possibility of the ball taking the outside edge. How do most batsmen get dismissed here, where the bounce is higher than the norm? From the outside edge or, if the bowlers are fast enough – and England’s were never going to be – via the well-directed short ball. Even at the start of play Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson declined to look for Smith’s outside edge. It was almost as if they were in damage limitation mode against him from the first ball. No doubt the Australia captain sensed that as well. He knew he was in clover. So Smith slipped easily to his 22nd Test century, and his fastest, from 138 balls, a figure that throws into the doubt the wisdom of some of the funkiness; soon he had registered 1,000 runs in a calendar year for the fourth time in succession. Shaun Marsh had been watchful alongside him; then, upon the introduction of Moeen Ali, he hit two consecutive fours but the next delivery turned a fraction and he was caught at slip by Root. England’s elation was brief and muted. The second new ball offered no more help than the first. When Smith was on 135 England reviewed an Anderson lbw appeal but it was an act of desperation; Anderson did not really look convinced, only surprised that Smith had missed a ball. Meanwhile, Mitchell Marsh settled in as if he was a Test veteran. After the break England tried their bodyline tactic via Broad and Chris Woakes but it was slow bodyline designed as much to stop the batsmen scoring rather than to dismiss them. Neither Smith nor Marsh was too bothered. On 163, Smith edged a ball but it dropped 10 feet short of the slip fielder; such a moment qualified as a blip in this innings. By now he was starting to decelerate; he would play the long game; already he was planning a mammoth first-innings lead. In this pursuit Marsh was a magnificent ally: he drove with absolute certainty on either side of the wicket; he cut powerfully to the ever-vacant third-man boundary and soon he had raced past his best Test score of 87. Just before tea he registered his century that was rapturously received by the home supporters. How to be polite about the English bowlers, who were now tormented by a pitch that offered them no help, given that they lack the pace to bombard the batsmen? Well, Anderson was the most accurate; Woakes looked the most willing; maybe Craig Overton was the bravest since it was revealed that he has a hairline cracked rib; but he kept going anyway. Moeen was the solitary wicket-taker and he seems to have adjusted his action; he has reduced his gather as he moves into his delivery stride and he appears to be slightly more open-chested. This may lead to greater accuracy but his bowling lacked the zip of earlier in the year. Wittingly or not he is bowling more slowly than in Brisbane. But the gloomy news is that Dawid Malan, who, all too late in proceedings, was invited to propel some of his leg-breaks, bowled six overs that were as impressive as any others on a dire day for England."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/16/san-francisco-homeless-robot","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Big Brother on wheels?

Fired security robot divides local homeless people","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"To some homeless people, San Francisco’s latest security robot was a rolling friend on five wheels that they called “R2-D2 Two”. To others living in tents within the droid’s radius, it was the “anti-homeless robot”. For a month, the 400lb, bullet-shaped bot patrolled outside the not-for-profit San Francisco SPCA animal shelter, rolling around the organization’s parking lots and sidewalks, capturing security video and reading up to 300 license plates per minute. Homeless people who pitched their tents in an alleyway nearby complained they felt the beeping, whirring droid’s job was to run them off. “We called it the anti-homeless robot,” said John Alvarado, who was one of numerous people camping next to the animal shelter when the robot arrived. He said he quickly decided to move his tent half a block away: “I guess that was the reason for the robot.” Officials of both the SF SPCA and Knightscope, who rented the robot to the shelter, denied that the intention was to dislodge homeless encampments. “The SPCA has the right to protect its property, employees and visitors, and Knightscope is dedicated to helping them achieve this goal,” Knightscope said in a statement. SF SPCA staff members said the facility had been plagued with break-ins, staff members had been harassed as they went to the parking lot and sidewalks were littered with hypodermic needles. Jennifer Scarlett, the SF SPCA president, said in a release that her organization “was exploring the use of a robot to prevent additional burglaries at our facility and to deter other crimes that frequently occur on our campus – like car break-ins, harassment, vandalism, and graffiti – not to disrupt homeless people”. But after complaints about the program were shared widely on social media, the organization quickly admitted it had made a mistake in its choice of security guards – and fired the robot. “Since this story has gone viral, we’ve received hundreds of messages inciting violence and vandalism against our facility, and encouraging people to take retribution,” said Scarlett, noting that their campus had since been vandalized twice. “We are taking this opportunity to reflect on the ‘teachable moment’.” Some of the homeless people who crossed paths with the white security robot, which bore images of dogs and cats, as it patrolled outside of San Francisco SPCA this month thought it was a cute and a positive addition to the area. TJ Thornton, whose tent is still pitched across the street from the shelter’s parking lot, nicknamed the bot “R2-D2 Two”. He liked how the machine made little whistling sounds as it moved along the sidewalk and how it would even say “hello” if you walked past it. Thornton said he thought the bot had a positive influence on the neighborhood and relieved the pressure on local homeless people to always keep an eye on cars parked nearby. “People living on the streets actually watch out for the cars. If anyone does anything stupid, like breaking into cars, it reflects on us.” Others saw the robot as Big Brother, surveilling their every move with video cameras. “That SPCA robot was the bane of our existence,” said Lexi Evans, 26, who has been living on San Francisco’s streets for 13 years. “It was driving us crazy.” She said her group of friends had a tent encampment behind the SPCA. When they first saw the robot looking at them, they found it creepy. Then they noticed its white light flashing and thought it was recording their every move on video. Later they observed police officers coming to interact with the robot and wondered whether it was feeding information to law enforcement. “We started feeling like this thing was surveilling us for the police,” said Evans, whose whole tent encampment has now moved around the block outside another business. “That’s officially invasion of privacy. That’s uncool.” Evans said that once, someone became so angry with the thing that they knocked it over. The robot made a “whee-ooh wah” sound. In another instance, somebody “put a tarp over it, knocked it over and put barbecue sauce on all the sensors”, Scarlett, the SPCA president, told the San Francisco Business Times. Trouble really started for the robot last week, when the city issued an order for it to stay off the public sidewalk or face a daily penalty of up to $1,000 for operating in the public right of way without a permit. Then the story hit the internet, with Scarlett telling the Business Times that “from a walking standpoint, I find the robot much easier to navigate than an encampment”. But by Friday, SF SPCA was apologizing for having brought in the machine. “We regret that our words were ill-chosen. They did not properly convey the pilot program’s intent and they inaccurately reflected our values,” said Scarlett. “We are a nonprofit that is extremely sensitive to the issues of homelessness.” Knightscope’s robots have gotten into trouble in other cities. Last year, a similar robot allegedly ran over a 16-month-old toddler at the Stanford Shopping Center in the town of Palo Alto, causing minor injuries. Another Knightscope security robot became famous on social media for drowning itself in the fountain of the Washington DC office complex it was policing. “I already miss it,” said Danica Dito, who works in the SPCA administrative offices. “Just the fact that it rolled around discouraged crime.” Do you have an experience of homelessness to share with the Guardian?

Last week, Republicans on the House judiciary committee opened fire, grilling the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, and accusing Mueller’s team of bias and a “political witch-hunt”. This makes for great political theater and irresistible cable news fodder, but looking down the road at the different ways this gambit will play itself out, you have to wonder: what on earth are Republicans thinking? Trump partisans might succeed in derailing Mueller in the short run, but that spells disaster in the end for Republicans. Let’s take a look at the whole chessboard and see how the game looks several moves from now. It’s not pretty. The initial playbook is familiar. First, muddy the water by vigorously deploying “whataboutism” at high volume on everyone from Barack Obama to Mueller to (especially) Hillary Clinton. Drag up discredited allegations like the Russian uranium deal, Clinton e-mails, or – God help us – Benghazi. Second, create-your-own conspiracy by finding someone in the FBI or justice department who either contributed to Democrats or said bad things about Donald Trump. There are surely lots of them, and Trump backers have already dug up a couple of juicy examples. Third, demand another special counsel to investigate the investigators, tarring Mueller and the FBI, and thereby dragging out the denouement. So far, so good. But then what? Here are the likely scenarios: 1. A special counsel is appointed to investigate the FBI’s handling of the Clinton e-mails, Russian uranium, etc. Since these cases have already been debunked by official investigations, the gambit leads nowhere but down a rathole. Money is wasted, nothing is learned, and the conspiracy true-believers still see black helicopters everywhere. Congressional Republicans take a beating in the non-fake news media for partisan hypocrisy. Dead end. 2. The second special counsel investigates Mueller and the FBI. Mueller is a lifelong Republican, appointed to head the FBI by George W Bush, and he’s also a Trump administration appointee. A genuine American hero, a Vietnam veteran who won two Bronze Stars for valor and a Purple Heart, he has an impeccable legal reputation. He wins praise from Republicans on Capitol Hill and even Trump’s own lawyers. No there, there. Dead end. 3. Trump fires Mueller. Despite all the brave statements from Republican senators defending Mueller in months past, by even raising the possibility of a second special counsel, congressional Republicans have given the president the green light to fire Mueller. But even if Trump gets rid of Mueller and doesn’t precipitate a constitutional crisis (doubtful), the investigation isn’t going away. There are two indictments and two guilty pleas on the table already. The justice department, even under Trump’s loyal lapdog Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, will continue to dig. It may take longer, but as Plutarch warned in his Moralia: “The millstones of the gods grind late, but they grind fine.” And there’s the rub. For Republicans, delay spells doom. The calendar is not the Republican party’s friend. The longer this drags on, the tougher 2018 looks for the ruling party. Congress’ popularity is already in single digits, and Trump’s numbers continue to erode in the Republican base. He’s already lost everybody else. If Democrats take the House of Representatives next year, which now seems possible, it represents an existential threat to the Trump presidency, and to Republican electoral prospects for years. Democrats will beef up investigations at all levels, and that will not end well for Trump. (See Watergate, and the Democratic waves of 1974 and 1976.) Here’s the really interesting part. For congressional Republicans, and the Republican party nationally, it doesn’t really matter if Trump is guilty or innocent. Either way, a quick resolution is the best outcome for the party. Think about it. If Trump is innocent, the sooner that’s cleared up the better. He’s still mightily unpopular, but at least he’s not going to jail, and Republicans can get on with the business of government, vastly improving their election prospects for 2018. If he’s guilty, best to just rip off the bandage and get it over with. The sooner the better. Plus, by encouraging an honest and thorough investigation, establishment Republicans would burnish their reputations as patriotic, honest statesmen, also vastly improving their election prospects for 2018. So why don’t congressional Republicans recognize the Hobson’s choice Trump is demanding? Maybe they fear Trump’s hypnotic control over the Republican base, but that aura of invincibility was shattered in Alabama’s Senate vote. Maybe they fear Hannity, Fox “News”, Rush Limbaugh, Breitbart or the rightwing noise machine? Maybe, but that noise will cease when the rest of the indictments come down. Surely they don’t fear Steve Bannon after Alabama? Whatever the reason, the Republican establishment is being stampeded by the Trumpistas into a completely avoidable disaster.

There is a team winning every game right now, but at the same time you have to concede that other teams are trying their best and in the last 10 games we have done a good job.” With Manchester City apparently already over the horizon in the Premier League, Chelsea will at some point have to surrender their title of champions. But there has been no crisis at Stamford Bridge in Conte’s second season and this was a highly professional victory over a Southampton side who delivered a performance that belied their own challenging form. Marcos Alonso decided the match with a free-kick in first-half injury time. His left-foot strike was delivered with typical precision, bending first outside then inside Fraser Forster’s right post, bouncing at the last moment and arcing over the keeper’s outstretched arm into the net. Conte described Alonso as “a specialist in that situation” before bemoaning a lack of sharpness elsewhere in his side. Chelsea created numerous chances throughout and should have won by more. Southampton played with belief and determination despite their slim total of four league wins. They could argue their defensive efforts were just as significant in keeping the scoreline tight and could even have snatched a point had Charlie Austin converted a one-on-one within a minute of coming on. Another name on the bench provoked a talking point: Virgil van Dijk was not selected by Mauricio Pellegrino with two weeks until the January transfer window opens. “It was a difficult game and we were a little bit unlucky in the way that we conceded, during injury time‚” Pellegrino said. “Chelsea created clear chances but the idea was to be in the game till the end and we were there.” On Van Dijk, he added: “We had played three games in six days. It’s really difficult to keep the same condition when it’s Wednesday night to Saturday afternoon, with less than three days to recover. I changed a lot of players and Virgil was just one of them.” So far, so boilerplate, but when pressed on the issue the Argentinian was unable to confirm the club will reject offers for the Dutch defender, something they did repeatedly during the summer. Van Dijk is still a target for Liverpool, and Manchester City as well, and Pellegrino said “I cannot control the market and I am not the owner of the player. All I can do is relay my opinion, after that the board can decide what is best for the team. I would recommend to try to keep our best players at the club. The club was quite clear on this at the beginning of the season and I have the same opinion now.” Conte was asked about Van Dijk but did the graceful thing, refusing to comment on another club’s player. He was happier when allowed to air the bee stuck in his bonnet: time-wasting on the part of his opponents. The Chelsea manager was particularly frustrated about the time taken by Forster at his goal-kicks. “Every time the ball went out it was maybe one minute before the game restarted‚” he said. “It’s important to pay great attention to wasting time. This happened and I hope something can change.” He went on to make a suggestion as to future practice. “To book the goalkeeper early is very important because then the game is faster‚” he said Perhaps Conte’s time and motion studies came in useful, given that Alonso’s free kick came in the third minute of first-half added time. A late booking for the wing-back means he will miss the midweek Carabao Cup quarter-final with Bournemouth, which also became the object of Conte’s fastidious grumbling. “For sure I prefer to have all players available and for sure there is a problem because [Davide] Zappacosta is recovering from bad flu,” he said. “But it can happen and we must be ready to overcome this difficulty.” The title may be all but gone, but Conte’s footballing obsession endures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/21/an-air-kicking-keeper-mma-hubris-and-rod-stewart-our-pick-of-2017-sport-clips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"An air-kicking keeper, MMA hubris and Rod Stewart: our pick of 2017 sport clips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/21/an-air-kicking-keeper-mma-hubris-and-rod-stewart-our-pick-of-2017-sport-clips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/21/an-air-kicking-keeper-mma-hubris-and-rod-stewart-our-pick-of-2017-sport-clips","fields":{"headline":"An air-kicking keeper, MMA hubris and Rod Stewart: our pick of 2017 sport clips","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) Way back when in January, Rod Stewart was invited to conduct the Scottish Cup fifth round draw.

Mladić’s life sentence for his leading role in ethnic cleansing operations in Bosnia, the battle for Sarajevo, and the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica was fully deserved. But this symbolic success cannot hide the fact that the international criminal justice system is under siege from within and without. In 2017, its problems grew worse. Mladić’s conviction followed the successful prosecution of another high-profile figure, the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić, in addition to nearly 160 other criminal indictees. All this is the work of the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), created by the UN security council in 1993. At the time, there was scepticism that the new court could function while the war still raged. To this day, many people in the western Balkans remain critical of its performance. But broadly speaking, the ICTY – which will be dissolved at the end of this month – may be judged a success. It brought justice, if not perfect closure, where mayhem and murder once reigned unchecked. The ICTY precedent has had an impact reaching far beyond south-eastern Europe. In 1994, the UN created a sister court – the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda – to prosecute those responsible for the genocide in that country. The “special court for Sierra Leone”, founded in 2002, was a variation on the theme. The ICTY measurably reinforced the concept of supranational justice applied over the heads, if need be, of national leaders and governments. And its inception undoubtedly smoothed the way for the founding, under UN auspices, of a permanent international criminal court (ICC) with global jurisdiction. The ICC is the world’s court of last resort, specifically tasked with investigating genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It began work in The Hague in 2002, when the Rome statute came into force. It is backed by 123 state parties, including Britain, out of a possible total of 195. Member states voted last week to significantly widen its jurisdiction, from next year, to include state-on-state crimes of aggression. So far, so good. Or perhaps not. From its earliest days, the ICC faced accusations that it was unduly focused on Africa, where nearly all its investigations have taken place. Fatou Bensouda, of Gambia, the current chief prosecutor, has worked to dispel these suspicions. But a degree of disillusionment persists. This year, Burundi became the first ever state to quit the court, claiming it was an “instrument of the west”. South Africa tabled legislation last week that, if enacted, would make good its previous threat to pull out. And African Union states have backed a non-binding proposal for mass withdrawal. Bensouda has taken concrete steps to broaden the ICC’s scope. Relatively new “preliminary examinations” now include Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine and Ukraine. This means American troops who have been fighting the Taliban, and killing Afghan civilians, inadvertently or otherwise, since 2001 are coming under belated legal scrutiny. Likewise, the actions of Israeli security forces in the occupied territories and Russian-backed troops in Ukraine will be examined. The behaviour of members of the British armed forces in Iraq following the 2003 invasion, the subject of much domestic litigation, forms part of another ICC examination. There is much to investigate in all these situations. The question is whether the ICC can act effectively. Palestinian human rights groups, for example, submitted evidence to the ICC in September alleging war crimes and crimes against humanity by Israeli officials in the West Bank and Gaza. Last year, Human Rights Watch called on the ICC to investigate the 2014 Gaza war and the expansion of Jewish settlements, illegal under international law. But while the Palestinian Authority joined the Rome statute in 2015, Israel rejects ICC jurisdiction. Israeli nationals could, in theory, be prosecuted for crimes committed on Palestinian soil. But Israel’s government has no obligation to surrender them to the court. The US, China and Russia, which also boycott the ICC, afford similar protections to their nationals, wherever they may be, whatever they may do. This continuing refusal of major global powers to support the international criminal justice system, represented at its apex by the ICC, seriously undermines its credibility. The failure of ICC members to enforce their own rules, as in the case of Omar al-Bashir, the Sudanese president indicted for genocide and war crimes in Darfur, has also done great damage. When Bashir visited South Africa in 2015, Jacob Zuma’s government ignored its legal obligations and declined to arrest him. In her annual report this month, Bensouda said it was imperative to close what she called the impunity gap. “What is required, today more than ever, is greater recognition of the need to strengthen the court and the evolving system of international criminal justice. It is up to state parties, first and foremost, as custodians of the Rome statute, to stand firmly by its values and further foster its positive impact in practice,” she said. The Mladić case aside, developments in 2017 suggest Bensouda’s call may fall on deaf ears. In Syria, not a state party to the ICC, horrific war crimes have continued unchecked. In the failed state of Yemen, also not a member, a similar tragedy has played out. Much of the killing in both countries can be attributed to Russian and Saudi forces, respectively, who are beyond the ICC’s purview. In Myanmar, tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have suffered what the US terms ethnic cleansing – but neither the Trump administration, the UN, nor a hamstrung ICC have done much about it. The same goes for the North Korean regime’s systemic abuses of its citizens. The focus there is on missiles, not misery. In truth, Bensouda’s “impunity gap” widened into a chasm in 2017. This ongoing failure to consistently and comprehensively pursue, prosecute and punish individuals guilty of the worst crimes known to humanity is universally shaming. It is reprehensible that great powers aspiring to global leadership, such as China and India, shirk their responsibilities with self-serving arguments about national sovereignty. It is shocking that the US, a once proud beacon of liberty and justice, also continues to fail the international community in this regard. And it is unacceptable that notorious malefactors, such as Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, appear beyond the reach of the of the law. A special tribunal set up by the UN has been compiling reports on Syria for years. There is no shortage of damning evidence. But only the UN security council can refer Assad to the ICC. And it has not done so because Syria’s ally, Russia, would veto any such move. The wider political environment has deteriorated, too. The rise of Donald Trump and inward-looking, nativist and populist forces in the western democracies has further undermined faith in transnational institutions such as the European court of justice and World Court. Lack of leadership, lack of vision and lack of a sense of common purpose are among many contributory factors. But only one conclusion is possible. Nearly a century after the 1919 Paris peace conference set up a “Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties”, it is a scandal that an under-powered, ill-supported international criminal justice system still struggles, and often fails, to bring the world’s worst offenders to book."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/17/centrepoint-helpline-homeless-under-25s-advice","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T00:05:16Z","webTitle":"‘Mum says I can’t come home’: Centrepoint’s lifeline for the invisible young homeless","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/17/centrepoint-helpline-homeless-under-25s-advice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/17/centrepoint-helpline-homeless-under-25s-advice","fields":{"headline":"‘Mum says I can’t come home’: Centrepoint’s lifeline for the invisible young homeless","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The email is brief and to the point. “I am at risk of being homeless as my fiance is kicking me out,” it starts. “I have lots of cuts and bruises from fights we have. I am scared. If he evicts me I have nowhere to go. I can stay at my nan’s until Sunday, but after that I have nowhere. I don’t know what to do. The violence is horrible.” The plea from a young woman arrives on a bank of screens in a basement office, loaned to the organisation in central London, where staff and volunteers operate a helpline for the youth homelessness charity Centrepoint. It’s not exceptional: one in every 20 calls or emails are prompted by domestic abuse, another three in 20 by relationship breakdown. Most often, though, young people get in touch because they can no longer stay with their families. “We ask them if they have evidence they have been shut out by their parents,” says Paul Brocklehurst, who manages the service. “For example, texts from their mum saying, ‘You can’t come home’.” Such advice can sound shockingly clinical, but the Centrepoint team is skilled in knowing what evidence homeless young people need to make a case to local councils to get access to housing. The odds are stacked against them, and the chances of being assessed as having priority need are slim, but applicants are more likely to be successful if they can prove they are at risk or have a health condition. Often they may be reluctant to disclose a diagnosis, or unaware of the importance of doing so. “I had a young guy last week who had been evicted and had severe mental health issues and had attempted suicide,” recalls Nina Calder, an experienced advice worker on the helpline. “It only came out later in the conversation that he was also diabetic and insulin-dependent. That could make all the difference to his case because insulin has to be kept in a fridge.” Giving young people direct access to such specialist knowledge and practical assistance is why Centrepoint set up the helpline this year. The charity, one of three supported by this year’s Guardian and Observer appeal, is better known for providing long-term accommodation and support for homeless under-25s. But it realised there was a pressing need for a service that could offer instant advice and help, and build a better picture of a growing problem that becomes visible only when young men and women end up on the streets. Of more than 1,600 young people who contacted the helpline in its first six months, one in five were sleeping rough. About the same number were still in the family home, anticipating leaving, but the biggest group – almost a third – were sofa-surfing with their friends or relatives and exhausting their welcome. Just such a call comes in to Calder. It’s a young man, let’s call him Rakesh, who is staying at a friend’s flat in east London but can no longer afford to contribute to rent or bills. He had been in local authority care until he turned 21 this year, and says he was at that point offered a flat, but turned it down because he was going overseas for an extended break. His personal adviser, allocated by the council, had quit and he had acted without any advice. Calder’s expression speaks volumes, but she makes no comment and patiently sets out Rakesh’s immediate options: he should ask the council if it owes any continuing duty of care to him, which is probably unlikely, but he must also make a homelessness application and, if he is assessed as having no priority need, be sure to ask for a housing referral anyway. That may be unlikely, too, so she also advises him on local housing organisations to which he can self-refer. Rakesh sounds grateful for the tips and for Calder’s calm counsel, if bemused by the system he has to wrestle with. You sense he will be back in touch. Grace Ogunyemi, the helpline team leader, says the system is intimidating at the best of times, let alone when a young person is under great stress. It is vital, for instance, that they insist on a written decision from the local council on their eligibility for priority-need housing, rather than accept a verbal rejection. Once they have that piece of paper, legal avenues can be explored. Most of the calls and emails to the helpline come from young people in towns and cities, but problems can be just as severe in rural areas. Ogunyemi recalls a recent contact from Cornwall, where locals face an uphill battle for accommodation, with many properties used as holiday homes. A young man had received a negative decision letter but found that local lawyers wanted payment – £180 is typical – even to consider his case. Ogunyemi spent hours searching for a solicitor who would give him an hour for free. Did she succeed? “Oh yes,” she says. “I was proud of that one.” • Support our three chosen charities by donating here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/17/call-to-fine-schools-that-illegally-exclude-poorly-performing-pupils","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T00:05:16Z","webTitle":"Call to fine schools that illegally exclude poorly performing pupils","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/17/call-to-fine-schools-that-illegally-exclude-poorly-performing-pupils","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/17/call-to-fine-schools-that-illegally-exclude-poorly-performing-pupils","fields":{"headline":"Call to fine schools that illegally exclude poorly performing pupils","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Ministers are being urged to fine schools that are informally excluding poorly performing pupils, amid mounting evidence that some institutions are attempting to game the exam system. Hundreds of cases of children being removed from schools on tenuous and potentially illegal grounds have been reported to a charity offering legal advice to parents. Experts blame the rise of so-called “off-rolling” on schools that are under pressure to improve performance. Children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are thought to be the most affected by the informal methods designed to move them out of a school without recording their departure as an official exclusion. With pressure mounting on the Department for Education to act, Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, said some schools were “abandoning their responsibility” to give a decent education to their children. She told the Observer it was “increasingly clear that some schools are gaming the system by taking children they think won’t get good results off their rolls before they sit their exams. Any school that does this is abandoning their responsibility to children, passing the buck to others who are often ill-equipped and don’t have the support they need to provide a good education. As a result, very vulnerable children are falling through the gaps in the education system, increasing the chances they will then go on to lead difficult adult lives. “I will be calling on the government to set out what measures it will take, including looking at the possibility of financial penalties for schools, to ensure this practice stops now and does not become an acceptable part of the school system.” Last week Amanda Spielman, the Ofsted chief, described off-rolling as “an invidious example of where schools have lost sight of the purpose of education”. Richard Oldershaw, senior legal consultant of the Child Law Advice Service (CLAS), run by the charity Coram, said: “According to Department for Education data, the rate of schools exclusions has stayed roughly the same since 2010. However, evidence from CLAS suggests the number of children excluded from schools is likely to be significantly higher than this figure as unofficial or unlawful exclusions by schools are not recorded in government data. “In the last 20 months, CLAS advised about schools exclusions in 1,704 calls. In a quarter of the calls relating to exclusions from primary schools, the adviser concluded that the school may have acted unlawfully, either by not complying with the correct procedures or because it did not adequately consider the child’s special educational needs. “An exclusion may be necessary, if regrettable, but an exclusion must be undertaken in a fair and transparent manner.” Research last year by the Education Datalab thinktank found that 125 schools would see GCSE pass rates drop by at least five percentage points if they included children who had left early. It identified a group of almost 20,000 children who leave the rolls of mainstream secondary schools, with only 6% recorded as achieving five good GCSEs. The Observer has been contacted by several people claiming they are aware of cases of children being unfairly excluded in ways that are not captured by official figures. One child psychologist said they had come across an “astonishing” case in a south-east comprehensive that was the worst they had encountered in 12 years. The student, currently living in care, was excluded on a second warning without any consultation with their support team in the first month following the takeover of a school deemed to be failing. The student was subjected to a so-called “managed move” and shifted to a pupil referral unit, where other students at the unit were walking out of lessons and insulting teachers. Repeated attempts to meet the leadership at the pupil’s original school were ignored. A Department for Education spokeswoman said that an independent review of exclusions was under way. “Any decision to exclude should be lawful, reasonable and fair,” she said. “While exclusion can be used as a sanction for schools to deal with poor behaviour, permanent exclusion should only be used as a last resort, in response to a serious breach, or persistent breaches, of the school’s behaviour policy, and where allowing the pupil to remain in school would seriously harm the education or welfare of the pupil or others. “We will be launching an externally led review aimed at improving practice in exclusions through sharing best practice nationwide, focusing on the experiences of those groups who are disproportionately likely to be excluded.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/16/england-paul-farbrace-steve-smith-stirring-australia-steve-smith-ashes-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T13:12:05Z","webTitle":"England’s Paul Farbrace admits Steve Smith ‘stirring’ has valid basis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/16/england-paul-farbrace-steve-smith-stirring-australia-steve-smith-ashes-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/16/england-paul-farbrace-steve-smith-stirring-australia-steve-smith-ashes-cricket","fields":{"headline":"England’s Paul Farbrace admits Steve Smith ‘stirring’ has valid basis","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"After inflicting one of England’s most chastening days of Ashes cricket in the field and pocketing a career-best score for himself, Steve Smith made light of his opponents and their lack of potency. Speaking as he left the field on day three, with an unbeaten 229 to his name after batting through all three sessions, the Australia captain described himself as “good sore”, spoke of his love of scoring runs for his country and “thought Dawid Malan was the pick of the spinners”. A throwaway comment, perhaps, but it cut to the heart of England’s problems this series and during the 4-0 defeat in India last winter, with a lack of pace in Joe Root’s attack and Moeen Ali struggling as the spin option despite claiming the solitary wicket to fall on Saturday. Paul Farbrace, England’s assistant coach, who is often put up to speak after a harrowing day, described Smith’s words as “a bit of stirring” but conceded the issues thrown up are valid. “We have got what we’ve got,” he said. “We’ve found it hard to get the ball off the straight on good pitches. I’m not being critical of our bowlers, I’m being honest. There’s nothing that’s surprised us during the course of this series and the same in India last year. Unless we get the ball to reverse then it’s quite tough for our bowlers. “In terms of high-quality pace, we don’t have bowlers bowling 90mph-plus in our setup and we don’t have too many waiting in the wings to come in the near future. And the one or two that do can only bowl four over spells, so they’re not exactly ideal for Test cricket.” Craig Overton was the pick of a limp attack, with the Somerset seamer, in his second Test, diagnosed with a cracked rib at the start of play. It was initially inflicted in Adelaide on his debut when struck by a Pat Cummins bouncer before a tumble on day two here exacerbated the issue. “He’s in a lot of pain. He is suffering but he is such a gutsy lad. He’s playing his first Test series, he’s desperate to play for England and to do well, and he stayed on the field,” said Farbrace. “To go through what he has gone through in the last couple of days and to still be out there bowling – even at the end he dived for one. Rooty suggested to him that he came off but he was having none of it – that tells you a lot about him.” The former England captain Michael Vaughan says England’s bowlers are not suited to thrive in Australian conditions and believes the lack of variety in attack is contributing to their downfall in Australia. “It is a disastrous day. I think today showed we have no swing, no seam, no pace or no spin,” Vaughan told BT Sport. “How are you going to get wickets? You are basically relying on an Australian batting lineup getting bored, chipping one in the air, but you can see in their eyes that they are not going to do that. “They are desperate to get the Ashes back and you have to say today is the day, in my opinion, that the Ashes will be staying in Australia.” He earlier tweeted: “It’s gone. It has gone. England aren’t winning this Ashes series. They’ll find it very difficult to get out of this game without it raining.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/16/jungle-refugee-theatre-paris-london-calais","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T15:05:22Z","webTitle":"From Calais to London and Paris: UK writers give new life to refugees’ theatre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/16/jungle-refugee-theatre-paris-london-calais","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/16/jungle-refugee-theatre-paris-london-calais","fields":{"headline":"From Calais to London and Paris: UK writers give new life to refugees’ theatre","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When the tent in Calais that housed the Good Chance Theatre came down in the spring of last year, as the refugee camp known as “the Jungle” was cleared, the two 25-year-old British playwrights who set it up pledged that the story would not finish there. “We know it is not the end,” Joe Murphy told the Observer last year. This weekend, sure enough, a new future is dawning. Not only has The Jungle, the challenging play that Murphy wrote with Joe Robertson just opened in London to admiring reviews, but “the Joes” have also revealed that their pop-up refugee theatre – visited by leading British actors such as Jude Law, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch – is to rise again next month, this time in Paris. “This is a really exciting development for us,” said Murphy this weekend. “We hope this can become a model: a place in a city for new people to find each other and come together.” A big dome and a little dome – two temporary geodesic structures – are to go up on 23 January for an initial 10 weeks next to the Paris refugee reception site known as La Bulle, or “the Bubble”. Situated in the north of the city, the surrounding camp has welcomed close to 20,000 people since it was opened by the French charity Emmaüs Solidarité almost a year ago, on the suggestion of the mayor, Anne Hidalgo. From next month, at the invitation of “the Joes”, three Paris-based curators will work on a programme of entertainment that will bring in all forms of art. “The curators will be running it alongside the refugees, and they are Elisa Giovannetti, who we have worked with before; Vincent Mangado of the Théâtre du Soleil, who I think we share a vision with; and Jack Ellis, a British actor who lives out there,” said Murphy. “What we are trying to achieve is a venue that can be autonomous,” he adds. While the pair will be there putting on shows, “we feel it is very important that it can exist beyond us”. The Hope Show, a variety evening which became one of the most popular communal events in the Calais camp, will also be back each Saturday night and, importantly, is open to all Parisians. “That is a crucial element for us,” said Robertson. “The camp is a mile and a half from the centre of Paris, but it might as well be another planet, so it is vital we open it to everyone, from our partners in the corporate world to people from the world of fashion.” The original 11-metre dome in Calais, named “Good Chance” after the slang phrase used in the camp for finding a way to get to Britain, was taken down when the French authorities moved in to raze part of the settlement in March 2016. The theatre had been made legally exempt from the clearance, but the facility was pointless without its audience. At the time Robertson described his experience in Calais running the Good Chance as “at once the worst time and the very best time”. The new Paris theatre is the result of a partnership with Emmaüs Solidarité that will allow it to offer a creative space for the use of refugees and migrants, who now reportedly arrive in Paris at a rate of between 80 and 100 a day. Robertson, from Hull, met Murphy, who is from Leeds, when they were both at university in Oxford. Writing for the stage together, they went on to work on director Stephen Daldry’s 2014 film Trash, about poverty in Brazil. They first travelled to the camp together in 2015, staying for six months. It is the naivety of their initial reaction to the community they saw around them that is at the centre of their new play, The Jungle. Now Daldry, fresh from launching season two of his hit television show The Crown, is directing The Jungle, alongside Justin Martin, who also worked on The Crown. A piece of immersive theatre that attempts to recreate the camp for the audience, the play was commissioned by the National Theatre and is performed with a vast refugee cast at the nearby Young Vic. Critics have applauded the ambition of Daldry, Martin and the Joes. The verdict of the critic on review site The Arts Desk was that The Jungle “is done with awesome integrity and total commitment”. Set in a replica of one of the camp’s Afghan restaurants, it features several scenes ridiculing well-intentioned western volunteers and does not offer simple solutions. “From the beginning we faced questions about who we think we are to come and help,” said Robertson. “We are very conscious that we are British.” “It was often the first question in fact,” added Murphy. “Now, as well as launching the Paris Good Chance, we will be working with refugee artists in Britain, to help them develop their new lives.” “Clearly the refugee crisis cannot be solved by any one country,” said Robertson, “but it is the responsibility of artists to create new links between people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/17/at-westminster-the-accused-still-walk-among-us","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T00:05:16Z","webTitle":"At Westminster, those accused of abuse still walk among us | Jess Phillips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/at-westminster-the-accused-still-walk-among-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/at-westminster-the-accused-still-walk-among-us","fields":{"headline":"At Westminster, those accused of abuse still walk among us","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The voting lobbies in Westminster are crowded. MPs pour in to them from the three available doors and form a scrum at the end where we declare our names. One of the doorways which leads straight from the chamber of the House of Commons demands that you stand in a very narrow winding stairway waiting to descend in to the packed lobby. Six or seven people can fit uncomfortably on these stairs, nine or 10 would have to be friendly. Last week I was squished on one of those stairwells, forced into almost full bodily contact with a man I know horrible stories about. A man about whom I have listened to someone crying on the phone. Every fibre of my body feels repelled, I close my eyes, hold my breath as if preparing to dive into deep water. I manage to surge forward quickly into the safety of the scrum. But it’s not safe. In that scrum I am again presented with others who don’t want to catch my eye, or those who don’t give a toss if they do because they have grown used to making people feel uncomfortable. There are others who look notably sorry, sad and repentant. I am certain that none of them feel as uncomfortable as I do. They only have to deal with me knowing and maybe one or two others. I know all of the stories. When I’m surrounded, I feel like Whoopi Goldberg in the film Ghost as she fights through the clamour of the needy dead. I break free of my own lobby into the scrum of all the members of parliament and push through the crowd in the chamber to head back to my office. I’m forced to bow my head, to push through in a way that means I don’t encounter the men from the other side whose skeletons are jangling in my mind. As I walk down the corridors, I have to slow my pace to avoid people who have been referred to the police. I wait for the next lift, find a different table to sit at and ultimately stay in my office as much as possible. The irony that I am the one who alters her behaviour is not lost on me. I notice Damian Green still firmly in his seat by the prime minister in PMQs, as she dares to say: “I want a world in which women and girls have the confidence to be able to be what they want.” It seems some of us don’t need to find somewhere else to sit. It is months since the start of the Westminster sexual harassment scandal. To quote Mrs May again, “nothing has changed”. Except this time when I say nothing has changed, I’m not lying. Last week, a young woman told me that that week a senior special adviser in the government she met at a lobby event had drunkenly asked her if she had a boyfriend, and when she replied no, he asked: “Are you a lesbian, what’s that like?” As you can see, really appropriate behaviour has broken out. When I look down the list of Hollywood directors, British TV and radio stars and US politicians (with a notable exception), I see people forced to resign or sacked because of their alleged behaviour. British politics has no intention of following suit. Parliament and those on the cross-party working group set up by the prime minister to tackle this are working hard to clean up the processes. I commend them. Political parties are similarly trying to make their processes for victims better and more robust at handling complaints. But when it comes to actually clearing out the problem, I am certain that I’ll be packed into crowded lobbies, taking the stairs instead of the lift and listening to tearful conversations for many more years. When the vote number matters more than anything else, byelections must be avoided. Women and men in Westminster said “me too”, but British politics replied, “So what?”.

Less well-known is the story of Lapland’s World Cup triumph. In 2003 the Nouvelle Fédération-Board was set up as the governing body of those regions, stateless people and unrecognised nations not permitted to join Fifa. Monaco, Occitania (comprising chunks of southern France, the Alps and Catalonia), and, yes, Lapland (or, more accurately, Sapmi) were among the founder members. Others – including the principality of Sealand, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Iraqi Kurdistan and a side representing the Aramean-Syriac people – have since joined their number. The first World Cup organised by the NFB took place in 2006 and was scheduled to feature eight teams, but the path to the tournament was not a smooth one. After being stripped of the rights to host the event, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus set up a breakaway tournament to take place at the same time. The eight became six – West Papua, the Roma, Sapmi, Monaco, Occitania, the host nation, and Southern Cameroons. The Papuans, though, failed to show up for the 2006 General Assembly, and the Roma were, understandably, hampered by logistical problems, so the final lineup featured only four teams. On the eve of the competition, visa problems meant the Cameroonians were refused entry to France, leaving the number of participants at three. Sapmi, boasting a side filled with professionals from the Norwegian league, waltzed through the group stage, beating Occitania 7-0 and hammering Monaco 14-0. Somehow, though, the principality secured a place in the final with a 3-2 win over the Occitanians. To say the final at Stade Perruc on 24 November was a one-sided affair would be something of an understatement – Sapmi ran out 21-1 winners, with three players scoring hat-tricks. You can be sure the memory of the triumph kept jolly old Saint Nick warm on his deliveries a month later. One of the hat-trick scorers, Tom Hogli, has since gone on to win 23 caps for Norway, but his former national side have since failed to repeat their success – in 2008 they finished third (although the women’s side did seal their inaugural title) and were third again in 2009 as Padania, helped by the former Internazionale striker Maurizio Ganz, took the crown for the second time. Which football teams appear in the Bible? “It is often said that Queen of the South is the only team mentioned in the Bible – but I can find many mentions of Bury (starting in Genesis 23) and Reading (Acts 8:28), and, stretching a point, Hearts and Wolves also get some space. Are there any others I’ve missed out?” asked George Chilvers in 2005. There are biblical references aplenty so best to get the most tenuous ones out of the way first. Psalm 80:13 mentions, “Boars from the forest ravage it and the creatures of the field feed on it”, while Genesis 12:15 notes: “And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.” Isaiah 41:7 even manages to (sort of) cover two Premier League clubs: “The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, and he who smooths with the hammer spurs on him who strikes the anvil.” But we can do better. Jeremiah 50:25 reads: “The Lord has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign Lord Almighty has work to do in the land of the Babylonians.” There are also the three mentions of Bolivian club The Strongest; in Samuel 11:16, Chronicles 5:2, and Daniel 3:20, while Brazilian outfit Corinthians share their name with two books in the Bible. “There are a few occurrences, discounting the use of place names in Israel that still exist and have teams or place names in Latin America named after biblical references,” adds John Morrow. “In the New International Version you can find Grasshoppers [Zurich] a number of times (eg Numbers 13:33), while Aurora (a club in Guatemala) occurs a number of times in the Spanish language Nueva Versión Internacional (eg Job 3:9), as does Uruguayan side Defensor (eg Proverbs 23:11).” But our favourite has to be this – somewhat dubious – suggestion from Bill Wright, relating to Proverbs 13:23: “ A poor man’s field may produce abundant food, but injustice sweeps it away.” Something Stags fans will probably get quicker than most. Next week … The Knowledge is off on holiday, but will be back on 3 January. Happy Christmas! Can you help? “Was the late Keith Chegwin the inventor, or at least first owner, of a half and half scarf? As a young Dons fan, I recall Multi-Coloured Swapshop doing an OB from Hampden Park on the morning of the 1978 Scottish Cup final. On being asked as to who he would be supporting in the upcoming game, Cheggers admitted to sitting on the fence (having presumably no interest or knowledge of Scottish football). At that point the utter abomination of a half-Aberdeen, half-Rangers scarf was produced for him to wear. This clearly wasn’t commercially available as Aberdeen and Rangers were no more fond of each other in 1978 than they are today. So, presumably it had been knocked up by somebody at BBC Scotland that morning. I can’t, as yet, find the relevant clip on YouTube, but I bet it’s out there. Are there any earlier examples of these things, or is this one more example of Chegwin being ahead of the cultural curve?” asks Gio Alzapiedi. “Almost every time Huddersfield play a Premier League game, the fact they haven’t played the other team in the league since 1972 (the last time Huddersfield were in the top division), crops up. But 45 years isn’t that long in football. So what is the longest period of time between two teams meeting each other in the league?” wonders Torbjorn O Karlsen. “Segunda B side Sabadell have drawn 13 of their opening 19 games this season. Is this a record?” asks Will Unwin. “Manchester City’s winning league run currently stands at an English record of 16 matches. The European consecutive win record is Bayern Munich with 19 matches. Who holds the world record for consecutive wins in competitive football?” tweets Reza Hardy.

Of course, this wouldn’t be about buying kids a six-pack and telling them to get bladdered. It would be a glass of watered-down wine at evening meals, to get them acquainted with a more “continental” approach to civilised drinking. However, evidence suggests that even small amounts of alcohol are dangerous to children before they’re fully grown. Then there are boundaries to consider. If you take away a teenager’s chance to sneak an illicit sip, then how much alcohol, how many drugs, might it take for them to feel that they’ve rebelled? Is this really about teaching responsibility around alcohol, or about certain parents signalling their own sophistication? Most of those socially advantaged children, washing down their pesto pasta with a slurp of Chablis, would probably end up drinking a tad more exuberantly outside the family home anyway.

Here’s Daniel’s on-the-whistle report on a night City surged 14 points clear of the chasing posse. In mid-December. “Today was a special performance from all the team,” he tells BT Sport. “I am happy to be on the scoresheet but it was an incredible performance from all the team ... we could have scored a lot more goals.” On his goal: “It was free header, so I was a bit lucky I suppose,” he says. “Obviously the Spurs players didn’t know how good I am with my head.” [Laughs] Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne got one each, while Raheem Sterling bagged two (and missed several sitters) as Manchester City hammered Spurs to go 14 points clear at the Premier League summit. It could have been a lot worse for outclassed Spurs, who bagged a late, late consolation but will go home knowing they could have finished the game with nine men, and that they could have lost by eight or nine if the victors had converted more of their chances. Tottenham are in seventh, seeing as you’re asking. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over and Manchester City have swatted Tottenham Hotspur aside win their 16th consecutive Premier League match and go 14 points clear. Spurs had no answers there and will consider themselves lucky to get away from the Etihad tonight having lost by only three goals. Christian Eriksen sends a low daisy-cutter into the bottom corner from the edge of the penalty area and doesn’t even bother celebrating. 90+2 min: Spurs have got a hiding here tonight, but in trutyh the scorelines could have been a lot worse from their point of view. They can probably count themselves lucky to escape the Etihad with ... oh, hold on. Raheem Sterling practically walks the ball into the back of the Tottenham net after an Eric Dier mistake allows him to nutmeg Lloris and prod into an empty goal from six yards. 89 min: Tottenham substitution: Danny Rose off, Ben Davies on. 88 min: Phil Foden gives the ball away halfway inside the Tottenham half, allowing Spurs to break on the counter. Not for long, mind – within seconds, Raheem Sterling is receiving a pass from Kevin De Bruyne and aiming for the top corner with a left-footed curler. Lloris saves and City have a corner. 86 min: Bernardo Silva stretches to catch a bouncing ball and forces Hugo Lloris to save at the near post and concede a corner. Nothing comes of it. 85 min: Tottenham substitution: Dele Alli off, Moussa Sissoko on. Manchester City substitution: Leroy Sane off, after an excellent performance. Bernardo Silva on. 84 min: Manchester City substitution: Phil Foden on, Ilkay Gundogan off. The 17-year-old gets another chance to impress on City’s first team. 82 min: That was wonderful goal from City, a series of weighted passes serving to carve open Tottenham’s defence like a Christmas turkey. Sterling simply couldn’t miss after being unselfishly teed up by Sane. Game, set and match. De Bruyne to Gundogan, who plays Sane in behind the Spurs defence. He crosses for Sterling, who slides in to poke the ball home at the far post from about three yards out. 80 min: Back to the Manchester City penalty, which was as clear-cut a spot-kick award as you’ll ever see ... hold on. 78 min: Lamela pulls the ball back to Harry Winks on the penalty spot, but a heavy touch prevents the midfielder getting a shot off. He stayed on his feet there under a challenge from Mangala when he’d almost certainly have got a penalty if he’d gone to ground. 76 min: Gabriel Jesus hits the foot of the left upright with his penalty kick and Raheem Sterling blazes over the bar with his follow-up. The goal was gaping. Spurs substitution: Erik Lamela on for Heung-min Son. 74 min: Jan Vertonghen trips Kevin De Bruyne in the Tottenham penalty area and Craig Pawson points to the spot. 72 min: Two minutes ago, De Bruyne was writhing around on the ground in agony after being fouled by Dele Alli, now he’s celebrating another fine goal to add to his show-reel. A mistake by Harry Kane at one end allowed Manchester City to break in numbers. Leroy Sane sent De Bruyne on his way down the inside left and despite having options to his right, he elected instead to send a left-footed surface to air screamer past Lloris, who might have got a touch on the ball but was powerless to keep it out. Wow! A great goal from Kevin De Bruyne, who finishes a City counter-attack by lashing the ball past Lloris into the roof of the net from a narrow ankle. 68 min: Dele Alli is booked for a stamp on Kevin De Bruyne’s ankle. Looking at replays, I would say the Spurs midfielder is very, very lucky to escape a sending-off there. On the touchline, Pep Guardiola is furious. 67 min: Sane drives across the front of the Spurs penalty area, gliding past Trippier and unleashing a shot. Hugo Lloris keeps it out with a strong left hand, before Raheem Sterling blazes over when scoring looked easier. It wouldn’t have counted if Sterling had scored - the flag was up. 66 min: Danny Rose is penalised for hauling Kyle Walker to the ground, then spits his dummy at the injustice of it all. Replays show it was a fair cop. 65 min: Son tries his luck from distance. Wide. 63 min: Kevin De Bruyne pulls a low- diagonal shot wide of the far upright. From the goal-kick, Spurs get themselves in an awful mix-up trying to play the ball out from the back and Jan Vertonghen is eventually forced to boot the ball into the stand before it all goes completely pear-shaped. 62 min: Mousa Dembele gets booked for persistent fouling. The straw that breaks the camel’s back is on Fernandinho. During the break in play, Gabriel Jesus adjourns to the sideline to change his boots. 59 min: With the ball at his feet in the Manchester City penalty area, Ederson picks out Sterling on the right touchline with an inch-perfect 65-yard pass. Unbelievable. 57 min: Manchester City substitution: Sergio Aguero off, Gabriel Jesus on. On his way back to the dug-out, Sergio Aguero pulled off his gloves and threw them on the pitch, leaving Eric Dier to pick them up and throw them to the sideline. Here’s hoping Aguero’s hands don’t get too cold on that 15 yard walk to the bench. Gloves. 56 min: Otamendi clears the ensuing corner with a powerful header. 55 min: Ederson is forced to bat a Harry Kane shot from distance around the post for a corner. 54 min: Spurs continue to dominate this second half, trying their damnedest not to give City’s players much time on the ball. They still haven’t looked like scoring, mind. 52 min: From the free-kick, the ball’s pinged into the penalty area by Christian Eriksen and Ederson clears with a fist. In the ensuing scramble for the lose ball, Harry Kane is booked for a studs up lunger on Raheem Sterling. 51 min: Delph fouls Trippier and gets a yellow card for his troubles. Spurs have a free-kick in the space between the touchline and the right side of the Manchester City penalty area. 50 min: Christian Eriksen sends Tottenham off on a counter-attack, which breaks down when Harry Kane overhits a pass to Son. Spurs are doing well in the early stages of this second half, but their final ball is letting them down. 48 min: Good defending from Leroy Sane, who gets back to get in front of Son to prevent the Tottenham winger from getting on the end of a Harry Kane cross to the far post. 47 min: Sergio Aguero wins a corner for Spurs off Harry Winks. The ball’s floated into the area, but Eliaquim Mangala’s header goes straight up in the air and Tottenham clear. 47 min: Danny Rose tries to get forward down the inside left, but loses his balance and falls over. 46 min: The second half gets under way, with a fairly dense fog hovering over the Eithad Stadium sward. Here’s hoping our view of proceedings isn’t impaired. The players troop off for their half-time beverages with Manchester City winning by the only goal of the game, scored by the unmarked Ilkay Gundogan from a corner. Spurs may be losing, but can consider themselves very lucky indeed not to be three or four goals down. They’ve worked hard tonight, but some of their defending has been slapstick and they’ve been made to look very ordinary indeed. 45+1 min: Gundogan shoots from 20 yards, but Lloris saves easily. Sane was in splendid isolation to his left, but Gundogan went for goal when he should have crossed. Not long before that, Man City had a shout for a penalty turned down when the ball hit Rose’s arm in the penalty area. 45 min: It was good goalkeeping from Ederson, who’s been outstanding in his distribution tonight. He came out to claim a ball into the box from Winks to Ali, forcing the Tottenham midfielder to hurdle his body. 43 min: Tottenham get forward, but a poor touch from Harry Kane as he tries to control a pass from Son in the penalty area sees a promising move break down. The ball ends up in the arms of Ederson, who sends City galloping up the pitch on the counter. 42 min: City go close again as Fernandinho plays the ball towards an unmarked Sergio Aguero at the far post. He’s offside. 39 min: City win a free-kick wide on the left after Dele Alli treads on Ilkay Gundogan’s instep. Tottenham, too, defend with a high line as Kevin De Bruyne sends the ball into the mixer. It’s cleared for a Manchester City throw-in. 37 min: Nicolas Otamendi catches Harry Kane in the face with a high boot as the pair contest a bouncing ball. Referee Craig Pawson books the Argentinian, who could conceivably have got a red card for that. It would have been harsh, but not completely outlandish. 35 min: A rare chance for Spurs, with Harry Kane curling a low effort a couple of feet wide of the right upright. 33 min: Manchester City go close twice in quick succession. A heavy touch from Sane enables Lloris to rush off his line and prevent the City winger from lifting the ball over him and into the back of the net. Moments later, Aguero pulls a low daisy-cutter wide from the edge of the area. Tottenham’s defence is all over the place here and the only thing preventing City from filling their boots are their own poorly aligned cross-hairs. 31 min: There’s a break in play as Trippier gets medical treatment, possibly for an injury sustained while making the clearance I just mentioned, or possibly because he’s dizzy and seeing cartoon canaries chirruping around his head from the run-around he’s getting from Leroy Sane. 30 min: Leroy Sane takes on the frazzled Trippier once again, but this time the Spurs full-back manages to win possession and boot the ball upfield. 29 min: Leroy Sane wreaks havoc down the left once again after latching on to a killer pass in behind the Spurs defence from Kevin De Bruyne. Sane pulls the ball back to Aguero, whose shot is blocked by Danny Rose. 26 min: Spurs win a free-kick wide on the right about 40 yards from the Man City goal. City opt to defend it with a defensive line so high up the pitch it’s 10 yards outside their own penalty area. Eriksen sends the ball into space behind it, but Ederson gathers under no pressure whatsoever. 24 min: Through in goal after being put in behind the Spurs defence by Leroy Sane, Sergio Aguero brings a smart save out of Hugo Lloris, who can only parry the ball. It breaks kindly for Raheem Sterling, who fires over the bar. Another let-off for Spurs. A tip of the hat, also, to Ederson – the Manchester City goalkeeper began the move with another 50-yard pass to Leroy Sane. There may only be a goal in it, but Spurs are looking like they could ship a hideously bad beating here. 22 min: Manchester City are denied a clear penalty when Danny Rose gives Eliaquim Mangala a two-handed shove in the small of the back as the City central defender contested a high ball in the Tottenham penalty area. It was an incredibly dim-witted thing for Rose to do, but he’s got away with it. 21 min: Nothing comes from the corner, at which Eric Dier took time out of his evening to mark Ilkay Gundogan. 20 min: Sane goes the better of Trippier again, going around his outside and pulling the ball back into the penalty area. It’s poked wide for a corner. 18 min: Manchester City appear to have identified Kieran Trippier’s wing as the one on which to make hay today and once again Leroy Sane chugs that way. This time Tottenham clear. 15 min: In for David Silva, Ilkay Gundogan fulfils the Spaniard’s duties with ease. The ball was floated in from the corner flag by Sane and he was allowed to wander, completely unmarked, into the Tottenham penalty area. Despite being one of the most diminutive players on the pitch, he still had to stoop to head home from eight yards. Mauricio Pochettino will be furious. A completely unmarked Ilkay Gundogan stoops to score with his head from the corner. 14 min: Eric Dier concedes a corner after good work down the inside left by Leroy Sane ... 12 min: Mousa Dembele rolls the ball back for Lloris to hoof clear, but the Tottenham goalkeeper completely shanks his clearance, sending the ball out for a throw-in halfway inside the Tottenham half. The Frenchman glares accusingly at the pitch, suggesting the ball got a bobble, or at the very least he’d like us all to think it got one. 11 min: City win a free-kick wide on the right, which Kevin De Bruyne sends curling into the corrido of uncertainty. Sergio Aguero gets his head to head to it, but steers the ball wide. It wouldn’t have counted if his aim had been better - he was offside. 9 min: Leroy Sane takes on and beats Kieran Trippier down the left flank and drills in a low cross. Vertonghen blocks and clears, with Sergio Aguero lurking behind him. 8 min: This match has got off to a real helter-skelter start, with each side trying to impose themselves on the other. Manchester City just about have the upper hand, but there’s not much in it. 7 min: Hugo Lloris does a bit of sweeper-keeping of his own, rushing out of his area to hoof the ball into the stands under pressure from Raheem Sterling. 5 min: Mousa Dembele is lucky to avoid an early yellow card for a late lunge on Kevin De Bruyne. 4 min: It’s shaping up to be a good game, with Tottenham showing no signs of meekness as they enter the belly of the beast. They’re trying to press Manchester City back in a bid to take the game to them - only time will tell whether or not they’ll succeed. 2 min: Tottenham send three players forward to press Manchester City as Ederson tries to play the ball out from the back. No bother - instead, the goalkeeper pings a 50-yard pass straight to the feet of Kyle Walker near the intersection of halfway line and touchline. 1 min: City go on the offensive early doors, with assorted Spurs players snapping around their ankles. Mousa Dembele is in to break up one early move, then Jan Vertonghen harries Sergio Aguero to disrupt another. 1 min: Manchester City kick off, playing in their usual home kit of light blue shirts, white shorts and light blue and white hooped socks. Tottenham’s players wear navy shirts, shorts and socks. The players give the patrons of Manchester City’s Tunnel Club their money’s worth before ambling out on the pitch to go through the last of the pre-match niceties. Kick off is just moments away. On how to stop Manchester City: “That is the question for the past six months here in England,” he says. “They are a fantastic side, they are playing so well but we are going to fight to try to win.” Talking to BT Sport smoothie-in-chief, the Manchester City manager says it’s tough trying to maintain his team’s current winning run: “Of course it will be tougher,” he says. “We have in one side a lot of confidence but we are relaxed and know what we have to do. Sooner or later we’ll come back to normality. On Silva’s absence: “David is out because of a personal issue.” December 3, 2017: That’s the last time anyone beat Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Chelsea were the team in question, winning 378 days ago. That’s what Manchester City have said about the absence of their best player, without offering any further explanation. Here’s hoping it’s not down to anything too serious. David Silva is a conspicuous absentee from Manchester City’s squad, for reasons that remain unclear - perhaps he’s just being given a well earned rest. Ilkay Gundogan makes his first start in three games, while Leroy Sane returns after being given a night off midweek against Swansea. Tottenham old boy Kyle Walker also returns to City’s starting line-up, having been stood down on Wednesday. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino recalls Dele Alli to his starting line-up, with Erik Lamela making way. Mpousa Dembele and Kieran Trippier are also in for Moussa Sissoko and Serge Aurier. Man City: Ederson, Walker, Otamendi, Mangala, Delph, De Bruyne, Fernandinho, Gundogan, Sterling, Aguero, Sane. Subs: Bravo, Danilo, Bernardo Silva, Gabriel Jesus, Zinchenko, Toure, Foden. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Trippier, Dier, Vertonghen, Rose, Dembele, Winks, Eriksen, Alli, Son, Kane. Subs: Lamela, Vorm, Sissoko, Llorente, Foyth, Aurier, Davies. Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire) Liverpool. Chelsea. Arsenal. Man United. One by one Manchester City’s rivals in the Big Six have stepped up to take a shot at runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City and one by one they’ve failed to land a glove on Pep Guardiola’s side. Today it’s the turn of Tottenham Hotspur to try and do something only Everton have done in the Premier League so far this season: deprive them of all three points. Whether or not they can end City’s 15-match winning streak in the league remains to be seen.

The 16-times world champion beat fellow Englishman Dobey 3-1 despite making an uncharacteristically nervy start. In the first set he went 2-1 behind before rallying to take the next two legs and the set against the throw. That seemed to settle Taylor down, and he took the second set 3-1 in much more routine fashion. The game became more scrappy in the next, which Dobey won with an 11-dart finish, and in the fourth set the 26-year-old looked to be on the verge of drawing level in the match before missing two shots at double 16 for the set. Taylor sprang back to hit double 16 to level it up and then looked more assured as he finished things off in the final leg. “I lacked a bit of energy against Chris tonight, I slacked a little bit and it’s not me. I’m tired,” said Taylor. “I never used to be like that before, I could win a tournament and then play another tournament, it’s strange. I’ve got a few days off now to get ready for the next one.” “I haven’t practised that much for it to be honest with you,” Taylor added. “I’ve been playing, doing exhibition work and a few charity events and I’ve loved it, and I’ve been classing that as my practice.” Taylor, who is now 57, won this tournament 13 times between 1995 and 2010 but since then has been champion only once, in 2013. He also won the BDO title twice before joining the breakaway PDC in 1994. Earlier, Belgium’s Dimitri Van den Bergh upset England’s former Lakeside champion Stephen Bunting 3-1 in a high quality encounter. Bunting has endured a tough 2017 and this first-round exit followed on from similar ones at the World Matchplay and the World Grand Prix. In the evening’s final match, world No20 Rob Cross defeated Japan’s Seigo Asada 3-0. 27-year-old Cross is playing in his first PDC world championship but is tipped as an outside chance to win the tournament after enjoying a remarkable debut year on the professional tour. On Thursday, defending champion and odds-on favourite Michael van Gerwen began his campaign with a 3-1 victory over Christian Kist, and there were also opening-night wins for Steve Beaton, James Wilson and Gerwyn Price."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/16/talking-horses-saturday-cheltenham-doncaster-deauville-dancer","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T00:05:46Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Deauville Dancer offers an each-way opportunity at Cheltenham | Chris Cook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/16/talking-horses-saturday-cheltenham-doncaster-deauville-dancer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/16/talking-horses-saturday-cheltenham-doncaster-deauville-dancer","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Deauville Dancer offers an each-way opportunity at Cheltenham","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Saturday’s ITV4 races The biggest success in the training career of David Dennis has been a decent handicap chase at last year’s Hennessy meeting. That could be about to change as the Worcestershire man pitches Deauville Dancer (1.55) into Cheltenham’s Caspian Caviar Gold Cup, in which the horse looks overpriced at 33-1. There is a risk for punters in assuming this race is just a rerun of last month’s BetVictor Gold Cup. This race is run on the more stamina-stretching New Course but on a drier surface and it cannot be assumed Splash Of Ginge and Le Prezien will come to the fore once more, especially after the hard races they had four weeks ago. Deauville Dancer has had plenty of chasing experience since May but something seems to have clicked in his last three starts, which show him to be on a steep upward curve. He has travelled strongly, finished well and defied an ever increasing rating. Perhaps this step up in class will find him out but it looks rash of the betting market to take that for granted, especially in a race short on star quality. Here’s hoping this six-year-old can get into the argument at an each-way price. 2.10 Doncaster Braqueur D’Or looks the best horse but whether this stamina-laden sort wants a small field, level-weights contest on a dry surface is open to doubt and his game Hennessy fourth may have left a mark. Rocklander could have the legs of these rivals up the home straight, having won over a shorter trip at Ludlow last time. 2.30 Cheltenham The transformation of Count Meribel continued last month at Ascot, where he made all and scored by eight lengths. He is preferred to Equus Secretus, who hung rather offputtingly last time and is untried on this ground. 2.45 Doncaster Nicky Henderson and Paul Nicholls field a couple of useful juveniles and it may be the older man who comes out on top with the former French We Have A Dream. He won as he pleased at Warwick last month and the distant third and fourth that day have since won three races between them. 3.05 Cheltenham The New One has made this race his own but, at the age of nine, he now comes up against Melon. Beaten only by the freakish Labaik in the Supreme back in March, Melon ran to a similar level with a reappearance win at Down Royal and looks the standout talent here. He can maintain Willie Mullins’s perfect (2/2) record in Britain this season. 3.20 Doncaster From a stable that may be emerging from a slump, Killala Quay gets in 1lb below the mark from which he won here in February. First-time blinkers may help him hold his position for the first circuit. 3.40 Cheltenham Progressive last winter, Graceful Legend took another step forward in first-time cheekpieces when scoring at Ascot last time, with the extra distance proving helpful. This is hotter but she has more to give and odds of 14-1 understate her chance.

In a mock-up of a shooting range, spectrograms – rainbow visualisations of sound frequencies – have replaced the silhouettes of bodies that are the marksman’s usual targets. A gripping real-life courtroom drama unfolds on the video at its centre, the case of Israeli soldiers who killed two Palestinian teenagers using live ammunition, not rubber bullets as they had claimed. Rather than recreate the trial, however, the artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan conveys its transcript via silent subtitles. Filling the space is a constant hum of different frequencies, interrupted occasionally by the thunk, thunk of shots fired. Developed by Abu Hamdan with researchers at Goldsmiths College, London, the spectrograms are the focus of the action. They represent an analysis of a recording of the fatal gunfire and became the key piece of evidence in convicting the soldiers. What this work most forcefully underscores though is silence: the human rights atrocities that remain unreported; the voiceless victims. In an adjacent video by the American artist Joe Namy exploring translation, a reflection on physical silence, as when a 1,000-year-old poem is torn in half, resonates loudly. Bringing artists from varied, complex cultures together under a single banner is a risky business. Surely no exhibition exploring art from the Arab world would attempt anything as hubristic as an overarching statement. Instead this show corrals individual voices from different generations and geographic backgrounds. Sound features in much of the work, but it also serves as a metaphor for an approach. Its fluid, immaterial nature is just as resonant for the photographs that form a large part of the show tackling memory and disappearing history: psychedelic layered imagery, cloudy flecked shots of Beirut taken with aged equipment and the anonymous faces from a Lebanese photo archive. The exhibition has its share of duds: the inevitable community project that makes for good work but less than electrifying art, or inert assemblages of musical instruments. At its best though, there’s a nicely volatile mix of plugged-in, personal responses to pertinent issues (as well as some great songs) which refuse to let our ideas settle. Abu Hamdan’s project is art gold dust: a work with a discernible, classifiable political impact. But it’s the way it conjures the unknown or uncertain, that sets the tone for what follows. There are nearly 20 artists here, a few of them veterans of the upheavals that have shaped their home countries, many young and now based in western art centres such as Berlin and London. While politics was always going to be on the menu, few offer direct commentary. Instead we get the worm’s-eye, ground-level view, grey areas, hazy recollections and shapeshifting stories. At times, it manages to foil expectations of what art about an Arab experience might look like altogether. Raised in Lebanon, the revered 92-year-old poet and painter Etel Adnan for instance, has spent most of her life between California and Paris. While her writing has dealt with war and displacement head-on, the ebullient abstractions that dance across her accordion-folded painted books, alongside fragments of Arabic poetry, suggest a private language. Interviewed in a nearby film about her memories of Beirut, she speaks less of the place itself than the imaginative world rooted in family mythology, through which you become who you are. Other standouts though are determinedly hardwired to the specifics of place. Jumana Manna’s 70-minute film A Magical Substance Flows Into Me, is a good-natured acme for the show’s conceptual currents, with gorgeous dollops of crowd-pleasing local colour. Chronicling the varied ancient music traditions within her native Jerusalem, it moves between the cramped busy kitchens of apartment blocks, modern offices and the tents where Bedouins take a break from tending the camels, nonchalantly drinking each other’s pee in the desert sun. In these humdrum spaces that speak quietly of the city’s most contested subject, home, ordinary folk create hair-raisingly sublime music. The sounds take listeners across borders and centuries; the political implications are impactful but lightly worn. Close by is a video as rough-edged and bruising as Manna’s is polished: This Lemon Tastes of Apple by the Iraqi Kurdistan artist Hiwa K. It consists of cameraphone footage of a 2011 protest in the artist’s hometown, Sulaymaniyah. Hiwa K has a mouth organ, his friend a guitar, and they walk through crazed, burning streets playing Ennio Morricone’s unsettling theme from Once Upon a Time in the West. Apparently as popular in Iraq as anywhere, they’re soon rallied by men cheering, while the juddering camera captures bleeding bodies and faces doused in lemon juice – an antidote to tear gas. This rudimentary citizen journalism-cum-art video conveys not what happened – the situation is too hectic to make sense of – but something of what the moment felt like. From Ear to Ear to Eye is at Nottingham Contemporary until 4 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/23/saturdays-best-tv-our-friend-victoria-at-christmas-feud-bette-and-joan","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Our Friend Victoria at Christmas; Feud: Bette and Joan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/23/saturdays-best-tv-our-friend-victoria-at-christmas-feud-bette-and-joan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/23/saturdays-best-tv-our-friend-victoria-at-christmas-feud-bette-and-joan","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Our Friend Victoria at Christmas; Feud: Bette and Joan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Our Friend Victoria at Christmas 9.30pm, BBC One Festive instalment of the series that ran earlier this year, commemorating the life of the late Victoria Wood.

A review concluded that Avon and Somerset police and Bristol city council wrongly perceived Bijan Ebrahimi as a troublemaker rather than a victim and sided with his white abusers. Ebrahimi’s family emphasised the significance of the review’s finding of institutional racism – the most explicit against a police force since the 1999 Macpherson report on the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in London, and the first of its kind against a local authority. Both organisations accepted the findings of the report by the Safer Bristol Partnership and said they would continue to work with Ebrahimi’s family to tackle the failings. Ebrahimi’s sisters, Mojgan Khayatian and Manizhah Moores, said it was important their deep concerns had been officially recognised, more than four years after their brother’s death. They said: “Bijan always fought for the truth, which is what we have tried to do in his name. He never gave up on trying to make things better and neither will we. “It’s been a long battle. No review can ever bring back our beloved Bijan but it is important that his voice has been heard. Bijan always said that racism must be challenged wherever it is found, including in town halls and police stations.” Ebrahimi, 44, was punched and kicked to death by his neighbour Lee James, who had mistakenly thought he was a paedophile. James and another neighbour dragged Ebrahimi’s body to a green in front of his home in Brislington, south Bristol, doused him with white spirit and set fire to him. James was jailed for life. Avon and Somerset police apologised in the summer after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said in a report that the force had failed Ebrahimi. The force has been working with his sisters to try to improve its procedures. It said on Monday: “Mr Ebrahimi was treated differently, to his detriment and without objective reason.” Ebrahimi’s family said the council had been slow to acknowledge its failings. “Bristol city council took nearly five years to accept it failed Bijan and the need for change. This is far too long, although late is better than never. We will not rest until improved systems are put in place to protect other vulnerable people,” they said. The new report says Ebrahimi’s death left a “hole in the lives of his sisters and young nephews that they feel can never be filled”. It adds: “They feel an indescribable emptiness and their lives will never be the same again.” The sisters said they would never have got to the truth without the support of the Bristol agency Stand Against Racism and Inequality (SARI) and their lawyers. “We worry about bereaved families who don’t have that support. How do they ever find the truth? We now look forward to working with the mayor and holding the council to account.” Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, apologised, accepted there had been institutional racism and said he would work with Ebrahimi’s family to try to prevent the occurrence of another such tragedy. The multi-agency learning review spells out that from 2005 until his death in 2013, Ebrahimi reported dozens of times that he had been the victim of racially motivated offending. He made about 44 allegations to the police that he had been the victim of a crime or multiple crimes, the report says. These included 17 recorded allegations of assault, seven of threats to kill, five of harassment, five of criminal damage, 12 of public order-related offences and one of cruelty to an animal – his cat Mooshi. On one occasion boiling water was thrown over his head; he was also the victim of an arson attack. One relative told the review she had witnessed him being called a “Paki” and a “cockroach” and being told: “Go back to your own country.” But before Ebrahimi’s death only one person was convicted of an offence – in relation to the scalding incident. The report says: “There is evidence that Mr Ebrahimi was repeatedly targeted for racist abuse and victimisation by some members of the public, that this was repeatedly reported to Avon and Somerset constabulary and Bristol city council and that representatives of both organisations repeatedly sided with his abusers. “The more incidents that were reported, the more ingrained this pattern of responses became.” Ebrahimi himself was arrested on 15 occasions from the date of his arrival in the UK in 2001 but was never prosecuted. On one occasion, Bristol city council obtained an antisocial behaviour order against him rather than against the neighbours he was complaining about. The report says this was “misconceived and served as official confirmation of his perceived status as the primary perpetrator rather than the primary victim”. It says there was an incorrect prevailing view among some neighbours that Ebrahimi was a paedophile. “The authorities were aware of that view, took no steps to correct it and it is possible that the silence of agencies on this may have been taken by some as confirmation of local suspicions,” the report says. “On occasions, Mr Ebrahimi was treated with disrespect and even contempt by some police officers,” it continues. The report concludes: “Those victimising him were overwhelmingly of white European origin and the neighbourhoods within which he lived were predominantly inhabited by residents of white European origin … Bijan Ebrahimi was isolated. His complaints resulted in little action. “As an Iranian man living in this environment, Mr Ebrahimi was disadvantaged by the inappropriate responses by Avon and Somerset constabulary and Bristol city council to his racist victimisation. “Representatives of those organisations displayed a distinct lack of understanding of his plight and, accordingly, unwitting prejudice against him.” The report sets out a definition of institutional racism from the Macpherson report: “The collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.” The Ebrahimi report says: “There is therefore, based on the above definition from the Macpherson report, evidence of both discriminatory behaviour and institutional racism on the part of Bristol city council and Avon and Somerset constabulary.” The family’s solicitor, Tony Murphy, of Bhatt Murphy, said: “Acknowledging the institutional nature of the racism at the core of this tragedy is an essential first step towards systemic change.” Two members of the Avon and Somerset force – PC Kevin Duffy, a beat manager, and Andrew Passmore, a community support officer – were jailed for misconduct in a public office over their dealings with Ebrahimi. They and two other constables, Leanne Winter and Helen Harris, have been dismissed from the force."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/18/star-wars-the-last-jedi-women-bechdel-test","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T17:16:09Z","webTitle":"A Force for good: why the Last Jedi is the most triumphantly feminist Star Wars movie yet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/18/star-wars-the-last-jedi-women-bechdel-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/18/star-wars-the-last-jedi-women-bechdel-test","fields":{"headline":"A Force for good: why the Last Jedi is the most triumphantly feminist Star Wars movie yet","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Last Jedi stormed into cinemas at the weekend as the most triumphantly feminist Star Wars film yet. While The Force Awakens and Rogue One had terrific heroines, they were isolated, and barely spoke to other women. Writer-director Rian Johnson has delivered a film that’s funny, exciting, spiritual and true to the original essence of the series while also having well-rounded female characters who actually interact with one another. Both in terms of women and non-white characters, there’s a celebratory inclusiveness that seems entirely in the Jedi spirit. If you haven’t seen it, very mild spoilers are ahead. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is feeling the first stirrings of the Force and has gone in search of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who is living as a hermit on a remote island. The dynamic between them is complex and constantly evolving: these are no awe-struck pupil and saintly teacher archetypes. Rey’s character is as developed as any in the series, and bears no relation to her gender. Back at the Resistance HQ, General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) is calmly calling the shots while her composed Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) is skeptical of our trigger-happy hero, Poe (Oscar Isaac). There are complex dynamics at work here, and gender seems significant in this case: the different sexes have varying approaches to military strategy, and it’s thought-provoking stuff. It’s an impressive feat that within this two and a half hour movie, there is also room for a well-rounded Asian-American female character, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) who goes on entertaining adventures with the intrepid Finn (John Boyega). Among the approving voices is Annalise Ophelian, a documentary film-maker and psychologist whose current project, Looking for Leia, is about girls and women in Star Wars fandom. “The Last Jedi depicts women as multi-faceted, multi-generational, multi-racial. There are women in strong leadership positions and women who occupy student/learner positions,” she says. The Last Jedi also contains what Ophelian says is the “first truly Bechdel Test passing scene” in the history of the franchise. “Female heroes are traditionally presented in cinematic isolation. This film gives us women working side by side, women in technical positions, and of course women learning the ways of the Force.” Writer-director Gurinder Chada (Bend It Like Beckham) took her son to the premiere of The Last Jedi at the Royal Albert Hall. She felt the film had a distinctly feminine spirit, while still hitting all the classic Star Wars marks. “I thought it was a great version in terms of having all the lead women there. Laura Dern’s character is clearly very knowledgeable and there was a pathos with Leia, with Carrie Fisher having since passed away. That gave it a very gracious sensibility and tone which also helps it feel female driven. It was quite a gentle film. It delivered all the battles but I thought it was very spiritual compared to some other ones.” Other commentators think the Star Wars series has always been ahead of the curve. “The franchise has been a trailblazer for women in command,” says Beth Webb, a film journalist and programmer for the Bechdel Test Fest, an ongoing celebration of women in film. “Aside from Leia, I particularly admired Felicity Jones’ Jyn in Rogue One. But it’s certainly thrilling to see these two powerhouse women be leaders, on screen, at the same time. There’s no rivalry or tension, just two old friends working together for a cause bigger than themselves. To see a franchise dear to my heart finally exceeding all of my expectations for its female characters makes it all worth it.” Here’s hoping the post-Weinstein era is finally ushering in the changes so many feminists have been campaigning for in film. Says Webb: “We’re already seeing it in next year’s big releases, from A Wrinkle in Time to Lady Bird to Ocean’s Eight, and we’ve got solid proof in record-breaking box office figures and Metacritic scores to back us up. Wonder Woman was one of the highest-grossing superhero origin films of all time. Girls Trip was the first comedy of the year to cross the $1m mark. Lady Bird broke the Rotten Tomatoes record. And television is already light years ahead.” But both Webb and Ophelian have one more new hope for Star Wars. ‘The next step is a female director, which I’m hoping the rapidly expanding franchise will allow,” says Webb. Tellingly, Rian Johnson, who will also direct the first film in a new Star Wars trilogy, has agreed. “There are so many incredibly talented female directors, directors of colour out there, and so many that I would love to see play in this universe. So hell yes, please, I’d love it to happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/18/grenfell-campaigners-win-reprieve-fight-save-local-college-kensington-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T11:30:02Z","webTitle":"Grenfell campaigners win reprieve in fight to save local college","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/18/grenfell-campaigners-win-reprieve-fight-save-local-college-kensington-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/18/grenfell-campaigners-win-reprieve-fight-save-local-college-kensington-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell campaigners win reprieve in fight to save local college","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government has intervened to save a further education college near Grenfell Tower after local people warned a plan to replace it with flats would deprive the community of a popular local asset after the fire. Kensington and Chelsea College, where many Grenfell residents studied, had been due to merge before the end of the year with a much larger institution in another London borough. Campaigners had warned this was likely to mean the building in North Kensington would close and its courses moved elsewhere. The local council bought the freehold of the site last year and had proposed an idea to develop much of it for flats. Government ministers have written to the chairs of the two colleges involved, saying any merger plans should be delayed until at least the end of April. After then, any eventual merger with Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College should be one that “preserves appropriate capacity to deliver for learners in North Kensington”, they wrote. Anne Milton, the skills minister, and Nick Hurd, whose Home Office brief includes the role of minister for Grenfell victims, told the college chairs that the fire six months ago, in which 71 people died, “served to emphasise the importance of your role in supporting and providing opportunities to the local community”. The small size of Kensington and Chelsea College, known locally as Wornington College, meant a merger was most likely but any plan “will require engagement with the community around the options”, they wrote. The letter follows a campaign against the merger by local people, who say the decision to sell the college building on Wornington Road to the Conservative-run council for £25m, without consultation with staff, forms part of a wider pattern of aggressive regeneration in North Kensington, the poorest part of the borough. The council had offered to temporarily lease back the building to the college, but campaigners had been sceptical about whether this could secure the college’s future. After the campaigners met Milton and Hurd last month, the ministers asked Richard Atkins, the further education commissioner, to conduct an urgent review of the planned merger. He made the recommendations given in the ministers’ letter. The Save Wornington campaign, which was sent a copy of the ministers’ letter, said it hoped to use the four-month pause to find a permanent solution. “This beloved building has educated members of our community for 140 years and we will not allow the council to prevent it remaining as an educational establishment for the benefit of the people who live here,” said Edward Daffarn, from the campaign. The leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, Kim Taylor-Smith, said the idea of replacing the college with flats was not an option being pursuing. “We are committed to working with the campaigners and the college to find the best solution possible and we welcome this four-month pause, introduced by the government, as it will allow for a fuller review of the process,” he said. “The Department for Education has made a number of recommendations to the colleges regarding this merger. These are currently being considered by the colleges and a summary of the commissioner’s review will be published in due course. “In order to support Kensington and Chelsea College we have offered them a 10-year lease on the building. This is an exciting opportunity which enables the college to realise its ambitions and provide a package of vocational courses tailored for the needs of North Kensington.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/18/cases-of-child-sexual-abuse-up-31-says-nspcc","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T08:38:14Z","webTitle":"Cases of UK child sexual abuse up 31%, says NSPCC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/18/cases-of-child-sexual-abuse-up-31-says-nspcc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/18/cases-of-child-sexual-abuse-up-31-says-nspcc","fields":{"headline":"Cases of UK child sexual abuse up 31%, says NSPCC","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The number of reported cases of child sexual abuse in the UK rose by almost a third last year, according to NSPCC figures that the charity described as “deeply worrying” but said showed a greater public willingness to report the problem. The charity said it referred an average of 90 calls a week to police and social services over concerns that a young person had been sexually assaulted. This was an increase of 31% on the year before. The NSPCC said it made a total of 4,677 referrals UK-wide last year, up from 3,578 in 2015-16. NSPCC Scotland reported the biggest year-on-year increase in referrals from 78 to 265 cases last year. The figures prompted opposition calls to reverse government funding cuts for child protection. The NSPCC also reported a further 3,912 contacts where helpline staff gave advice about sexual abuse against young people. The NSPCC said children will not always realise they are being sexually abused, while non-physical offending can occur through live-streaming. John Cameron, the head of helplines at the NSPCC, said: “It is deeply worrying that so many children are potentially being exposed to such a devastating experience, but at the same time it also suggests that as a society we are much more alert to the risks and much more willing to come forward and share our concerns. “Sexual abuse can do huge damage to a child’s life and, left untreated, will often haunt them long into adulthood.” The figures were launched to coincide with a Light Up Christmas for Children appeal to help vulnerable young people over the festive period. Emma Lewell-Buck MP, the shadow minister for children and families, said: “This is the latest evidence that demand for child protection services is going up, just as funding is being cut. The government’s own figures show that spending on children’s services has already fallen by a tenth under the Tories, and we are heading for a £2bn shortfall by 2020. Ministers should cancel their latest multibillion-pound tax break for bankers and start protecting the most vulnerable children instead.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/strictly-come-dancing-best-bits-joe-mcfadden","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T10:00:00Z","webTitle":"Alexandra's jive to judge Shirley: the best bits of Strictly Come Dancing 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/strictly-come-dancing-best-bits-joe-mcfadden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/strictly-come-dancing-best-bits-joe-mcfadden","fields":{"headline":"Alexandra's jive to Susan's quickstep: the best bits of Strictly Come Dancing 2017","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So in the end it was Joe and Katya who lifted the Glitterball on Saturday, after one of the hardest-fought Strictly finals in years. It brought the curtain down on the 15th series of Strictly Come Dancing, with impressive viewer numbers and a format that doesn’t seem to age. This year was no exception: the series was packed with showstopping dancing and gave us plenty of laughs along the way. I’ve whittled it down to my five favourite moments, but feel free to add yours in the comment box below. Alexandra and Gorka’s jive Every series needs a legendary jive, and whoever delivers it usually goes on to win the series. In 2015 everyone was talking about Jay and Aliona’s Pulp Fiction themed jive, until Ore and Joanne attempted to steal their jive crown with theirs in 2016. For me, this year’s trophy was won by Alexandra and Gorka in week four, and repeated in Saturday’s final – Alexandra totally captured the spirit of Tina Turner, and set the tone for the weeks of showstopping dances that followed. They may not have lifted the Glitterball, but their Jive will go down in Strictly history. New head judge Shirley Ballas Filling Len Goodman’s shiny ballroom shoes was always going to be a challenge; 15 years of “Sehvens” had made Len part of the Strictly furniture. But Queen of Latin Shirley Ballas wasn’t remotely fazed – she simply Cha Cha-ed in, took the top seat, and immediately made it her own. Her approach has been firm but fair: extra points for improvement on the previous week, and plenty of tips on how to perfect the technicalities of each dance. When she gave her first ten in week 4 with a yell of “It’s never too early for a ten from Shirley!”, it felt like she’d been there forever. Just what the Strictly doctor ordered. Joe and Katya’s Argentine Tango Argentine Tangos are very much a Strictly danger zone: most couples decide to give it a miss, on the basis that it’s technically demanding and very hard to do well. Those who do attempt it mostly stay traditional – it’s definitely not a dance to mess about with. Unless you’re choreographer extraordinaire Katya Jones, who is one of Strictly’s biggest risk-takers (see every dance with Ed Balls ever). She and Joe delivered an intense and brooding contemporary Argentine in the semi-finals, causing half the nation to put their back out trying to recreate the seesaw lift at the end. Craig’s Bruno impression The judging table was missing Bruno in Week 5 – he had Dancing With The Stars commitments in the US that week, or a week long date with swimwear model Matt Law, depending on your preferred source of news. Did anyone miss Bruno? Nope. His spirit lived on in Craig Revel-Horwood, who briefly removed his panto villain mask to do a brilliant impression of his fellow judge, complete with flailing arms, exuberant praise and a final falling over. It’s a side to Craig we’d definitely like to see more of – feel free to go away any time, Bruno. Susan and Kevin’s quickstep to Bring Me Sunshine For me, Susan and Kevin’s Morecambe and Wise tribute quickstep was the dance of the series. It might not have been the most technically proficient attempt we saw in 2017, but it was nevertheless 1 minute and 45 seconds of sheer, unbridled happiness. This dance was a huge nostalgia trip for anyone who grew up with Eric and Ernie on their telly, and clearly a special song for Susan too; Bring Me Sunshine was the first dance at the wedding of Susan and her wife, Lee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/live/2017/dec/18/bitcoin-bubble-ubs-futures-trading-20000-cme-stock-markets-tax-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T17:44:15Z","webTitle":"Bitcoin bubble warnings grow louder as futures trading begins on CME – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/18/bitcoin-bubble-ubs-futures-trading-20000-cme-stock-markets-tax-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/dec/18/bitcoin-bubble-ubs-futures-trading-20000-cme-stock-markets-tax-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Bitcoin bubble warnings grow louder as futures trading begins on CME – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Time for a recap. Bitcoin has made a subdued debut onto the world’s largest futures exchange, as a series of politicians and officials voiced concerns about the digital currency. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) became the second exchange to offer bitcoin derivatives trading last night. And right now, bitcoin futures contracts which settle in 2018 have all fallen below their opening value. The January 2018 contract, which initially spiked over $20,000, has now dropped back to $18,920 - having been originally priced at $19,500. Contracts that mature in February, March and June are all in the red (although they’ve received little attention compared to the January option). Futures contracts allow traders to bet against an asset, so today’s moves could suggest that bitcoin’s stunning rally is running out of steam. But, less than 1,000 contracts have been traded today (each one is worth 5 bitcoins). The spot price of bitcoin has also dipped, currently down 1.6% at $18,640 - having hit a new alltime high near $20,000 last night. CME’s launch of bitcoin futures was accompanied by a series of warnings. For example: Denmark’s top central banker said bitcoin was dangerous, and investors shouldn’t blame regulators if they lost their money. A senior Singaporean regulator said bitcoin had no intrinsic value France’s finance minister is pushing for the G20 to debate bitcoin regulation UBS’s chairmen, Axel Weber, said regulators should take a closer look at digital currencies Analysts at ING also put the boot into bitcoin, saying it would eventually become just a ‘niche product’ again. ING cited bitcoin’s volatility, scalability issues, and the shadow of regulation among several reasons why it would not replace traditional cash. So those buyers who are hoping to sell their bitcoins at an even higher price in the future may be disappointed, they say: We are enthusiastic about blockchain technology, and the current attention for Bitcoin could boost blockchain and digital currencies’ development. But as we have argued above, we doubt whether Bitcoin itself has what it takes to become a serious mainstream payment systems contender. Instead, we think it is more likely for Bitcoin to return to its roots as a niche payment system. A niche asset adopted worldwide could still have a substantial user base and hence value. It is therefore impossible to say whether the current Bitcoin market price is “too high” for a niche asset. Then again, we join the crowd of analysts observing typical bubble characteristics: the idea of an asset that is new, revolutionary, almost magic – hard to understand, but let’s invest anyway because it will become huge. This idea is a form of “this time it’s different”-thinking. “Yes we know about all those previous bubbles that popped, but Bitcoin is really, really different.” We are not so sure. That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here’s our news story about the kerfuffle over Ikea’s tax affairs: European stock markets have closed at their highest level in almost six weeks, following Wall Street’s lead. The German Dax led the charge, gaining 1.6%, with France’s CAC and the Italian FTSE MIB both gaining 1.33%. The UK lagged behind, with the FTSE 100 finishing 46 points higher at 7,537, up 0.6%. The Footsie was held back by the pound, which has gained almost a cent today to $1.34 (which is bad for exporters). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says the City is anticipating a final deal on US tax cuts soon. Risk on sentiment is driving trading, as investor optimism over the US tax bill being passed sooner rather than later is lifting stocks. The 2 wavering Senators, which could have thrown the vote in the Senate slim majority are now back on side and the markets are cheering. France’s call for G20 leaders to debate bitcoin regulation may win the support of Germany. Bloomberg reports: In Berlin, a Finance Ministry spokesman said it was watching “bitcoin and other cryptocurrency developments closely,” adding that Germany’s financial supervisor Bafin has already warned of the risks of cryptocurrencies for consumers. In Greece leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras has urged banks to do more to clamp down on big time debtors, citing the banking system’s record stock of non-performing loans. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a no-holds barred speech Tsipras told leading bankers today that the time had come to crack down on big-time debtors and strategic defaulters as part of efforts to restore liquidity to Greece’s cash-strapped economy. Those who had allowed bad debt to bust businesses, but done well themselves, had to be “chased,” he told bank representatives assembled at his office, adding: “Liquidity needs to be restored to the economy … We need a responsible and effective way to deal with the problem of non-performing loans.” By failing to effectively deal with NPLs – of which Greece has the highest amount in the EU – and provide funding for others, he said, banks were failing to properly support young Greeks in fulfilling their dreams. Describing the role of banks as crucial, the leftist leader also called for the creation of an “observatory” that could advise the government on what banks could offer. With less than a year before the debt-stricken country’s third international bailout officially expires – ending, it is hoped, an era of international supervision – the government is keen to improve daily life. On Friday the International Monetary Fund also cited bad debt as a major obstacle for Cypriot banks despite the island’s impressive economic recovery after its own crisis in 2013. NPLs in Cypriot banks amount to 46% of loans -- after Greece the highest amount in the EU. Maybe some of these bubble warnings are getting through to investors. The bitcoin futures price is now moving south, as more traders take a position via CME’s new derivatives platform. Almost 840 contracts for the January 2018 bitcoin contract have now been traded - with the price now falling to $19,010 [reminder, each contract is for five bitcoins]. Over in New York, the US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 138 points, or 0.5%, to 24,790 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is also up, while rallying tech stocks have sent the Nasdaq higher too. Investors are excited by the possibility that the US Congress might reach a final agreement on tax reforms. Those reforms have been heavily criticised by some experts, who fear it will drive up the US deficit and hand the richest Americans a tax cut. So why is Wall Street celebrating? Because the bill will slash corporation tax, delivering a massive windfall to large corporations. Analysts at FxPro say: With the bill reducing corporation tax from 35% to 21%, there will be a windfall to US companies. With the possibility of share buy-backs and/or higher dividends by US Corporations, this will, in turn, increase the pace of interest rate hikes and see a stronger US dollar as a result. But.... foreign exchange expert Kit Juckes of Societe Generale points out that bond traders aren’t impressed by the tax reforms: The US Tax Bill will probably be voted on, pass and will turn up on the President’s desk this week . A significant boost to the economy? “Oh yes, it is” cries President Trump, who calls it ‘one of the great Christmas gifts’ to the middle class. “Oh no, it isn’t” answers the bond market, as 10yr Notes meander along at 2.37% this morning, and TIPS remain mid-range. The bond market fell for the President’s policy promises this time last year and is resolutely unimpressed this time round. ‘Bah, Humbug’ sums it up (at the risk of mixing panto-metaphors). Denmark’s top central banker has now issued a stern warning to speculators to avoid bitcoin. Lars Rohde, governor of the National Bank of Denmark, told local broadcaster DR that bitcoin was a dangerous bubble, comparing it to the tulip bulb mania of the 17th Century. Rohde declared that putting money into bitcoin was basically gambling, warning: “You have to stay away [from bitcoin]. It is dangerous. Rohde also warned that people buying bitcoin shouldn’t blame regulators if they suffer losses when the market crashes. He says: “It is not a regulated market. It is not the responsibility of the authorities. It is the responsibility of the individual.” So far so smooth for bitcoin today..... Don’t risk the scrum of present-hunters in the shops this lunchtime. Instead, pit your wits against our Christmas quiz.... Breaking away from Bitcoin.... and the European Union has launched an investigation into whether Ikea is unfairly dodging tax. The EU has opened an in-depth investigation into the Swedish furniture giant’s tax deals in the Netherlands, and whether it used a Dutch subsidiary to slash its tax bill. EU’s anti-trust commissioner Margrethe Vestager is concerned that Ikea may have had an unfair advantage over rivals, by using various subsidiaries to reduce its tax burden. She says: “All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax. “Member states cannot let selected companies pay less tax by allowing them to artificially shift their profits elsewhere.” The inquiry focuses on two tax rulings in the Netherlands. One allowed Inter Ikea, its Dutch branch, to pay a large licence fee to a Luxembourg-based division which paid less tax. A second ruling involved a loan arrangement between Inter Ikea and a unit in Liechtenstein, which also moved shifted taxable revenue to a low tax jurisdiction. Most of the EU’s previous tax inquiries have focused on US companies, as Apple and Amazon. This one is closer to home, points out Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit. We should note that CME’s new bitcoin futures contracts actually covers five units of the digital currency. So the 681 contracts traded so far today have a notional value of 3,405 bitcoins -- or around $65m. Singapore’s financial watchdog has joined the chorus of concerns over cryptocurrencies. Sopnendu Mohanty, the top fintech official at Singapore’s monetary authority (MAS), has warned that people who have invested in bitcoin will come a cropper when they try to withdraw their funds. The Telegraph’s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has the story: Bitcoin has no fundamental value and is likely to end in tears once speculators discover how hard it can be to extricate their cash, Singapore’s financial watchdog has warned. Sopnendu Mohanty, Fintech chief for Singapore’s monetary authority (MAS), said there was a crucial difference between Bitcoin and rival crypto-currency Ethereum, but it is far from clear whether either improves day-to-day transactions or has much potential as a tool for central banking. “Bitcoin has no natural intrinsic value. Can you buy a house with it? Can you use it for daily interactions? It may be valued at $18,000 right now but what I want to know is how you convert it into fiat currency and realize that value. The risk comes at the moment of conversion,” he told the Daily Telegraph.... More here: Singapore’s Fintech chief warns on Bitcoin delusion The bitcoin futures price is also rallying. The January contract has now jumped back to $19,645, over the opening price of $19,500, and ahead of today’s ‘spot price’. But the trading volume is still quite modest, with exactly 666 contracts so far on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s new offering. Other longer-dated bitcoin futures contracts are also available, but are being ignored - just seven have been traded so far. I guess that betting where bitcoin’s price in June 2018 is too risky even for seasoned traders... Bitcoin is creeping higher again, as early bird traders head to their desks in America. The spot price has jumped back over $19,000, erasing this morning’s small dip as CME’s futures trading got under way. Swissquote Bank, an online bank based in Switzerland, has a more positive view of bitcoin than UBS. It has been letting customers buy bitcoin since July, and today it added four other digital currencies - Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin and Ripple Analyst Yann Quelenn argues that bitcoin’s scarcity (there can only ever be 21 million coins, with 16m discovered so far) will help push its price higher. Quelenn says: Who would have thought at the start of 2017 that Bitcoin would increase 20-fold? That was simply unpredictable. The introduction of futures trading has driven up prices. Nonetheless, it is also artificially increasing supply and weighing on prices. In the short-run, Bitcoin is likely to reach US$ 25,000. A correction is due at some point, but within the next few years it should easily reach US$ 100,000. By the way: Bitcoin is far from perfect, with high transaction fees and low scalability. And it is expensive, but it is even more scarce. Newsflash: British manufacturers are ending 2017 on a high, with the strongest order books in 30 years. That’s according to the CBI’s monthly healthcheck on UK factories, which found that exports and total output are both strong. The survey found that: 28% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 11% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +17% (joint highest with last month and August 1988) 28% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 12% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +16% well above the long-run average of -18% 42% of businesses said the volume of output over the past three months was up, and 11% said it was down, giving a rounded balance of +30% above the long-run average of +4% The slump in the pound after last year’s Brexit vote should have made UK exports more competitive. But...it also means that imported raw materials are more expensive. That is likely to translate into higher prices in the shops in the months ahead. Correction corner: I daftly called UBS a German bank earlier. It’s Swiss, of course (the name dates back to Union Bank of Switzerland) Thanks to the readers who kindly flagged it up. Update: Bitcoin is still hovering around the $18,800 mark, having dropped back from nearly $20,000 overnight. The future price of Bitcoin is also quite stable on CME’s platform. Just over 650 contracts for bitcoin’s value in January 2018 have now been traded since last night. Right now, that contract is priced at $19,330, down from the opening price of $19,500. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the introduction of futures contracts is having a slight negative impact on the bitcoin price. This negative impact from CME futures on Bitcoin is likely temporary, just like it was with the launch of CBOE futures last week. Until the bulk of the volume of trading is done through futures, spot prices should dictate the futures price, not vice versa. Bitcoin is a rubbish investment, literally! An email just popped into my inbox, announcing that you can use digital currencies to pay to have your company’s waste and recycling hauled away. York-based BusinessWaste.co.uk will now accept bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum - along with dusty old cash and credit cards. They insist it isn’t a publicity stunt (perish the very thought!), but a natural response to customer demand... Business Waste spokesperson Mark Hall argues: “Individuals and companies are trading in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies all over the world. So of course we’re going to accept it from our customers.” Here’s some Twitter reaction: Dutch Bank ING shares some of Axel Weber’s concerns over bitcoin. In a new research note, ING argue that the digital currency will eventually return to being a “niche product for a select group of enthusiasts”, rather than a revolutionary new currency that reshapes the financial system. Why? They argue that there are several impediments build into bitcoin, which will prevent it becoming the peer-to-peer electronic cash system envisioned by creator Satoshi Nakamoto. For example: Regulation: Its decentralised nature makes it difficult to regulate. Governments and regulators may never come to like decentralised financial networks at all. A negative event, such as a price crash followed by public outcry, could trigger a regulatory crackdown. Intermediaries: Working without intermediaries is cherished by a core group of Bitcoin enthusiasts. The mass audience however dislikes having no rights, no recourse, no guarantees, no legal coverage, nothing. They just want secure, reliable and hassle-free access to their money, and a help desk to call when they lose their password. Scalability: The Bitcoin network is currently clogged and the current level of transaction fees (average $8 in November) makes it very unattractive for small payments. Volatility: while the value of “ordinary” money is managed by the central bank, Bitcoin’s supply is fixed and its value depends greatly on demand. This makes it inherently volatile. Energy use: in the case of Bitcoin, the price of taking out intermediaries is very high electricity consumption. Governance: Blockchain is great at rule enforcement, but does not provide at all for rule-setting. This lack of governance makes implementing innovations slow and painful. Moreover, power may get concentrated in the hands of a few (miners, in the case of Bitcoin). The Guardian’s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day’s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market – and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: France’s finance minister, Brune Le Maire, has also waded into the bitcoin debate. He wants the G20 group of leading advanced economies to debate the whole issue of digital currencies next speing. Speaking on French news channel LCI, Le Maire says: “I am going to propose to the next G20 president, Argentina, that at the G20 summit in April we have a discussion all together on the question of bitcoin.” Le Maire told French news channel LCI. “There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how (...) with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin.” But..... can the G20 really do much about bitcoin? They can certainly try to clamp down on criminals who use anonymous decentralised currencies to launder money. But beyond that, it gets tricky. Bitcoin isn’t an official currency, so it doesn’t fall under the control of a central bank. So should it be regulated as a security - a financial asset? Possibly. Back in July, America’s Security and Exchange Commission ruled that Initial Coin Offerings – where a new digital currency is launched and sold to investors – meet some of the criteria. That opens up to prospect of ICOs being scrutinised by regulators. But even that wouldn’t extend to interfering with day-to-day prices. The FT have published a good take on the battle between the two rival Chicago-based financial exchanges to offer bitcoin derivatives. Here’s a flavour: The bitcoin futures race began in earnest on Sunday as exchange operator CME Group challenged another Chicago exchange that had launched the first digital-currency futures a week before. In the first three hours of trading, nearly $50m in bitcoin futures changed hands on CME, the world’s biggest exchange operator by market value. Rival Cboe Global Markets had hosted $30m in bitcoin futures trading over the same time. The two Chicago-based exchanges created competing bitcoin futures contracts as prices flew higher and professional investors sought exposure inside the walls of a regulated exchange. Success in launching futures contracts could confer legitimacy to bitcoin and add a revenue stream for Cboe and CME. Investors will closely watch how CME’s contract fares because the more than 100-year-old exchange runs several of the world’s most-liquid futures markets in interest rates, currencies, equity indices and commodities. Futures listings tend to be a winner-takes-all business. More here: Duelling bitcoin futures go head-to-head as CME launches contract The launch of bitcoin futures contracts has two significant implications. Firstly, it makes it easier for institutional investors to take a position in bitcoin. They don’t have to actually buy and sell digital currencies, let alone mine them by cracking complicated maths problems. Instead, they just take a position and profit, or lose money, when the contract expires, based on CME’s index of bitcoin prices across several exchanges. Secondly, it allows people to bet against bitcoin. Until now, there hasn’t really been any way of wagering that digital currencies are overpriced. Derivatives contracts allow a trader to bet that bitcoin will be worth less than the current price in, say, mid-January (or whenever a particular futures contract expires). That should mean that digital currencies find their ‘true’ value, stripping out some of the recent volatility. That’s the theory, anyway. It may not go as smoothy in practice, as Lee Wild of interactive investor explains: Introducing futures contracts in the US was meant to give short-sellers access to the market and improve liquidity, but availability is still fairly restricted. The introduction of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the weekend may help, but it will take time. Until it becomes easier to sell short, buying dries up, or there are tech issues or a major hack, bitcoin will keep passing milestones with alarming regularity. Right now, there’s a long queue of investors, both amateur and professional, still waiting for a ride. This bubble is not bursting yet.” CNN Money reckons the bitcoin bandwagon “just keeps rolling on”, with the launch of futures trading on CME. They say: The involvement of top financial institutions in the bitcoin market underscores its growing mainstream acceptance even as government officials, business leaders and economists continue to warn people against investing in it. The CME launch “adds considerable legitimacy” to bitcoin trading, said Shane Chanel, an adviser at Australian investment services firm ASR Wealth Advisers. Swiss bank UBS has warned anyone keen to invest in bitcoin that they risk losing their money. UBS chairman Axel Weber fears that the digital currency’s recent gains are unsustainable, and says investors and speculators should keep away. Speaking to Swiss newspaper NZZ, he says: “We as a bank have consciously warned against this product because we do not assess it to be valuable or sustainable.” Weber argues that financial regulators should now step in, given the surge of interest in bitcoin recently. Otherwise, he fears smaller investors could be wiped out by bitcoin’s volatility. As Weber puts it: “As soon as small investors invest, the regulators are required.... I would welcome an discussion with regulators about cryptocurrencies. There are already signs that governments are taking more interest in bitcoin, with European officials concerned that it is being used for moneylaundering. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The future of finance, or an unsustainable speculative bubble that will cost investors their shirts? The jury is still out on Bitcoin. What we do know, though, is that the cryptocurrency has crossed another barrier -- the world’s biggest exchange is now offering bitcoin futures. From today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is allowing investors to wager whether they think bitcoin will rise or fall in value in the months ahead (after seeing it surge around 2,000% this year). CME is the second exchange to offer bitcoin futures – rival Cboe stole a march last week – and this move shows how digital currencies have pushed their way into the mainstream. The launch has gone fairly smoothly so far. The ‘spot price’ of bitcoin initially surged to almost $20,000, a new record, before dipping back towards $18,800 by 8am London time. Such volatility shows why sceptics argue that bitcoin is hardly a reliable store of value, mind you. Over on CME, the January 2018 futures price has actually dropped a little in the first few hours of trading. It was priced at $19,500, but is now changing hands at $19,370. That suggests that investors expect bitcoin to broadly hold its value over the next month. Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital LLC, told Reuters that many traders are approaching bitcoin cautiously: “We saw a nice open on light volume, but pretty uneventful so far,” “This is a brand-new asset class and I think perhaps a lot of investors want to sit back and see how this plays out before dipping their toes in this market.” Also coming up today... Stock markets are expected to rise, as investors salivate over the prospect of US tax reforms being signed off by Donald Trump by the end of this week.

Speaking after release of the government’s six-monthly budget update, Morrison said the Coalition was still hoping to pursue its 10-year enterprise tax plan, complete with $65bn in company tax cuts, despite the Senate’s opposition. He said Australian businesses needed the multibillion-dollar tax relief, and the country needed to keep its headline corporate tax rate internationally competitive in the face of Donald Trump’s looming tax cuts in the US. He said the Coalition also wanted to pursue personal income tax cuts before the next election, as Treasury forecasts a larger surplus of $10.2bn in 2020-21, revised up from $7.4bn. But he did not dismiss the idea that the government may need to reduce the level of its planned company tax cuts to create the fiscal room to pay for personal income tax cuts and to get the Senate’s support. “We’ll just keep working the issue,” Morrison said on Monday. “Our policies and commitments remain the same. We’re working to meet all of those objectives.” On the ABC’s 7.30 program, Morrison said he believed Australians “always” deserved a wage rise but there were “good signs” at the moment due to the high levels of business investment and profits. He said as the labour market continued to get tighter “we can expect to see that flow through to wages more broadly in the economy”. Asked why wages had not yet risen, Morrison argued they had got out of sync with productivity in the mining boom and profits had only just turned a corner. “We had 12 consecutive quarters where profits were going backwards ... for the first time over the last four quarters we’ve actually had positive profit growth,” he said. Morrison said the prime minister had made it “pretty clear” his task was to deliver income tax cuts for middle-income earners “into next year and the years beyond that”. The treasurer said he intended to deliver income tax cuts while still returning to surplus in 2020-21 and would not be pushing ahead with the plan if tax cuts would put the AAA credit rating at risk. Last month the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute warned the Turnbull government should not try to cut Australia’s headline company tax rate to compete with Trump because it could harm the local economy. It dismissed concerns that a US cut of its corporate tax rate to 20% would lead to capital being withdrawn from Australia. Malcolm Turnbull foreshadowed personal income tax cuts for middle-income Australians in a speech last month to business leaders as he attempted to shrug off the chaos of the past few months and make the case for his “measured” leadership. Since then, he and Morrison have defended the idea on several occasions. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, dismissed Turnbull’s plan to cut personal income taxes last month, saying it amounted to a vague promise of “free beer tomorrow” to distract voters from his political woes. The former Treasury official Chris Richardson also undermined the plan, saying there was no strong economic case for personal income tax cuts and they would come at the budget’s expense. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, on Monday said if parliament passed the government’s business tax cuts in full he would expect “the impetus [would] be there for future increases in wage growth”, but he did not say how that could happen. He accepted that wages were currently growing at a record slow pace despite a near-record 383,000 jobs being created this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/21/losing-the-wilderness-a-tenth-has-gone-since-1992-and-gone-for-good","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T00:14:29Z","webTitle":"Losing the wilderness: a 10th has gone since 1992 – and gone for good","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/21/losing-the-wilderness-a-tenth-has-gone-since-1992-and-gone-for-good","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/21/losing-the-wilderness-a-tenth-has-gone-since-1992-and-gone-for-good","fields":{"headline":"Losing the wilderness: a 10th has gone since 1992 – and gone for good","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The world’s last great wildernesses are shrinking at an alarming rate. In the past two decades, 10% of the earth’s wilderness has been lost due to human pressure, a mapping study by the University of Queensland has found. Over the course of human history, there has been a major degradation of 52% of the earth’s ecosystems, while the remaining 48% is being increasingly eroded. Since 1992, when the United Nations signed up to the Rio convention on biological diversity, three million square kilometres of wilderness have been lost. According to the UQ professor and director of science at the Wildlife Conservation Society James Watson, senior author on the study, “If this rate continues, we will have lost all wilderness within the next 50 years.” This wilderness degradation is endangering biodiversity, as well as the water cycle, the nitrogen cycle and pollination. And, says Watson, once they have been damaged or cleared, the wildernesses are gone for good; there is no scientific evidence that degraded eco-systems could ever return to their original condition. These pristine wild places exist in inhospitable locations: the deserts of Central Australia; the Amazon rainforest in South America; Africa; the Tibetan plateau in central Asia; and the boreal forests of Canada and Russia. They are being encroached on by logging, oil and gas exploration, mining, roads and agriculture. “It is death by a thousand cuts” says PhD student James Allan, who also worked on the study. “The moment you put a road in, you get people moving in to farm, hunt, and [that] undermines the wilderness. The risk is that a lot of these systems could collapse. The Amazon is the best example of where you need the whole forest, or a huge portion of the forest, protected for the hydrological cycle to function.” One third of the Amazon wilderness region has been lost since 1992. Watson agrees: “What we are showing is that the degradation of intact ecosystems affects the ability around cloud formation, so it means that literally the ability to create rain is affected. [And]we are seeing the dramatic impacts on water, in terms of the water flow in rivers.” Loss of wilderness will affect the migratory species who depend on large intact wilderness areas, and the large carnivores – charismatic megafauna such as lions, who can’t live in a human landscape when their habitat disappears. According to the study, Australia has not suffered the worst of global wilderness loss. “Central and Northern Australia has very little large scale infrastructure at the present,” says Watson. “We are very lucky, we have a very low population density and the vast majority of our population is on the coast. This doesn’t mean these areas are not threatened – they still have very serious issues with invasive species and non-natural fire regimes.” However, James Trezise, policy analyst at the Australia Conservation Foundation, points to the irrigation and mining projects in Western Australia and South Australia scattered within the wilderness regions. Trezise says Australia urgently needs to address the major drivers of habitat loss, invasive species and fire regimes. “We have some of the biggest intact tropical savannas, we have got amazing desert country [but] we have this immense challenge in how we adapt and protect nature going into the future. Otherwise, we will see a significant ramp-up in extinction. We will also see a huge loss in ecosystem function which could ultimately cascade onto us.” The UQ study found that conservation efforts are being rapidly outpaced by the acceleration of the decline, thanks to massive global population growth and the associated economic growth that demands ever-increasing natural resources. The problem is profound. “Intact functioning ecosystems” says Watson, “are critical not only for biodiversity but for the huge amounts of carbon they store and sequester. They provide a direct defence against climate-related hazards like storms, floods, fires and cyclones. They are the most resilient and effective defence against ongoing climate change.” And yet only 20% of the earth’s surface now survives as wilderness. “Within a century it could all be gone,” says Watson, “and with it, uninfluenced evolution and natural carbon storage. When we started seeing the numbers, we had to double-check them because they were so large in terms of the loss.” Loss of wilderness also affects Indigenous communities . “You have got people living in the Amazon, Congo and New Guinea who have been there for thousands of years subsisting through hunting – just sustainable use of the resources,” says Allan. “So loss of wilderness will have huge ramifications for local people and their livelihoods.” While Trezise says the UQ research is “sound”, it is part of a bigger picture. “It doesn’t account for impacts such as climate change. In Canada you have climate change impacts to those boreal forests. You need to take this analysis and look at other bits of work and bring it all together to tell a holistic story. ” The UQ research shifts conservation thinking which has historically targeted funding towards really threatened areas where there is a lot of human activity harming species. “What we realised was that we were not really thinking about the other end of the spectrum, which is those amazing intact systems that are still functioning like they are meant to be function by evolutionary and ecological processes,” says Watson. “If you looked around, there were no maps, no discussion of how these places were changing. Or what was being lost. We realised that we should start looking at humanity’s influence on that end of the spectrum, the last great wildernesses on the planet.” In 2016, Watson and his team released maps of the global human footprint, using eight data layersof roads, agriculture, grazing land, human population density, urbanisation and navigable waterways. “The environment footprint of humanity is truly massive,” Watson wrote of his findings in Time. “No other species has ever come close to us in terms of consuming so much of the world’s energy, resources and land area. In this Anthropocene era, where the human footprint is now altering many of the Earth systems processes, wilderness areas serve as natural observatories where we can study the ecological and evolutionary impacts of global change.” The loss of wilderness maps build on that research. It is hoped the maps and research will influence global policy. Watson says he has had “multiple” requests from policymakers around the world, including the UN.He describes it as a call to action. “We have got to turn the corner, we have got to bend the curve, we have got to change this and save the last brilliant irreplaceable places.” What we need, says Trezise, is “strong environmental law. We need big investments from government and the private sector, otherwise we will continue on a very sad trajectory.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/18/pm-begins-long-march-from-camp-tantrum-as-he-sells-economic-revolution","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T06:45:42Z","webTitle":"PM begins long march from Camp Tantrum as he sells economic revolution | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/18/pm-begins-long-march-from-camp-tantrum-as-he-sells-economic-revolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/18/pm-begins-long-march-from-camp-tantrum-as-he-sells-economic-revolution","fields":{"headline":"PM begins long march from Camp Tantrum as he sells economic revolution","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Right now, if you watch politics closely, you won’t need me to tell you about the story the Turnbull government wants to tell you in 2018. It will be about as obvious to you as the nose on your face. But assuming the fatigue of the year might have finally got to you, let’s take a minute to spell it out. After the omnishambles of 2017, the government wants 2018 to be about fresh starts and improving economic fortunes (due to its dazzling managerial wizardry of course) – sweetened with the prospect of tax cuts. If we consider the regular Treasury forecasts a necessary input to that story, the latest midyear economic outlook, released on Monday, paints the following picture. The global economy is rebounding after the prolonged economic downturn triggered by the most significant financial crisis to hit the world since the great depression. Assuming no conflagration on the Korean peninsula and assuming conditions in China remain benign, 2018 is looking like the best year in a decade and the best since the onset of the crisis. Back at home, let’s persist with the good news. Labour market conditions are picking up, with unemployment at the lowest rate in over four years and participation up. The outlook for business investment is also positive. But elsewhere the picture is mixed. Economic growth is off a touch, wages growth remains stagnant and growth in household consumption is modest. If that all sounds meh, it is. It’s also a cycle that becomes self-fulfilling. Low wages growth means household consumption drops and, while spending less might be prudent at the household level, it’s not good for the economy. Let’s go finally to the national balance sheet. The budget is shuffling back towards surplus but, on current projections, despite tax hikes and spending cuts, we don’t get there until 2020-21. The best you can say about government debt is it is growing more slowly. So while there are some positive signs, we are a distance here from what Paul Keating once described as a beautiful set of numbers. But tracking back to where we started – with what the government wants to talk about when we all stagger back from the beach – even if the outlook is mixed, talking about the economy and tax cuts is helpful for a few reasons. The first reason is the Coalition believes it can begin to fight back politically if that’s where the daily conversation happens. The second involves plotting the long march back from Camp Tantrum. Let’s remember what has happened this year. This government has struggled to agree on major policies, struggled to maintain internal discipline. Just imagine a scenario where Coalition MPs can talk about something they more or less agree on rather than constantly bag each other. It really does seem revolutionary. The government also thinks it can translate a decisive pick-up in global confidence and activity into the vibe of the domestic political arena. In the process of importing the feelgood, the government will also attempt to import Donald Trump’s corporate tax cuts by arguing (amplified by business groups) We Absolutely Must Follow The Donald Or Risk Becoming Internationally Uncompetitive. Think of next year as a special down under episode of The Apprentice: cut corporate taxes Australia, or you’re fired. The interesting thing to watch will be how Labor reacts. The economic conversation in Australia between the major parties to date has been the unreconstructed trickle-down merchants versus the guardians of equity – a conversation where Labor has been able to make political gains on the Coalition. We saw Labor reduce the Turnbull government to a majority of one at the last federal election by having precisely that conversation, while the aspirational tone from the prime minister sounded glib and out of touch. The reason Labor has been able to make gains on the Coalition up until now in an area of traditional Coalition strength is because the opposition’s top line messages resonate with the lived experience of ordinary voters in the Australian economy described in minute detail by Treasury: one with stagnating wages and all the insecurities and loop effects that flow from that. Labor’s messaging works when the world is stuck in the long shadow of the global financial crisis. If we remain in that economy, my instinct is Labor’s messages still resonate. But if we transition to a new one, if green shoots become green lights, the balance between aspiration and insecurity in this country might shift – and it will be interesting to see how Labor adapts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/18/ending-puppy-farms-are-victorias-new-laws-the-right-approach","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T06:03:11Z","webTitle":"Ending the disgrace of puppy farms: are Victoria's new laws the right approach?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/ending-puppy-farms-are-victorias-new-laws-the-right-approach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/18/ending-puppy-farms-are-victorias-new-laws-the-right-approach","fields":{"headline":"Ending the disgrace of puppy farms: are Victoria's new laws the right approach?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On 11 December, almost two years after council workers found 57 dogs hidden in a western Victorian park, a magistrate banned two well-known dog breeders from owning any animal for the next 10 years. It was a culmination of one of the Victoria’s most high-profile animal cruelty cases. The dogs were discovered in Pioneer Park in the Ballarat suburb of Wendouree on 5 February2016, the morning of a pre-arranged inspection of the Wendouree house and breeding facility. More were found by RSPCA inspectors in a follow-up inspection in April 2016. They were found in dirty conditions with as many as seven packed into a single travelling crate, RSPCA prosecutor Sebastian Reid said. More than 70 adult dogs and puppies of working dog breeds were seized and 66 were forfeited, of which 60 have since been rehomed. In July, another dog breeder from Lake Marmal, 271km from Melbourne in north-west Victoria, was banned from owning any dogs for nine years after the RSPCA seized 36 dogs that, it said, “were housed in appalling conditions, with some dogs not even provided with water”. The cases are an example of the kind of cruelty that spurred the RSPCA and other welfare organisations to lobby for anti-puppy farm laws, designed to stamp out unethical breeders and target those who warehouse dogs in inhumane conditions. Currently, dog breeding businesses with more than three and up to about 150 breeding females are regulated under the one system. Under the new laws that passed the Victorian parliament on 15 December, operations with more than 10 breeding female dogs will be illegal from 10 April 2020, unless they classify as a commercial breeder and have ministerial approval to have a maximum of 50 breeding females. Those larger operations will fall under the inspectorate of the Department of Agriculture, not local councils, and will face more regular audits, including inspections ordered by Victoria’s chief veterinary officer. Pet shops will be prohibited from selling dogs or cats, except those that came from an animal shelter, a pound or a registered foster carer. Foster carers will be will be limited to having five animals – either dogs or cats – per house. The flagship reforms were promised by the Andrews government while it was still in opposition and delivered after industry and opposition criticism prompted a 12-month redrafting delay. With the reforms come a slew of new offences for breaching the laws. But the most significant reform, according to both RSPCA Victoria and the Victorian branch of the Australian Veterinary Association, is the establishment of a pet exchange register that will allow animals to be traced back to their breeder. It’s that transparency, animal groups say, that will allow regulators to unearth underground breeding practices and track down unethical suppliers. Puppy farms, defined by the RSPCA as places characterised by extreme confinement, unhygienic living conditions, overcrowded housing and inadequate veterinary care, have always been illegal. The RSPCA says the pet exchange register is the most effective tool yet in stamping out the farms. How does that work? The register will work much like paddock-to-plate traceability in meat animals such as cattle and sheep, minus the plate. From 1 July 2019, anyone who either breeds animals for sale or passes on ownership of a dog or cat either by selling or free exchange needs to register with the pet exchange and acquire a source number. The only exception is when a person is giving away a dog or cat without advertising it, such as giving it to a family member. Advertising a dog or cat for sale without a source number in Victoria will be illegal under the new laws, with penalties for both the person who places the ad and the publication that runs it. The source number will be linked to the animal’s microchip and carried with it for life. Buyers who have a bad experience collecting an animal can flag it with the department. That puts a lot of pressure on buyers to do their due diligence, but the RSPCA Victoria chief executive, Liz Walker, said most pet owners want to do the right thing. “I think there are many, many stories that have been heard about highly informed, highly educated people who follow the smart puppy buyers’ guide from the RSPCA, and then when they are on their way to pick it up, they get a call saying, ‘it’s not convenient for you to today, we will meet you at a petrol station or somewhere else to where the puppy has been bred’,” Walker told Guardian Australia. The ability to trace animals is the “jewel in the crown” of the new laws, Walker said. The Australian Veterinary Association of Victoria president, Dr Paul Martin, agreed, saying it would help improve monitoring and compliance. Currently, Walker said, it is unknown where about about 70% of the dogs born in Victoria each year, or 60,000 puppies, actually come from. The register aims to change that. What about cats? Cats are problematic. This is part of their charm, but in the context of a pet exchange register, cats and kittens are problematic because they have a tendency to just appear – like Asbestos, the tiny kitten that fell out of the soggy ceiling cavity into the bedroom of Melbourne woman Ellie Haywood during torrential rain earlier this month. It can be presumed that Asbestos does not have a source number. That is fine because he is not for sale, but humans who are less open to cats falling from the ceiling and moving in permanently will either have to surrender them to an animal shelter or register for a source number to sell or give them away privately. The caps on the number of breeding females do not apply to cat breeding operations, because kitten farms are not perceived to be as big a problem as puppy farms. However, the RSPCA says it has busted some. “We know that kitten farms are out there, not at the level that puppy farms are, but undoubtedly they exist,” Walker said. Martin said large kitten farms breeding a specific type of cat to meet market demand were not as common a problem as puppy farms, because fewer cat owners sought out specific breeds. “There is a never-ending supply of cats already,” Martin said. “There seems to be a chronic oversupply of kittens, so the same issues don’t really develop with cats.” Is there a downside? According to the Australian Veterinary Association of Victoria, the laws could have the unintended consequence of encouraging small-scale backyard breeders who do not have the experience of larger professional breeders, which could lead to negative animal welfare outcomes. “What is going to happen is that people are going to see an opening to breed two or three dogs and sell them to the market,” Martin told Guardian Australia. “Because they are not at home for 40 hours of the week, those dogs are going to be left in a shed, in a yard, unsupervised.” Martin said he had seen a number of dogs kept in similar situations over his veterinary career. “They have been in whelp for more than 24 hours because the people who owned them were doing it as a part-time exercise,” he said. It’s an argument for allowing larger, professional breeders to remain in the market, because they have both the knowledge and the resources to watch pregnant animals closely. Martin said capping the number of breeding females at 50 was “an arbitrary number that the minister has picked out for political reasons”. He said the number should remain uncapped but with the same strong new regulations and compliance measures in place. “There’s no scientific reason for it. In fact, there is some evidence and scientific arguments for why large establishments can improve animal welfare standards more than small establishments,” he said. However, he said it was difficult for the public to think of dog or cat breeding as a business to be conducted by professionals, in the same way that it might accept horse or cattle breeding as something best done by professionals. “Large breeders like Banksia Park (a Gippsland dog breeder specialising in designer crossbreeds) are professionals,” he said. “They know what the pitfalls are and they avoid them.” Banksia Park has been one of the most vocal critics of the new laws, which it says target large professional breeders. It has argued that the welfare of the animals should be the only metric under consideration. The RSPCA says the number of animals is not in itself an indicator of a puppy farm. “There’s no evidence that connects animal welfare to the number of breeding animals,” Walker said. “That’s a choice by government and, at the end of the day, we think the focus should be on the jewel of the crown, which is traceability.” What are other states doing? The Western Australian government has also pledged to introduce anti-puppy farming laws following the same model as Victoria, including a centralised registration system to identify dogs at point of sale, compulsory sterilisation of dogs unless an exemption is given for breeding purposes, an upper limit on the number of breeding females a breeder can have and a mandatory upper limit on the number of litters a breeding female can have in her lifetime. The advisory group given the task of drafting the laws met for the first time in November. The WA laws will not include cats, as they are already covered under the Cat Act 2011. Queensland introduced compulsory dog breeder registration laws in May 2017 and dog breeders will face audits from the RSPCA. New South Wales conducted a parliamentary inquiry into puppy factories in 2015, which recommended introducing a breeders licensing scheme for commercial cat and dog breeders, and requiring all pet sale advertisements to include the breeder’s identification and the animal’s microchip numbers. The NSW government responded by conducting a review of the existing system and implementing a $200,000 education and compliance program."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/18/society-problem-women-sexual-harrassment-kate-maltby-damian-green-trial-by-media-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T14:35:33Z","webTitle":"Society still has a problem with women speaking out.

Regardless of the facts, they’re often vilified and blamed for what happened. In 2016, footballer Adam Johnson was found guilty of child grooming and sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. A few months later, the former partner of Johnson’s sister was jailed for harassing the victim in a series of Facebook posts – in which he shared a photo of the teenager and encouraged others to do the same. His victim has said she now “lives in fear of violent attack”. A few days ago, sexual assault allegations against rapper Nelly were dropped. He denies the allegations. According to her lawyer, the alleged victim told police she didn’t want to press charges “because she believes the system is going to fail her”, and that “she never wanted notoriety”. Who can blame her given how other alleged victims have been treated? More than 80 women have now accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual violence and harassment, many of them rich and famous in their own right. He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Their individual stories appear to indicate a specific pattern of offending. Despite this, only 62% of US citizens believe the allegations are credible. On social media, the alleged victims have been ridiculed, slandered, harassed and threatened. They’ve been accused of attention seeking and making a fuss in an attempt to further their careers. Before the story broke, Weinstein hired an “army of spies”, including former Mossad agents, as one contract stated to stop the publication of the abuse allegations going public. His team are accused of collecting information on dozens of people, and compiling psychological profiles with their personal or sexual histories in order to contradict, discredit or intimidate them, although Weinstein denies this. Allegedly, journalists were also used to extract details from women planning to make public claims. It is, perhaps, unsurprising that a man like Weinstein could use such tactics to protect their own reputation. But there is also a far broader cultural problem. From the vantage point of the UK, journalists helping Weinstein against his accusers seems shocking – but our own media is far from spotless in this regard. The threats against Kate Maltby came after the Daily Mail published what was, effectively, a piece targeting her – prompted entirely by her allegations against Green. It described her as “one very pushy lady” and insinuated she had only made the claims to raise her own profile. Particularly nastily, it included a quote from an anonymous family “friend” suggesting her parents “will be aghast by what Kate has done”. In truth, Maltby’s family are fully supportive of her. An accompanying opinion piece by Jan Moir dripped further poison, again suggesting she was simply attention seeking for personal gain. Now, a Cabinet Office inquiry into Damian Green’s case is understood to be examining whether he played a role in briefing the Daily Mail against Maltby. Green vehemently denies this. Regardless, the journalists who published the pieces must have known they could have prompted harassment. Even a neutral or supportive article could potentially provoke a nasty backlash – but the Mail effectively stuck a target on Maltby’s back. I feel it’s hard to avoid concluding that this was exactly the point: to intimidate Maltby herself. The fact that she is a Conservative activist seems to have been irrelevant. To protect a senior minister (and, potentially, the stability of the government) the Conservative-supporting Mail was seemingly perfectly happy to savage one of its own. • Abi Wilkinson is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/18/more-prisoners-should-commute-to-work-says-justice-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T15:25:05Z","webTitle":"More prisoners should 'commute' to work, says justice secretary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/18/more-prisoners-should-commute-to-work-says-justice-secretary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/18/more-prisoners-should-commute-to-work-says-justice-secretary","fields":{"headline":"More prisoners should 'commute' to work, says justice secretary","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The justice secretary is to encourage prison governors to allow more inmates to “commute to work” by making greater use of their powers to grant prisoners temporary releases on licence. David Lidington, in a major speech on prison reform, highlighted the day release initiative alongside a pilot project for prisoners to access housing on release. It is part of a concerted effort across the public sector to reduce stubbornly high reoffending rates. The justice secretary said he wanted to see the record 86,000 prison population in England and Wales come down. He argued prison should be a last resort and promised to keep pushing for community sentences that judges and the public would feel confident about. He put a renewed emphasis on post-release rehabilitation, citing the facts that 83% of former prisoners are without a job a year after release and 30% do not have a suitable home on their first night of release. He said a New Futures Network was being introduced to build links between prisons and local employers to promote the hiring of former offenders. He said prison governors’ overcautious approach to the use of the temporary release on licence programme was a significant obstacle to expanding the job opportunities of former prisoners. “Prison officers say they want to use release on temporary licence more so that those [coming to the end of their sentences] can commute to work from prison but that does depend on getting more employers involved in the first place,” he said. The use of temporary release on licence for work experience has declined sharply since 2012, when it was used for day release 484,000 times. The latest figures show there were 83,740 instances in the first three months of this year and only 50 recorded failures to return on time. Individual failures headlined in the press lay behind the reduction, but Lidington is in effect giving governors political backup to expand the scheme once again. He will look into the expansion of home detention curfew tags, under which about 2,000 prisoners are released early. Lidington promised to press ahead with the prison modernisation programme to create “decent, humane conditions” but made no mention of his predecessor’s “new for old” programme, under which the closure of Victorian inner-city jails was to finance the building programme. He told a Reform thinktank event in London that the “overriding trigger” for the levels of violence, harm and disorder inside prisons in England and Wales was the availability of drugs, including new psychoactive substances, and other contraband. Lidington said a target of recruiting an extra 2,500 prison officers had passed the halfway mark, with a net increase of 1,255 in the last year. Every prison officer now had access to body-worn cameras and “police-style” handcuffs and restraints had been introduced, he added. The justice secretary also highlighted a campaign against illicit phones and drones being used by criminal gangs to orchestrate the drug trade in prisons. The latest assessment shows 6,500 prisoners have links to or are involved in organised crime gangs. Lidington held up a tiny mobile phone, the size of a cigarette lighter, which was made of plastic and advertised to Beat the Boss on Amazon, eBay and other websites. The “boss” in this case is thought to be a screening chair used in prisons to detect metal items such as mobile phones. The minister urged online retailers to take them down from their platforms and stressed the number of convictions that have been secured in recent months against drone and attempts to smuggle drugs and phones into prisons. The thrust of his speech centred on a fresh emphasis on rehabilitation, saying that safe and secure prison environments were the foundation stone for successful rehabilitation. Lidington reminded his audience that two-thirds of prisoners serving sentences of less than 12 months reoffend within a year of release. In the past six months, more control has been devolved to prison governors, including more influence over their healthcare services and programmes to help change offender behaviour. In October, this was extended to budgets for family services, including visitor centres and parenting skill classes, and in the new year will be extended to give them powers to commission libraries and workshops. Lidington stressed the burden of reducing stubbornly high reoffending rates could not just be borne by the justice system. “I believe that if we are to successfully rise to this challenge we need to mobilise more of government; we need a concerted effort across the public sector,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/18/word-of-the-year-2017-oxford-dictionaries-youthquake","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T13:05:13Z","webTitle":"Forget youthquake: here are the real words of the year | Martin Kelner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/word-of-the-year-2017-oxford-dictionaries-youthquake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/word-of-the-year-2017-oxford-dictionaries-youthquake","fields":{"headline":"Forget youthquake: here are the real words of the year","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Casper Grathwohl has the rather fine title of president of dictionaries at Oxford University Press, so it was he who chose the much-discussed but rarely used “youthquake” as 2017 word of the year, over some other equally unlikely suggestions. I only mention that in case, in skimming over the story at this busy time of the year, you read Grathwohl alongside Antifa, gorpcore and broflake, and assumed it was one of the contenders. Why not? The Microsoft spellchecker puts the same wobbly line under youthquake and the rest of Casper’s shortlist as it does under his name, meaning it’s not just the man on the Leeds omnibus (me) scratching his head over El Presidente’s selection. In a hilarious blogpost, Grathwohl says: “I always look forward to the word of the year season.” (Who knew it was a season? Carry on calling it Christmas if you want.) “Selecting one word each year that embodies the previous 12 months is a difficult task, which is one reason we surround it with a diverse shortlist of friends.” Who, I immediately wondered, is on this shortlist of friends, bandying youthquake, gorpcore, and milkshake duck around the dinner table, describing their festive cocktails as “unicorn” (artificially brightly coloured food or drink)? Freddie Flintoff? Debbie McGee? Professor Carlo Rovelli? I followed the link from Casper’s blog back to the Oxford Dictionaries website, and nowhere are names named. One might almost think he was referring to the rivals for word of the year – but other than perhaps Stephen Fry, no one could possibly be that arch. In fairness to the pres, he recognises that youthquake (there goes that wobbly line again) – defined as a significant cultural, political or social change arising from the actions or influence of young people, such as Labour’s improved performance at the last election, or my teenage daughter retuning the car radio to Capital – has not exactly been on everybody’s lips in 2017. “Sometimes you pick a word because you recognise it has arrived,” he explains. “But other times you pick one that is knocking at the door and that you want to help usher in.” That leaves the president and those friends lucky enough to make his shortlist (Tony Blackburn? Professor Mary Beard? Richard Osman, almost certainly) an awful lot of latitude. Given that previous selections include the “tears of joy” emoji as 2015’s word of the year, the cynic in me is inclined to dismiss the whole word of the year season as an elaborate publicity stunt – or pubstunt, as nobody has ever called it. But who wants to be a miserable old killjoy at this time of the year? Helping to “usher in” words that have rarely been used, and likely never will, is such fun we should all have a go. The only rule is that the ushered-in word, the ushee if you like, should in some way reflect the events and trends of 2017. Here are a few of mine, for starters. Onan-occupier A male figure in the entertainment industry bringing what has traditionally been a deeply private practice into the public domain, as an instrument of power to harass and humiliate women, and damage plants. Mudclear The words issuing from the mouth of any politician, immediately after saying, “Let me be absolutely clear,” or “We’ve been absolutely clear on this,” as in the invariably opaque answer to the question, “What is Labour’s policy on Brexit?” Sheerfatigue As in: “My daughter retuned the car radio to Capital, I tried another three music stations, and I still can’t get away from Galway Girl. If I don’t get back to Radio 4 soon, I won’t be responsible for my actions.” Trumprace The frantic race on Twitter to be first to point out the obvious idiocy of the US president’s latest tweet, and thus get all the likes and retweets that would normally go to Owen Jones. Starklessness Condition suffered by one who has never watched Game of Thrones, trying to socialise with a shortlist of friends who love the show. Those are mine.

Thank you. The big picture So now the hard bit starts. Eighteen months after the referendum and 16 months before the UK formally leaves the EU, Theresa May’s government will finally have to discuss what it wants Brexit to mean – and what it will give up to get it. The EU27 ruled at their Brussels summit last week that sufficient progress had been made on the three key points of the divorce talks – citizens’ rights, the Irish border and the financial settlement – to allow negotiations to move on to discussions about a transition period and Britain’s future outside the bloc. It marked a major step forward for Brexit and a real achievement for the prime minister, who the day before the summit had suffered a humiliating defeat in the Commons over a meaningful vote for MPs on the final deal. Eleven Conservative rebels, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, backed an amendment to May’s flagship European Union withdrawal bill, handing the government – by 309 votes to 305 – its first Commons defeat over Brexit. Now May must try to pull together her deeply divided cabinet to come up with what the EU27 are demanding before March, when they are prepared to start proper trade talks: a clear vision of how the UK sees the desired end state of Brexit. The conundrum remains: align standards and regulations, prioritise access to the single market and sacrifice control over laws and borders, or diverge from EU standards, control laws and borders and sacrifice privileged single market access? The EU has made plain that the UK cannot do both. Squaring the circle is not going to be easy. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has promised to present his vision of a “liberal” Brexit in the coming days that avoids Britain becoming what he has called a “vassal state” of the the EU. Meanwhile, the Tory rebels who defeated the government last week are urging May to face down the hardliners, reach out to Labour and form a cross-party alliance for a soft Brexit that would enjoy the support of a large majority in the Commons. The transition period, the top priority for January, is already the subject of an almighty row, with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, saying single market and customs union rules will of course still apply – as the EU27 have said – and the former Brexit minister David Jones describing that as “anathema”. Have a good festive break; it’s going to be a full-on new year. The view from Europe The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave us a taste of what is to come, telling the Guardian that Britain cannot have a special trade deal allowing financial services firms in the City to trade freely in the EU: There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn’t exist. [This is a consequence of] the red lines that the British have chosen themselves. In leaving the single market, they lose the financial services passport. Given Britain’s red lines, the only feasible deal would be one similar to the Canada-EU Ceta deal, Barnier said, with extra non-economic cooperation on judicial affairs, defence and security, and aviation. Barnier also said a trade deal could be agreed within a strict two-year transition period but would have to be ratified by more than 35 national and regional parliaments, and that the UK must follow all EU rules and regulations during that transition period. Trade agreements with the rest of the world could be negotiated but would not be allowed to enter into force during that time, he added. Stefaan de Rynck, Barnier’s chief adviser, made the EU’s position on a few points quite clear too, in an event at Chatham House. Businesses would only get absolute certainty about a Brexit transition – which, incidentally, he said was not yet “a given” – when the withdrawal agreement was finalised, probably in October 2018, he said. The UK would have to accept new rules that came into force during the transition period, he said, and while it would get a “bespoke” trade deal in the sense that it would not be exactly the same deal as, for example, Canada’s, it could not have access to the single market just for some sectors of the economy. Meanwhile, back in Westminster To lose a vote on one amendment to the EU withdrawal bill could seem bad luck (or perhaps bad counting); to lose two would be downright careless, and the government has apparently decided not to risk it. With the marathon committee stage of the bill (when amendments are submitted) finally coming to an end this week, ministers have backed down on plans to enshrine in law the Brexit date as 29 March 2019. Critics had complained that this was both pointless and overly inflexible, with Tory MPs threatening to rebel in sufficient numbers to repeat the defeat the government took last week. While No 10 has yet to officially say it is backing down, it is understood May will support a compromise whereby the date will stay in place but with the caveat that MPs can push it back as needed if the EU27 agree. Elsewhere, the repercussions of last week’s rebellion were continuing, and not in a good way: several of the 11 Tory MPs who voted against the government disclosed that they had received threats and abuse. Grieve, whose amendment it was that passed, said he had reported death threats to the police and blamed the vitriol of the pro-Brexit media. Another MP, Anna Soubry, was sent multiple messages saying she should be hanged as a traitor. She said newspapers who had referred to Brexit “mutineers” and the like had “frankly lost the plot” and had helped inspire such emotions.

Read these … In the Guardian, Martin Kettle argues that the government’s Commons defeat last week opened up new and far-reaching possibilities, of a second referendum and indeed the whole leaving process coming off the rails: The passing of the Grieve amendment is a big moment for May and for the Tory party. It may be a freak high tide of revolt against May’s Brexit strategy. Alternatively, it may be a watershed moment after which the whole landscape of Brexit options looks different. Boris Johnson said yesterday that Brexit was unstoppable. Well he would, wouldn’t he? But the events of this week have actually raised the opposite possibility – that May’s Brexit can be still be changed, and perhaps even stopped. Matthew d’Ancona reckons Brexit’s new political lexicon – “vassal states”, “traitors” and “enemies of the people” – is a reminder of the dangers of populism: Whether or not this counts for much on Twitter and Snapchat, the fact remains that sovereignty lies with the Queen-in-Parliament. It is sensationally unfashionable to say so, but I am not sure that what is loosely called “the sovereignty of the people” is such a good thing. Since Rousseau hailed the “general will”, the history of those who have declared themselves its authentic voice has been, shall we say, patchy. The 20th century was an object lesson in the perils of populism and the autocracy and fascism it so easily leads towards ... The next time you hear someone claiming to speak for “the people” – and you will – be sure to count the democratic silver.

On his first day in the city, he meets a rich-girl art student, Adeline, who becomes his roommate, playmate, soulmate – his “one essential person”. The book alternates between their points of view, and through their eyes Kobek gives us a rollicking tour of the cool downtown culture of the time. The novel is a prequel of sorts to Kobek’s debut, the self-published cult hit I Hate the Internet, both in the sense that a middle-aged Adeline is the protagonist of I Hate the Internet and in that the cultural commentary of one book looks forward to that of the other. Both novels are also aggressively unconventional in form. In his first, Kobek informed the reader that he was writing a “bad novel” because good novels had completely failed to encompass the experience of the internet. Thus, in the place of realistic characters and a coherent plot, I Hate the Internet offered Twitterish one-liners, bloggy opinions and chatter about celebrities. The Future Won’t Be Long uses the same techniques: Kobek spends 400 pages bantering, opinionating and telling Big Apple anecdotes. Some are from the fictional lives of Baby and Adeline; some are real vignettes from the era, like the story of Daniel Rakowitz, who murdered a woman, made a stew from her body and fed it to the homeless people of Tompkins Square Park. Various celebrities – Quentin Crisp, Bret Easton Ellis, Norman Mailer – appear in cameos to deliver a few characteristic lines. Regardless of whether Baby or Adeline is narrating, the prose has a chatty immediacy, with moments of half-baked lyricism that are winningly camp. Adeline describes a period of aimlessness in San Francisco as “too much perambulation enclosed within tendrils of fog and woe”; in one of Baby’s many epiphanies, he says, “I’d spent too much time in New York, too much time interacting with its lunatics, its mad ones, its charlatans, its would-be revolutionaries.” The tone is always faintly cynical, and the events sometimes grisly, but, as Baby says, describing projections on the walls of a club: “Violence, malice, hatred, death. All very cartoony, detached from the actuality of suffering.” Kobek does not announce his anti-novelistic intentions within the book, and so the reader keeps expecting a narrative arc that fails to materialise. As Baby’s clubbing becomes increasingly drug-sodden, promiscuous and alienated, we assume he’s heading for some kind of crisis; instead, he just gradually eases off as he gets older and clubbing stops being so much fun. Since his friendship with Adeline is the centre of the book, we assume that some significant conflict will eventually threaten their relationship – and indeed the two do have a falling-out that separates them for some months, but it’s about something extraneous, is dealt with in a single page of snappy dialogue and has no profound effect on either of them. Adeline’s reaction to the rift is covered in a single high-camp sentence: “Our unspeakable schism wreaked its terrible havoc, but your old pal Adeline stood her ground, resolute and knee deep in her even-eyed imbecility.” She then goes on to give us a full-page description of an unusually heavy period. These choices are deliberate, but do they work? Yes and no. The violent demise of Baby’s parents is described with the same catty frivolity as his meeting with Quentin Crisp; the terror of the Aids epidemic is batted away with a few offhand remarks, and there is just enough realism in the book for this to make the characters seem gratingly insensitive. Everything proceeds at the same sauntering pace; over the course of 400 pages, it can feel like walking in circles. Still, the structureless course of events is, in its way, savagely realistic; and while The Future Won’t Be Long may be a “bad novel” in ways Kobek didn’t entirely intend, it’s mostly very fun to read. In a typical sally, Kobek ends with a three-page litany of things that “fiction never addresses”, which mostly consists of things that are actually fairly commonly represented in fiction: “Like the way in which air travel is an abhorrence that destroys the soul. Like the way in which plastic saps a percentage of joy. Like the way in which no specific action by any individual person or group of persons achieves anything and yet somehow life continues on apace.” It’s a microcosm of the rest of the book: argumentative, over-dramatic, valuing style over accuracy, much longer than it has any right to be. Yet one can’t help liking Kobek for writing it; for so defiantly, brattishly, entertainingly, being a not-good novelist.

Bryan Talbot’s choice of this quote to open Grandville Force Majeure is appropriate, because this case will see the burly, badger-headed Detective Inspector LeBrock of Scotland Yard pushed beyond his limits and biting back. This is the fifth and final volume in the anthropomorphic graphic series, set in an alternative past in which France won the Napoleonic wars and rules the rest of Europe, and it’s clear from the cover that the stakes are being raised to their highest. LeBrock stands alone, his back turned, his eyes glowering suspiciously over his shoulder, while his right hand clasps a handheld version of a rapid-fire Gatling gun. A review of a prose novel rarely mentions its paper stock, font or production qualities, but graphic novels can offer a highly visual and physical experience of the book as design object. The Grandville series distinguishes itself, seducing with its embossed hardcover heft, ornate, art nouveau-inspired decoration and endpapers, and crisp colour printing, in a format reminiscent of classic children’s comic annuals. Related to this is a deep seam of nostalgia for the British and international legacies of “funny animals” in comics as well as in animation, television and other popular culture. The title itself pays tribute to Jean-Jacques Grandville, the pen name of the 19th-century French caricaturist famed for his animal-headed “metamorphoses”. Deeply referential if not always reverential, Talbot squirrels into his panels numerous nods and winks to a menagerie of characters, some from his childhood. From the cast of the Rupert Bear strip, for example, he derives the pug Algy, one of LeBrock’s Eton-collared superiors at the Yard. Talbot rarely resists a pun, even if it’s a groaner, so a Parisian prostitute named Gigi is a horse, a pigeon informant is called Walter after the film star, and the tyrannical lizard mastermind is a T rex named Tiberius Koenig. Gangster twins the Crays are, naturally, crayfish. Hiding this number of Easter eggs might risk overegging the story, but it places Grandville in the tradition of Britain’s humorous comics, not least those by the late genius of the Beano, Leo Baxendale, to whom Talbot dedicates the book. From the Bash Street Kids to the Three Bears, Baxendale’s comedies abounded with anarchic humour and gags to be savoured on repeated readings. Talbot may play to our preconceptions about animals’ characteristics, casting a pig as a sexist circus strongman or a vulture to conduct an autopsy. But he can also exploit our prejudices, for example making us worry if LeBrock’s partner Detective Sergeant Roderick Ratzi can be trusted, or will reveal his “true” rat-like nature. He is not unaware of the unsettling surrealism of this animalist fantasy, such as in the opening scene in the kitchen of a fish restaurant, with its fish-headed chefs, waiters and clientele. Equally vital to the hybrid fusion of Grandville is the detective fiction genre. This grand finale is 60 pages longer than previous volumes, so Talbot has room to flesh out more of his characters’ back stories, particularly a flashback to LeBrock’s crucial apprenticeship under the master sleuth Stamford Hawksmoor, portrayed by an eagle in tribute to the aquiline nose of Sherlock Holmes. Talbot also unfolds several dynamic, largely wordless action sequences as our beleaguered badger pursues justice and vengeance, hounded by criminals and fellow police officers alike. One problem particular to graphic novels is their graphic immediacy, enabling readers to glean so much from merely a bookshop browse or a little peek ahead. So, in an inspired solution to avoid giving away twists and turns, the last 50 pages come wrapped in plastic, enshrouded inside a black removable sleeve or “Anti-Spoiler Seal (Patent Pending)”. Additionally, Grandville Force Majeure features a strong political undercurrent. Like Talbot, LeBrock’s roots are working class. Despite the supposed newfound equality in Grandville’s alternative Britain, post independence from its French rulers, the snobbish class system endures. As his mentor Hawksmoor warns, LeBrock will have to “be absolutely brilliant in order to overcome the mountain of prejudice in your path”. And the trail of corruption will lead LeBrock to society’s highest echelons. This graphic novel achieves an extraordinary balancing act of themes, tones and genres, full of mesmerising retro science fiction and crowned with an intense, sparky love story between badgers. In a witty self caricature, Talbot presents the fishy opportunist Byron Turbot, eager to rewrite LeBrock’s exploits for the “fifty centimes dreadfuls”. In contrast, while a live-action/CGI TV series has been proposed, the Grandville books end here and will never be overextended or farmed out as a franchise to others. Talbot is now collaborating with his wife Mary on reality-based graphic novels (Dotter of Her Father’s Eyes, about James Joyce’s daughter Lucia, won the 2012 Costa biography prize).

Hell must have frozen over","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I don’t even know how there would be industrial action in Ryanair,” the company’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, observed at its annual general meeting in Dublin less than three months ago. “There isn’t a union.” There is now. In fact, not merely one union, but several pilots’ unions from all over Europe will shortly be recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining with the airline. This is not simply a U-turn by O’Leary: it is a full loop-the-loop aerial extravaganza, with multicoloured vapour trails and a brass band playing in celebratory support. Industrial action by Irish pilots, set for this Wednesday, was suspended on Sunday evening. The company should be sitting down with representatives from the union Impact tomorrow. Unions from the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal should all now get talks to avoid strike action in those countries as well. Along with the usual refreshments served at such meetings, there ought to be a decent slab of humble pie for Ryanair’s management to consume. The company has resisted this for years. Doomsday must surely be near, because O’Leary has previously talked about hell freezing over or cutting off his arms before sitting down to deal with unions in this way. Management is going to have to change its tune. Pilots do not have a “difficult job”, O’Leary has said. They are “precious about themselves” and “full of their own self-importance”. (He later apologised for the remarks, and said they were aimed at pilots working for rival airlines.) Now his pilots and their representatives will have the chance to ensure their pay and conditions improve, in order to avoid a repeat of the recent embarrassment over cancelled flights and missing crew. Planes are just “buses with wings”, O’Leary has also observed. And here we get to the point about Ryanair and what has made it such a success. The company has called our bluff. We might moan about the indignities of travelling with it. We might balk at the apparent disdain the chief executive has for his staff and customers. But we keep coming back for more – even after thousands of flights were cancelled owing to the airline’s staffing problems. Their prices are low. Ryanair does not pretend to offer comfort or pleasure. It will fly you from one airport to another more cheaply than most of its competitors will. On a recent edition of the Radio 4 comedy show I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue, John Finnemore said that Ryanair’s real advertising slogan ought to be: “You knew what you were getting into.” The gag produced a big laugh of recognition. There is some sort of consumer cognitive dissonance going on here. Which? has just reported that Ryanair is the joint worst airline, according to its members. To which the company responds that it is also one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing airlines. Both claims can seemingly be true at the same time. The airlines business is pretty weird. Customers can be dragged screaming from an overbooked plane, as happened earlier this year on a United flight, yet airlines continue to trade and investors continue to hold their shares. It’s business as usual. Matt Levine, a commentator at Bloomberg, has even suggested that, since most big investors hold shares in all the major stockmarket listed airlines, they are pretty relaxed about how they treat customers as long as between them they continue to dominate the market and deliver returns. Normal competition this is not. It is all a very long way from the earlier glamour of the jet set and the aspirational image of international travel. Ryanair cabin crew have been told to try harder to flog more perfume and trinkets in the sky. And while piloting a plane was once seen as a dream job, as many as half of Ryanair’s pilots are not employees of the company at all, but agency staff, sometimes required to enter into intricate contractual arrangements with the airline. This has led to the pilots’ tax affairs being investigated by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. Now Ryanair’s approach has collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions. You still need pilots to fly planes – which is, of course, a difficult and highly responsible job. And the 21st-century solution that the company has chosen to get it out of its difficulties? Trade unionism, employee representation and collective bargaining. It’s just like the old days. O’Leary has adopted the crash position, and workers around the world will have noticed. • Stefan Stern is director of the High Pay Centre and co-author of Myths of Management"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/18/four-people-hospital-fire-hotel-banks-loch-lomond","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T14:12:29Z","webTitle":"Two people die and three in hospital after Loch Lomond hotel fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/18/four-people-hospital-fire-hotel-banks-loch-lomond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/18/four-people-hospital-fire-hotel-banks-loch-lomond","fields":{"headline":"Two people die and three in hospital after Loch Lomond hotel fire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two people have died and three more were treated in hospital after a fire took hold in a luxury hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond, Scotland. More than 200 guests were evacuated from the Cameron House hotel, near Balloch, as firefighters battled for about 12 hours to bring the blaze under control. Police Scotland confirmed one person died at the scene, while another died at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley. The Scottish ambulance service said two adults and one child – believed to be members of the same family – were taken to the Queen Elizabeth University hospital in Glasgow. They were released on Monday afternoon. Police said some other guests were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation. David McGown, the Scottish fire and rescue service’s assistant chief officer, said: “Our deepest condolences are with everyone who has been affected by this morning’s tragic events.” The fire had been brought under control by Monday evening, he said, praising the firefighters for their professional response. The alarm was raised shortly before 7am after the fire took hold in the main building of the hotel complex, the Scottish ambulance service said. “We dispatched four ambulances, our special operations response team and the trauma team to the scene,” a spokeswoman added. The hotel, which is on the west bank of the loch – about 17 miles north-west of Glasgow – said it would remain closed for at least two days. The BBC reported some staff members had only learned about the fire when they turned up for their shifts at the five-star hotel on Monday morning. One worker told the broadcaster she did not believe reports of the blaze until she saw it for herself. “It’s a really lovely hotel, I’m so sorry to see this,” she said. The hotel is one of the most luxurious in Scotland and has been used as a base by the Scottish national football team. It is also a popular wedding venue and houses the Michelin-starred Martin Wishart at Loch Lomond restaurant. A police spokeswoman said: “Officers … are working with other emergency services to establish the exact circumstances of the incident … A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.” Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/21/memoirs-polar-bear-yoko-tawada-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T10:30:04Z","webTitle":"Memoirs of a Polar Bear by Yoko Tawada review – dreamlike fictions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/21/memoirs-polar-bear-yoko-tawada-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/21/memoirs-polar-bear-yoko-tawada-review","fields":{"headline":"Memoirs of a Polar Bear by Yoko Tawada review – dreamlike fictions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The recent winner of the inaugural Warwick prize for women in translation, Tawada’s story, translated by Susan Bernofsky, consists of three novellas, originally written in German. Each explores one generation of a real-life family tree, that of Knut, the polar bear born in a Berlin zoo in 2006 who, while his babyhood cuteness lasted, was adored by the world. The first portrays the life of Knut’s Russian-born grandmother, the second that of his mother, Tosca, a circus performer. The third is Knut’s own story of the powerful bond he formed with his keeper, only to be separated from him when the bear’s size and power began to pose a danger. In spite of links to the real histories of the three animals (particularly Knut, whose short life was obsessively recorded), these are dislocated and dreamlike fictions that disturb expectations: it’s not so much that the bears can interact with humans, read newspapers and, in the case of Knut’s grandmother, write an autobiography, but that these magical scenarios do not add up to a “world”; rather, we are never allowed to forget that these are the imaginings of a writer who can change direction on a whim.

Desperate UK homeowners are cutting prices, says Zoopla Data from website Zoopla that says house prices are being cut by sellers desperate to shift them in a slowing market provoked much discussion on the site on Monday. ‘People are overdoing it and starting at a point where there are no offers’ I think unrealistic seller expectations have a lot to do with it. It has become standard practice to overvalue and expect to be haggled down – but people are overdoing it and starting at a point where there are no offers. My neighbours had their house on the market for over a year unsold. It was a big stone four bed for £1.3m. At the same time there was a 7 bed house with land and a small lake in the same village for sale at £1.2m. They have now sold – but only after coming down in increments to £900,000. I see the same pattern all over Oxfordshire. I think sellers often forget that, unless they are selling to a cash buyer, the mortgage lender will be the ultimate arbiter of what the house is worth. Therebedragons The childhood gift we always wanted – would it change our lives today? Many in the comments have enjoyed this feature, in which Guardian readers and writers discuss some of the gifts they never did get for Christmas. Not until now, at least. Here are some of your reactions. ‘My mum decided Trolls were evil’ The one that got away for me was a Troll doll. My mum (who was a devout Christian at the time) somehow decided they were evil. Never found anything else evil, just those. We laugh about it now, and she bought me one a few years ago. Looking back I don’t know how my parents managed to get me so much, because we never had money. I wasn’t too into fads (apart from the trolls) but still, Christmases (and birthdays) were never a disappointment. Not until I hit the awkward teenage years anyway. hellopixel ‘Every single year we’d highlight the Clairol Foot Spa in the Argos catalogue’ Me and my younger sister bought Christmas presents for our family from when I was about 8. We’d look through the Argos catalogue looking for our own stuff, but also what we could buy mum and dad. Every single year we’d highlight the Clairol Foot Spa. But for one reason or another, mostly it’s £34.99 price tag (and thus if we bought that we couldn’t get lots of other luxury items like Elizabeth Duke jewelry, Body Shop soaps, ice cream scoops and Hazelnut Whirls), we never did get them the blue plastic purveyor of clean, relaxed feet. PizzaRe When I was anxious and depressed, cycling put me on the road to happiness Charles Graham-Dixon has written about his experiences with mental health treatments, and finding cycling after a (successful) course of CBT and medication. ‘A form of meditation – simultaneously calming and exhilarating’ Similarly to the author, I took up cycling as a means to get fit and help myself out of depression and anxiety, starting from simply commuting to longer rides out of London. The benefits to your physical health are obvious (despite the odd unfortunate incident) but my mental health has seen the biggest change. Cycling became a form of meditation – simultaneously calming and exhilarating. When your mind is going a million miles an hour taking all the information in and you have a heightened awareness of your surroundings, for the duration you can switch off from everything else in life and become a little island of peace in a sea of impatience and aggression.

The Pentecostal pastor watches proudly as the players take part in an exercise drill, neatly passing the ball between themselves in a tight lattice before raining a quick succession of shots towards the hoop. Originally from Nigeria, Edomwaddoba is on the sidelines to watch his two sons, Victor and King, compete against the league leaders in an eagerly anticipated encounter. But the outcome of the game seems of little importance when taking into account the struggles the team has been through in order to participate at all. If anyone understands the notion of having to work hard to be a part of something, it would be Edomwaddoba, who, together with the other parents of the team and the rest of the forgotten community of immigrants who live in the Caserta area of Campania, just north of Naples. When a former Italian basketball champion, Massimo Antonelli, decided to start the team in the area, he had no idea that within a year they would inadvertently find themselves at the centre of a fierce political debate on what it means to be Italian. Until a month ago, the teenage players of the Tam Tam squad had been denied the right to compete against other teams in the regional league because their parents were immigrants and, as such, considered foreigners in the eyes of the law. In their endeavour to contest the decision to bar them a media storm erupted, disrupting practice and shining a light on Italian attitudes towards immigration and integration. The Tam Tam team take on rivals Caserta. Below: Destiny, Tam Tam’s playmaker, and below right: Wisdon in action. It was only last year when a handful of teenagers gathered on a cracked asphalt basketball court in the grounds of an abandoned holiday resort to start training for the first time. Founded in Castel Volturno, an area with 25,000 inhabitants of which 5,000 are registered migrants and many thousands more who are undocumented, the premise of the club is that it should be free to join. Antonelli has relied on support from his basketball peers to donate trainers and organise crowdfunding campaigns to sustain the team. This support helped turn an abandoned sports hall in the area into Tam Tam’s home court as well as purchase a team bus. Coastline with abandoned houses. Pineta Mare was a residential area built illegally in the 1960s by the Coppola brothers as the “Miami of the Med”, a place where aspiring middle-class Italians could buy a seaside home. A mass of buildings was erected swiftly along the coast. The resort lasted just long enough for the Camorra crime family and politicians to make a fortune. In 1975, it was seized by the state, leaving an abandoned labyrinth of concrete, twisted steel and a vast patch of asphalt where the Tam Tam basketball team would later make their first training ground. A player’s mother cheers on the team. To begin with, a mixed group showed up from different backgrounds but as the weeks went by players whose parents were born in Italy began to drop out, leaving just those whose parents were born in west Africa. Of those who remained, only two had previously been able to afford costly after-school sports activities. It took an hour to walk to training along the Domiziana dual carriageway, but if this was a deterrent for the “Italians”, the remaining players were not going to be put off. Soon, they were training three times a week and begging the coach for longer and longer sessions. As the winter nights closed in on the outdoor court, the players’ initial interest developed into diehard passion just as Antonelli had hoped. Little did they know the far-reaching consequences their sporting hunger would have. The team inside a minivan used to travel to games owing to the lack of public transportation. Below: Faisal and Star listen to music. Below right: Wisdon chats on his phone. As a team ready to compete in local tournaments emerged, Antonelli realised the challenge was not so much winning games but getting around the strict regulations imposed by the Italian Basketball Federation (FIP). The FIP was emphatic: only two foreign players per team. Consequently, when Antonelli tried to enrol his under-14s team in the league, his application was rejected. The young hopefuls were bruised by the exclusion, amplifying their marginalisation in a country still coming to terms with the changing sociodemographics caused by an increase in immigration over the last decade. Team-mates Honesty and Star walk through the streets before training at the local sport palace. Unlike the UK, the right to citizenship at birth – known legally as jus solis (the right of soil) – is still unapproved in Italy, denying children born of immigrant parents automatic citizenship. As it stands, only upon reaching 18 is it possible to make the long, fastidious and costly application for permanent citizenship and only if the applicant has never left the country for any length of time and has always had “residency” at a fixed address. However, the plight of the Tam Tam team has given face to those that suffer under the legislation and forced the issue back to the top of the political agenda. The debate is intensifying, as the Democratic party (PD) of the prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, had hoped to push through the change in legislation by the end of the year but did not have enough support to win a majority. Luigi Manconi, a DP senator who has accused Italy of “raising children to be half citizens”, has been on hunger strike over lacklustre support in the lead-up to Christmas. Meanwhile, the Northern League leader, Matteo Salvini, has been up and down the country promoting his anti-immigration party’s stance that “kids must prove Italy is their nation only when they become adults”. Worshippers attend Sunday Pentecostal mass in Castel Volturno. The local African community often gathers on Sundays in places of worship because of a lack of other venues to come together. Honesty, who is 13 years old, with his family. He and his siblings will have to apply for citizenship when they are 18 because of the ‘temporary’ status of their mother, Osas Fedina. Edomwaddoba has been in Italy for 22 years, jumping through the hoops necessary to obtain official citizenship. This means that his sons Victor and King will face a less difficult time applying for citizenship when they reach 18. However, many children are not so lucky. They inherit their parents’ “temporary” status, which results in an interminable struggle with the Italian state and constant, time-consuming visits to the immigration office to renew their costly residency permits – all while being treated like foreigners. The process is “a never-ending cycle of paperwork, uncertainty and isolation”, says Edomwaddoba despairingly. His players on the other hand just don’t like people thinking they are different. Matthew says it is “totally unjust” that he and others are not considered Italian, while Wisdom says: “If my friends see me as Italian, that means I am Italian.” The coach gives Tam Tam players a team talk during a game against Caserta. Aside from the Tam Tam basketball team, Castel Volturno is known for two things; a massacre of eight west Africans by the Casalese mafia in 2008 and a vast complex of illegally built apartment blocks and holiday villas, which now lie partially abandoned. The failed holiday resort, known as Villagio Copolla, has served as one of the main attractions in the region for destitute immigrants searching for somewhere to live. The presence of the mafia has meant work can be found in the shadows, while drug trafficking and sex work thrive along the notorious Strada Domiziana. Moreover, since the 1970s nearby tomato farms have provided informal cash-in-hand work. Underpaid and overworked, these immigrant workers are known to prop up Italy’s agro-economy. In an area where parents struggle to make ends meet and with no other opportunities for young people to distract themselves aside from the local Caritas community centre, the Tam Tam team has emerged as an important project for younger members of Castel Volturno’s immigrant community. One of the Tam Tam coaches, Andrea, helps the players with their shooting. In October Antonelli took the team’s plight to the authorities, using his sporting reputation to attract media attention which in turn applied the necessary pressure for the issue to be debated in parliament. He pushed Italy’s International Olympic Committee (Coni) to make a legal exemption so the team could play this season. By mid-November the players were on the court in match kit. However, the key to the triumph lies hidden within the dense Legge di Bilancio (public finance law). On 21 December parliament passed a small but significant bill entitled Save Tam Tam basketball team, changing sporting regulations so that all children born in Italy to “foreign parents” will be allowed to compete officially from 1 January. Some may reach the top of sport, perhaps like the Italian football international Mario Balotelli, who was born in Italy to Ghanaian parents but was only able to obtain full citizenship at 18. He too has had his “Italian-ness” questioned by the media even when he was the lead striker for Italy. The new legislation is one decisive move that may go towards a more inclusive society, but with the more far-reaching reforms to jus soli still yet to be approved, the government of Gentiloni still has a long way to go in making the estimated 1 million “new Italian” children, as the media have called them, feel at home. Star, 14, gets some dribbling practice in as he takes care of his two brothers, Alyha and Fatima (below, right) while their mother is out shopping at the supermarket. Ask Tam Tam player Kessy why he loves basketball so much and the 13-year-old says it makes him forget everything and feel free. Such sentiments point to sport’s capacity to heal and to build confidence, empowering young people as they prepare for adult life. However, the Northern League continues to exploit the growing immigration crisis in Italy by blocking legislative changes that would help safeguard the next generation. The party has sought to conflate and muddle the differences between immigrants who have just arrived and those born in the country. For the latter, this poses an impending challenge: they live and feel just as Italian as their peers but are not treated so by law or by society.

Faced with so many changes in such a short period of time, it’s all too easy to lose one’s bearings. That’s why, when it comes to taking stock in the dark days before the new year dawns, I find it helpful to restrict myself to cold, hard numbers. Below is my personal statistical index for 2017, using the latest obtainable figures: 0.42: number of years at present address. 23.8: number of years at previous address. 9: approximate man hours I’ve spent, since mid-July, searching for the nicer of our two bread knives, before accepting that it probably didn’t survive the move. 14: additional number of fruitless hours spent in search of, among other things, the paper tray attachment for the printer; my rear bike light; one of two electric whisk blades; the contents of my middle desk drawer; and all products and equipment related to the shining of shoes. It is perfectly possible to live without any of this stuff, if you can only teach yourself to stop wondering what happened to it all. I can’t. 11: average additional number of minutes I’ve had to factor into a simple excursion to the local shops, because everyone in Acton is so bloody friendly. 50+: approximate number of sound-effect options offered by the wireless doorbell designed to connect my new office shed with the outside world, or at least with people trying to deliver stuff to our front door. The selection includes a cock crowing, three doorbell noises and snatches of Happy Birthday, Greensleeves, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Für Elise, The Sailor’s Hornpipe, Oh My Darling Clementine, We Wish You A Merry Christmas, Yesterday Once More, Red Wing, The Wabash Cannonball and the William Tell Overture. The sheer range available should go some way to explaining why I took the battery out last week. 0: minor children under my care as of May 2017. 3: male adults under the age of 25 currently living with me anyway. 50/50: likelihood, on any given day throughout the whole of 2017, that one of the three male adults was wearing my trousers, or my shoes, or was at large in greater London while in possession of my Oyster card. 48: roughly the additional number of hours I have been obliged to pretend to work because there were workmen in the house through the autumn months. In my experience, it’s almost impossible to spend a Tuesday afternoon lying on a sofa watching Escape To The Country with a cup of tea on your chest when someone is plastering the ceiling above you. 1: number of dolphins I’ve spotted in the Thames in 2017, including any such sighting that I subsequently sought to characterise in print as an uplifting, even slightly magical encounter, despite the high probability that the dolphin in question would be found dead at some point between deadline and publication. Live and learn. 32: approximate number of individual ring-necked parakeets responsible for the rapid emptying of my wife’s three bird feeders (intended for native species only) despite her insistence that it is the work of a single bird, known to her as “the green bastard”. Her refusal to accept the multiple parakeet model means that she is now locked in a psychological battle of wills that she is destined to lose. 24: according to my old diary, the exact number of live dates the band I’m in played in 2017, which is not a lot if you’re our tour promoter, but which, it turns out, is more than enough if you are seeking to characterise me as a selfish, absentee spouse for the purposes of winning an argument about an unloaded dishwasher. 13: according to my new diary, the number of live dates the band I’m in already has scheduled for the first half of 2018, which, it turns out, is still more than enough if you want to start an argument about unloaded dishwashers of the future.

If this attack on civil liberties has escaped your attention, it’s probably because the people affected are homeless. Since the Brexit vote, the pro-remain media has been full of trepidation about how life will change once Britain leaves the EU in 2019 – and the impact on EU residents living in the UK. But the nightmare scenario – Brexit as a bonfire of social and legal protections – has already been a reality for many EU migrants in the UK. Since May 2016, immigration enforcement teams have been targeting migrants who sleep rough using intelligence provided by local councils, the police, and, most shockingly, some homelessness charities, including St Mungo’s and Thames Reach. That has had a real impact on some homeless people. One Polish man caught up in a raid in north London told us how he felt that some homeless charities were not to be trusted. “They pretend to help people,” he said, “but actually they gather information for the Home Office.” Rough sleepers from the EU have had their documents confiscated and told they have 28 days to “go home”. Others have been held in detention centres pending administrative removal. Britain is the only country in the EU that allows indefinite immigration detention, so some homeless people have been incarcerated for months while they try to prove their right of residence. The high court’s ruling on 14 December that the Home Office’s policy of detaining and deporting rough sleepers from the European Economic Area is unlawful is the culmination of a year of campaigning by the Public Interest Law Unit at Lambeth Law Centre and the organisation I work with, North East London Migrant Action. It feels like a depressing sign of the times that it took a court order to put a stop to such an obviously callous policy. The Home Office said the policy targeted migrants who came to the UK “with the intention of sleeping rough” and were thus abusing their right to free movement. This version of events has been rejected by the European Commission and the charity Crisis. Most of the homeless Europeans we support have lived in Britain for years. Some have British children. They are often skilled workers who have fallen on hard times. Anyone who thinks sleeping rough is a “choice” should spend a month at the sharp end of the UK labour market. Zero-hours contracts, rising rents and radical welfare cuts have not just created a new class of working poor; they’ve created a class of working people who become homeless. One man was detained while camping in a tent, despite showing the Home Office proof of employment. On zero-hours contracts, he and his partner simply couldn’t earn enough to rent a flat. Homelessness charities that share information with the Home Office claim they are acting in the “best interests” of rough sleepers by helping them return home. The testimonies we’ve gathered from EU rough sleepers speak against such careless paternalism. Spending months in Yarl’s Wood is not in anyone’s best interests. The man detained for sleeping rough spent 26 days in detention. “I saw women fainting and falling down,” he said. “I had money on my credit card and wanted to buy food and cigarettes, but they wouldn’t let me. We had to live on 71p a day. I felt like killing myself.” The High Court’s ruling is not just a judgment on the hostile environment created by the Home Office. It’s an indictment of a political class that views incarceration and deportation as a solution to the social problems caused by rampant inequality. Right-wing media coverage of our challenge argued that the Home Office’s policy reduced rough sleeping. Such logic is chilling. Reducing homelessness by deporting the homeless “works” only in the same way that reducing the benefits bill by leaving disabled people destitute “works”. Anecdotal evidence suggests some rough sleepers removed from the UK have later died on the streets in their country of origin. Being homeless is not a crime. Freedom of movement is not just for the rich. Such patent truths shouldn’t need repeating, but — now more than ever — they do. David Jones is an activist with North East London Migrant Action.

So, I hear you ask, what does that have to do with baroque Christmas music? In his book Playing With History, John Butt – keyboardist, Bach scholar, Glasgow University’s Gardiner professor of music, director of the Dunedin Consort – considers why we look back. The book was published in 2002 but its prescience is striking. Butt discusses the historically informed performance (HIP) movement – using period instruments and techniques – in the context of populist nationalism, climate change (“As we begin to perceive the limits of the earth’s resources, a culture of recycling becomes vital for our future survival”), and collective trauma (“The burgeoning of authoritative collected editions from 1950 might come in the wake of a war that had threatened to destroy virtually all the manuscript sources of western music”). You can see his point. We turn to an idealised past as refuge from the messy present. A Britain before immigration; a violin sound before vibrato. We invent versions of ourselves, our nations, or music, that were somehow purer and more “authentic” than the complicated reality of today. But which past? Whose past? Who gets to decide what it looked and sounded like? For decades, dominant factions of the HIP movement, mainly scholar-performers, hoped to find a kind of objective truth about the way music sounded in, say, Bach’s Leipzig of the 1730s. The instruments they played were exquisite and expensive, and all but the most specialist performers were excluded. The search for authenticity began as a revolution but became militant and intolerant, decrying any string player who wobbled on a phrase with too much passion. Times have changed. HIP is now taught in most conservatories, and the counterculture has become mainstream. Butt is one of many who recognise that the notion of absolute authenticity is dodgy; he acknowledges the impossibility of going back to the past. If HIP can be defended, he concludes, it’s only in the context of a culture “in which plurality is a fact of life”. For me, that plurality is the crux of it – and the work Butt does with the Dunedin Consort investigates the past not by narrowing down but by opening up. At this time of year the Dunedins, like most early music specialists, are occupied with two pieces – Handel’s Messiah and Bach’s Christmas Oratorio. At a performance of the latter in Perth, I was struck, as ever, by the lyricism and sinew of the instrumental playing, by the lean charisma of the eight voices. The choral sound didn’t always blend because the singers kept hold of their own personalities and nuances, so maybe it’s a shared ethos that synched them. Violinist Huw Daniel led with fierce attack. Soprano Mary Bevan sang with bite and grace. Tenor Hugo Hymas, still in his 20s, sang with great delicacy and a stunningly easy sound. It wasn’t the gripping storytelling of the Dunedins’ regular tenor, Nicholas Mulroy, but a more introverted, less urgent style that had real beauty. He’s a name to watch. Advent was a season of penitence for 18th-century Lutherans. The Christmas Oratorio – first performed on the days around Christmas, 1734 – would have come as a sumptuous sensory feast, and we should still feel that today. “One of the problems with historical performances of Bach,” Butt once told me, “is that many musicians take their atheism very seriously and therefore want to divorce themselves from anything too touchy-feely. There’s a sense that if one is moved by the emotions of this music then one is internalising its religiosity, and for many people that’s a no-no.” Butt himself has no tub-thumping message to impart (incidentally, he’s not a believer) but he is acutely aware of the emotions this music should trigger. Momentum, rhythm, pace, gait: I love the way Dunedin performances deal in the physical feel of tempos, and especially between tempos. Butt makes the transitions between movements really count, building up drama as the music lurches, sidesteps or mellows. Bach didn’t write any operas, but he knew how they worked. “He simply changes the operatic mechanism,” Butt says. “Instead of sucking the audience into the stage drama, he blows the action back out at us. Consciousness, interiority, belief … The individual becomes the stage.” There’s something ultimately inclusive about this. At the Dunedin’s Proms debut in August, Butt arrived early to rehearse the congregation – AKA the entire Royal Albert Hall audience – in a kind of hymn singalong, joining the chorales in the liturgy around St John Passion as would have been done in Bach’s day. The Lutherans knew the trick. Listeners will ingest an experience more deeply if they’re active rather than passive. Theirs was a culture of participation, and in his mission to recreate context as well as notes, Butt is bringing everyone in. Look to the past, yes, but realise its strength was its plurality. • Dunedin Consort perform Handel’s Messiah at Queen’s Hall, Edinburgh, on 19 December.

The site, in Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, spans about 50 acres. Each day, it receives more than 600 tonnes of waste from the capital and from the three million residents of its sprawling suburbs. People who work on the dump site collect metals, coal and plastic from among the chaotic mess of needles, rats, faeces and aborted babies. They are paid just 3,000 Malagasy ariary ( 70p) a day. Many families take it in turns to work a gruelling 10-hour shift: mothers and children during the day, men at night. Among the many dangers facing families is the plague, which spread to the capital in August. Across the country, around 2,400 cases of the disease have been reported. Randriamihavo, who sifts through rubbish at Ralalitra during heavy rain, says she doesn’t worry about the plague. “God will protect us,” she says. Asked about the worst thing she has seen in the dump, she replies: “I have come across aborted babies before – sadly it’s not unusual.” Isabel Rakotomiriana, 40, has been living and working at Ralalitra for more than 15 years. Her sister used to work alongside her, but left the site because she worried about the health of her five children. She now works at a porphyry mine where she earns 1,700 Malagasy ariary (40p) a day. The site is run by Service Autonome de Maintenance de la Ville d’Antananarivo (Samva), a private company that has a contract with the local authority. Each day, lorries bring heaps of rubbish for people to search through. Samva has been accused of trying to prevent journalists from entering the site to talk to local people. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Above, workers end a night shift on Ralalitra. There are rumours that a number of people have been run over by lorries after falling asleep on the site during their night shift, although there’s no suggestion that Samva bears any responsibility for this. Two fatalities have been reported by residents in the past two months alone. Woman sort through metals, coal and plastic before bagging them up to sell. Dogs sniff through the rubbish during a downpour. While the number of reported cases of the plague has steadily decreased over recent weeks, the World Health Organization has warned that new infections are more likely during the rainy season, which will last until the end of April. Doctors fear Ralalitra could become a breeding ground for the disease."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/18/thousands-protest-as-far-right-ministers-enter-government-in-austria","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T15:19:59Z","webTitle":"Muted protests in Vienna as far-right ministers enter Austria's government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/thousands-protest-as-far-right-ministers-enter-government-in-austria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/18/thousands-protest-as-far-right-ministers-enter-government-in-austria","fields":{"headline":"Muted protests in Vienna as far-right ministers enter Austria's government","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Austria’s president has sworn in a new government amid muted protests against the far right’s prominent role in the cabinet. At the weekend the new chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, of the Austrian People’s party, struck a deal with the Freedom party, a nationalist group founded after the second world war by former members of the Nazi party and now headed by Heinz-Christian Strache. The coalition deal makes Austria the only western European country with a far-right presence in government. At 31, Kurz is the youngest head of government in the world. Kurz’s People’s party won 32% of the vote in October’s elections, securing 62 seats in the 183-seat national council. The Freedom party came third with 26% of the vote and 51 seats. Police estimated that about 5,500 people attended protests in Vienna on Monday – a far lower number than the tens of thousands who turned out the last time the Freedom party entered government. On 19 February 2000, 150,000 Austrians took to the streets of Vienna to protest against the incoming government. On Monday, a heavy police presence of about 1,500 officers, helicopters and water cannon trucks blocked off the area around Hofburg Palace in the run-up to the swearing-in ceremony conducted by the Austrian president, Alexander Van der Bellen. As marches by students, feminists and anti-fascist groups converged at the central Heldenplatz Square, people brandished placards that read “Refugees welcome”, “Nazis out” and “No Nazi pigs”. Police fired a smoke grenade when some protesters tried to break through a barricade, an Agence France-Presse photographer said. Van der Bellen, who had previously said he would not swear in a government led by the Freedom party, prefaced Monday’s inauguration ceremony with only mild words of warning. He appealed to Kurz and Strache to exercise a respectful and civilised leadership and to heed the rights of minorities. “Our treatment of the weakest in society reveals what our values are really worth,” he said. Donald Tusk, the Polish president of the European council, said he looked forward to welcoming Kurz in Brussels. “I trust that the Austrian government will continue to play a constructive and pro-European role in the European Union,” he said. One of the few critical reactions came from the United Nations, whose rights chief said that Austria’s rightward lurch marked a “dangerous development … in the political life of Europe”. “I am very worried,” the UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, told AFP. The last time the Freedom party entered a coalition government, in 2000, the move was met with sanctions and outrage from Israel and across the EU.The coalition treaty agreed by the two parties vows to restrict illegal immigration and speed up deportation of refused asylum seekers, but also emphasises the state’s commitment to EU membership. “This is a coalition of two parties who want to actively shape Europe,” Kurz told Austrian TV over the weekend. A referendum on the issue of Austria leaving the EU, previously suggested by the Freedom party, has been explicitly ruled out. Kurz’s chancellory will oversee European affairs, and the foreign ministry post has been filled with an independent Middle East expert nominated by the Freedom party, Karin Kneissl. The Freedom party will control key posts in the new government, including the interior and defence ministries. Norbert Hofer, narrowly beaten by the Green-backed Van der Bellen in the presidential election in December 2016, will be in charge of infrastructure. The new interior minister, Herbert Kickl, a former speechwriter to the Freedom party’s ex-leader Jörg Haider, is the author of widely criticised campaign slogans such as “More courage for Viennese blood” and “Daham statt Islam” (“Home instead of Islam”). Kickl’s party and the Austrian People’s party have identified cash payments for asylum seekers as one of the key pull factors for illegal immigration into Austria: they plan to reduce benefits to €365 per month, with a top-up of an additional €155 “integration bonus”. Critics warn that switching to non-cash benefits could significantly increase state expenses in other areas, such as housing. Under rules proposed by the new government, those applying for asylum in Austria will also be required to allow authorities to access their mobile phones to verify their identity and migration routes, and hand over cash they have on them to fund their welfare. Trades unions and politicians from Austria’s Social Democratic party have criticised the new government’s commitment to relaxing restrictions around working hours. The two parties plan to raise the maximum working day from 10 to 12 hours and the maximum working week from 50 to 60 hours. “International comparisons show that the more progressive the location, the more flexible the working arrangements,” states their manifesto. While Kurz’s People’s party and the far right have agreed to expand voter participation in legislative matters, their plans do not match up to the Swiss model of “direct democracy” in the way the Freedom party had originally intended. Under their proposals, petitions with more than 100,000 signatures would be treated as legislative initiatives with guaranteed speaking time in national parliament. But a decision on whether such initiatives could also lead to national referendums has been postponed to 2022, the end of the coming legislative period. Even in its curtailed form, however, the plans could soon come back to bite the new government. A petition calling on Kurz to reinstate the smoking ban, which his government has decided to scrap, has already gathered more than 300,000 signatures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/20/world-of-dread-and-fear-bob-geldof-try-eating-catfish-lagos-bush-bar-band-aid-elnathan-john","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Call it a world of dread and fear, Geldof?

Try eating catfish in a Lagos bush bar","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s Christmas. How do I know? For many months I have been living in Berlin, capital of a Christian country governed – at least for now – by a politician from the Christian Democratic Union. I did not realise how much of a privilege this was, and how heightened my Christmas senses were because of living in Germany, until I listened to Bob Geldof’s song Do They Know It’s Christmas? First off, let me praise the writers of this song for updating it in 2014, to reflect the realities of our time, like Ebola, and for finally recognising such a thing as west Africa. Comparing both versions, my respect for Bob grew immensely. I will not comment on the old version, the same way I think you should not comment on a person’s previously dirty body after they have taken a bath and groomed themselves. The 2014 version of the song begins with the line: “It’s Christmas time, there’s no need to be afraid.” There is a lot to be afraid of as an African. One of the most prominent dates leading up to Christmas is Black Friday, which falls towards the end of November. On this day, people in developed countries perform a little ritual, similar to the gladiators of the Roman empire who entertained audiences in violent, often deadly confrontations. People queue up for days to buy cheaper versions of items they don’t need, fighting until they get them. I see the videos and I am afraid. When I am in Europe or America, I do not go out on Black Friday. Also, the snow used to make me afraid. Of losing my fingers to frostbite. But this song warms my heart and drives away all fear. The second line, sung by Ed Sheeran in 2014, reads: “At Christmas time, we let in light and we banish shade.” As an African, all I see around Christmas time is darkness. Night falls so quickly; without electricity, it would be really terrifying to have darkness as early as 4pm. Thank God for electricity. I think that is what Ed Sheeran meant. Electricity. In line three, Rita Ora sings: “And in our world of plenty, we can spread a smile of joy.” I really appreciate this line. Especially the word “spread”. I see plenty and joy spreading across my African back like butter softened by the African heat on fresh bread. Detractors may ask about poverty in inner city America or in Europe, but that wasn’t Ora’s point. The point is that the west has plenty and Africa doesn’t. Now forgive me, I don’t know the relationship between Emeli Sandé and the Elbow frontman Guy Garvey, but I want to combine their lines in this song: “At Christmas time it’s hard but while you’re having fun, There’s a world outside your window and it’s a world of dread and fear.” Now let’s not be anal about this and ask what window they are speaking of. They were just there to sing the song and raise money for people living in a world of dread and fear. The real question is, can we (and I have thought about this “we” and decided that, since living in the west has given me such great hope, I can include myself) talk about this world of dread and fear? Like the fear of pepper in Lagos bush bars that serve catfish? I saw this fear after I went out with an expat friend of mine in Lagos who mistakenly ordered catfish without telling the waiter not to add pepper. She turned completely red and had to go home to use the bathroom. I haven’t seen anyone that afraid before. I miss Lagos. I really love the next line, sung by Bastille’s Dan Smith: “Where a kiss of love can kill you”. Look, I know Dan was talking about Ebola, but can we not limit his words to an ordinary disease? Many of my gay friends cannot give a kiss of love in public in many parts of Africa. I know there are also parts of, say, America where that kind of kiss can cause you trouble, but that is not the point. The point is, how do we talk about killer Africa in a way that will make paradise west donate money and swallow Christmas turkey without guilt? Coldplay’s Chris Martin really hit the nail on the head: “And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom.” When I am in Africa, especially, all I can think of is doom. Especially when I am out at night. I wish doom for all those mosquitoes while I enjoy tilapia in pretty Accra. I really look forward to this song over Christmas. I don’t know if they will edit the it to reflect whatever disaster is happening on the continent, but I know it will be good. (Please don’t ask Bob to sing a song for Brexit or for poor Americans — we need him to focus on doom that matters.) God bless you as you download this track and donate to make Bob Geldof’s song great again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/18/spread-betting-shares-eu-european-securities-and-markets-authority-binary-options","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T09:51:38Z","webTitle":"Spread-betting firms' shares plunge as EU watchdog plans crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/18/spread-betting-shares-eu-european-securities-and-markets-authority-binary-options","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/18/spread-betting-shares-eu-european-securities-and-markets-authority-binary-options","fields":{"headline":"Spread-betting firms' shares plunge as EU watchdog plans crackdown","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A crackdown by the European regulator on high-risk online bets has sent shares in spread-betting firms plummeting. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said late on Friday it was considering a ban on the marketing, distribution or sale to retail clients of binary options, amid fears they are too risky for amateur speculators. Binary options allow speculators to bet on whether the price of financial indices such as a share index, commodity (like gold) or currency will rise or fall over a given period of time, often varying between 30 seconds and five minutes. ESMA is also considering imposing restrictions on the marketing, distribution and sale of contracts for difference (CFDs) to retail clients. Measures include imposing leverage restrictions, a guaranteed limit on client losses, restricting trading incentives such as bonus offers, and issuing standardised risk warnings. Shares in London-listed spread-betting firms plunged on the news. Plus500 fell more than 17%; CMC Markets was down nearly 14% in early trading and IG Group lost more than 12%. The European regulator said it had been concerned about the provision of speculative products such as CFDs, including rolling-spot foreign exchange products and binary options, to retail clients “for a considerable period of time”. Some national authorities have already cracked down on the sector, but ESMA said it “remains concerned that the risks to investor protection are not sufficiently controlled or reduced”. The Financial Conduction Authority, Britain’s financial watchdog, recently announced it would regulate binary options for the first time from January. It warned that the majority of consumers lose money on binary options. There have been been a reported 2,605 victims who lost £59.4m on binary options scams since 2012. The FCA will take over the regulation of binary options from the Gambling Commission from 3 January. The FCA said it “supports ESMA in its consideration of potential EU-wide product intervention”. It added: “Our domestic policy work on permanent product intervention measures applicable to firms offering CFDs and binary options to retail clients is ongoing. Any permanent FCA policy measures would take into account any prospective ESMA measures.” ESMA will conduct a brief public consultation in January. Any measures would apply for three months but could then be renewed. Plus500 welcomed the “strong regulatory framework that this will bring to the industry”. It said it had never offered binary options and removed its bonus schemes for the vast majority of its operations in January. IG said it “seeks to only accept clients who understand the risks involved with its products and how they operate”. The firm said the measures would not have a significant financial impact on its business in the current financial year, but that it was hard to assess the longer-term impact. It stopped offering its Sprint binary product to new retail clients in January, and revenue from binaries traded in the UK and EU was less than 5% of the company’s revenues in the first half. IG welcomed most of the measures, but said the leverage restrictions under review were “disproportionate and go beyond what is needed to protect consumers from poor outcomes associated with excessive leverage”. It warned that this could push punters to trade CFDs with unregulated firms based outside the EU. Rival CMC said: “Fair client outcomes have always been a focus, with margin close-out and standardised risk warnings already in place throughout the group.” It said the ban on binary products would not have a material impact on its business, as they only generated £2.1m of revenues in the first half of 2018: “Proposed margin changes are likely to have an impact on how clients trade, although at this stage it is not possible to quantify the impact.” The firm focuses on wealthier clients and says it has one of the highest revenue per client in the industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/18/merkel-to-meet-berlin-attack-survivors-as-anniversary-puts-failings-in-focus","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T06:00:52Z","webTitle":"Merkel to meet Berlin attack survivors as anniversary puts failings in focus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/merkel-to-meet-berlin-attack-survivors-as-anniversary-puts-failings-in-focus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/18/merkel-to-meet-berlin-attack-survivors-as-anniversary-puts-failings-in-focus","fields":{"headline":"Merkel to meet Berlin attack survivors as anniversary puts failings in focus","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Angela Merkel is to meet bereaved relatives and survivors of last year’s Berlin Christmas market attack for the first time, two weeks after they sent her an angry letter accusing her of political inaction and failing to acknowledge their suffering. The German chancellor will meet the group in her office in Berlin on Monday, a day before the anniversary of the attack. Her spokesman Steffen Seibert said Merkel had felt “the greatest respect” on reading their letter, in which she was accused of a dereliction of duty. He said the victims’ outpouring of their grievances showed “how useful and urgent this meeting is”. Twelve people died in the attack on 19 December, in which Anis Amri, a Tunisian whose asylum application had been turned down months before, drove a lorry at speed into the Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz. Almost 100 people were injured, many of them in life-changing ways. It was Germany’s first major Islamist-inspired terrorist attack. The victims included the lorry’s Polish driver, whom Amri shot before he took over the controls. Amri was shot dead by Italian police in a suburb of Milan four days after the attack. In the letter to Merkel, the victims set out a range of grievances over their treatment, including “the lack of counter-terrorism in Germany, as well as the way we as victims and bereaved have been dealt with”. In the year since the attack, they wrote, “we note that you have not shared your condolences with us either in person or in writing. In our opinion this means that you have failed to live up to your office.” They accuse Merkel’s government of failing to address systemic shortcomings that had allowed Amri, who arrived in Germany during the refugee wave in 2015, to apply for asylum numerous times and to remain at large despite the fact he had been classified by security forces as a high-level threat and had a criminal record for drug dealing. “At a time when the threat posed by dangerous Islamists has greatly increased, you have failed to push ahead with expanding resources and reforming the confused official structures for fighting these dangers,” they wrote. In what was widely interpreted as her acknowledgement of the grievances, Merkel visited the site of the attack last Monday, speaking to stallholders at the market and thanking those who had risked their lives to come to the aid of those hit by the truck and by falling debris. “Frau Merkel has behaved shabbily towards us,” said Sigrid Rheinsberg, who lost her daughter, Dorit Krebs, 53, in the attack. Her husband, Hans-Georg, said: “Frau Merkel embraced the refugees but has put us at arm’s length. We’ve been completely ignored.” The couple told Der Spiegel they felt strongly that the German state was complicit in Amri’s murderous act. “The state should bear part of the blame,” Sigrid Rheinsberg said, referring to multiple errors made by the authorities. “It wasn’t the perpetrator, but it is complicitous.” Rami Elyakim, an Israeli who lost his wife of 40 years, Dalia, and who was badly injured himself, said he had been appalled to learn of the catalogue of errors made leading up to the attack. “An Islamist with 14 different names allowed to move about freely?” he said in an interview, referring to the authorities’ repeated failures to apprehend Amri. “They could have put him in prison or at least been on his trail.” Elyakim said his medical treatment had been excellent but that he had received pitifully little financial support from the German state. He had had to depend on help from the Israeli state, which had acknowledged him as a victim of terror, he said. “Germany has done nothing,” he told the newspaper Bild. Many of the victims say that on top of having to wade through a bureaucratic minefield, they have struggled financially and have received paltry compensation payments. Some have taken out bank loans to cover the rents and mortgages of those who died or on behalf of those so badly injured they can no longer work. Almost all the bereaved complained that they had no letter of condolence from the German state and that the first official recognition they had received that their loved ones were dead was a bill from the institute of forensic medicine demanding a fee of €51, payable within 30 days, for certifying the cause of death. “I didn’t want to believe it myself,” said Kurt Beck, an MP for the Social Democrats. “But I saw one of these letters with my own eyes.” Beck, who was appointed as official representative of the victims and bereaved in February, acknowledged the catalogue of errors made by state organisations before and after the attack in a report published last week. He has recommended a long list of improvements, including better communication with victims and much higher compensation payments. Most victims have so far received little more than €10,000, and only then after going through a highly bureaucratic application process. Beck said a department should be set up within the justice ministry to act as a coordination centre to deal with any future attacks. “The government cannot leave the injured and bereaved to deal with the situation themselves,” Beck said. “What’s most important is to help them out in their hour of need, to not have them running from pillar to post trying to establish the facts and what they’re entitled to.” On Tuesday, the anniversary of the attack, officials and survivors will gather to unveil a memorial to those killed. Relatives will be invited to fill with liquid gold a 14-metre-long gash indicating the path the lorry took, and symbolic of the scar that remains, according to officials. The steps leading up to the Memorial Church, which was bombed during the second world war and remains in large part a ruin as a deliberate reminder of the horrors of war, will be engraved with the names of the victims and their countries of origin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/17/west-bromwich-albion-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T16:08:30Z","webTitle":"West Bromwich Albion 1-2 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/17/west-bromwich-albion-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/17/west-bromwich-albion-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"West Bromwich Albion 1-2 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Manchester United go 11 points behind Manchester City, goals in the first half from Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard enough to secure a narrow victory. West Bromwich Albion stay 19th despite a belated attempt at a fightback, but at least they did a goal through Gareth Barry. Thanks for reading and emailing. That’s all from me. You can follow Bournemouth v Liverpool with Danny Harris here. Peep! Peep! Peep! 90 min+4: United appear to have eaten up the time. Rondon’s booked. 90 min+2: A punt from left to right finds Lukaku one on one with Evans. He tries a stepover before pulling a poor shot wide with his right foot. 90 min+1: Four minutes of added time. Hegazi hoicks a deep cross to the far post. It’s headed down and Barry’s shot is blocked! It might have been going in. 88 min: United could do with full-time now. They were coasting for so long that they’re struggling to respond now that West Brom have stirred. 87 min: Rondon turns on the left and curls a cross to the far post. Rojo swings and Lukakus at it, almost sending the ball past De Gea! A corner’s awarded. Though Rojo’s claiming he didn’t touch it. His appeals are ignored. The corner’s whipped in by Brunt again. De Gea misses his punch and the ball bounces off Matic - and back into the grateful clutches of De Gea! Barry tries to nick it off him and seems to catch United’s goalkeeper, leading to a disagreement between the pair. Anthony Taylor sorts it out. 86 min: Scott McTominay replaces Jesse Lingard. 85 min: Gibbs whips a cross into the area from a deep position on the left and Rodriguez’s free header flashes just wide, with De Gea rooted to the spot! What a chance for West Brom to equalise. 84 min: Rondon hustles and bustles to win a corner for West Brom on the left. Brunt’s deep delivery is headed back into the middle by Rodriguez and cleared by United, who are under pressure now. 81 min: United have been lax since half-time. They’ve brought this on themselves - not that West Brom are in the habit of scoring two whole goals in one game. They are pressing, though, and De Gea has to save Rodriguez’s shot from the edge of the area. 79 min: Anthony Martial replaces Marcus Rashford. Hang on! Just as everyone was nodding off, West Brom score the first goal of the Pardew era! They’d won a corner on the right after Rondon’s shot was deflected over; Brunt swung it deep to the far post, Hegazi headed down, Evans made a nuisance of himself and Barry controlled before swivelling to turn the ball past De Gea from six yards! The Hawthorns has cheered up a bit. 75 min: Brunt boots a shot over with his right foot from 20 yards. 74 min: Brunt slips a pass through to Rondon, who shoots timidly at De Gea. This side is utterly bereft of confidence. The Hawthorns is miserable at the moment. 71 min: McClean fruitlessly chases after a flick-on. Young, trying to usher it back to De Gea, leans into him and sends him careering into the United goalkeeper, who’s winded for a moment or two. West Brom make their final change, Chris Brunt replacing the disappointing Krychowiak. 66 min: Rojo’s introduction was delayed because he wasn’t ready, much to his annoyance, but he’s finally on. 65 min: Antonio Valencia has picked up an injury. Marcos Rojo is coming on. Ashley Young has gone to right-back. 64 min: Jay Rodriguez replaces Oliver Burke, who did not scare Manchester United. 60 min: Nyom picks up a booking for tugging Rashford back while that counter was developing. “Won’t someone…anybody… (Santa maybe?) make Lukaku smile for Christmas?” asks Justin Kavanagh. “Between him and his dour, sour manager, Manchester United has become a refuge for Scrooges this season. Bah, humbug!” 59 min: A flowing United counterattack ends with Lukaku brilliantly backheeling into the path of Lingard, who rams his shot straight at Foster from 18 yards. That would have been a vintage United goal. Is there a more underrated player in the league than Lingard? 57 min: Valencia’s cross from the right reaches Rashford, who slashes a snapshot wide, much to the merriment of the home fans. 55 min: Burke charges on to a long ball down the right and hooks a lovely ball into the middle. Rondon and McClean both throw themselves at it, but neither can make proper contact and the ball’s scrambled away. 54 min: Barry rolls a shot straight at De Gea from 20 yards. 52 min: West Brom seem to have absolutely no clue about how they might create a chance. United look likelier to score a third. Rashford tries to wriggle past Hegazi, only to go down clutching his face. He stays down for a while - Hegazi put an arm across him. Eventually he gets up and the pair engage in a philosophical debate. It’s instigated by Rashford, so he gets a yellow card. 49 min: Rashford dinks a pass through to Lukaku, but the flag goes up for offside. 46 min: Off we go again. Manchester United get the second half underway. West Brom have made a change, Gareth Barry replacing Claudio Yacob, and they start the half encouragingly, Gibbs shooting wide from the edge of the area. These are worrying times for Pardiola. 45 min+1: There will be one added minute. United have a corner on the right. Mata takes it and Foster punches it unconvincingly to the edge of the area. Young’s shot is charged down. 44 min: Livermore takes aim from 25 yards. De Gea dives low to his right to make a comfortable save. 43 min: Was the Wembley dance the high point of Alan Pardew’s life? 39 min: United are playing with wonderful confidence now. They could fill their boots if they keep going. They were too cautious before the first goal, but a blend of sharper passing and movement is turning this an ordeal for West Brom. 37 min: This probably won’t happen, but West Brom will be bottom if Swansea win at Everton tomorrow. Game over. Probably. Jesse Lingard finds space 20 yards from goal and has a dig. It’s not the best effort, but Hegazi hangs out a leg and his intervention takes the ball spinning to Foster’s right, with the goalkeeper already committed to his left. 34 min: Cafu Nyom livens West Brom up with a surprising piece of skill that takes him freewheeling past two United players on the right. Here’s a chance for the hosts! Nyom slams a low cross into the middle, intriguing Rondon, but Smalling’s also alert and his challenge denies the striker. The ball squirts around the six-yard box, but Valencia hoofs it away before McClean can pounce. 31 min: Burke has been quiet, but this is an improvement from the young winger, who charges through the middle, only to tempt Smalling into a challenge when he had Rondon free to his right. 30 min: What are West Brom going to do now? They’ve not had a shot on target yet and haven’t scored a goal under Alan Pardew yet. 29 min: Lukaku’s celebration might be termed the anti-Arnautovic. Ask and you shall receive. This has more or less come out of nothing, though United had just stepped up the threat in the last minute or so. Rashford shifts the ball on to his right on the left and whips a dangerous cross into the six-yard box, where the unmarked Lukaku rises to glance a powerful header into the top left corner. He elects not to celebrate again, though that’s probably down to respect for West Brom. 27 min: How about a shot? 25 min: Krychowiak’s delivery is substandard again, struck with too much oomph, and Evans is moving backwards as he sends a header over. 24 min: Herrera, who’s come in for criticism lately, clips McClean in the middle. West Brom take the free-kick quickly, moving it out to Gibbs on the left. His cross is deflected and De Gea can’t stop it going out for a corner. 23 min: Oliver Burke hasn’t scared Manchester United yet, but then he hasn’t had the ball yet either. This is not a good game. 21 min: There’s no way that Anthony Martial would be of any use here. 18 min: Rondon miscontrols a pass, spooning it out for a throw. The entertainment levels are low at the moment. 14 min: Young whips a cross to the far post, looking for Lukaku, but Gibbs does superbly to stay with the Belgian, despite the height disadvantage, and get his head to the ball. It loops up into the air, tempting Lukaku to challenge Foster, but he fouls the West Brom goalkeeper. 12 min: This is much better from the hosts now. They looked nervous in the first 10 minutes, but they’re beginning to play their part in this, winning their first corner on the left. Krychowiak’s delivery is awful, though. 11 min: West Brom embark on another sortie, Rondon muscling through the middle, but the forward’s pass to Livermore is overhit and forces the midfielder too wide on the right. He’s crowded out. 9 min: West Brom break for the first time, Rondon opening United up down the left with a smart backheel to McClean, who surges away. The winger hasn’t got much support, though, and his firm centre is too hard for Burke to control. 8 min: Young’s corner is headed away by Hegazi. 7 min: England’s Jake Livermore dithers on the edge of his own area and attempts to dribble out of trouble, only for Lingard to pick his pocket and win a corner. 6 min: United are in complete control. A poor clearance goes straight to Young, who looks like he’s going to cross. But no. Instead he disguises a perceptive pass through to Mata, whose low centre has to be hacked away. West Brom are struggling to get out of their half. 5 min: A long ball finds Rashford on the left. He cuts inside, breaking into the area again, but his shot’s blocked. 4 min: “I only saw Burke play a few times for Forest and have been looking forward to him getting a start,” says JR in Illinois. “He looked big and really fast with some tricks as well and that was two years ago when he was 18. He certainly seems capable of scaring United on the wing. Not in the same way McClean scares people, mind. Come on you Baggies. Oh man do I hope they stuff Mourinho.” 2 min: United have settled quickly, taking control of possession and pushing West Brom back. Lukaku and Rashford indulge in a spot of head tennis on the edge of the area, the latter almost bursting through on goal before Evans hooks clear. Peep! West Brom, kicking from right to left in the first half, get the game underway. The Manchester United fans are making a lot of noise. Here come the teams! West Brom are in their blue and white stripes, Manchester United are in red shirts and black shorts. Alan Pardew says that Oliver Burke’s orders are to scare Manchester United - and he won’t last long if he doesn’t. “He reminds me a bit of Zaha.” I’ve never seen Burke play. What do we think of him? Pre-match reading “Herrera needs a performance today,” says Christopher Faherty. “He’s been terrible in the bigger games this season, and whenever he’s been subbed on to close out a match he’s not done anything towards that, he doesn’t seem to get around the pitch as easily this season and his passing is very humdrum now. If McTominay keeps going the way he’s going he’ll have his lunch quick enough.” Jose Mourinho speaks! He’s asked about his team selection. “We think a match at a time. I am not rotating, I am not protecting players for what is coming, I am just trying to play the team that we think is the best team for this match. And what of West Brom? “The biggest danger is the fact that they need points because they are in a difficult position and they need points. The stadium is always difficult because their crowd is so supportive and enthusiastic. Then the qualities and experience of the players, they are very experienced and physical, capable to defend well with a lot of bodies, but at the same time to be dangerous with direct football with people like Rondon and McClean.” And what about being 14 points behind Manchester City? He’s asked whether United have to do their job in isolation. “You told the question and the answer.” Bye Jose! Alan Pardew has mostly kept faith with the players who held Liverpool at Anfield. Only one change for West Brom, Oliver Burke replacing Hal Robson-Kanu. Manchester United make three changes to the side that beat Bournemouth 1-0. Ashley Young replaces Luke Shaw at left-back, Scott McTominay makes way for Ander Herrera and Marcus Rashford comes in for Anthony Martial. Paul Pogba is still suspended. West Brom: Foster; Nyom, Hegazi, Evans, Gibbs; Yacob, Livermore, Krychowiak; Burke, Rondon, McClean. Subs: Myhill, McAuley, Brunt, Barry, Field, Robson-Kanu, Rodriguez. Manchester United: De Gea; Valencia, Jones, Smalling, Young; Herrera, Matic; Mata, Lingard, Rashford; Lukaku. Subs: Romero, Lindelof, Rojo, Shaw, McTominay, Martial, Ibrahimovic. Referee: Anthony Taylor On this day in 2016, West Bromwich Albion hosted Manchester United at the Hawthorns. The Baggies were in terrific form. Salomón Rondón had scored a fine hat-trick in a win over Swansea City three days earlier and all the talk was about whether Tony Pulis’s side might be capable of challenging for a European spot. Only four points separated them and United at the start of play, after all, and West Brom were still feeling optimistic even after being put to the sword by Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s smart double. The Pulis Pragmaticos were sitting pretty in seventh place, seven points off a European spot and nine above the bottom three, and they were almost becoming the very definition of Premier League stability. But what a difference a year makes, even though 2017 did start quite well for West Brom. They went out of the FA Cup early, because Pulis, but all was well when they closed February with a win over Bournemouth that took them to … 40 points. Dun-Dun-Duuuuuuuun!!!!!!!! At which point: commence the slide. Barely anything has gone right since then. They ended last season with one win from their last 12 games – a 3-1 victory over Arsenal in March – to finish 10th, miles off the European places, and despite some promising summer signings, Pulis proved incapable of exterminating the malaise. It simply got worse (more boring) and the safest pair of hands in England had turned into a butterfingered mess by the time West Brom decided that their club shop could stand the drop in profits that would come from sacking Pulis. Something had to be done. A hero was required, a breath of fresh air, a silver-haired smoothball with a proud track record of making everything slightly more exciting for a short while. There was only one man. And who could else it be but Alan Pardew? No one else, that’s who! But the famous Pardew bounce hasn’t quite materialised yet. West Brom are still waiting for their first goal under their new manager, who has picked up two points from his first three games, and they find themselves in trouble before hosting United this afternoon. Yesterday’s results largely conspired against them, leaving Pardew’s strugglers in 19th place and two points off the promised land of 17th, and it probably won’t have cheered them up to see their grumpy old loanee, Romelu Lukaku, end his goalscoring drought against Bournemouth on Wednesday night. They could do without see another non-celebration from Lukaku here. United, however, are also desperate for a win. They shouldn’t assume this will be easy – West Brom held The Most Exciting Team That Ever Existed to a goalless draw at Anfield on Wednesday and have too many solid professionals to be dismissed as an incompetent mess – but they know that nothing but three points will do if they are to have any chance of stopping me from referring to the title race as the title “race”. United begin 14 points behind Manchester City and there can be no bus-parking from them here. Mind you, they were 13 points behind Chelsea at the top of the league this time last year, so at least United are showing signs of improvement under Mourinho. Kick-off: 2.15pm (GMT)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/17/ashes-fourth-test-day-three-australia-england-root-starc","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T10:21:56Z","webTitle":"England on the edge of series defeat as Australia tighten grip on the Ashes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/17/ashes-fourth-test-day-three-australia-england-root-starc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/17/ashes-fourth-test-day-three-australia-england-root-starc","fields":{"headline":"England on the edge of series defeat as Australia tighten grip on the Ashes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A tempestuous Sunday in Perth ended with England on the brink of surrendering the Ashes. A fierce, winter wind blew all day, which had players digging into their cases for sweaters. The candlelight carols down by the river Swan were cancelled in the morning – there was certainly no chance of any candles staying alight and there were more serious concerns that the stage and the lights would be blown away. To the despair of England fans at the Waca the disruption to the cricket was surprisingly brief. Sometimes there was sun, sometimes showers and always that wind howling across the ground. Amid the gales Australia inexorably tightened their grip, declaring with a lead of 259 and then making clinical incursions into England’s batting like an expert surgeon. At the close the tourists were 132 for four, still 127 runs away from making Australia bat again. Already England’s experienced men were back in the pavilion with a pair of 14s, no more use to the team than they are in pontoon. Alastair Cook’s tour, despite all the toil – but no sweat – in the nets has yet to take off, while Joe Root’s Australian expedition took another turn for the worst. Of the four batsmen dismissed Root’s departure was the most exasperating. Perhaps the strain on the captain is telling, with the expedition on the brink of failure. In his eagerness to assert himself at the crease Root chased the first delivery bowled by Nathan Lyon in the innings – the widest he has bowled in the series – and he was caught behind. He may, like Cook four years ago, be appreciating how lonely a job his can be. Unsurprisingly the pitch looked a little livelier when the Australian bowlers took the field after resting up for the best part of two days. Mark Stoneman fell, caught behind, for his first single-figure score of the series in Hazlewood’s first over. Cook clipped two leg-side boundaries and looked sharp enough until a leading edge went back down the pitch, where an inspired Hazlewood dived to his right before completing a brilliant one-handed catch. Out came Root, steeling himself to regain the initiative. As ever he began busily, whereupon Steve Smith summoned Lyon on a pitch that has been no more helpful to spinners than an umbrella in a hurricane – incidentally it seems that umbrellas are the latest item to be banned from Australian cricket grounds. Lyon’s first ball was speculative, wide and on a good length, a nice sighter for the batsman, except that Root chose to drive it. The edge clipped the gloves and knee of the wicketkeeper before landing gently in the hands of a jubilant Smith at slip. That England avoided an immediate subsidence was down to James Vince and then a plucky partnership between the first-innings heroes, Dawid Malan and Jonny Bairstow. Vince batted in princely fashion with barely an error. Twelve boundaries fizzed from his bat in his 55 but then he was bowled by Starc. On this occasion Vince was blameless since he was the recipient of the ball of the series, which cut from leg to off as if delivered by Derek Underwood in his pomp but 25 mph quicker. There was absolutely no disgrace in this dismissal. Thereafter Malan and Bairstow dug in impressively with few frills except when Malan took four authentic boundaries off an over from Pat Cummins. Despite the cracks appearing down the middle of the pitch – as is usually the case here – fluent strokeplay was still possible on this surface. Play was abandoned soon after 5pm when the heaviest shower blew over, with England hoping for more of the same on the fifth day. Oddly the fourth one began better than England could have hoped given that Australia started it on 549 for four. Mitchell Marsh was lbw to Jimmy Anderson’s second delivery; then Smith, after a cunning review, departed in the same way as England’s premier bowler conjured a little movement from the Prindiville stand end. The titans of Saturday were mortal after all. Then Starc was stranded mid-pitch and Australia had lost three wickets for 12 runs. They were still 158 runs ahead but the complexion of the game had changed. Perhaps the old ball was reversing a little, which might justify not taking a new ball for an over or two. But it is hard to explain why Root and, more pertinently, his two senior bowlers declined to take it once Tim Paine and Cummins had begun to settle. So here was a case of England’s two senior new-ball bowlers not wishing to bowl with a new ball. There was a risk attached: the hard and shiny new ball can fly. But there was also a potential reward: the new ball against lower-order batsmen might produce the three quick wickets required to keep Australia’s lead under 200. The old guard was not prepared to take that risk. Sometimes old-pro canniness can give way to negativity; sometimes Root may be required to challenge the wisdom of the seasoned duopoly. So the Australian pair were able to add 93 as England, with the soft old ball in their hands, settled for damage limitation rather than the pursuit of wickets. The decision to persist with the old ball was a declaration of non-intent. After lunch Cummins became the third lbw victim for Anderson and then Lyon holed out to his third ball. Anderson remains England’s best bowler but this must have been the least satisfying four-wicket haul of his career. From the depths of 561 for seven Australia were able to declare on 662 for nine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/18/scientists-have-beaten-down-the-best-climate-denial-argument","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Scientists have beaten down the best climate denial argument | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/18/scientists-have-beaten-down-the-best-climate-denial-argument","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/18/scientists-have-beaten-down-the-best-climate-denial-argument","fields":{"headline":"Scientists have beaten down the best climate denial argument","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Climate deniers have come up with a lot of arguments about why we shouldn’t worry about global warming – about 200 of them – but most are quite poor, contradictory, and easily debunked by consulting the peer-reviewed scientific literature. The cleverest climate contrarians settle on the least implausible argument – that equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS – how much a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase Earth’s surface temperature) is low, meaning that the planet will warm relatively slowly in response to human carbon pollution. But they have to explain how that can be the case, because there are a lot of factors that amplify global warming. For example, a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, which is itself a greenhouse gas, adding further warming. Warming also melts ice, leaving Earth’s surface less reflective, absorbing more sunlight. There are a number of these amplifying ‘feedbacks,’ but few that would act to significantly slow global warming. Clouds are one possible exception, because they both act to amplify global warming (being made of water) and dampen it (being white and reflective). Which effect wins out depends on the type of cloud, and so whether clouds act to accelerate or slow global warming depends on exactly how the formation of different types of clouds changes in a hotter world. That’s hard to predict, so many contrarians have wishfully argued that clouds will essentially act as a thermostat to control global warming. Research suggests if anything, clouds amplify global warming A new study published in Nature by Stanford scientists Patrick Brown and Ken Caldeira found that so far, the global climate models that best simulate the Earth’s global energy imbalance tend to predict the most future global warming. These results suggest the ECS is around 3.7°C. This is higher than the previous best estimate of 3.1°C, and if correct, would shrink our carbon budget by about 15%. The study found that the biggest contributor to the difference between the accurate and inaccurate models was in how well they simulated cloud changes. And while it’s just one study, several prior papers arrived at similar conclusions. For example, a 2010 study published in the Journal of Climate found that climate models that most accurately simulate recent cloud cover changes in the east Pacific point to an amplifying effect on global warming and thus a more sensitive climate. Another 2010 study by Andrew Dessler using satellite observations showed that in the short-term, clouds likely amplify global warming, though the long-term effect may be different. In 2012, a paper published in Science by John Fasullo and Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research found that similar to the new Nature study, climate models that most accurately simulated observed cloud changes are also the ones that are most sensitive to the increased greenhouse effect. Similarly, a 2014 paper published in Nature found that the least sensitive climate models incorrectly simulate water vapor being drawn up into the atmosphere to form clouds in a warmer world. In reality, as lead author Steve Sherwood explains in the video below, scientists observe water vapor being pulled away from those higher cloud-forming levels of the atmosphere. Contrarian arguments have not withstood scientific scrutiny Former MIT scientist Richard Lindzen (one of the most often cited, and most often wrong contrarian climate scientists) was among the first to argue that clouds act as a climate thermostat. He developed a hypothesis in 2001 that as the atmosphere warms, the area covered by cirrus clouds will contract like the iris of an eye to allow more heat to escape into space, thus slowing global warming. His ‘iris hypothesis’ was quickly disproved by subsequent research, but that hasn’t stopped climate contrarians from continuing to make the argument. More recently, other contrarian scientists have used a combination of climate models and recent observational data to similarly argue that Earth’s climate is relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect (they call these “observational estimates” of ECS). This group often likes to refer to themselves as ‘lukewarmers,’ but really they just cherrypick this one way to estimate ECS because it seemed to yield a relatively low result, while ignoring the other methods that point toward a significantly more sensitive climate. Over the past two years, climate scientists have identified several flaws in the method that yielded lower estimates of ECS. At this year’s American Geophysical Union conference – the largest gathering of climate and Earth scientists every December – there was a session devoted to this very topic. As one of the presenting climate scientists Andrew Dessler put it: There’s still significant uncertainty about how clouds will respond to global warming, but the evidence points to an amplifying effect, or at least not a significant dampening. The new Nature study adds to the mountain of evidence ruling out the contrarian argument for an insensitive climate. Clouds aren’t going to save us; only rapid cuts in carbon pollution can do that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/16/mark-hughes-stoke-city-manager-defiant-after-west-ham-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T21:02:54Z","webTitle":"Mark Hughes defiant as fans vent fury at Stoke’s loss to West Ham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/16/mark-hughes-stoke-city-manager-defiant-after-west-ham-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/16/mark-hughes-stoke-city-manager-defiant-after-west-ham-defeat","fields":{"headline":"Mark Hughes defiant as fans vent fury at Stoke’s loss to West Ham","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"An under-fire Mark Hughes insisted he is the man to turn Stoke City’s fortunes around after a chastening 3-0 home defeat by West Ham, their fifth loss in six games, plunged them deeper into a relegation battle. Hughes was turned on by large sections of the crowd after Marko Arnautovic, the former Stoke forward, scored West Ham’s second goal 15 minutes from time. The mood was mutinous by the time Diafra Sakho added a late third but Hughes, whose team will drop into the bottom three if West Brom defeat Manchester United on Sunday, believes he can still coax more out of his players. “I know this group and I know what they can produce,” he told the BBC. “We’ll get a tune out of them and hopefully we’ll get better. We’re in this position. Maybe we’ve got some clarity now. We’re better than what we’re doing at the moment. We need to get ourselves out of our situation. I don’t want to be in a relegation battle; we need to recognise that and do something about it.” Arnautovic, who Hughes said before the match had made a “sideways” move in joining West Ham for £24m during the summer, missed several chances to make the scoreline far greater. But Hughes pointed to the controversial first-half penalty – awarded by Graham Scott after Manuel Lanzini went to ground under Erik Pieters’ challenge – as the game-changing moment and left no doubt about his interpretation. “He’s clearly dived,” Hughes said of Lanzini’s tumble. “He’s a clever player, he’ll draw a foul or some kind of challenge, but he wasn’t clipped, he’s clearly dived. It’s disappointing the referee hasn’t seen that. Referees need to get match-defining decisions correct and he certainly didn’t get that one right from our point of view.” David Moyes, who has overseen a return of seven points and three clean sheets from West Ham’s last three games, agreed the decision was questionable but believed Lanzini had simply run out of steam after a surge upfield. “I think the defender gives the referee a decision to make,” Moyes said. “I would call it ‘soft’. Manuel’s run 70 yards and he’s probably run his race at the end of it. I don’t think there’s any intent regarding a dive, I think he’s riding the tackle more than anything. I see tiredness at the end of it but I don’t see a dive.” The away fans cheered Moyes and his players from the pitch; Hughes experienced the polar opposite but resisted any temptation to complain. “That’s understandable, clearly,” Hughes said. “I thought the fans were absolutely magnificent until the second goal, driving us on, and – like ourselves down on the bench – when the second goal went in it took the wind out of our sails.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/16/minnie-driver-matt-damon-men-cannot-understand-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T20:04:17Z","webTitle":"Minnie Driver: men like Matt Damon 'cannot understand what abuse is like'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/16/minnie-driver-matt-damon-men-cannot-understand-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/16/minnie-driver-matt-damon-men-cannot-understand-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Minnie Driver: men like Matt Damon 'cannot understand what abuse is like'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The actor Minnie Driver has told the Guardian that men “simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level” and should not therefore attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women. Driver was discussing comments by Matt Damon, whom she once dated and with whom she starred in the Oscar-winning 1997 film Good Will Hunting. In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved “a spectrum of behaviour”. Damon said there was “a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.” He added that society was in a “watershed moment” and said it was “wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it’s totally necessary”. But he said: “We live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, ‘Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.’” In her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: “God God, seriously? “Gosh it’s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women’s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.” Driver’s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: “There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it’s still cancer.” On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: “I felt I desperately needed to say something. I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level. “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.” Driver’s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape. Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response. “That’s the sign of somebody who – well, we can work with that,” Damon said, adding: “I don’t know Louis CK. I’ve never met him. I’m a fan of his, but I don’t imagine he’s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... ” Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon. “I don’t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,” she said. “It seems to me that he thinks that because he didn’t rape somebody – so far as we know – that what he did do wasn’t as bad.” The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said “these stories are true” but did not specifically apologise. “That’s a problem,” Driver continued. “If good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we’re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.” Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand. “I felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,” she said. “Put abuse in there … that all abuse is equal but some is worse.” She added: “There is no hierarchy of abuse – that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn’t want or ask for … you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other. “And it certainly can’t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency. “How about: it’s all fucking wrong and it’s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it’s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not. Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.” Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein. “There is not a woman I know,” Driver said, “myself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn’t sleep with.” Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women. “In the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,” she said, “I feel that’s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question. “Men can rally and they can support, but I don’t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse. Ever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/16/leinster-exeter-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T18:35:17Z","webTitle":"Exeter failure to exploit early edge punished by Leinster’s Luke McGrath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/16/leinster-exeter-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/16/leinster-exeter-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Exeter failure to exploit early edge punished by Leinster’s Luke McGrath","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Part of the Great English Humiliation last week, Exeter were one of those not quite disgraced then – and here their dignity was way beyond reproach, rocking mighty Leinster, who required a try, five penalties from the boot of Isa Nacewa and a fair dose of luck to prevail. Yet the cold truth is that Exeter return from Dublin with a defeat. England’s champions now face a fight outside the back door into the quarter-finals. “We have qualified before in extraordinary circumstances,” said Rob Baxter, their director of rugby, “more extraordinary than those we’re in at the moment. We’re not giving up by any means.” Leinster were way below their best, but like the champion team they are too – and of rather more experience and pedigree than Exeter – they found their way to victory, having ridden the loss of Johnny Sexton to a head injury in the third minute and an assault upon their defences by a transformed Exeter. The hosts had to ride their luck, too. Cian Healy would have seen red on another day for his forearm to the head of the superb Luke Cowan-Dickie in the first half. How Leinster turned round eight points adrift will require some explaining by Exeter’s analysts, but that they did. Leinster are now five points clear at the top of Pool Three, but they know they got away with one here. Where last week Exeter were inexplicably flat in front of their home fans, this time it was Leinster’s turn. Meanwhile, Exeter were unrecognisable, Sam Simmonds injected some pace round the fringes, where Cowan-Dickie, Matt Kvesic and the rest thrived too. Exeter hogged three-quarters of the first half-hour’s possession, pulling Leinster into all sorts of uncomfortable shapes. The home side responded with some tackles of a horribly clumsy nature. Three players required treatment for head clashes that were due to appalling technique. Sexton was departed for a head injury assessment and never returned; his replacement was off for an HIA four minutes later but did; while Sean Cronin was lucky not to go off for an HIA and/or a yellow card after his head clash when tackling Don Armand, some four inches taller. And then there was Healy’s clear-out on Cowan-Dickie, which seemed to tick every box for a red card but somehow received yellow. Leinster looked as lost as Exeter had at Sandy Park. When they did have the ball they kicked it away, where Ollie Woodburn, so shaky in this department the week before, ruled the air. The Chiefs had their first try after two minutes, Sam Skinner finishing after numerous phases, then their second on the half-hour, when their maul drove through Leinster’s with ease. Scott Fardy pulled it down and saw yellow to boot. That earned Exeter a 17-3 lead, but while Fardy was away Leinster raised their game. Two penalties by Nacewa in the three minutes before the break pulled them back to that unlikely eight-point deficit. But Leinster responded in the second half in a way Exeter had not the week before. Fergus McFadden cut the line a couple of times, but Exeter’s defence held. Leinster bade their time, two further penalties pulling them to within two with quarter of an hour to play. Then Leinster finally broke the visitors. Dan Leavy was released through midfield, straight from a lineout, and his flat, inside ball sent Luke McGrath to the line. The final pass looked suspicious, but Leinster escaped further scrutiny there too. Five points adrift, Exeter had 10 minutes to react, but composure at the lineout deserted them twice in the dying minutes. The second saw them penalised harshly. In that respect, it fitted the theme of their afternoon perfectly. Rugby at this level is harsh indeed.

After 11 Conservative MPs joined opposition parties to inflict a humiliating loss on the government last week, Tory grandees are warning that the spirit of rebellion will spread to the Lords unless May shows she respects parliament and decisively rejects those with “extreme views” in her own party. Writing in the Observer, two Tory peers, the former pensions minister Ros Altmann and Patience Wheatcroft, a former editor of the Sunday Telegraph, say they are appalled at the insults heaped by hardline Brexiters on MPs who voted with their consciences, and at the “strong-arm” tactics of the Tory whips. They say it is vital to democracy that parliamentarians be given the right to assess the Brexit deal on behalf of the British people without being threatened or bullied, and suggest that the aggression of Tory party managers has helped create a “toxic atmosphere”, not only in parliament but across the UK. Altmann and Wheatcroft write: “The resulting appalling insults from Brexiters, calls for expulsion from the party, and even death threats, are worrying symptoms of the toxic atmosphere which has been created in our country.” They add: “There are many moderate Conservatives in both Houses of Parliament who are deeply concerned that some in our party are so desperate to leave the EU, with or without a deal, that they believe any cost is justified to bring Brexit. They maintain ‘freedom is priceless’ but this extreme view does not reflect public opinion.” The two peers say Conservative members of the House of Lords, in which there was a large pro-Remain majority, will not take kindly to being told by the Tory whips and the executive what to think about Brexit and how to vote. “Mindful of the monumental importance for future generations of getting Brexit right, the Lords is unlikely to be receptive to bullying over a restricted timetable or vigorous whipping to toe the party line,” they say. “The people voted to ‘take back control’ but that has to mean control by parliament, not a small group with extreme views or an executive that will brook no challenge. It is parliament that must have the final say on whether the deal that is negotiated for breaking away from the EU ... is in the UK’s best interests.” Labour’s former deputy leader Harriet Harman is to raise serious concerns in the Commons on Monday about death threats issued against Tory MPs who rebelled last week. Harman said the atmosphere had been created by a combination of the Brexit debate, social media and pro-Brexit newspapers. “We have to show that we do not think it is right that people are afraid to vote in parliament for what they think is right because they are afraid they will face death threats,” she said. It was up to everyone with responsibility – including internet service providers – to think about how they can work together to preserve the democratic system. The Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, one of the 11 Tory rebels, has tweeted that she has received ugly threats and said the Daily Mail, which described the rebels as “self-consumed malcontents” after the vote, should think about the consequences of its actions and tone. “Are you proud?” she asked the Daily Mail. “I’ve also been deluged by the traitors and hanging vibe. Time to get a grip and a sense of proportion before deliberately unleashing all this incitement to violence.” It comes as a new poll found a majority backing remaining inside the EU. The BMG poll for the Independent found 51% favoured staying in, with 41% backing Brexit. After people who said they did not know were removed, it found 55.5% in favour of Remain and 44.5% for Leave. The Brexit withdrawal bill will head to the House of Lords in the new year. While peers will not seek to block or delay Brexit, there is a growing view that if the kind of cross-party cooperation that was achieved by opponents of a hard Brexit in the Commons is repeated, they can push the lower house’s change into a series of modifications to the bill. MPs say the Lords is likely to feel more emboldened to flex its muscles because the government was defeated last week. The Labour peer Andrew Adonis said last night: “The withdrawal bill will have a nightmare passage through the Lords. We respect the fact that it passed the Commons, so won’t reject the principle of withdrawal. “Our job is to make withdrawal compatible with the government’s own promises which – even with the latest changes – still aren’t satisfied in respect of a ‘meaningful vote’ on the final terms, ‘no hard border’ in Ireland and the rights of EU citizens in the UK. “We are facing the biggest conflict in the Lords since Irish Home Rule before the first world war, and the stakes are equally high.” Another Tory peer, Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher’s former foreign policy adviser, said he believed division in the Tory party over Europe ran so deep that it was “more or less bound to split at some point”. He added that there was more support for a second referendum on Brexit in the Lords than the Commons, “and that is one of the things on which you may find a harder push in the Lords”. “There is even less support in the Lords for Brexit than in the Commons and they will contest all those clauses contested in the Commons, and probably quite a few more. It can hardly not be clear to the Lords that this was in the manifesto and endorsed in a referendum and the case for the non-elected house making an attempt that could be seen as derailing it beyond what the Commons does is not likely to go down well in public opinion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/16/tory-rebels-overthrow-hardline-brexiters-in-the-commons-in-focus-toby-helm-michael-savage","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T21:31:12Z","webTitle":"Outnumbered, defeated … where next for the diehard Brexiters?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/16/tory-rebels-overthrow-hardline-brexiters-in-the-commons-in-focus-toby-helm-michael-savage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/16/tory-rebels-overthrow-hardline-brexiters-in-the-commons-in-focus-toby-helm-michael-savage","fields":{"headline":"Outnumbered, defeated … where next for the diehard Brexiters?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"At 6pm last Wednesday, the Tory MP for Eddisbury, Cheshire, Antoinette Sandbach, rose to her feet in the Commons and called on her Labour counterpart Chuka Umunna, who was progressing serenely through a speech, to offer her some badly needed support. “Does the honourable gentleman agree that it is deeply insulting for those who have time and again voted against their prime minister and their government to suggest in this crucial bill, which will help to set the future course of this country, that it would be wrong for us to do the proper scrutiny and to apply for votes in this house?” It was a remarkable moment. Here was a Tory MP asking a senior Labour member to condemn some of her fellow Tories for behaving shamefully and hypocritically. Umunna duly obliged. The Commons had been debating Brexit for five hours. Tempers were fraying. At times there was more unity breaking out between members of different parties than there was within them. Minutes earlier the Conservative veteran Bernard Jenkin, a hard Brexiter and formerly a serial rebel against the Maastricht treaty (which he had argued in the early 1990s represented a grave threat to the sovereignty of parliament), had accused some MPs on his own side of “trying to delay” the UK’s exit from the EU by arguing for a vote on the eventual Brexit deal. The likes of Sandbach – one of those branded “mutineers” over the previous weeks by the pro-Brexit Tory press – were not prepared to sit back and take it any longer. If Jenkin and others had made it their life’s work to defend parliamentary sovereignty from the clutches of Brussels, how could they be arguing now that the same parliament should be denied a right to scrutinise and vote on the most important issue to have come before it in decades? Despite the best efforts of the Tory whips to force their rebel MPs into line, discipline in the party had disintegrated. Principle was beginning to trump party loyalty and the threats of the increasingly ineffective whips counted for nothing. “The whips tried to tell us we’d be responsible for landing the country with a Marxist government under Jeremy Corbyn à la Daily Mail. What bollocks,” said one rebel. “No one really thinks that defeats over Brexit will bring down the government. The DUP will have to desert before that happens and they won’t because there is only one thing the DUP wants less than a hard border in Ireland – and that is Corbyn.” Less than an hour and a half after Sandbach rose to her feet, she and 10 other Conservative opponents of a hard Brexit held their nerve and rebelled. The 11 voted with the opposition parties in support of an amendment tabled by the former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve that will ensure (unless ministers succeed in removing it later in the parliamentary process) that MPs have a vote to approve the eventual deal. The pro-Brexiters fear it will, in effect, give MPs a veto. The dramatic events saw Theresa May’s first defeat over the Brexit bill in the Commons and, seemingly, represented a terrible humiliation for her. But, maybe more important, they also marked a shocking, sobering reverse for the hardline, hard-Brexit Tory right. Has the tide turned against them? All the hardline Brexiters could do in the following hours was to launch fresh assaults on the 11 rebels, accusing them (wrongly) of celebrating wildly and toasting their success with champagne in the Pugin Room at Westminster. The reality was that they had gathered, exhausted, over a glass of wine for a very sombre post-match analysis of where events of the last few hours had left them, the country, and the tangled mess that is Brexit. Next morning, as the recriminations gave way to more sensible reflection, many agreed a vital corner had been turned. One senior Tory MP said that it had not been so much a humiliation for May as her liberation. “What the vote showed was that there is nothing to be gained for her from continuing to appease the hardline Brexiters. She has done that for too long. She was imprisoned by them. Now it must be clear to her that if she continues along that road, she will be defeated again and again. The hard Brexiters are not important any more. They are outnumbered. The collective view of parliament is what is important, not one extreme faction within. The only way to make progress towards a sensible Brexit is to go with the majority.” Umunna, who had been instrumental in marshalling cross-party support behind the Grieve amendment, said that attempts to intimidate Tory MPs, not least by the Tory press, had backfired and had merely emboldened the rebels. “The use of inflammatory and threatening language by elements of the rightwing press against these parliamentarians – who have committed the crime of disagreeing with others’ views on the national interest – is grossly irresponsible, dangerous and has a whiff of the 1930s about it.” Other Labour MPs heaped praise on the Tory rebels, particularly Grieve, hailing them as national heroes. One said: “What he did was bold and brave in the face of a torrent of abuse and his motives continually being questioned, ironically by Tory MPs who have a history of extreme disloyalty towards Tory leaders. Had he not held his nerve, the whole rebellion would have disintegrated. He has done a huge service to the country and his constituents.” This weekend, as the rebels reel from Twitter death threats and insults from those angered by their actions in the country, they are vowing in private to carry on and impose more defeats on the government if needs be. Already it seems they have forced May to compromise over her plan to insert a fixed date for Brexit into the withdrawal bill, to avoid another Commons defeat this week. While the date will remain in place, it is understood that allowance will be made for it to be shifted back if more time is needed to complete negotiations. Pro-Brexit MPs on Tory and Labour benches are worried that they are losing the influence, and key arguments. Labour’s Frank Field said he was very uneasy about the so-called compromise, as Tories of like mind would be. “Any wriggle room like this will just be exploited by the Remainers,” he said. For the moment, the argument is slipping away from the hardliners in favour of moderate Brexiters. Nothing demonstrated this more vividly than May’s trip to Brussels on Friday when she signed off an agreement with the 27 other member states that will allow trade talks to begin – but in return for her agreeing, in effect, that the UK will sign up to what will be another two years of EU membership beyond March 2019. If there is to be a two-year transition deal, which May insists there must be, it will be on the EU’s terms, with European Court of Justice oversight and freedom of movement continuing to apply to the UK. This weekend, with the tide turning against their vision of a fast and clean Brexit, the Tory hardline Brexiters are desperately trying to regroup – both in the cabinet and on the backbenches. In recent years they have got used to having things their way, to forcing Tory prime ministers to bow to their will. They pushed David Cameron into committing to a Brexit referendum in the first place, then persuaded the country to back leaving the EU. Under May they thought they had secured her commitment to a hard Brexit. But now, most moderate MPs believe, they may be losing sway just as the real arguments approach over the precise shape that Brexit will take. So if the numbers are not there in the Commons, and as the largely pro-Remain House of Lords prepares to scrutinise the withdrawal bill, where do the hard Brexiters go now to claw back the initiative? Some at the extreme end of the spectrum seem intent on whipping the country up into a frenzy of anger against the “traitors” – hoping to foster a hard Brexit revolution in the nation at large. One hardline Brexiter told the Observer that the rebels had got themselves into such trouble in their constituencies that they were at serious risk of de-selection. The only way forward was to show them compassion. “We have to feel sorry for them,” he said. “We gave them this compromise over the date of Brexit because they were in a terrible position and they needed our help. It was a way to help get them off the hook.” The reality is that it is the hard Brexiters who should be most worried. Senior figures among them, including their leaders in the cabinet, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, seemed determined to give the impression of calm, as they prepare for a series of cabinet meetings, which begin this week, on the “end destination” of Brexit. In the meantime, they are biding their time. The key phrase being deployed among senior Brexiters is: “Eyes on the prize.” Just ensure Brexit happens. Everything else can be dealt with later. Ironically, given the difficulties that Ireland has created for the process, one Brexit tactician explained that they were taking lessons from Irish independence. Once the Irish free state was declared in 1922, they say, there was a momentum that inevitably led to a full republic being declared by 1949, ending any British involvement. “There is a ratchet effect to having your own state,” said one influential Brexiter. “One by one, the things that weren’t acceptable to the sovereignty of the Irish free state got cut away, stage by stage. That’s what we need to do. The moment we are out of the EU, everything will be in our own hands. People try to say that our hands will be bound. In the end, they won’t be.” The battle beyond parliament Big business Major groups had focused on securing the transitional agreement. They will want that finalised early in the new year, before turning their attention to the final deal. The CBI says the UK should be as close as possible to current arrangements, with immigration to be a key battleground. The City Britain’s huge financial services sector will hope the UK achieves a first by securing an EU trade deal with a high degree of access for financial services firms. Many accept they will not get full access (“passporting rights”), and are preparing contingency plans in case of a hard Brexit. They expect the Treasury to fight their corner. The media The Brexit-supporting press mostly backed Theresa May, as she finally secured trade talks with the EU, largely by conceding ground to Brussels over money, the role of the European court of justice and the Irish border. It suggests they will not push her towards hard Brexit, and will back her against rebel MPs. Whether they endorse the final deal May is handed will be a big moment. Popular campaigns Popular movements on both sides of the debate are likely to become noisier. Leave campaign donor Arron Banks has vowed to fund a pro-Brexit movement, though it has not yet come to pass. Remain rallies will pressure wavering MPs for a softer Brexit as crunch votes in the Commons approach next year. Prepare for a year of political marches."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/17/poaching-wildlife-africa-conservation-women-barbee-zimbabwe-elephant-rhino","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T00:03:15Z","webTitle":"Africa’s new elite force: women gunning for poachers and fighting for a better life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/17/poaching-wildlife-africa-conservation-women-barbee-zimbabwe-elephant-rhino","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/17/poaching-wildlife-africa-conservation-women-barbee-zimbabwe-elephant-rhino","fields":{"headline":"Africa’s new elite force: women gunning for poachers and fighting for a better life","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The black metal of the AR-15 rifle has worn silvery and shiny in parts after years of use. More manageable than an AK-47 in close-quarter combat, the weapon is precise enough to bring down an enemy target at 500 metres. Used for decades by anti-poaching units throughout Africa, today this gun is not carried by a typical swaggering male field ranger; this one is cradled securely and proficiently by Vimbai Kumire. “This job is not meant just for men,” she says, “but for everyone who is fit and strong.” Kumire is a 32-year-old single mother whose husband ran off with a younger woman while she was pregnant with her second child. She is practising setting up an ambush in the early morning in Zimbabwe’s lower Zambezi Valley, nestling deep into the green undergrowth like a dappled shadow. This is Africa’s poaching frontline, and these are not just regular female game rangers. If the team behind Kumire’s new job have anything to do with it, these women are a growing squad of environmental shock troops for a new type of community development offensive. According to conservation biologist Victor Muposhi of Chinhoyi University of Technology, the lower Zambezi Valley has lost 11,000 elephants in the past 10 years. But he believes that hiring and training female rangers such as Kumire directly from the local communities is a game-changer. “Developing conservation skills in communities creates more than just jobs,” says Professor Muposhi. “It makes local people directly benefit from the preservation of wildlife.” And that, he says, can save not only landmark species such as elephants but entire ecosystems. Women’s empowerment is at the core of the programme, named Akashinga, which means the brave ones. “This is a true empowerment programme,” says Muposhi, “because you are dealing with a highly vulnerable and damaged group of young ladies.” Sitting on a rock looking north over one of Africa’s last great wildernesses, Muposhi explains that his early research shows the five-month-old programme is helping change these formerly unemployed single mothers into community leaders. Primrose Mazliru, 21, stands in the gathering dusk near their camp among the new grass, bright green with the recent rains. Ramrod straight, shoulders back and proud, she smiles despite the vivid scar that runs across her upper lip, where her ex-boyfriend beat her in a drunken rage. “I can testify to the power of this programme to change my life, and now I have the respect of my community, even as a young single mother,” she explains. Mazliru has already bought a small plot of land with her wages as a field ranger. “I don’t need a man in my life to pay my way for me and my child,” she says, a glint in her eye. Like most countries in southern Africa, Zimbabwe uses game management areas around famous national parks such as Victoria Falls or Mana Pools as “buffer zones” to protect the animals. These buffer zones are huge tracts of land much larger than the parks themselves, originally created to benefit the surrounding communities by allowing limited trophy hunting by high-dollar foreign clients such as Walter Palmer, the American dentist who attracted worldwide condemnation after killing Cecil the lion on a hunt in 2015. There are no fences between the hunting areas, or between the wildlife and the estimated 4 million people living on the borders of these protected lands. Some profits from the hunting have gone to support the communities which live in the wilderness areas designated for trophy hunting – almost 20% of Zimbabwe’s land. According to Muposhi, these precious ecosystems are now under grave threat due to the collapse of commercial hunting, in part because of a growing ethical backlash. “Cecil the lion marked the birth of the greater debate around the issues of morals and ethics in hunting and whether it is sustainable or not.” Revenues are plummeting and human populations around parks growing. “Five years from now,” says Muposhi, “if we do not have other options, then it will not be viable to save these areas.” Damien Mander, the founder of the Akashinga initiative, is a tall, Australian, military-trained sniper, who would look very much at home in the centre of a rugby scrum. Mander was inspired by the story of the Black Mambas, the world’s first female, unarmed anti-poaching unit, who work near South Africa’s Kruger National Park. Having met some of the women on a fundraising trip to New York, where they were giving a talk, he saw the international support and interest they received and thought a similar project in Zimbabwe might be a good way to raise the profile of his own project, the International Anti-Poaching Foundation (IAPF). What transpired went way beyond those modest ambitions. “Thirty-six women started our training, modelled on our special-forces training, and we pushed them hard, much harder than any training we do with men,” he explains from his tented camp at a secret location in the Zambezi Valley. “Only three dropped out. I couldn’t believe it.” From the very first day of the women’s training, he saw that something very special was happening. He realised that women were the missing link to successful conservation and anti-poaching initiatives. “We have turned a security need into a community programme,” he said. In only five months, according to Mander, this pilot project is already putting more money per month into the local community than trophy hunting did per year. Important people are noticing. Tariro Mnangagwa is a 32-year-old professional photographer who is visiting and training with the International Anti-Poaching Foundation’s Akashinga field ranger unit. She is also the youngest daughter of Zimbabwe’s new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. “These women show me hope,” she says. She heads to a beaten-up Land Rover to visit a community in search of a former poacher who wants to talk. Annette Hübschle, a senior researcher and post-doctoral fellow at the University of Cape Town, believes that the Akashinga model could still be a great solution. While many western governments and conservation organisations take decisions in London, New York and Geneva, the people most affected are usually women in communities adjacent to protected areas in Africa. Community-driven conservation programmes based around empowerment and training for women such as Kumire and Mazliru offer a potential solution to the end of hunting. Mander, and all his rangers, live on a vegan diet. His TED talk on veganism has been seen by millions of people around the world. He stopped eating animal products five years ago. “I was wandering around in the bush, protecting one group of animals and coming home and eating another. I could not live with the hypocrisy of that any more.” The Akashinga have embraced it with gusto. “It’s great,” says Kumire with a huge smile, as she stands in the light of the cooking fire steaming with pots of beans and spinach-like greens. “I don’t miss meat at all, when I go home for leave and people try to feed me meat I can’t eat it because my stomach hurts if I do, and I tell people no, don’t give me meat, I am vegan!” The women around her smile and nod in agreement. Muposhi, himself a vegan for 13 years, argues that showing communities they don’t need bushmeat is about setting an example, one that stops poaching and reduces the need to farm animals in wilderness areas – a driver of habitat loss. Muposhi is excited to see the project grow. “It is happening right in the middle of nowhere in the Zambezi Valley, and it is part of a greater movement,” he says. “We are going to develop it to become one of the best models of conservation of wildlife based on women’s empowerment.” As the training exercise unfolds, the female rangers are hidden from sight, the muzzles of their AR-15s poking from tufts of grass. Slowly the two scouts designated as “poachers” walk down the animal track. When they get to the right spot the women explode into action, shouting “Get down! Down! Now, now, now!” Within moments they have the suspects handcuffed. When asked why the pretend “poachers” are shaking, Kumire says that suspects always lay “shaking on the ground”, she laughs. Mander ends the exercise, the women help their friends up with smiles, and together they quietly fall into formation and disappear back into the bush.

Politicians tweeted Lynyrd Skyrnyrd’s Sweet Home, Alabama. Historians tweeted the 1934 classic Stars Fell on Alabama. My mind’s been drifting to The Alabama Song. Not the obvious reference from The Doors/Bowie version – “Oh, show us the way to the next little girl” – but two other lines that recur throughout the song: “We now must say goodbye … I tell you we must die.” It’s a lyric for the left, which can’t seem to let go of its sense of defeat, even when the right loses. 1. This is what defeat looks like Alabama’s a red state, as red as they come. The last time it elected a Democratic senator – a quarter-century ago – he was a Republican. Three years ago, Donald Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, won re-election to the Senate with 98% of the vote: no Democrat had dared challenge him. When Democrats started wondering if Moore’s sexual predations might sink him, it seemed a case of either wishful thinking – why would the state that rewarded Donald Trump’s alleged harassment with 63% of its vote care about Moore’s harassment? – or defining deviancy downward. Next to Moore, liberals seemed to suggest, Trump didn’t look so bad, a point Paul Begala actually made even before the news of Moore’s predation broke. But now that Moore has done what virtually no one thought he could do, liberals have turned around to say his loss is not that significant. What really matters, says Ezra Klein, is the fact that Moore almost won, that he got 48% of the vote and 91% of the Republican vote. Moore is proof that there is no depravity so unforgivable, no behavior so immoral, that it assures a candidate will lose his party’s voters … even though we are not the country that elected Roy Moore, we are the country that almost elected him, and that is still worth reckoning with. Others focus on the fact that a majority of white voters still voted for Moore, despite his being an unabashed white supremacist and sexual harasser and accused assaulter of underage women. After every defeat of the right, after every poll shows dangerously low approval ratings for Trump or the Republican, I hear the same response from the left, especially on social media: what about the minority of voters who still support the right? How can they do it? What is wrong with them? Even though Tuesday’s election showed signs of a fairly large switch in the white vote of Alabama, from red to blue, even though 24% of the American people approved of Richard Nixon the day he resigned – eight points lower, incidentally, than Trump’s current approval rating – the left can’t let go of the voters who remain committed to Trumpism. Even when the candidates of those voters lose major statewide elections twice in a row. In southern states. But the left doesn’t need to convince every last Republican of the error of their ways. It doesn’t need to put all Republican voters in the public square, forcing them to recant their beliefs. It doesn’t need Christian suasion, encouraging rightwingers to apologize and confess their sins. In an electoral democracy, the way to break your opponents – especially opponents like these – is to demoralize them, to make them feel they are a small and isolated minority, that their cause is a loser. On election day, the left needs to convince the right – not through voter suppression or intimidation but through rhetoric and speech – that their movement is going nowhere, so they shouldn’t either. That’s exactly what happened in Alabama, where “the biggest reason for the shift” in counties that voted for Trump last November going for Jones this December is that “GOP voters stayed home”, according to MCIMaps. 2. This is what winning looks like Speaking of voter suppression, several commenters have said to me that overcoming the effects of voter suppression seems to require either an extraordinarily bad candidate, like Roy Moore, or an extraordinarily charismatic candidate, like Barack Obama. I’d rephrase that to say that it requires extraordinary efforts of all sorts and sizes by all sorts of people. But that’s not just true of elections and voter suppression. It’s also true of getting social security (and keeping it), passing the Wagner Act, getting the vote, organizing a union, going on strike, and passing the Equal Rights Amendment – which didn’t pass. That’s true of any smidgen of justice, any advance, no matter how small, that you’ll ever get in this godforsaken country, with all its cockamamie veto points and separated, federated, other-kinds-of-ated institutions. That’s true of all democracy – there’s a reason, the political theorist Sheldon Wolin intimated, that in all those ancient theories of regime cycles, democracy always comes last – but it’s especially true of democracy in America. The most ordinary, minimal democracy requires the most extraordinary, heroic acts of individual men and women, of anonymous collectives and faceless social movements – years and decades of grueling work, of hair turned gray and stomachs turned sour. That’s the American story: always has been, always will be. The French took the Bastille in four hours; it took American workers 100 years to get a weekend. 3. The Democrats just got served As many outlets have reported, black voters played a large role in defeating Moore, though as Matt Bruenig points out, there was also a large and under-reported switch in the white vote, which, in keeping with the lack of enthusiasm in the Republican base, may have contributed as much if not more to the surprise of Tuesday’s results. Regardless of the relative weight of these factors, this, from Eddie Glaude, is indisputably true: Finally, black voters in Alabama saw their power and exercised it. In doing so, they served notice to the Democratic party. Democrats cannot win without black voters and they must not take our votes for granted. The days of symbolic talk and empty gestures are over. Deliver or pay the price. The national leadership of the Democratic party must understand this or risk continued defeat. What black voters, particularly black women, have gotten instead is a lot of thank-yous. From liberals and Democrats, on Twitter and Facebook: thank you, black people, for saving “us” or America or democracy from “ourselves”. It’s a weird move, with weird overtones. Rather than treating black people as political agents in their own right, acting in their own interest, rather than viewing black people as part of an inclusive movement of the left, the thank-you-note writers treat African Americans as if they were the indispensable helpmates of an addled white upper-middle class, a class that’s too harried, busy, or distracted to deal with the hassle of everyday life, the drudgery of daily upkeep, the housekeeping of democracy. What Glaude rightly is calling for is not a thank-you note – or donations to black organizations, which replicate the same structure of white noblesse oblige – but a political program, for the entire left, that’s commensurate with the black vote, a program that confronts the deep divide of race and class that mars this country. Not just the extreme poverty of Alabama, which predates the rise of Trump and Moore and will continue with Doug Jones, but the racial wealth gap, the crushing debt, the homeownership crisis, the over-policing and imprisonment that have been so relentlessly documented over the years. As Glaude suggests, the Democrats haven’t been too forthcoming on that front. Indeed, their last presidential candidate breezily dismissed the centrality of the economic concerns to African Americans with the claim: “Not everything’s about an economic theory, right?” 4. We now must say goodbye Keep an eye out in the coming days and months for announcements from Republican members of Congress that they aren’t going to seek re-election in 2018. The number of such announcements was already high, relative to Democrats, back in November: 27 to 7, according to the New York Times. I expect we’ll see a lot more in the new year.

Pointing out that the network’s slogan was “THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS”, Trump suggested an alternative tagline: “THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS”. But he took a hit from an unexpected quarter on Sunday when his usual loyal ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said she thought the numerous women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment or assault “should be heard”. The White House’s official position is that they are all liars. Monday On Monday a group of those women demanded Congress open an investigation into the president, hoping that in the light of the post-Weinstein #metoo movement their stories would gain a greater hearing. “Let’s try round two,” one of them, Samantha Holvey, said. “The environment’s different, let’s try again.” The Pentagon also had bad news for Trump, announcing it would allow transgender people to enlist in the military beginning on 1 January, despite the president’s vocal opposition. Trump’s attempt to change military policy by tweet in July was not well received by the Pentagon, and numerous legal challenges have followed which the administration fears it will lose. Tuesday On a busy day for Trump, he ensured his accusers achieved their aim of greater publicity for their allegations by making what many saw as a crude sexual innuendo about one of their congressional supporters, Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said he should resign over the claims. (Male senators have said so too, but Trump left them alone.) Gillibrand “would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them)”, Trump tweeted. Meanwhile, his lawyer, somewhat absurdly, called for a second special counsel to investigate the special counsel investigating Trump and Russia (perhaps a third one should investigate the special counsel investigating the special counsel), as secretary of state Rex Tillerson defied his boss to call for talks without preconditions with North Korea. Trump has said such talks would be useless: “Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!” All that came before the shock defeat of Roy Moore in the Alabama special election. The controversial Republican former judge, who had been accused of sexual misconduct including against a girl of 14, had been abandoned by most of the GOP establishment – but Trump had made a point of personally backing him, including with a rally disparaging one of his accusers, as well as a full-throated tweet. (“VOTE ROY MOORE!”) Moore’s own final push had all the absurdity and offensiveness of peak 2016-era Trump – Moore’s wife attempted to rebut accusations of antisemitism by saying “our lawyer is a Jew” and a Vietnam buddy recalled the time he and Moore had accidentally wound up in a brothel featuring “very young” girls – but it failed to replicate one key element: victory at the polls. Wednesday Trump tried his best to spin his way out of association with the defeat on Wednesday, claiming he had known all along the hardline religious conservative would lose (“I was right!”) and pointing out that he had backed Moore’s opponent Luther Strange in the primary. Yet the fact remained that Trump had endorsed the losing candidate twice in the same election, and the populist crusade of his former strategist Steve Bannon had suffered a possibly fatal blow in its attempts to elbow aside the establishment wing represented by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Democrats were jubilant and began to fantasise about taking the House and the Senate in next year’s midterms. Thursday Also damaging was the loss of White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, one of Donald Trump’s few African American allies. After her departure under somewhat unclear circumstances was announced on Wednesday, Manigault Newman appeared on TV the next day to say she had “seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and my people”. On Friday she added that many of Trump’s comments had been “racially charged” and said Trump’s response to the far-right violence in Charlottesville had “absolutely” concerned her. With a future on the media far more probable than a continued career in politics, it seemed likely that a book deal that could reveal a troubling new perspective on the president’s attitude towards race might follow. Friday On Friday Trump returned to the idea – perhaps uniquely held by him – that foreign countries somehow try to get rid of their “worst people” by sending them to America. This strange fantasy first came up in his notorious campaign launch speech, and he picked up on it again in a speech to FBI recruits which touched on the green card immigration lottery. “They give us their worst people,” Trump lamented, as if imagining some calculating dictator sending forth his baddest hombres to destroy the US from within. “They put ‘em in a bin but in his hand, when he’s pickin’ ‘em, is really the worst of the worst,” he continued, confusingly. “‘Congratulations, you’re going to the United States, it’s OK.’ What a system, lottery system.” In fact the US Department of State – not the foreign countries the applicants come from – chooses who has been accepted by the lottery. What a system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/17/omarosa-trump-diversity-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T11:00:29Z","webTitle":"Omarosa's exit highlights lack of diversity at Trump White House","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/17/omarosa-trump-diversity-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/17/omarosa-trump-diversity-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Omarosa's exit highlights lack of diversity at Trump White House","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The departure of the former Apprentice contestant Omarosa Manigault-Newman from the White House this week has placed the lack of diversity in Donald Trump’s administration under renewed scrutiny. Manigault-Newman, the highest-ranking black person to work in the West Wing under Trump, abruptly left her post as a special assistant to the president on Wednesday. She subsequently criticized minority representation in the White House in a televised interview, claiming that many of Trump’s senior advisers “had never worked with minorities, [and] didn’t know how to interact with them”. “As the only African American woman in this White House, as a senior staff and assistant to the president, I have seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and my people,” Manigault-Newman told ABC’s Good Morning America on Thursday. Manigault-Newman, who rose to prominence in the 2000s while appearing on The Apprentice, the reality television show produced and hosted by Trump, has long held a reputation among critics as a brash personality, hungry for attention – not unlike her former boss. But her comments about an absence of people of color in the White House tapped into an issue that has clouded Trump’s administration, which produced a cabinet more male and white than any of Trump’s four predecessors. “There is no comparison. Black diversity in the White House is almost oxymoronic at this point,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee and the first African American to hold the post. “It’s not for a lack of names or people who qualify … This continued pretense that it’s so hard to find [people of color] to do the job is just ridiculous at this point.” Without Manigault-Newman, Trump appears to have no black senior advisers in public-facing White House roles. Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, is the only black member of Trump’s cabinet. Jerome M Adams, the US surgeon general, is one of the only other black individuals to hold a high-ranking position in Trump’s administration. More broadly, the minority members of Trump’s cabinet are few and far between: Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation, is the only Asian American; Alexander Acosta, the labor secretary, is the only Hispanic; and Nikki Haley, the UN ambassador, is the only Indian American. There are two other Indian Americans in prominent administration roles: Ajit Pai, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. By contrast, 64% of Barack Obama’s first cabinet and cabinet-level officials were women or nonwhite men, according to a New York Times analysis. That figure in George W Bush’s first cabinet was 45%. In Trump’s cabinet, there are only five women. Furthermore, 80% of nominations for top jobs in the Trump administration have been awarded to men – paving the way for the most male-dominated federal government in nearly a quarter-century. A similar trend has characterized Trump’s judicial nominees. An analysis by the Associated Press last month revealed that 91% of Trump’s nominees to US federal courts are white, and 81% are male. Three of every four nominees are white men, the review found, with few African Americans and Hispanics under consideration. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, defended Trump on Thursday for having “a really diverse team across the board at the White House”. She could not, however, identify how many senior staffers at the White House were black. An administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, told the Guardian there were 24 commissioned officers who were minorities, three of whom were African Americans. Malik Russell, a spokesman for the NAACP, America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization, expressed concern with “the overall way in which this administration has addressed and engaged people of color”. “Opportunities for individuals of color have and continue to be a rare occurrence and scarce commodity in this administration, which often seems more comfortable in appointing or nominating individuals with clear ties to racist and white supremacist organizations than someone from Latino, Asian or African American communities,” Russell said. Steele said he was part of a small group of Republicans that provided a list of recommendations “of highly qualified and capable” African American men and women during Trump’s transition period, who were either already serving in the US government or had already served in various capacities. The group had also made the recommendations under previous Republican administrations, Steele said, but he expressed his view that the list had been “summarily ignored or rejected” under Trump. Even with Manigault-Newman by his side for the first year of his presidency, Trump has ignited numerous firestorms for his comments on race. There was his feud with the NFL over predominantly black athletes kneeling during the national anthem – players whom Trump referred to as “sons of bitches”. And there was the president’s assertion in August that “both sides” were to blame for the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Such moments called into question Manigault-Newman’s influence after she positioned herself as a liaison between the president and the African American community. Manigault-Newman was no stranger to controversy herself, once irking the Congressional Black Caucus by sending invitations to meet with Trump at the White House that she signed as “the Honorable Omarosa Manigault”. Steele said Trump’s long-held views on race were an “unspoken truth”, and it was unlikely that an increase in African American staff would change the outlook of a 71-year-old man. He also said a move to hire more black men and women at this stage of Trump’s presidency would lack authenticity. “You just don’t have a revelation all of a sudden that, ‘Oh damn, we forgot black people.’ That’s not how this works.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/15/bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-preview-chris-froome","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T20:37:59Z","webTitle":"It’s fair enough for Sports Personality of the Year to ask some searching questions | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/15/bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-preview-chris-froome","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/15/bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-preview-chris-froome","fields":{"headline":"It’s fair enough for Sports Personality of the Year to ask some searching questions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For more than 60 years the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year has served up a mildly diverting few hours of saccharine and froth. The formula is long established: laud Britain’s sporting heroes, relive their glories through stirring montages, and throw a threw softball questions for them to answer. Usually it makes for an easily digestible, if unchallenging, three hours of viewing. On Sunday night, however, the BBC is expected to break with tradition by firmly questioning Chris Froome about his failed test at the Vuelta a España when he appears via video link from his training camp in Spain. Since an investigation by the Guardian and Le Monde revealed that Froome was found to have double the permitted levels of the asthma medication salbutamol in his system in a test taken on 7 September, he has gone from third favourite to a 50-1 outsider. Froome insists he has not broken any rules, only took the amount of the medication that was allowed, and that he will be able to provide an explanation for the adverse finding. However, the brand and PR consultant Mark Borkowski believes the BBC programme needs to also reflect the wider reality of British sport in 2017. “It has been an ugly year,” he says. “What we seem to be increasingly seeing is a whole bunch of unlikeable heroes.” He points to another member of the 12-person shortlist under scrutiny – the Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, who last month was revealed to have avoided £16.5m in tax on his private jet by using an offshore structure. Some might think this does not matter, and that the focus should be solely on Hamilton’s audacious driving skills. But the Sports Personality of the Year award has always been a curious fusion of sporting prowess and likeability. “People, and particularly kids, want to identify with heroes,” says Borkowski. “But how can they do it when many of these athletes seem more remote to them than ever?” Meanwhile, another of Britain’s greatest sporting stars, Mo Farah, also faced some hostile questions after winning a record 12th Olympic and world championship medal in August. Much of it was about his then coach, Alberto Salazar, who remains under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency. Farah, who is the third favourite for Spoty, has never failed a drugs test and insists that he plays by the rules. But will this backstory discourage some voters? With these contenders all facing scrutiny for one reason or another, the heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua is an overwhelming favourite – unsurprising, perhaps, given that his victory over the former champion Wladimir Klitschko for the WBA, IBF and IBO world heavyweight titles was watched by more than 80,000 people at Wembley. And while it may be unwise to trust opinion polls or bookies’ forecasts given the result of the Brexit vote and this year’s general election, as things stand anyone who put £100 on Joshua to win would get only £13 in winnings back, along with their stake. The William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly says: “Joshua is such a short-priced favourite but we have seen upsets before. It would appear, however, that Lewis Hamilton is the only one who can stop him from getting his hands on the coveted trophy given the controversy surrounding former third favourite Chris Froome.” Some experts believe the programme would do well to acknowledge the broader questions facing British sport as well – especially given that over the past 18 months the words “climate of fear” have been heard many times in connection with Olympic and Paralympic sports. Some of the stories have been horrifying. In July a coach in British Canoeing’s high-performance team resigned after an internal investigation into claims of grooming and sexual assault, as revealed by the Guardian. This paper also revealed that an investigation took place at British Bobsleigh in October after the head coach Lee Johnston allegedly said: “Black drivers do not make good bobsleigh drivers.” Last month a parliamentary select committee heard of cases where Para athletes were said to have exaggerated their disability to get an easier classification – thus making it easier to win medals. One father was even claimed to have bought a wheelchair on eBay so his child, who could walk unaided, could hoodwink classifiers. As Ian Braid, the former chief executive of the British Athletes Commission and the managing director of DOCIA sport (Duty of Care in Action in Sport) puts it: “It is always good to acknowledge British success and it is always great that we have it to celebrate. But it is also good to see there are also questions being asked about what potential price this success has had.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/16/gymnastics-larry-nassar-sexual-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T17:54:33Z","webTitle":"Why don't we care about the biggest sex abuse scandal in sports history? | Bryan Armen Graham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/16/gymnastics-larry-nassar-sexual-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/16/gymnastics-larry-nassar-sexual-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Why don't we care about the biggest sex abuse scandal in sports history?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In a Michigan court last month, Larry Nassar pleaded guilty to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The longtime US women’s gymnastics team physician is accused of sexually abusing more than 140 women and girls, under the guise of medical treatment. His accusers include some of the most prominent names in the sport, among them the Olympic gold medalists Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Aly Raisman and many others whom he treated over two decades at Michigan State University. When he is sentenced next month, the term will be added to the 60 years he was given last week in a separate case regarding child abuse images. Culpability may only begin there. Many statements from victims and their attorneys have centered on the institutions that allegedly enabled or were negligent in preventing Nassar’s abuse for as long as two decades: Michigan State, USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee. All three are named as co-defendants in civil suits that appear headed to trial. This is hardly the first high-profile sex abuse scandal in the sports world in recent years. No one can forget the Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky’s serial molestation of boys or Baylor University’s mishandling of rape allegations involving its football team. Yet the case of Larry Nassar, certainly the largest such scandal in scale, has generated a fraction of the mainstream media coverage that was devoted to the Sandusky and Baylor stories. Why that is is worthy of inspection. It is not as if reporters have not been paying attention. The Indianapolis Star broke the first allegations against Nassar in September 2016. The Lansing State Journal has been with the case every step of the way. Nationally, Dvora Meyers of Deadspin, America’s foremost gymnastics writer, has paired exhaustive reporting with thoughtful analysis. ESPN has hit on the major developments and the courtroom was packed with reporters when Nassar entered his plea. So why the visibility issue? Perhaps it is because the story centers on a sport to which people do not pay attention during non-Olympic years. Or perhaps, unlike more common cases of sex abuse involving teachers or coaches, it is because the Nassar case involves the less familiar terrain of abuse by a doctor. Or perhaps it is simply a more complicated story than what happened at Penn State or Baylor, harder to parse or boil down to a digestible tagline. But the most distressing reason of all is that the abuse of women is normalized in our society. The Nassar scandal fits into our framework of how we understand a sport like women’s gymnastics. On some level we expect women to be victimized, so it’s not surprising when they are. That’s a problem. When a football coach is found to have molested boys, who are abused at a lower rate than girls (although at a much higher rate than we realize, due to underreporting), it goes against our expectations and shakes the foundation of a sport associated with virility and masculinity. Such news even stokes society’s latent homophobia. There is a shock associated with an older man molesting young boys that does not exist when the victim is a girl. It is a subconscious form of erasure, which perhaps helps to explain why it took so long to thoroughly investigate the accusations around Nassar, some of which date back to 1997. Rachael Denhollander, a former club gymnast whose allegations were the first made public, in September 2016, said she hesitated to contact police for more than a decade and a half. “I was 100% confident that I would not be believed,” she said. Journalism is a business. If people care about something, there will be more coverage of it. But stories like the gymnastics scandal, even if they do not involve glaring celebrity or a $14bn-a-year industry or more identifiable principals, are vitally important. They remind us how humans can be convinced anything is acceptable. The manipulation here ran so deep that girls for years believed there was nothing to report. They assumed the adult was right, especially because he was an authority figure. In some of the cases the abuse happened while a parent was in the treatment room, a tragedy that offers an alarming metaphor of how blind we can be. It is literally happening in front of our eyes. We should ask ourselves why the biggest sex abuse scandal in sports history has hardly made a dent in the public consciousness. But asking why there has not been more coverage is a self-indictment that misframes the issue and attempts to let the asker off the hook. The issue isn’t the volume of coverage. The issue is people not caring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/19/trivago-girl-tv-adverts-gabrielle-miller-phenomenon","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T15:40:09Z","webTitle":"The Trivago woman: ‘People have an opinion, but don’t know me from a bar of soap'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/19/trivago-girl-tv-adverts-gabrielle-miller-phenomenon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/19/trivago-girl-tv-adverts-gabrielle-miller-phenomenon","fields":{"headline":"The Trivago woman: ‘People have an opinion, but don’t know me from a bar of soap'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s hard to explain why the Australian actor in the Trivago adverts became such a phenomenon this year. The television adverts she appears in are neither breathtaking nor contentious – just anodyne, perfunctory videos in which she explains in some detail how the hotel comparison website works. Yet somehow the “Trivago girl” became a sensation in the English-speaking world; an outpouring of social media and press interest helped boost Trivago’s net revenue by 67% in the first half of 2017. Some think it’s simply because she’s attractive. Others that she is strangely soothing. One theory is that the sparseness of the complementary poster campaign – just the company’s name, slogan and her photo – often repeated over and over on one tube platform, created an eerie effect. “I have no idea why, or how, or anything,” says the Trivago woman, Gabrielle Miller, when asked why she thinks she’s made such an impact. “I get a lot of emails, some good, a lot from mothers that say things like, ‘My two-year-old stops crying whenever you come on television’, which is nice; but some very very horrible, a lot of sleaze and bad things.” From gross guys? “Yeah, there’s a lot of that, but I would say the good outweighs the bad.” At 24, Miller went to Berlin to study the Jacques Lecoq method of physical theatre. She works as a “freelancer performer”, which involves everything from twisting balloons on the street to cabaret theatre. After our call she’s flying out to Thailand and Malaysia to tour with her bohemian street band Zap. “I’ve always been inspired by things that are poetic, that run against the grain,” she says. Most of her friends and contemporaries, immersed in the world of performance art, “don’t even watch television” so are surprised when they see her on the side of a bus. Miller still lives in Berlin, where the Germans have their own “Trivago Mann”, but since the campaign blew up she has started to get recognised even there: “Someone will tap me on the shoulder in the doctor’s surgery and I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s right, I’m the Trivago girl, I forgot’.” The campaign has funded her creative endeavours and she says she is happy with the balance in her life. “I’m just continuing to do exactly what I used to do, and then filming some adverts in between.” She still auditions a lot, but says doing the Trivago ads has neither helped nor hindered her other work. She admits she has not always found her new-found fame easy and finds it odd that people “have an opinion on me even though they don’t know me from a bar of soap”. Miller admits she finds it “confronting” being so exposed and some times can’t tell whether people are complimenting her or making fun of her. “The best thing,” she says, “is to just not give a fuck about anything.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/15/rex-tillerson-scales-back-offer-of-opening-dialogue-with-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T19:52:35Z","webTitle":"Rex Tillerson scales back offer of opening dialogue with North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/15/rex-tillerson-scales-back-offer-of-opening-dialogue-with-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/15/rex-tillerson-scales-back-offer-of-opening-dialogue-with-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"Rex Tillerson scales back offer of opening dialogue with North Korea","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Rex Tillerson has said that the US was keeping channels of communication open with North Korea but said Pyongyang would have to “earn its way back to the table” with a “sustained cessation of threatening behaviour”. In his remarks at a ministerial meeting of the UN security council, the US secretary of state appeared to restate an offer of a dialogue following a pause in nuclear and missile testing that he made on Tuesday, but cast it in tougher language following a rebuke from the White House. Tillerson omitted a line restating US openness to talks “without pre-conditions” that had been in a text of his speech circulated earlier by the state department. “As I said earlier this week, a sustained cessation of North Korea’s threatening behavior must occur before talks can begin. North Korea must earn its way back to the table,” Tillerson said. “The pressure campaign must, and will, continue until denuclearization is achieved. We will, in the meantime, keep our channels of communication open.” Speaking later at the security council meeting, the North Korean envoy Ja Song-nam ignored the US secretary of state’s call for talks, claiming that the US was “terrified by the incredible might of our Republic that has successfully achieved the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force”. The UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said that a restoration of dialogue with Pyongyang was urgent. “We must do everything we can to reach that objective – and avoid a level of danger that would be unpredictable in its trajectory and catastrophic in its consequences,” Guterres said. On Tuesday, Tillerson told an audience of foreign policy experts: “We’re ready to talk any time North Korea would like to talk, and we’re ready to have the first meeting without precondition”. He said that the initial dialogue could be about the weather or the shape of the table, but added: “We’ve got to have a period of quiet or it’s going to be very difficult to have productive discussions.” Hours later, however, the White House contradicted him, telling reporters that North Korea’s test of an intercontinental missile in November meant that “clearly right now is not the time” for a dialogue. That was ruled out until Pyongyang “fundamentally improves its behaviour”. The mixed messages illuminated a rift between the White House and the state department on North Korea policy. The state department believes an early return to diplomatic contacts is essential to defuse tensions and avoid war by miscalculation, while the White House believes that economic pressure and military threats should be given more time to force Pyongyang’s acceptanc that it will ultimately give up its nuclear weapons programme. Asked about his administration’s policy on Friday, Donald Trump made non-committal remarks. “Well, we’re going to see what happens with North Korea. We have a lot of support,” he said. “There are a lot of nations that agree with us – almost everybody. We can’t let that happen. And we’re going to see what happens with North Korea. We hope it works out.” At the same day, the US special envoy for North Korea policy, Joseph Yun, echoed Tillerson’s remarks during to a visit to Thailand. “It’s very hard to discern what their intent is without, as I said, having a real dialogue,” Yun told reporters. “We are open to dialogue. And we hope they will agree to have a dialogue,” In his remarks to the security council on Friday, Tillerson appeared to be “trying to square the circle between two different policies”, said Mira Rapp-Hooper, senior research scholar in the China Centre at Yale Law School. “He may be pressing diplomacy especially hard because he finds the other streams of thought in the administration so horrifying. But his tenure is expected to be extremely short.” Tillerson omitted a section in the draft version of the speech circulated to reporters before delivery that said that apart from a cessation in nuclear or missile tests “there are no preconditions for talks, nor will we accept pre-conditions from North Korea or others”. In what has become a pattern, unnamed White House officials were quoted as making derogatory remarks about Tillerson on Friday. “I think our allies know at this point he’s not really speaking for the administration,” one official told the Washington Post. Both Tillerson and Trump had denied reports that the White House was planning to fire the secretary of state, but the denials have done little to quash rumours of his departure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/25/christmas-after-a-hurricane-we-still-must-celebrate-the-holidays","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T09:00:15Z","webTitle":"Christmas after a hurricane: 'We still must celebrate the holidays'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/25/christmas-after-a-hurricane-we-still-must-celebrate-the-holidays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/25/christmas-after-a-hurricane-we-still-must-celebrate-the-holidays","fields":{"headline":"Christmas after a hurricane: 'We still must celebrate the holidays'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For seven weeks in autumn, images of homes in ruins, trees stripped bare and people wading through floodwaters dominated the news as hurricanes devastated the American south and Caribbean. The US had never been hit in one hurricane season by storms as strong as Harvey, Irma and Maria, according to modern records, and the areas hit hardest by those intense storms are still far from recovery. In Houston and the Florida Keys, thousands of people still don’t have homes. In Puerto Rico, full electricity services have not been restored and those that have power know it can go out at any moment. At least 200 people were killed on the US mainland in the storms and the death toll in Puerto Rico is expected to be hundreds of people higher than the 64 reported by the island’s government. Other islands in the Caribbean were also badly hit. These catastrophic events unleashed death and destruction but also an outpouring of support from people with no connection to the regions affected. As the holiday season approaches, nonprofits leading the recovery continue to see significant donations that will help provide food, water and shelter to those still in need. Three months since the trio of storms unleashed life-threatening rain and winds, the Guardian spoke with people on the frontlines of the recovery. Puerto Rico: Christmas lights brighten the dark Residents like Jessica Fontánez are decorating their houses and powering them with the aid of portable gas-powered generators. “I debated whether to decorate or not since we have no power, but I got motivated to do it right after my nine-year-old daughter asked me, ‘Mom, if we don’t have a Christmas tree, where will Santa put all the presents?’ Now I just use the generator to turn it on for a few hours every day,” said Fontánez, who lives in the Caguas municipality. Fontánez has also moved her traditional Christmas dinner to lunchtime to reduce the impact on her generator. At least 100,000 Puerto Ricans have left the island but the 3.3 million who remain have adapted their lives, and now Christmas traditions, to the limits imposed by the storm. Christmas specialities like roasted pork, pasteles and Ron Cañita are only available at premium prices and traditionally festive city squares are withholding Christmas decorations because government funds are supporting recovery efforts. The darkness has also inspired debates about decorating with Christmas lights. In the Vega Alta municipality, the local government did not have money to use on Christmas decorations so it transformed wooden scraps, metal panels and other debris into Christmas trees, ornaments, traditional miniature homes, and cheerful boards. A dead white indigo berry tree that toppled during the storm was placed in the center of the square. “It’s free, natural, and local. It looks like a corpse, but what can we do,” said Juan Negrón, a resident of Vega Alta who helped deliver the tree to the square. Negrón smiled as he explained how this Christmas reminds him of his childhood holidays in the 1960s, when a small white indigo berry tree, or Tintillo as it’s known locally, would be decorated like a Christmas tree. “Technologically, we’ve gone over 15 years back in time after the hurricane. This tree represents that. Still, we must celebrate the holidays; it’s a tradition we must not lose. We can’t stop celebrating because of these natural occurrences,” said Negron. Three months after Hurricane Maria carved a trail of destruction across Puerto Rico, the island remains cloaked in darkness, with electricity services not expected to be restored until early next year. People there are living in a lingering disaster zone, with acts of daily life defined by the recovery: food can’t be stored in refrigerators, traffic lights don’t work in many places and restaurants, malls and bars remain shuttered. Many Puerto Ricans have questioned the sensibility of adding unnecessary energy consumption to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (Prepa), especially when so many people still don’t have reliable access to a generator, or the money to pay for one. Prepa’s director of occupational safety and health, Shehaly Rosado Flores, said extra energy consumption generated by Christmas decorations does not affect their efforts to restore power across the island. The US Army Corp of Engineers estimated that power would not fully be restored to Puerto Rico until the end of May – a full eight months since Maria hit. The most remote areas will likely be the last to have power restored. “There is not enough you can say about the need for electricity. You can’t operate society without it,” said José Calderón, president of the Hispanic Federation, which created the Unidos disaster relief and recovery program for Puerto Rico. Unidos has provided water filtration systems, medical support, meals, solar lamps, mosquito nets and other supplies to more than 500,000 Puerto Ricans. More than 175,000 from all 50 states and 23 countries donated to the group, which has delivered 3.4mn lbs of food and water across the island. Calderón said he was uplifted by how many people donated, including people who have no connection to the island and children as young as three and four who he said had sent their allowance. But, three months on from Maria, he is still frustrated by the federal government’s response. Calderón said: “It is actually criminal what our federal government has done in Puerto Rico.” Houston, Texas: ‘All I want for Christmas is housing’ Electricity returned to Houston days after Hurricane Harvey hit, but cheer was still in short supply when two-dozen Houstonians rallied outside City Hall in mid-December to sing a festive song with a twist: “All I want for Christmas… is housing.” Christmas Day marks exactly four months since Hurricane Harvey made landfall about 200 miles south-west of Houston, dropping 50-odd inches of rain over parts of southeast Texas and causing widespread flooding. Across the state about 900,000 people applied for federal assistance. Tens of thousands of people in Houston were forced out of their homes. While life is back to normal in much of the area, plenty of properties remain unusable and many residents are still in hotels and other forms of temporary accommodation. Thomas Babineaux and his wife, Julie, who have an 18-year-old son, were among those who gathered to call on the city council to distribute more federal relief money quickly to fund housing for low-income families. They had hoped to move into an apartment in time for Christmas after spending a month in a hotel. They did not leave their home when it was flooded, he said, because they had nowhere else to go. But mould and mildew quickly grew and the couple developed respiratory problems. After losing all their possessions, it is hard to find money for presents. “We had to start out fresh,” said Julie, who has breast cancer. “We can’t really celebrate because we’ve got to find a way to get a place to stay.” Some displaced families discovered that moving out of flooded places created a new set of challenges. Elsa Bazaldua came to Houston after her apartment in the coastal town of Rockport, a three-hour drive away, was wrecked. But the home where she currently lives with her husband and four children, paying $650 a month in rent after signing a one-year lease, is poorly maintained and the cost of water is extortionate, she said, clutching a bill for $189. She is a cleaner, though not working at the moment, and her husband works in construction. “I don’t know if we’re even going to do Christmas this year,” she said through a translator. Willie Fegans loves hosting her three daughters and grandchildren for Christmas dinner but this year she is skipping the family tradition. The apartment where she lived for three years with her husband flooded up to knee height and after a spell in a hotel a charity found them a unit at an apartment complex. But the 61-year-old does not feel safe. “I’m scared to stay there because every day they’re out there shooting,” she said. “I won’t take my family there. Too much violence. I was at home cooking and I heard what I thought was two cars crashing, I went to the door and it was a dude shooting at another guy, he hit a sign and lost control.” They sleep on the floor because they are worried that a stray bullet might fly through the window and hit them while they are in bed, she said. On Christmas Day, she added, “I’ll probably go to one of my daughters’ houses. Bullets don’t have no name, don’t have no eyes, my family could be there and they could be out there shooting and somebody in my family could get killed. I don’t want to take that chance. “I haven’t even thought about gifts for Christmas because I’m too busy worrying about getting somewhere to live that’s safe.” The Florida Keys: ‘Christmas is more powerful this year’ Hurricane Irma skirted Puerto Rico days before making landfall in Florida, where the Keys bared the brunt of the Category 4 hurricane destruction. Tourist hotspot Key West emerged with minimal damage but three months out from the storm, other Keys islands are still recovering from the housing crisis the storm left behind. Thousands were displaced from Big Pine Key, Cudjoe Key, Marathon and Ramrod Key where many people lived in mobile homes, houseboats or vulnerable homes that were not up to modern property codes. “For some families it’s probably going to be a year before they are rebuilt, have a place again,” said Bill Mann, co-ceo of the Florida Keys Children’s Shelter. Mann said families are split because people have moved to the mainland, but have jobs in the keys – or vice versa – or are working more jobs to survive. Mann said one young boy the shelter assisted told them the one thing he wanted most for Christmas was to see his dad, a single father, more often because he is now working a second job. Floridians have donated many toys to the shelter so Mann expected the children the shelter helps will all have presents to open on Christmas day, but families still desperately need grocery gift cards and home improvement gift cards. And tourism, Mann said, because it is a foundation of the region’s economy. Caribbean islands that suffered in the storm also rely on tourism and are encouraging people to visit to aid the recovery. In Big Pine Key, the rebuilding effort is also coming from informal social media networks. Hervé Thomas, who has lived in Big Pine Key since 1998, created a Facebook group to help coordinate the community’s response to Irma. For Christmas, the group organized a surprise for 12 families, including 32 children, hit hard by the hurricane – Santa Claus at their door in a fire truck, delivering presents donated by community members. Last week, a woman who assists children in the domestic abuse system said she needed Christmas presents for seven children. Within three hours people had responded with donations, including paying for a meal for the caretaker. “You can’t block good when it’s on its path,” Thomas said. His home was perfectly intact after the hurricane but just 100ft away, a neighbor’s home was completely destroyed. He said Big Pine Key looked like a warzone immediately after Irma and that feeling remains in some of the devastated homes. There are fewer decorations around the Keys and fewer homes to fill with Christmas trees, but Thomas said he felt this Christmas was more powerful than in years past. “You can feel there is something,” Thomas said. “If I think about it I believe it’s maybe an answer to the strength of what we went through.” He continued to say Christmas provided some relief. “You can drop everything and say it’s Christmas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/17/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T21:00:40Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/17/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/17/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• In a review of a performance by ex-Keane singer Tom Chaplin, we misnamed his former bandmate, the drummer Richard Hughes, as Russell Hughes (Not a Christmas jumper in sight as indie’s evergreen choirboy serves up a chilly set, 15 December, page 42). • Other recently corrected articles include: Families with stable jobs at risk of homelessness in England, report finds Toni &amp; Guy co-founder Giuseppe Toni Mascolo dies aged 75"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/15/canadas-spy-agency-settles-lawsuit-over-alleged-racist-and-homophobic-bullying","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T17:42:38Z","webTitle":"Canada's spy agency settles lawsuit over alleged racist and homophobic bullying","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/canadas-spy-agency-settles-lawsuit-over-alleged-racist-and-homophobic-bullying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/15/canadas-spy-agency-settles-lawsuit-over-alleged-racist-and-homophobic-bullying","fields":{"headline":"Canada's spy agency settles lawsuit over alleged racist and homophobic bullying","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Canada’s spy service has settled a C$35m lawsuit launched by five employees who alleged they suffered years of bullying in a workplace rife with racism, homophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment. The allegations against the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, documented in a statement of claim filed in July in Federal Court, offered a view into one of the country’s most secretive organisations. Based on the experiences of five veteran employees, court documents painted a picture of a hostile work environment where “racist, sexist, homophobic and discriminatory behaviour has become the accepted culture and norm”. None of the allegations were proved in court. On Thursday CSIS director David Vigneault said in a statement that a settlement had been negotiated, describing it as “in the best interest of those concerned”. He gave no details on the terms of the settlement, calling it a confidential matter. “CSIS does not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or bullying under any circumstances,” he said. “The complexity of the ever-evolving threat environment requires that all CSIS employees are equipped to give their best. As such, I strongly believe in leading an organization where each employee promotes a workplace which is free from harassment and conducive to the equitable treatment of all individuals.” In the statement of claim, the five employees allege that some members of management mocked, abused and threatened employees, setting a tone that permeated through the 3,300-person workforce. When confronted, the managers in question allegedly refused to acknowledge the behaviour as wrongful conduct. One employee, who is gay and has a Muslim partner, alleged that since he had arrived at the Toronto office 10 years ago, some managers routinely highlighted his sexuality in day to day communication, using terms such as “gay boy”, “fag”, “fag boy” and “homo”. Several of the plaintiffs described a workplace where anti-Islamic comments and views were commonplace, while one intelligence officer alleged she was made to feel by management as though she was a “token black woman (who) was promoted without merit”. All five employees said they had taken extended leave from the agency and, in several cases, were struggling with stress, anxiety and depression that they linked to their treatment at the agency. The agency was the latest Canadian security force to be rocked by accusations of inappropriate behaviour. Last year the Royal Canadian Mounted Police formally apologised and earmarked C$100m for payouts to hundreds of current and former female officers who were subjected to sexual harassment and discrimination, while a 2015 investigation into the Canadian armed forces uncovered widespread sexual misconduct and hostility towards minorities and women."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/15/london-overground-goes-24-hour-joining-night-tube","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T19:37:19Z","webTitle":"London Overground goes 24-hour, joining night tube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/15/london-overground-goes-24-hour-joining-night-tube","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/15/london-overground-goes-24-hour-joining-night-tube","fields":{"headline":"London Overground goes 24-hour, joining night tube","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Passengers in east London will from now on be able to travel on the “night overground”. The 24-hour services will operate on Friday and Saturday nights on the London Overground. The service currently ends at around 12.30am from Monday to Saturday. Trains will run approximately every 15 minutes between Dalston Junction, east London, and New Cross Gate, south-east London, throughout the night. However, it will not call at Whitechapel station due to Crossrail works, which will finish in summer 2018. The service will extend further northwards to Highbury &amp; Islington next year. Londoners working through the night, as well as late-night revellers, looked forward to the start of the service. Some people on social media declared that they intended to ride the line all night. Currently it can take well over an hour to make the journey on a bus from south-east London to east London after the departure of the last train. The maiden voyage of the service comes just after London Overground celebrated a decade since it first began connecting people on its orbital route around inner London. It currently serves 23 of the capital’s boroughs, as well as southern Hertfordshire, since it took over from Silverlink Metro services in 2007. The launch follows the introduction of the night tube on the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly and Victoria lines. More than 9m journeys have been made since it began last year, contributing more than £170m to London’s economy, according to the city mayor’s office. Work is currently under way to improve the Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines. Once modernisation is complete in 2023, the night tube can potentially be introduced on those lines. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, hailed the start of the night overground in east London. “Londoners and visitors alike will be able to use the service to help them enjoy everything that this buzzing part of the city has to offer as well as providing a significant boost to the night-time economy,” he said. Amy Lamé, appointed as London’s night tsar, who champions the night-time economy, welcomed Khan’s announcement. “From Dalston to New Cross, the ‘ginger’ line is world-renowned for its incredible nightlife and diverse culture,” she said. “Ensuring London thrives as a 24-hour city is a top priority for the mayor, so I’m delighted the night overground is joining the night tube in providing a safe and efficient service to thousands of passengers, whether they’re partying all night, or working to keep the city ticking around the clock.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/15/eu-to-force-companies-to-disclose-owners-with-directive-prompted-by-panama-papers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T18:23:20Z","webTitle":"EU to force firms to reveal true owners in wake of Panama Papers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/eu-to-force-companies-to-disclose-owners-with-directive-prompted-by-panama-papers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/15/eu-to-force-companies-to-disclose-owners-with-directive-prompted-by-panama-papers","fields":{"headline":"EU to force firms to reveal true owners in wake of Panama Papers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Companies across the EU will be forced to disclose their true owners under new legislation prompted by the release of the Panama Papers. Anti-corruption campaigners applauded the agreement as a major step in the fight against tax evasion and money laundering, but expressed disappointment that trusts will mostly escape scrutiny. The revised terms of the EU’s fourth anti-money laundering directive include: A requirement for companies to disclose their beneficial, or true, owners in a publicly available register. Data on the beneficial owners of trusts to be available to tax and law enforcement authorities, as well as sectors with an obligation to follow anti-money laundering rules, such as lawyers. A requirement for member states to verify beneficial ownership information submitted to their registers. Extending anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism regulations to apply to virtual currencies, provision of tax services and those dealing in works of art. EU member states will have 18 months to transpose the new directive into domestic legislation. As a current member of the EU, the UK will implement the legislation. “This is a big breakthrough and confirms that full transparency of corporate ownership is now the global standard against which other countries will be judged,” said Laure Brillaud, the anti-money laundering policy officer at Transparency International EU. “The EU deserves credit for taking this bold leap to end the secrecy that facilitates corruption, tax evasion and other crimes.” Global Witness applauded the move “in the face of opposition from countries like the UK, Luxembourg, Ireland, Malta and Cyprus,” but criticised the failure to introduce the same requirements for trusts. Unlike companies, which are legal entities, trusts are effectively agreements between two or more parties, which has traditionally allowed them to escape aspects of tax and crime legislation. “Today’s deal will make it much harder for the criminal and corrupt to use EU companies, but trusts are an even better ‘getaway car’. They are the ultimate black box, so secretive that even the taxman and the police can’t see who is behind them,” said Murray Worthy, a senior campaigner at Global Witness. “Despite numerous scandals showing their use in cases of corruption and tax evasion, the deal reached today will do almost nothing to tackle this.” The changes also include new rules on the use of pre-paid cards. The cards, which are issued by companies including MasterCard and Visa, can be loaded with cash and used online and in shops without need for the same checks as are made on debit and credit card payments. After the terrorist attacks in Paris, French authorities found that the perpetrators had used prepaid cards in their preparations. Under the revised rules, member states will have to limit how much can be spent anonymously to €150 in a shop and €50 online. The agreement is likely to make it harder for the UK to resist imposing the same transparency standards on its network of crown dependencies and overseas territories, many of which are major tax havens. Negotiations to revise the fourth anti-money laundering directive were launched partly as a response to publication of the Panama Papers in 2016. The leaked Mossack Fonseca files revealed how offshore companies are used to hide assets and wealth. In his first UK lecture since leaving office, the former prime minister David Cameron said on Wednesday that “the cancer of corruption is developing, metastasising and becoming more commonplace, more complex, more multi-layered, elusive and ingrained”. He also defended his record on engaging with the UK’s crown dependencies and overseas territories, which have consistently resisted international moves towards greater transparency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/17/cryptocurrency-christmas-cheer-bitcoin","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Bring a little Christmas cheer with a cryptocurrency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/17/cryptocurrency-christmas-cheer-bitcoin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/17/cryptocurrency-christmas-cheer-bitcoin","fields":{"headline":"Bring a little Christmas cheer with a cryptocurrency","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"What do you buy the person who has everything? How about bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that has hardly been out of the headlines in the past few weeks? Of course there is a problem, and that is that a surge of interest has seen its price increase by a factor of 17 this year and by more than 15% last week alone. But if you are really determined to take part in the volatility, there are other ways. Part of last week’s interest came because bitcoin effectively entered the mainstream, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange launching contracts allowing investors to bet on the future price of the currency. This weekend, Chicago-based CME follows suit, albeit with higher margin requirements – how much investors have to set aside as collateral – than its rival’s. But if ever there were a case of caveat emptor, it’s here. There have been a number of comparisons with 17th century tulipmania, and warnings of a bubble that could easily burst. Howard Davies, chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, the European Central Bank and America’s Securities and Exchange Commission have all expressed varying degrees of scepticism, with several calls for increased investor protection. So it’s probably not a good Christmas present for any of them. Little rest for Carney after Brexit stress test Even in the run-up to the festive celebrations, Mark Carney remains busy. After last week’s interest rate meeting and a weekend trade trip to China, the Bank of England governor is up before MPs at the Treasury select committee on Wednesday to discuss last month’s financial stability report. Carney, along with deputy governor Sam Woods and two members of the financial policy committee, will be quizzed about the report, the latest health check on the state of Britain’s banks. It concluded that high street banks would be able to withstand a disorderly Brexit – unless another crisis happened at the same time. The Bank’s health check tested for resilience if Britain’s GDP fell by 4.7%, unemployment rose to 9.5%, and residential property prices dropped by 33%. Other factors included sterling plunging and interest rates soaring to 4%. All banks passed these stress tests, although Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays only just struggled over the necessary hurdles. The Bank had also been keen to put across its view that there should be a Brexit transition deal by Christmas. The way things are going, MPs might legitimately ask on Wednesday which Christmas it meant. LSE still reeling from angry exchanges A bust-up at the London Stock Exchange is set to come to a head this week: investor TCI wants to oust the company’s chairman, Donald Brydon, over his handling of the departure of chief executive Xavier Rolet. To recap: the LSE said in October it was looking for a successor to Rolet after it emerged he would leave by the end of next year. But a surprise statement a month later said he would in fact step down with immediate effect, at the board’s request. TCI had wanted him to stay on and Brydon to go, and had put forward resolutions to that effect. After the news of Rolet’s immediate departure, it gave up on getting him to stay but is pressing on with its demands for Brydon’s head. Shareholder advisory group Pirc is not convinced by the LSE’s actions. Pirc said: “[Rolet’s] sudden departure requires further transparency and information. The lack of disclosure is troubling and demonstrates substandard corporate governance … Donald Brydon has therefore failed to maintain good governance standards.” But Brydon looks likely to survive the vote. TCI holds 5% of the LSE but the Qatar Investment Authority, a 10.37% shareholder, is backing the board. Brydon is due to step down in 2019 in any case, but you couldn’t rule out a repeat performance next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/17/diane-abbott-labour-does-not-support-a-second-eu-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T12:23:58Z","webTitle":"Diane Abbott: Labour does not support a second EU referendum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/17/diane-abbott-labour-does-not-support-a-second-eu-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/17/diane-abbott-labour-does-not-support-a-second-eu-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Diane Abbott: Labour does not support a second EU referendum","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Diane Abbott has insisted Labour rejects the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, saying the electorate will get a say through their MPs when parliament votes on the final deal. The shadow home secretary was challenged on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show after the Guardian published a letter she had written to constituents in her Hackney North and Stoke Newington seat, saying: “I will argue for the right of the electorate to vote on any deal that is finally agreed.” Confronted with the wording of the letter, she said: “It’s about the electorate, and we have a parliamentary system, and we did agree, last week, against the wishes of the government, that parliament will have a final vote on the deal, and I think that’s very important, and it will allow MPs to reflect the views of the electorate.” She added: “The Labour party does not support a second referendum, and we’ve never supported it, and we don’t support it now.” However, Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said in a separate interview that Labour backing for a referendum could not be completely ruled out. Appearing on Pienaar’s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: “We’ve not said we want a second referendum. What we actually want is a negotiated settlement. The point about the vote this week was we don’t want power to be taken away from unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, as the debate went in the referendum, to be given to the executive or unelected bureaucrats in Whitehall. We want parliament to have a say on it.” When pushed on whether Labour would rule out a second referendum, Watson said: “When you’re in complex negotiations on behalf of the nation, you shouldn’t rule anything out. What I am trying to say to you [is] I don’t think it is likely at all. It would be more likely that we try and renegotiate the deal should parliament reject it.” Theresa May was defeated in the House of Commons on Wednesday when 11 of her MPs supported an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill aimed at ensuring that the “meaningful” vote on the Brexit deal repeatedly promised by the government must happen before Britain leaves. Another looming parliamentary showdown appears to have been averted after rebel MPs backed a compromise amendment on the government’s demand that the date of Brexit be enshrined in the bill. A referendum on the final deal is one of the key demands of the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, as part of what he calls “exit from Brexit”, though the Lib Dems failed to make as much progress as they had hoped in June’s general election with stopping Brexit as their flagship policy. Offering voters the chance to ratify the Brexit deal in a referendum was one of the clearest dividing lines in last year’s Labour leadership contest in which Jeremy Corbyn defeated the challenger Owen Smith. Smith is now on Labour’s frontbench as shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Asked about a claim last week by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, that Labour would accept “easy movement” of EU citizens into the UK after Brexit, Abbott said the party was keen to reduce the bureaucracy of the system. “When we leave the single market, freedom of movement will fall. What we will put in its place is fair rules and a reasonable management of migration. A part of that will be moving away from the bureaucracy that bedevils the current system.” She said the question of whether EU citizens would require a visa to travel into the UK in future would depend on the outcome of the government’s negotiations with the EU27."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/18/football-transfer-rumours-jonny-evans-back-to-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T07:46:47Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Jonny Evans back to Manchester United?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/18/football-transfer-rumours-jonny-evans-back-to-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/18/football-transfer-rumours-jonny-evans-back-to-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Jonny Evans back to Manchester United?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"José Mourinho knows a thing or two about allowing players to leave a Premier League club only to watch them turn into incredibly influential footballers elsewhere. Isn’t that right Kevin, Mo, Romelu and Nemanja? He hopes to redress the balance slightly – but not by rectifying one of his own mistakes. No, he’ll fix his moody stare on Louis van Gaal, who allowed Jonny Evans to join West Brom for £6m in 2015, as he attempts to pip Manchester City and Arsenal to the centre-back’s signature in the hope he can slot him into the Eric Bailly-shaped hole that exists in his Manchester United back line since the Ivorian’s ankle injury. Mourinho got a good first-hand look at what the 29-year-old can do in Sunday’s 2-1 win at The Hawthorns and believes he’s more than capable of parking a Manchester United bus instead of a West Brom one. Chelsea will rummage through the ash-strewn remains of Monaco’s squad in January until they find Thomas Lemar, at which moment they’ll leave £50m and a bewildered Michy Batshuayi on the steps of Stade Louis II before whisking the 22-year-old away to Stamford Bridge. And it says here that Juventus are willing to bring the hammer down on the highest bidder for defender Alex Sandro, who Chelsea wanted in the summer. But they’ll face stiff competition from Manchester United, Manchester City and PSG for the £60m-rated player. Wilfried Zaha’s name has also been whispered around Stamford Bridge in recent weeks. If Zaha does join Chelsea he may find himself being managed by an Italian other than Antonio Conte. There is some seriously hot gossip doing the rounds that shiny high-end managerial autopilot, Carlo Ancelotti, will return for a second stint at Stamford Bridge. He was sacked in 2011, a season after winning the Double, because that’s football for you. He hasn’t lasted more than two seasons anywhere since but he’s still kept things ticking over to the tune of two league titles, a domestic cup and the Champions League at PSG, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. Not bad considering for the most part he was doing it with his feet up while looking wistful and smoking multiple cigarettes. And where might Conte end up? Real Madrid, that’s where. Sam Allardyce has instructed Everton beancounters to find a wad of cash big enough to reunite him with Crystal Palace’s Christian Benteke, having decided that the only way to properly replace a big Belgian striker, is with a big Belgian striker. Allardyce also has the hots for Sevilla’s £35m-rated Steven N’Zonzi but Arsenal are favourites to bring the former Stoke defensive midfielder back to the Premier League. If Benteke does leave Crystal Palace then Roy Hodgson will bid £10m for strapping centre-forward Guido Carrillo, who is also lurking somewhere among the Monaco leftovers (see above). Jürgen Klopp just can’t get enough of tricky winger-cum-forwards so Liverpool will attempt to prise 20-year-old Federico Chiesa away from Fiorentina for a cool £53m. Spurs are also interested but all the zips on Daniel Levy’s pockets are stuck. Again. One man on his way out of Anfield is former Red Star midfielder Marko Grujic, who can’t even get a game in that one-paced midfield. Aston Villa and Brighton want the 21-year-old on loan. And if Mauricio Pellegrino is still Southampton’s manager in January he says he hasn’t ruled out letting Virgil van Dijk leave. Did you hear that Liverpool fans? Barcelona want a ball-playing defender to replace Javier Mascherano. Step forward, um, Daley Blind? Yes, the Manchester United utility player ticks all the Catalan club’s boxes but Internazionale fancy luring him to Serie A, where they too can offer him a role in a proper title race rather than the joyless schlep towards a second-placed finish 1,000 points behind Manchester City he faces being a part of at Old Trafford. And members of Antoine Griezmann’s family have met with Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu, so expect the Atlético striker to turn up at the Camp Nou in the summer then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/26/researchers-to-study-school-records-for-clues-on-suicide-and-self-harm","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T15:00:51Z","webTitle":"Researchers to study school records for clues on suicide and self-harm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/26/researchers-to-study-school-records-for-clues-on-suicide-and-self-harm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/26/researchers-to-study-school-records-for-clues-on-suicide-and-self-harm","fields":{"headline":"Researchers to study school records for clues on suicide and self-harm","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Researchers are embarking on an ambitious project to see whether a child’s school record can provide vital clues as to whether they are at risk of suicide or self-harm. Nearly one in 10 young people self-harm or have suicidal thoughts but understanding of the causes is limited, making prevention difficult. By analysing anonymised school data for 180,000 10- to 17-year-olds in south London, including on attendance and performance, and linking it to their health and hospital records, researchers hope to identify the most important risk factors, paving the way for early intervention. The lead researcher, Rina Dutta, a senior clinical lecturer in the psychological medicine department at King’s College London, said young people felt under more pressure than in the past, which had led to self-harm becoming almost normalised. “We have got about three children in every state school class who will eventually have these issues so I think it’s good that we’ll be able to intervene earlier,” said Dutta. “If we are able to have a better picture of which schools in particular are having this issue then we can target potentially high-need schools and colleges and maybe the culture will change earlier and we can prevent future problems.” The data will be drawn from Croydon, Lambeth, Lewisham and Southwark, which are all covered by South London and Maudsley NHS foundation trust. It will include potentially stressful events for children, such as starting exams and changing schools, as well as absences and whether they have suffered bullying/abuse. The researchers will also have information on deprivation indicators at the schools, including the percentage of pupils receiving free school meals. The school records can be linked to information held by health services and hospitals, although the researchers will receive it all as anonymised data that cannot be traced to individuals. Dutta and colleagues will be able to look at whether a child has special needs or long-term physical health conditions and their levels of engagement – if any – with child and adolescent mental health services. Hospital records will show up whether a child has been admitted to A&amp;E after self-harm or suicidal behaviour. When put together, the researchers hope the data will help identify warning signs in school records that could lead to children and/or their schools being given targeted help in future. Dutta said: “Individual-level risk factors such as mental ill health, abuse and neglect, bullying, social isolation or withdrawal, alcohol and illicit drugs, bereavement and experience of suicide are well known. Much less is understood about educational risk factors for self-harm and suicidal behaviour in young people, which is why our research is so important and innovative. “As a team, we are really optimistic we will have some good data and results which will have an impact and enable us to intervene, which is what we want to be able to do.” The project is being funded by the mental health research charity MQ. Sophie Dix, the director of research at MQ, said: “Rina’s project offers hope to the thousands of young people and their families who are devastated by suicide and self-harm. Right now, too many children are left struggling with their mental health in silence, without the help they desperately need. “If schools and services were able to identify which young people are at risk, we could intervene early and save lives. This research offers the opportunity to fill that gap, highlighting the children most at risk of suicidal behaviours so we can get them vital support.” The first official UK statistics on suicides among 10- to 14-year-olds, published last year, showed that between 2005 to 2014 a total of 98 children in that age group killed themselves. Research published last month found that annually between 2001 and 2014, across 10- to 19-year-olds, 37.4 girls per 10,000 of the population and just over 12 boys per 10,000 reported their first episode of self-harm. Brain scan study Researchers are analysing brain scans of young people across the world, as well as data on their behaviour, to try to predict who is in danger of suicide, in another project funded by MQ. The Hopes project will examine brain images from around 4,000 young people across 15 different countries as part of an attempt to create the largest dataset of its kind looking at the emergence of suicide in young people. Together with data on suicidal behaviour and traits, the researchers hope this will enable them to identify unique social and biological factors that make young people more likely to attempt suicide. As well as brain scans, they will be collecting health service data, self-reporting on daily routines, monitoring through mobile phones and information gathered from personal interviews. Ultimately, their goal is to provide those working with young people with tools to predict individuals at highest risk of suicide, facilitating early intervention. The international nature of the project leads the researchers to hope that it will yield results of relevance to young people in countries across cultural and income boundaries. The project will be led by the University of Cambridge, working with scientists from the US and Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/17/melbourne-lord-mayor-stands-down-for-a-month-after-harassment-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T03:02:43Z","webTitle":"Melbourne lord mayor stands down for a month after harassment allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/17/melbourne-lord-mayor-stands-down-for-a-month-after-harassment-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/17/melbourne-lord-mayor-stands-down-for-a-month-after-harassment-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Melbourne lord mayor stands down for a month after harassment allegations","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The lord mayor of Melbourne has stood down for a month amid allegations of sexual harassment. Robert Doyle announced on Sunday he was taking leave while an investigation into claims against him takes place. “My decision to take leave must not be interpreted as any concession or admission,” Doyle said in a statement. Doyle said he had been officially informed of an allegation against him on Sunday morning. “I welcome the investigation and will cooperate fully to clear my name,” he said. “I am shocked. I have not been officially informed of the specifics but find the allegations detailed to me by media outlets thoroughly abhorrent, not only as lord mayor but as a father of young women, a husband, a brother and as the head of an office made up entirely of women.” Doyle said he was “frustrated” that he had not been given specifics of the allegations and said the release of details to the media was a “strategic” act that was damaging to his reputation and a “denial of natural justice”. The City of Melbourne chief executive, Ben Rimmer, said he was made aware of the allegations on Friday night and had ordered an external investigation to be headed by Ian Freckleton QC. “On Friday evening I was made aware of serious allegations – including sexual harassment, indecent assault and misconduct – against the lord mayor, Robert Doyle AC,” Rimmer said in a statement. “I have today informed the lord mayor that these allegations have been made.” Doyle’s announcement comes after it emerged City of Melbourne councillor Tessa Sullivan left her job on Friday.

The 63-year-old’s resignation could be misconstrued as professional downsizing, but she describes the move as more like leaving a long and happy marriage for a more compelling mistress. “I realised I was just falling more and more in love with Wow. I’ve had a passionate relationship with the Southbank Centre for all these years – but when I started the Wow festival, that was really me coming out as a woman.” In 2010, Kelly felt feminism was in a lull. “Women were being told they’d never had it so good – which was a terrible injustice.” Since then she has staged 49 festivals in 23 countries over five continents, featuring talks, debates, performances and activism involving more than two million people, among them Malala Yousafzai, Christine Lagarde and Salma Hayek. How Kelly has managed this while running Britain’s biggest arts centre is a mystery that begins to become clearer over a lunch of fish pie and diet coke near the Royal Festival Hall. Although petite in stature, Kelly crackles with spry energy and formidable ambition. “I’d always been a feminist, but I’d reached a point where I looked at the amazing things I was curating and thought, ‘The reality is, the majority of the canon is created by men, and if the culture keeps on reiterating over and over again this idea that creativity is male, then it permeates absolutely everything else. And you have to do something. Saying you’re a feminist is not enough.” Eight years on, the world is catching up with Kelly. The #MeToo and Time’s Up movements are bringing a global focus on feminism not seen in decades, and Kelly is well aware that this year’s festival in London in March will attract unprecedented interest. “To be able to say: ‘Here’s a vehicle for many different people from many different backgrounds to debate and be creative and have fun’ – that’s a very handy thing to offer.” Wow is billed as bringing “people together from all corners of society”, so I’m curious to know if there are any Kelly would not want to see on stage. Catherine Deneuve, for example, provoked the wrath of the #MeToo movement recently, for signing an open letter denouncing it as a “witch-hunt”. Would the French actor be welcome at Wow? “Yes, absolutely. I think that’s an interesting discussion.” How about Marine Le Pen? “No.” Ivanka Trump? Kelly falls silent for 12 seconds while she thinks. “We-ll, I think it’s a very good question. I think you’d have to put Ivanka Trump in the context of a genuine drilling-down interview. I’d have to be sure that she was prepared to look at how she squares being a feminist, as she calls herself.” Kelly doesn’t dispense a neat definition of her brand of feminism, but as she talks, it becomes clear that it is more radical than Ivanka Trump’s – or indeed the version promoted by Tina Brown’s US festival, Women in the World, with which Kelly’s is often confused. When I ask her to characterise the difference between the two festivals, Kelly considers her answer carefully before offering: “Well, it’s $900 (£630) a ticket for Women in the World. That’s the difference. So I think that changes the nature of something. What I’ve tried to do in Wow is make it look like the women of the world. People arriving shouldn’t look round and think, ‘Oh, this is my tribe.’ Tribalism doesn’t help. So it isn’t useful to simply applaud women who have ‘made it’ in the conventional sense. That’s implying that that’s the gold standard of success. We’ve got so many things to solve and we’re not going to solve them by just mimicking where society’s got up to so far. You’d be billing the women who have ‘made it’ as the most important – whereas I think we should be looking at change, and who’s making change happen. That’s the most exciting thing. The status quo is not what we’re after. So, going back to Ivanka Trump – yes, I’d invite her, but only if the conversation’s interesting. Not if someone is simply there to grandstand who they are. Wow doesn’t do a PR campaign for individual women.” Last year, she was forced to postpone the appearance of two speakers, Thordis Elva and Tom Stranger, co-authors of a remarkable book called South of Forgiveness, about Stranger’s rape of Elva and the enduring impact of his crime on them both. From Kelly’s expression when I bring this up, I get the impression she’s still bruised by the uproar. “The gender equality debate is complex. And most people don’t want complexity, we have to grapple with that fact.” She had invited the pair to speak after seeing their TED Talk. “There is a real need to get men to talk about rape and sexual harassment. They have to start considering, ‘Well, what does entitlement mean?’ I don’t want to put these things exactly side by side, but white racism has had horrific effects for centuries, and at a certain point white people have got to go, ‘Why have we felt that we’re entitled like that?’ So men have got to have that conversation. And I thought, ‘Here’s an opportunity for a man to make the clear statement that it was entitlement that made him do it.’” But protesters demanded Stranger be no-platformed, and the pair’s appearance at the Southbank Centre had to be rescheduled to a later date. I ask Kelly if she has ever been sexually assaulted. “Oh yes,” and reels off the incidents casually. “In the workplace, when I was a waitress. And I’ve been flashed at, several times and put in situations of real danger. And I’ve been stalked. Of course.” She wasn’t at all surprised by the results released this week by the Stage of its survey of sexual harassment, bullying and assault within the industry. A third of respondents reported experiencing harassment, and almost one in 10 had been sexually assaulted. “When you have a dynamic that is so much about, ‘Are you pleased with what I do?’ and ‘Do you like what I do?’, these things are very exploitable.” Notwithstanding this, women have made more inroads into the professional hierarchy of theatre than in film. The first female director of a major London theatre was appointed in 2012; the number grew to five within as many years, and Kelly runs the Southbank Centre with an all-female leadership team – but when I ask why she thinks theatreland has been more porous than the film industry for women, she offers a wry smile. “Well, mainly because theatre is poorer. Traditionally, the more money there is, the less porous it is. That is absolutely the reason, I’m sure.” Does she share the now common complaint that the workplace rules of gender relations are mystifyingly elusive? “No,” she says briskly. “One of the things I say to people at work is: ‘Anything you wouldn’t do to your boss, don’t do.’ So would you suddenly fling your arm around your boss’s shoulder and tickle her on the ear? You probably wouldn’t do that, would you? Would you wolf-whistle your boss? Probably not. So don’t do it to anyone else either. Women don’t want to have to defend women’s dignity on their own. We need men and women together to do it. Men need to be accomplices in change, not just a bit supportive. They have to want it as well.” Kelly is not without sympathy, though. “Men have been taught that they might be considered a bit dull if they’re not laddish. I have a daughter, but I also have a son, I have a partner, I have a dad, I have lots of men in my life who I love, and I can see if you put women in a prison and say, ‘This is what you are, this is what you have to be,’ there’s also a prison for men. And just because they are socially more powerful, it doesn’t mean that each individual man has the individual power.” Technically, she remains married to the father of her children, now both grown up, but they have been separated for 16 years and she lives with the author Andrew Cracknell, who has three daughters. Kelly herself came of age in the late 60s, during the second wave of feminism; she and her sisters were the first generation in her working class Liverpool family to go to university, and her younger self might have marvelled at the freedoms her daughters and stepdaughters enjoy today. When I ask if their generation of young women face anything harder than hers did, she doesn’t need to pause to think. “Social media. And pornography. And body image. The notion of perfection – female perfection – that wasn’t there back then.” Does any bit of her share the view of some that the #MeToo movement has gone “too far”? After another 12-second pause: “We-ell, I don’t believe it’s good for women – or anybody – to troll other women with crude and violent statements. I think that’s really a huge mistake. That’s too far for me. I think we should be trying to operate from love.” The venom unleashed against Lena Dunham, for example, after her public posts in defence of a male colleague accused of assault, was “unhelpful” and ugly. “It makes people feel that the argument has gone too far. But actually, it’s the reaction to the argument” – the harsh, judgmental condemnation – “that’s gone too far”. If Kelly had any doubts about her decision to leave the Southbank Centre, the manner in which it was reported would have settled her mind. “If you look at the reporting of me stepping down, it was something like, ‘Another woman leader leaves the arts’.” She rolls her eyes. “Nobody writes headlines saying, ‘Another man has left the arts’. So we still see [female directors] as special; there’s still a tally going on. We haven’t reached a tipping point yet when it’s just normal. And until we stop believing that patriarchy is the correct default place, we still haven’t changed that fundamental mindset.” Wow festival runs at Southbank Centre from 7 to 11 March. • This article was amended on 29 January 2017.

I have a lot of sympathy for the author of the essay, Rebecca Watts, and the presumably unwelcome attention she’s drawn for it. These demons we send out with a pat on the tail and a “Go-show-’em, killer!” always come flapping back home too soon. I know: I too was a young desperado of a critic, right up to my first (and wholly deserved) death threat, after which I decided that this was not the career for a coward with such a fundamentally lousy attitude. I hope Watts can parlay her brief notoriety into some attention for her own poetry, which is plainly excellent. And her piece is a fun read, if it’s not about you. Though all I’d say is that if the purpose of good literary criticism is to persuade readers of your opinion, there was too much anger in it to do much more than harden their prejudices, one way or the other. Watts is right to point out that remarks I made about performance poetry in 2004 (in the course of that year’s TS Eliot lecture) seem to contradict what I say today. I changed my mind, was all. Obviously, you have distinct identities as a poet and a publisher, and I’m not paid to indulge the narrower of my own preferences: it would have been deeply remiss of me not to take notice of the burgeoning spoken-word circuit, which has seen the likes of McNish and Tempest recruit a vast new audience for poetry. My respect for it simply grew with my direct acquaintance. Poetry is most definitely not a broad church, but nor does it consist of 40 mutually exclusive sects, like the Plymouth Brethren. One can worship at more than one altar. You don’t have to like them all (personally, the strange hymns of the experimental school still remind me too much of my time as a flame-tongued evangelical, even if I enjoy the sermons), but your allegiance to one alone can turn you into a poetic sectarian. Spoken-word poetry might “fail” by Watts’ own favoured house rules but it has its own code, by which it deserves to be judged – a distinct aesthetic partly borrowed from hip-hop, where song-like rhythmic “flow” and ingenious rhyming and metaphor are often prized, but where “authenticity” seems valued most of all. The spoken-word crowd can smell the inauthentic at a thousand paces. I wish the “page” poetry scene would show the same critical discrimination when they encounter poems that do little more than tick off this week’s fashionable signifiers, and that the poet clearly doesn’t mean a word of. And just because Tempest, McNish and Kaur (whom few poets consider a poet at all) are all “accessible”, and Watts can’t stand them, doesn’t make them a genuine grouping. She might as well have added Ed Sheeran and kale, for all they’re alike. Elsewhere, we’re in agreement. Watts says “technical and intellectual accomplishments are as nothing compared with the ‘achievement’ of being considered representative of a group identity that the establishment can fetishise”. I think that’s overstated, but it’s a brave thing to say these days. I would add that we do young, first-book poets no favours through such rapid promotion, which can make them fatally self-conscious. You can’t yet say their work is game-changing, because that’s not how the game works. We might remember that the first published efforts of Keats and Auden met with as much bewilderment as praise, as the truly ground-breaking invariably does. Low stakes and high blood pressure often go together, and poetry is not always the lovely supportive community some claim – especially on Twitter, which can strain the pure venom out of mild demurral. My own admiration of Tempest and McNish, I can assure her, is genuine; but Watts is also bang on when she says: “The middle-aged, middle-class reviewing sector […] is terrified of being seen to criticise the output of anyone it imagines is speaking on behalf of a group traditionally under-represented in the arts.” But do you blame us, when every time we utter a word we either get gummed alive by some 20-year-old or have our every published remark audited for consistency? We can all work together to right the wrongs of the past, and still have space for honest disagreement. But we’re going to have to start by kicking open the doors between the rooms we’ve chosen for ourselves, rooms that reflect nothing but our own admirable taste."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/28/for-the-record-observer","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:05:27Z","webTitle":"For the record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/28/for-the-record-observer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/28/for-the-record-observer","fields":{"headline":"For the record","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The headline “How great to see Jacinda Arden being so bullish about pregnancy” (Comment, last week, page 27) misspelt the name of the prime minister of New Zealand.

Devon and Cornwall police suggested that decriminalising the taking of badgers in cull zones would ease pressure on resources, save the public money and could help stop the spread of bovine TB. The force insisted it was not suggesting abolishing the Protection of Badgers Act across the UK but campaigners claimed the proposal would lead to “open season” on badgers. The Badger Trust called the suggestion “appalling”. Its chairman, Peter Martin, said: “This is them simply trying to make their role in policing the cull easier by allowing all and sundry to be out and about killing badgers in the cull zones. It would create a completely unregulated slaughter of wildlife.” The charity’s CEO, Dominic Dyer, added: “I recently raised serous concerns in a meeting with the Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] secretary of state Michael Gove over the demonisation of badgers by the government and farming industry to justify the cull policy. This is leading to increased persecution of the species across the country and it now appears that the police are also playing a part in this process.” Under the Protection of Badgers Act, anyone caught taking, killing or injuring badgers risks a fine or imprisonment. Since 2013, culling in zones including areas of Devon and Cornwall have been permitted under licence. Policing the cull has added to pressure on forces already badly hit by cuts. In 2015, the government sought the views of police forces about the cull. The responses were declared “sensitive” and not published. Following a two-year battle that went all the way up to the Information Commissioner’s Office, Anna Dale, a library assistant from the New Forest, uncovered the police views (pdf). The most eye-catching suggestion came from Devon and Cornwall police, who suggested: “Why not decriminalise the possession or taking of badgers in cull areas with the provision that any taking has to be done with due regard to animal welfare.” Asked what they meant, a spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall police said: “We are not advocating the removal of the Protection of Badgers Act across the UK. This is about the control of bovine TB and for agencies to be able to consider all available options in cull areas to manage its spread. “We … asked Defra to consider the removal of the act in cull zones only to allow greater flexibility in the methods used to stop the spread of bovine TB.” The spokesperson added: “It is important that agencies who are working on such matters are free to raise these concerns and suggest alternative solutions to bodies such as Defra, working together to control the spread of bovine TB while also reducing the cost burden on the taxpayer and the impact on police resources.” Chris Cheeseman, an eminent badger ecologist and expert on bovine TB, said: “Rather than advocating what would in effect be open season on badgers in the cull zones, and probably beyond, they should focus their efforts on ensuring that the culls are conducted safely and strictly according to the rules, while also allowing legitimate peaceful protest.” Mark Jones, of the Born Free Foundation, said: “It’s not the police’s job to suggest whether a law should or should not apply. It’s their job to uphold the law.” Amanda Barrett, who acts as a liaison between badger protectors and the police in the West Country, said she was disappointed but not surprised. She said: “Based on my experience with police liaison since the beginning of the culls, I seriously wonder how people protecting badgers can expect the promised fair and independent policing when a constabulary holds such ill-advised, partisan and biased views?” Jay Tiernan, of Stop the Cull, said activists believed that police did not take wildlife crime seriously enough. “Those at the top are clearly biased towards those that wish to kill,” he said. Devon and Cornwall police’s suggestion has not been taken up. A Defra spokesperson said: “Bovine TB is one of the greatest animal-health threats in the UK and has a devastating impact on our farmers. “We work very closely with all agencies involved to inform our long-term TB eradication strategy, using their advice, alongside the best possible scientific evidence, to improve our plan to eradicate the disease.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/26/a-costly-ornament-with-no-obvious-practical-purpose","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T15:55:27Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | A costly ornament with no obvious practical purpose","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/26/a-costly-ornament-with-no-obvious-practical-purpose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/26/a-costly-ornament-with-no-obvious-practical-purpose","fields":{"headline":"A costly ornament with no obvious practical purpose","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"DOG LOVER v GIANT SLAYER Barwick Park, located just south of Yeovil, has four follies, the largest and most ornate of which is called Jack The Treacle Eater. Built in tribute to a young messenger boy, the folly – in architecture, a costly ornament with no obvious practical purpose – now stands in perpetuity above an arch constructed from local rubble. Having recently swapped their own folly, Henrikh The Armenian Midfielder, for new signing Alexis The Dog Lover, Manchester United have rather spoiled what could have been a good riff for today’s Fiver before their FA Cup fourth-round match against Jack’s local team, Yeovil Town, tonight. That said, it’s Friday and we can’t think of anything else on which to hang the opening paragraph. Besides, it would be a shame to let the solitary piece of trivia we know about the south Somerset town with a population of 45,000, located on an old Roman road and former centre of the glove-making industry, go to waste. Struggling in League Two and operating on a budget of whatever spare change manager Darren Way can find down the back of his sofa, Yeovil’s chances of beating Manchester United are somewhere between slim and none, but they have a chance nonetheless. “I’ve spent more on flipcharts than I have on players,” he told Big Paper this week. “Paul Pogba went to United for £89m – I’d be happy with a £1m budget.” Way’s hopes of getting the weekend’s FA Cup fun off to a great start with the mother of all upsets suffered a further hammer blow when his star midfielder, Otis Khan, shoved a referee and got himself sent to the Naughty Step for three matches, extended to five on the back of a ludicrously optimistic and frivolous appeal. His silliness has also muffled the BBC’s Narrative Klaxon, as you can be sure the lifelong Manchester United fan, who was released by the club as a kid, would have featured prominently in the obligatory pre-match package filmed by their Romance and Magic of the Cup Correspondent, Mark “Clem” Clemmit. Celebrating his 55th birthday today after signing a new contract with Manchester United yesterday, José The Wasp-Chewer is expected to be even more cheerful than usual as he takes his place in the intimate environs of the visitors’ dugout at Huish Park. With a seated capacity of just 5,512, it is probably not where his spanking new Chilean playmaker envisaged making his Manchester United debut, but Alexis The Dog Lover has travelled down south and is likely to get a run-out. Should Yeovil do the unthinkable and embarrass their hosts, we can expect calls for a fifth folly, Darren The Giant Slayer, to be erected in Barwick Park.

A series of business and consumer surveys pointed to lower growth, ending a strong run that culminated in a rise in GDP growth to 0.5% in the last quarter of 2017. Lloyds Bank said a survey of customers showed households were struggling to cope with rising prices that forced them to spend more on food, petrol and heating bills. In a monthly survey of over 2,000 bank account holders, 55% of people said they spent more on household groceries compared to this time last year, a rise of 17 percentage points on December 2016. A year ago half of respondents felt comfortable with the level of inflation. By December 2017 70% were feeling negative about it, the bank said. The survey chimed with a separate survey on consumer confidence by Ipsos Mori that found respondents pessimistic about the outlook for the next year. The polling firm said its confidence index remained at -32 compared to more than +30 in 2014. The weakening outlook is expected to motivate the Bank of England’s interest rate setters to keep the central bank’s base rate at 0.5% when it meets in a fortnight’s time. Some economists have speculated that the strength of the manufacturing sector and record levels of employment would trigger a series of rate rises this year. But the downbeat surveys, combined with figures showing the housing market slowing and the construction industry in recession, will play a significant role in any assessment of the economy by the nine-strong monetary policy committee. Robin Bulloch, managing director of Lloyds Bank, said household budgets were under pressure, with a significant decrease in the proportion of consumers planning to save more in six months’ time. “Families with kids are feeling the pressure more than most. Not only has there been a fall in those who plan to save more, but also 45% expect to have to spend more in six months’ time, an increase of 11 percentage points since November,” he said. The CBI said at the weekend that private sector firms reported a slowdown in orders and sales growth in the three months to January. A survey of 629 businesses across the distribution, manufacturing and service sectors showed the balance of firms reporting a rise in output at +9%, compared with +19% in the three months to December 2017. Growth slowed across the board, although it remained above the long-run average in most sectors. Retail volumes declined in the quarter to January, continuing the trend of flat or falling volumes since October 2017. Anna Leach, the CBI’s head of economic intelligence, said there was a slight pick-up in activity forecast by firms for the next three months, but struggling retailers dragged down the recovery. “Our surveys suggest that growth has slowed across the board,” she said. “But it’s retailers that are once again bearing the brunt as inflationary pressures continue to squeeze consumer-facing businesses.” The accountancy group Deloitte said its consumer confidence survey was more upbeat, despite remaining at the same level in the three months to December as the three months to the end of September. People were more confident about hanging on to their jobs, but less confident about finding new ones. Ian Stewart, the firm’s chief economist, said that despite a fierce squeeze in spending power last year, consumers went into 2018 “in pretty good spirits”. He said: “With record levels of job vacancies and an economy that continues to grow we would expect wage growth to edge higher this year as inflation eases. The worst of the squeeze on incomes is probably behind us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/26/energy-experts-say-defence-secretary-gavin-williamson-is-scaremongering","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T15:13:41Z","webTitle":"UK defence secretary is scaremongering about Russia - energy experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/26/energy-experts-say-defence-secretary-gavin-williamson-is-scaremongering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/26/energy-experts-say-defence-secretary-gavin-williamson-is-scaremongering","fields":{"headline":"UK defence secretary is scaremongering about Russia - energy experts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Experts have accused the UK defence secretary of scaremongering by claiming a Russian disruption of Britain’s electricity interconnectors to Europe would cause chaos and kill thousands of people. Gavin Williamson told the Daily Telegraph that Moscow was looking at energy cables and pipelines between the UK and the EU, and sabotage could come by a cyber-attack, missile or undersea activity. “Why would they keep photographing and looking at power stations, why are they looking at the interconnectors that bring so much electricity and so much energy into our country?” the defence secretary told the newspaper. Experts said the lights were unlikely to go out if the electricity interconnectors, which supply about 5% of UK power, were somehow cut off. “It does sound a bit like scaremongering really. If you take out one interconnector it’s clear the UK can survive. We saw that last year with the one to France,” said Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU thinktank, referring to a major power cable to France running at half capacity after it was damaged by a storm. Even if all four power lines were disrupted simultaneously, it is unlikely supplies to homes would be affected. “There’s more than enough capacity in the UK,” he said. John Feddersen, the chief executive of Aurora Energy Research, agreed. “Electricity is not a major problem, we’ve got a decent amount of capacity. No house lights are going to go out,” he said. The analyst added there was also a hierarchy of needs in place for such scenarios, whereby big industrial users would be forced to cut their power demand before individuals were affected. However, experts said the UK’s growing reliance on interconnectors for power could pose more of a problem in the future. Peter Atherton, an analyst at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: “If you literally switched off all the power interconnectors with a bit of warning, the lights probably wouldn’t go off because there’s enough capacity in the system. “But once you get up to 7-8GW [of interconnector capacity in future, up from around 4GW now], there wouldn’t be enough spare capacity.” A wider attack on Britain’s energy system targeting power stations and grid infrastructure would be crippling. Atherton said: “It’s a very real threat in the sense that all modern economies are very vulnerable to a loss of energy. The energy infrastructure has relatively few very, very key nodes, and if you could take them out through bombing or a cyber attack, it would be hugely disruptive. “In that sense it’s not scaremongering, but it is something that’s been around for ever [as a threat] and industry takes it seriously.” Moscow mocked Williamson over the claims, saying they were “worthy of a comic plot or a Monty Python’s Flying Circus sketch”. Industry watchers said the impact on gas supplies by Russian attacks on UK-EU pipelines could be very disruptive, though the effect would be more limited if North Sea links to Norway were unaffected. While Britain could import gas supplies by ship in a crisis, the tankers would take several days to arrive. Analysts told the Guardian that the UK energy industry was mindful of the potential impact of threats to critical infrastructure, both physical and cyber. A National Grid spokesperson said: “Given our vital role in connecting people to their energy supplies, we take our responsibility very seriously.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/03/julian-barnes-on-suburbia-to-be-a-citizen-of-nowhere-much-is-to-be-a-citizen-of-the-world-","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T12:00:20Z","webTitle":"Julian Barnes on suburbia: ‘I have no sense of a great Tufnell Park novel inside me'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/03/julian-barnes-on-suburbia-to-be-a-citizen-of-nowhere-much-is-to-be-a-citizen-of-the-world-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/03/julian-barnes-on-suburbia-to-be-a-citizen-of-nowhere-much-is-to-be-a-citizen-of-the-world-","fields":{"headline":"Julian Barnes on suburbia: ‘I have no sense of a great Tufnell Park novel inside me'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Writers are traditionally supposed to have a sense of place, aren’t they? Visit Hardy’s Dorset, Austen’s Bath, Brontëland; take the Charles Dickens Big Red Bus Tour, and so on. This territoriality wasn’t a literary impediment; rather, it concentrated their focus. As Flaubert put it, to be local is to be universal. Nowadays, with increasing global migration, the norm has changed: many novelists work from a sense of displacement, of dislocation, their protagonists spiritually split between their birthworld and subsequent destination. Instead of the writer fiercely attached to a piece of ground, we have the transglobal writer as fertile, absorbent victim (and beneficiary) of a collision of cultures, religions, languages. I fall between these two poles. I spent my first 10 years in an inner west London suburb, my next 10 in an outer north-west suburb. I have lived abroad a little, travelled a fair amount, but essentially spent my last 45 years in and around the same tube station. Yet I certainly don’t feel the genius loci of Tufnell Park very strongly. It is a congenially anonymous place to live. I enjoy its location, shops, weekly farmers’ market, its access to parks, comparative quiet, and lack of knife crime; others might prioritise schools, hospitals and parking. But these are characteristics common to many inner suburbs. There is a sentimental fantasy that London consists of a spread of interlinked “villages”, each retaining its original specificity. I don’t think there’s much truth in this: everywhere, you see the same food chains and cafes, charity shops and bus termini; also, an astonishing number of estate agents. A Martian might conclude that these “villagers” spend their entire time drinking coffee and selling one another their flats and houses. And as a consequence, I have no sense of the great Tufnell Park novel fermenting away inside me. On the other hand, Northwood, Middlesex, where I spent the second decade of my life and came to sentience, does seem to have affected my writing. The title of my first novel, Metroland, appears to invoke and celebrate the sense of place. However, despite its cosy Betjemanic associations, the point about Metroland – and its writerly attraction – is that from the beginning it was a kind of fake place. The name, an act of branding, was thought up by property developers and railway companies as the underground network expanded. The line wasn’t built to serve existing areas; the place was invented to serve the railway. So it was a non-place full of non-traditions, where – appropriately enough – the predominant architectural style was mock Tudor. The Northwood police station, a few hundred yards from where I lived, had a birdhouse on a pole in its front garden. Even this birdhouse was mock Tudor. Most of the breadwinners who lived there spent five days in seven getting out of the place. Work was in London. So too, for me, was school: an hour or so’s journey on three different tube lines to Blackfriars. This pallid nomadism gave me a fairly strong sense of non-place. To adapt Larkin: something, like nothing, happens anywhere. Or, to adapt the prime minister, to be a citizen of nowhere much is to be a citizen of the world. Which is what a writer, consciously or unconsciously, seeks to be. I returned to leafy, neutral, unaggressive outer suburbia – Surrey, this time – as the starting point of my latest novel, The Only Story. Its 20ish protagonist itches to escape from what he judges a place of spiritual torpor. But it is also a place, as he discovers, where something as well as nothing may happen. A big something, which turns out to command and oversee his entire life. I like this idea of a pale background wash, against which the rich colours of emotional action can show up more dramatically. Somewhat ruefully, I have to admit that – for me as a writer – suburbia is my kind of place. The Only Story by Julian Barnes (Jonathan Cape, £16.99).

The tuition fee hike in 2012 has led to students questioning the value for money of a degree, while staff costs are mounting. Media coverage: “Higher education has become the new NHS” Last year brought a tough summer for university leaders, as the vice-chancellor pay scandal erupted all over the media. Higher education had grown used to being viewed with respect as one of the UK’s most successful sectors. Suddenly universities were exposed to widespread criticism that has undermined their purpose and value. Fee cuts: “You could still get by but you would be limping, some universities it might even push to insolvency” The government has pledged to review student finance, but details of the form it will take and what it will cover remain under wraps. In the meantime, universities are concerned that if any cut to tuition fees is not supplemented by a government grant, the impact could be serious, pushing those universities which are struggling to recruit students right to the brink. Clearing wars: “We’re really seeing a ramping up in the behaviour and aggression in the market” The cap on student numbers, which was lifted in 2014, was intended to lead to overall expansion of the sector. The reality is instead that the top tier universities are lowering their tariffs and luring students with unconditional offers, poaching the applicants who would normally seek out lower tariff institutions. The result has been aggressive marketing - with SnapChat a core battleground. Brexit: “Brexit makes us a less welcoming country, a less welcoming partner” Universities came out in force to back the remain campaign in the 2016 referendum. They highlighted the negative impact that Brexit would have on the higher education sector in terms of staff and student recruitment and research funding. Nearly two years down the line, that impact is beginning to be felt. Universities are struggling to recruit EU academics and forge new research partnerships with other European countries – and this is just the beginning. International students: “We cannot break even, or make a surplus, on any other area of our business” Calls for the government to take international students out of the net migration target have been reverberating around the sector for years now. They have met with continued resistance from prime minister Theresa May, who is sticking to her views developed as Home Office secretary that too many overstay their visas - despite evidence to the contrary and pleas from Conservative MPs. Universities will be watching amendments to the immigration bill this spring, in the hope that it will offer more favourable conditions for international students, which represent a critical source of revenue. The teaching excellence framework: “It’s been a lottery” The government’s Tef assessment exercise, which is intended to evaluate universities on the basis of the quality of their teaching, has been controversial since its inception. Much of the debate has focused on whether the metrics, which include graduate salaries and student survey results, have anything to do with what’s actually going on in the classroom. The first round of results were released this year, shaking up the traditional higher education hierarchy by awarding some Russell Group institutions bronzes while lower ranked universities gained golds – but the secret to their success remains disputed. Mental health: “We are having to invest a lot of money in supporting those needs” Mental health problems among university students have been on a rapid rise since the trebling of tuition fees. Sixty-one per cent of institutions have seen demand for counselling services jump by over a quarter in the past five years. Universities are responding to the agenda by expanding mental health and wellbeing services – but some are falling behind, and have been asked to triple their support to meet growing demand. Value for money: “If there is one thing that we have to absolutely get right it is driving up the quality of student experience” Student experience has become something of a buzzword in universities in recent years. It’s been given added prominence by the use of the National Student Survey to evaluate institutions in Tef and in league tables. This has combined with the increased competition for students to make investing in shiny buildings and a spruced-up campus a priority for universities. Business links: “Academics might have looked at businesses in the past as a cheque-writing machine and I think we are trying to shift that attitude” The “ivory tower” is an old trope used to describe how detached universities are from the real world. Recent government policy has sought to encourage universities to forge closer links with local businesses and the community, through degree apprenticeships and research commercialisation. Before his departure, the former universities minister, Jo Johnson, unveiled the knowledge exchange framework, or Kef, as a means of evaluating universities on the strength of their ties to industry. Its future now lies in the hands of the new minister. This research [pdf] was commissioned by the Guardian, supported by HSBC, and carried out by Shift Learning.

Black Jacks, Sherbet Dip Dabs, jawbreakers? I did: the net result being that my adult teeth are a war zone. In the past few months, I’ve endured hours of emergency pain-relief dentistry, followed by two separate root surgeries, followed by several hours of crown work, which I’m currently in the middle of. I should have Cameron Diaz’s smile for the amount of money I’ve spent. I don’t mean a smile similar to it. I mean her actual smile. I like my dentist – it is very, very important to mention that, can’t stress that enough – but I do not understand anything about his world. When does the urge to drill into the living bones of your fellow man come upon you? They’re not bones, I know. Christ knows what they are, these enamel nubs sprouting from our gums. Are they alive? Why do the mineral idiots have nerves in them that serve no purpose other than to become excruciatingly painful and maddeningly inaccessible? No one has explained it to me. Whip all of them out, I wanted to tell the specialist who was sticking tiny needles into my canals under a microscope. Why are there canals? Obviously, I couldn’t talk; despite that, he kept asking me questions. Like whether I was going on holiday, while charging me the exact amount of money I could have spent going on holiday. Is there a more expensive way to volunteer for such exquisite pain, apart from the boutique stuff that goes on in basements after party conferences? It’s my wallet that really hurts. I go private for dental work because at some point in the past it was explained to me that NHS fillings were made out of melted spoons and woodlice or, rather, that’s what I heard. I was an actor at that point (maybe I still am, but at this point my career isn’t resting, it’s comatose) and, like most actors, unbelievably vain. I wanted, needed, porcelain teeth that gleamed like a wall of urinals. “Because of the castings. I do filming you see,” I told the receptionist, who didn’t care. What if I had a meeting with Sam Mendes and he wanted to peer deep into my mouth? I’m not sure what roles I thought I would be going up for. I regret that now, as I sit in the waiting room, listening to staff tell walk-ins that they are no longer accepting NHS patients. Those are chilling words. I thought the NHS was like a parent, always standing behind the door to your home, ready to open it to you. And I suppose it is; it’s just behind fewer doors. The most upsetting thing is that I’ve come to enjoy this. I like the motorised orthopaedic chaise, plus you get to wear sunglasses indoors, like Kanye West. They play Air, Portishead and Morcheeba, trippy stuff that makes me almost as nostalgic as the jawbreakers do. Admittedly, it’s quite unrelaxing when they do the x-rays and everyone else runs out of the room, the bloody cowards. But it’s nice to have a lie down in the middle of the day, isn’t it? Even if someone’s trying to put an angle grinder inside your head. Now that I’m skint, this is probably the closest I’ll get to pampering myself all year. It may be too late; I can feel myself getting interested, which is the step before I start Munchausening myself into experimental treatments. Teeth tattoos. LED braces. Getting a second row put in, like a shark. Better watch that grill, Diaz, I’m coming for it. Pretty words for heinous acts A study indicates that acting out cuckolding fantasies – which usually involve watching your partner committing adulterous acts – can actually strengthen a relationship. The issue of watching your partner get horizontal with a stranger for your pleasure is a complex one, and there are a variety of important, counterintuitive conclusions to be drawn from these findings – all of which pass me by, because I’m just happy such a lovely word is back in parlance. (Admittedly, the far right got there a few months ago, hurling the shortened slur “cuck” at emasculated, leftwing softies who possess traits such as empathy. But that sounds awful, and isn’t what the word means, so let’s ignore them, eh.) “Cuckolding”. Delights the mouth, doesn’t it? It’s probably the nicest word to describe what is, in most cases, not a great situation. They have always had a seductive slant for me, pretty words for heinous acts. “Embezzling” is another favourite. Embezzling. Like snuggling deep into a suitcase of purloined bills. Mmm, “purloined”, now you mention it. I’m a sucker for them, although it’s not a good look. I’ll hear how the vampire bats exsanguinated their helpless victims and think: “Now, that’s a lovely word.” I forget not everyone is like me. I used to live with two degus, which are a cute relative of the chinchilla. I named the boy Typhus and the girl Chlamydia. People didn’t like it. But you know the feeling when you meet someone, and they just … are a Chlamydia? It was that. One friend told me it was an awful name to give a lovely creature, but I think the opposite. It’s a beautiful name, and to be honest, she wasn’t that nice. She would scream at Typhus, and stand on his head to get food. And I’m sure, if she’d had options, she probably would have cuckolded him, too. Then again, if he was into it, what’s the harm? Hanger chief I read this month that Penélope Cruz has a collection of more than 500 types of coat hanger, none of which are metal. Now there’s an example of paraphilia I can get on board with. Presumably, she has covering bamboo, and many woods, in a variety of gauges. Clipped, flocked, bar, foldable. Surely not plastic. It’s important to me that they are different types of hanger, meaning she has an interest in the tool, and doesn’t just own a lot of clothes. Sadly, there’s not a lot of information, and no pictures, only rumours. Why? It’s 2018 and nothing to be hung up about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/29/chris-packham-in-search-of-lost-girl-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T06:20:15Z","webTitle":"Chris Packham: In Search of the Lost Girl review – the big picture via a small photograph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/29/chris-packham-in-search-of-lost-girl-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/29/chris-packham-in-search-of-lost-girl-review","fields":{"headline":"Chris Packham: In Search of the Lost Girl review – the big picture via a small photograph","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Twenty years ago, while filming in Sumatra, Chris Packham took a photograph of a young girl. She was a member of a tribe of hunter-gatherers called the Orang Rimba, who lived harmoniously with their jungle environment. For Chris it was an immensely significant encounter. Now, he’s going back to see if he can find her again. Not driven by sentimentality or nostalgia, though there might be a bit of that, but because he sees the girl as a sort of barometer, a way of measuring the condition of the planet. Indonesia – Sumatra particularly – has seen some of the world’s most devastating deforestation, millions of hectares of rainforest destroyed to make way for productive crops, mainly oil palm. “If she’s still out there, living harmoniously in that environment, then there’s hope for us all,” he says. “But if we’ve robbed her of her habitat, then we really have got something to fear.” Chris’s partner Charlotte offers a note of pragmatism before he goes, about the younger generation of people like the Orang Rimba maybe not wanting to stay in the forest. “Would they, if they had awareness of the outside world, would they want to gravitate towards that?” she asks. I like Charlotte, who we also met in Chris’s Asperger’s documentary. That was also an intense, personal, moving, important film, as this one is. He’s making a habit of it. Incidentally, he now wears his autism spectrum disorder with pride. “Only a nitwit with Asperger’s could do that,” he says when he recognises the exact spot where his encounter happened, 20 years ago, from the curve in the road and the lie of the land. The Orang Rimba have left the area, because their home has been cut down. More terrible news: there was a massacre. Several of the people Chris had met and photographed were killed, though probably not the girl. The trail goes cold: dead ends, more oil palm plantations, unanswered shout-outs on the radio ... then a breakthrough, someone recognises the people in the picture, and the girl is alive, yay! Not really yay. He finds her – Bunga, mother of three girls herself – living not in one of the last remnants of forest but under a blue plastic shelter on the edge of a palm plantation. Hell, he calls it: “They’re living amongst the very thing that has destroyed them.” Chris’s barometer shows little sign of hope, then. “If we don’t stop this nonsense, we’ve had it,” he says. There was a sliver – of hope – along the way, when he spent time with one of the few remaining Orang Rimba families still living in an area of protected forest (though there do seem to be a lot of mopeds buzzing about). Among them is a young boy, Njarang, who his father hopes will stay in the forest. Chris hopes the same, and photographs Njarang, one of the last humans living at one with nature. Perhaps Chris will come back in 20 years’ time to find him. I hope so. Though I’m less hopeful that Njarang will still be in the forest. It doesn’t matter if you think Chris is perhaps being over romantic. What does is that the issues here – the destruction of the planet, and of some of its inhabitants – are more than important: they are the stories. Always so hard to tell, though, in a way that’s human and engaging. And that’s what he’s done, got to the big picture via a small one, a photograph and a search. So Chris Packham, I will – we all should – drink your wee. Not literally; it’s Orang Rimba for thank you. Excellent, a new Saturday night talent contest! How does All Together Now (BBC One, Saturday) work, then? Well, someone comes on and sings a song, any style. If the judges like it, they stand up and join in. That’s it, really. Except the judges are called The Hundred, because that’s how many of them there are. They’ve all got something to do with singing, apart from their leader, Geri Horner … only joking, Geri. Rob Beckett hosts, with a raised eyebrow. It’s kind of like a pub singalong meets Celebrity Squares. First up then, Rosalie from Liverpool, who does One Night Only, which 61 of The Hundred stand up to, so Rosalie takes top spot, until she’s bumped off later. Should Rosalie have changed the lyrics – One Series Only? Actually, I quite enjoyed it. It doesn’t take itself too seriously. There are no promises of stardom; just a bit of a laugh, and 50 grand to the winner. And it’s nice to be able to easily work out how well someone’s done, as a percentage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/26/xfl-trump-vince-mcmahon-football","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T13:12:37Z","webTitle":"The resurrected XFL is the perfect exponent of Trump's America","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/26/xfl-trump-vince-mcmahon-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/26/xfl-trump-vince-mcmahon-football","fields":{"headline":"The resurrected XFL is the perfect exponent of Trump's America","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Vince McMahon screamed. It was 2 February 2001 and the man who made professional wrestling a cultural colossus stood inside a football stadium near the Las Vegas strip telling me how he was about to change sports forever. He wore a black and red bandana on his head and proclaimed his new spring football league, the XFL, would take fans to places they had never been with cameras in the locker rooms, in meetings, on the tops of players’ helmets and where every collision promised to knock your television off its shelf. Then he breathed in deep, threw back his head and bellowed: “LET US BE THE VOYEUR!” Let us lift the curtain, let us peek in the window. McMahon was laying a bet on that Vegas afternoon that America yearned to look inside football, to feel the crunch of a tackle and to smell the dirty socks. He was gambling on a hunch that people would watch if he could make the US’s most-popular sport less a game and more a spectacle, with nightly dramas spilling from locker rooms to fresh-laid sod at the feet of leather-clad cheerleaders. He was trying to turn mainstream sports into a reality TV show at a time when reality TV was more a concept than the norm. The football, he said would be real. The show he was building around the game would only make it better. One night later, the XFL bombed in its opening act. The football, it turned out, was real but not good. The first game was far drearier than the team nicknames promised, an unmemorable 19-0 victory for the Las Vegas Outlaws over the New York/New Jersey Hitmen. The titillating hint of voyeurism was blunted by the fact little happens in football locker rooms. Players sat at their lockers. They listened to music. They studied game plans. The most exciting thing they did was pull jerseys over their shoulder pads. My best football memory of the night came an hour before the game just outside the Las Vegas locker room where one of the players, running back Rod Smart, stood dressed in his uniform. McMahon had encouraged the players to wear nicknames on their jerseys – the fiercer the better – and above the No30 on Smart’s back was printed the words: “He Hate Me.” “Why ‘He Hate Me?’” I asked. “Because when I hit the other guy he hate me,” Smart said smiling. All these years later, He Hate Me is about the only thing anyone recalls of McMahon’s failed three-month venture taken on with NBC. The league was gone by May. The farce that was the XFL came flooding back Thursday as McMahon announced a new XFL that will begin play in 2020. This XFL, he said, won’t attempt to be the voyeur. In a world where all the blinds have been drawn he is betting $100m on the idea that people have too much of a window to the inside of pro football and are hungry to focus on the game instead of a show. McMahon says his new league has nothing to do with politics but a red-white-and-blue logo along with his insistence that players will be expected to stand for the national anthem and social justice stands suggests otherwise. Public dissent won’t be tolerated. Neither will players with criminal records. Without saying as much, McMahon – a friend of president Donald Trump – is presenting a football league for Trump America sealed with a vow to Make Football Great Again. Two decades after gambling big on the idea that fans were tired of a despotic NFL squelching its players’ individuality, McMahon is laying an even heavier wager that fans no longer want players with a voice. Now that the players, once muffled by football’s autocratic structure, have a platform to speak about uncomfortable topics that range from police brutality to the fact they are killing their brains in a daily battle for an brown, oblong ball he is telling them to shut up, lock on their chinstraps and blast their cerebellums into gooey messes without complaint. As with Trump’s presidential campaign McMahon was big on hazy rhetoric and short on specifics. He talked vaguely about putting his new XFL in the hands of football experts, eliminating half-time and breaks in play to shorten games from three hours to two. He said repeatedly that the football would be high-quality without indicating how this league would be any different than the handful of second-tier spring leagues that have come along, including the first XFL, only to die deaths of indifference. The sad part about McMahon’s first XFL is that actually he had the right idea. The NFL was too manipulative, filled with Stepford players, best watched but not heard. He gave stages men like Rod Smart and begged them to be free. He pushed the use of overhead shots, on-field cameras and long extra points – all things that have been adopted by today’s NFL and improved it. His mistake came in wrapping it with wrestling, trying to create tawdry subplots and encouraging a misogynistic culture where grown men and young boys held sheets with numbers, rating cheerleaders on their level of sex appeal. That wasn’t football and America flat-out rejected it. “Whatever comes out of this thing from a reality standpoint isn’t going too far,” he said that day in 2001. Now that reality doesn’t fit the squares of a Trump tweetstorm he is making a red-white-and-blue football league where the players he unshackled go back into their chains again, where the only sounds are the cracking of helmets and the grinding of knees. And where Vince McMahon tries to blow out a fire he once hoped to light."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/26/princess-eugenies-wedding-news-fails-to-excite","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T16:04:13Z","webTitle":"Princess Eugenie’s wedding news fails to excite | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/26/princess-eugenies-wedding-news-fails-to-excite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/26/princess-eugenies-wedding-news-fails-to-excite","fields":{"headline":"Princess Eugenie’s wedding news fails to excite","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of my most thrilling moments as a teenager in the late 1970s was the surprise of finding myself selling bread to Mark E Smith (Obituary, 26 January) in my Saturday job at Slattery’s bakery in Prestwich (not least due to the mere shock of considering that he actually ate at all).

The number of injuries to employees reported totalled 70,116, while 31.2m working days were lost due to work-related illness and workplace injury. That’s why organisations should be striving to create a positive environment in which employees don’t just survive, but thrive. Health and safety and wellness should be top priority for HR personnel, as illnesses and injuries, particularly those that are work related, lead to financial burdens for both employer and employee. The Health and Safety at Work Act provides a legal duty for the management team within a business to protect the health, safety and welfare of its employees and others who may be affected by their acts or omissions. In the modern workplace, however, safety has moved on from complicated rules to employers striving to ensure employees are safe 24/7 – encouraging them to apply the safety skills gained in the workplace to everyday life. Safety systems must be led from the top down, with managers not just talking about safety, but actively demonstrating safe working practices. Opel/Vauxhall takes the view that safety is everyone’s business and everyone’s responsibility. The steering wheel in its safety logo symbolises every staff member’s ability to make personal decisions about safety, which is also reflected in the company’s safety strapline: It’s Personal, Own It. “Each of us owes it to ourselves and our co-workers to ensure we get home safe and sound at the end of the day,” says a company spokesperson. HR can play a role in health and safety compliance at work, by ensuring that every employee attends their induction prior to starting in their role, says Abigail Morakinyo, nurse and founder of Health in Check, a provider of health and wellness programmes. “They also need to reinforce attendance of both mandatory and relevant training,” she says. “Some workers may have personal or health-related problems that deter them from attending training courses such as manual handling, which is pertinent to preventing injuries. Therefore, HR personnel should be approachable and accessible to employees. Just as nurses are seen as a patient’s advocate between their consultants, HR are the employees’ advocate.” Having good health and safety working practices in place delivers many business benefits, as Paul Jackson, safety adviser at Howarths People and Safety Management, explains: “In reducing your staff absence due to having effective control measures in place regarding illness or accidents at work, the business will benefit by saving time and costs associated with recruiting and training a new member of staff. But the benefits to the individual are probably more pertinent for staff. “With good health and safety measures, your staff can do their work more easily and safely, which also boosts morale, increases productivity and reduces costs,” says Jackson. “Good health and safety performance will help the business to build a positive reputation with your clients and staff and their friends and associates. This can help to increase sales and generate more leads,” he adds. Safety regulations at work The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 Employers must carry out risk assessments concerning staff health and safety and provide employees with information and training on occupational health and safety; they must also have a written health and safety policy. The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 These regulations require employers to provide adequate lighting, heating, ventilation and workspace, staff facilities, and safe passageways. The Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 This applies to employees who use a computer as a significant part of their normal work. Employers need to carry out risk assessment of workstations, ensure that staff take adequate breaks, and provide regular eyesight tests. The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 Employers are required to report work-related incidents, injuries and diseases to the HSE, or to the nearest local authority environmental health department. The five most common accidents at work Handling, lifting or carrying – caused by lack of training, lifting beyond recommended lifting capacity, or while injured, and moving items in a repetitive manner. Slips, trips or falls – can be the result of poor floor conditions, unmarked hazards, such as liquid spillages, ice in poor weather conditions, incorrect footwear, and protrusions from the floor. Being struck by a moving object – this could include being struck by objects that are being moved by hand, or with the aid of equipment, such as a forklift truck. Contact with moving machinery – this could be due to unguarded machinery, or machinery being used for something other than its designed purpose. Another factor is tiredness, which affects concentration. Falls from height - common causes include the incorrect use of ladders or scaffolding, the poor condition of working-at-height equipment, falling down unmarked holes, and a general lack of training."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/2018/jan/26/wetherspoons-cancels-russell-hume-contract-meat-scare","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T13:20:03Z","webTitle":"Wetherspoons cancels contract with Russell Hume after meat scare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/26/wetherspoons-cancels-russell-hume-contract-meat-scare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/26/wetherspoons-cancels-russell-hume-contract-meat-scare","fields":{"headline":"Wetherspoons cancels contract with Russell Hume after meat scare","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Wetherspoons has cancelled its contract with the meat supplier Russell Hume after a food safety scare. The pub chain said it had ended the deal after inspections of Russell Hume’s Birmingham site revealed the business was “unable to demonstrate compliance with food hygiene rules at its locations”. The chairman of JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, apologised to customers after it was forced to remove meat from its menu on Tuesday, leaving customers without rump, sirloin or gammon at the chain’s weekly steak night. Martin said: “Our decision to stop serving steak from Tuesday 23 January, despite limited information from the supplier, was the correct one. Steak is one of the most popular dishes on our menu, and we serve around 200,000 per week on average, about half of these on our extremely popular Tuesday night steak club.” The company is sourcing products from different suppliers and has confirmed steaks will be back on the menu from next Tuesday. Hilton Hotels, which was also supplied with meat by Russell Hume, has also taken meat products from the company off its menu. A spokesperson for Hilton said: “We can confirm that a small number of Hilton hotels in the UK were supplied by Russell Hume and, following advice from the FSA, the hotels acted immediately to dispose of all products supplied by the company. The safety and security of guests is our primary concernand we uphold stringent food safety standards in all of our hotels.” Jamie’s Italian stripped Russell Hume products from its menus and changed suppliers this week.

As Willian prepared to limp off the Emirates Stadium pitch midway through the first half Barkley, his obvious replacement, was still dutifully gambolling up and down the touchline in his tracksuit. This didn’t go down well with Antonio Conte who seems, even at the best of times, to be in a state of constant eye-boggling rage at every detail of his sentient existence. This is Conte’s default mood, his baseline. But he still managed to find some even deeper gears, letting out a shriek, waggling his arms and clenching his fists like a man strangling invisible kittens and generally urging Barkley back down the touchline like the most embarrassing stressed-out dad in the long and detailed history of embarrassing stressed-out dads. The Arsenal fans on that side roared with laughter. Barkley scuttled off to remove his shirt, all anxious fingers and thumbs. Finally he came on for his first game of football after eight months out, one traumatic hamstring injury and a life-changing move from his boyhood club. His first act in a Chelsea shirt was to fall on his face. His second was to foul Jack Wilshere. His third was to run the wrong way in search of a pass. After which things really started to go downhill. There is something compelling about terrible debuts, a kind of voodoo that is hard to shake. Simon Kerrigan’s Test cricket debut for England against Australia at the Oval springs to mind, when Kerrigan didn’t just bowl poorly but seemed to have forgotten completely the sequence of movements he had been repeating with uninterrupted success from childhood, instead hurling down assorted round-arm lobs like a man tossing wellies at a country fair. He hasn’t been seen since. Judgments have already been passed on Barkley on this basis, doubts confirmed, cards marked. Which is a great shame for two reasons. First, because it does Barkley a disservice. Yes, he was bad, producing a horribly uncomfortable performance, a sense of being unable to avoid or stop or walk away from what was clearly a traumatically raw and rusty hour of football. He whirled around a lot, finding pockets of pointless space. He looked red-faced and startled in exactly the way footballers really aren’t supposed to be startled, baffled by the patterns around him. Understandably so. Barkley wasn’t ready. He is not an instinctive, natural-genius kind of footballer, those who seem to define the game simply by playing it, to reek of pure uncut essence of football. Luka Modric, for example, could be dropped on to the storm-racked surface of Mars with just a lungful of air and a football, and in the 40 seconds or so before he asphyxiated Modric would still be able to move and link and pass between the craters and rock piles, even here asserting his own sense of pure footballing ease. Barkley is not that player. His form and his conditioning are more delicate. With a little care he will show the best of himself. Really, though, the point of interest here had little to do with Barkley and a lot more to do with that genuinely rare spectacle of a professional athlete so startlingly out of kilter. This is the occasional vertigo of professional sport, the revelation, suddenly, of its brutality, its rarified levels. There is something deeply reassuring in this, confirmation that even an international footballer at 60% is completely out of the game, an alien, a lost boy. And that yes, this is all for real, that even playing elite professional football very badly is mind‑bogglingly difficult. Underlying this, a background timpani to all sport, is the incredible difficulty of identifying that mixed and flowing quality known as human talent, and of predicting what it might do once you have. By any reasonable standard Barkley is a brilliantly talented athlete capable of producing a moment as fine as the beautiful goal-making nutmeg pass against Estonia two years ago that illuminated an otherwise mind-numbing night at Wembley, the kind of grey midweek England international that comes over you like a dose of autumn melancholy. And yet somehow it seems possible to ignore the variables in all this, the thrillingly high margins of his profession and portray Barkley as yet another lazily grasped moral fable, the old football story of squandered talent, excessive material rewards and all the rest. There are two things worth saying about this. Firstly, the levels of anger directed at a poor performance or a duff season or a stalled career are laughably misplaced, an indication of a complete misunderstanding of what sport is really about, the dizzying human mystery involved in translating talent and graft into tangible achievement. Nobody coasts through this, or doesn’t care. The people who coast and don’t care – you’ve never heard of them. They dropped out years ago. And secondly, any scorn for Barkley should be saved instead for his exceptionally ruthless manager who knows all of this better than anyone, knows the condition of his player, but was ready to throw Barkley on to the pitch, then to rubbish him in a press conference, using his own player as a weapon with which to gouge away at the Chelsea hierarchy. As for Barkley he will surely come again. He remains a pure, slightly clogged talent who is simply a part of the system, the set of structures we have all created for him; and who still has the ability, as on Wednesday night, to look alarmingly, endearingly, familiarly mortal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/03/blind-date-campaigners-andy-liam","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Blind date: ‘He probably thinks I’m a bit full-on’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/03/blind-date-campaigners-andy-liam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/03/blind-date-campaigners-andy-liam","fields":{"headline":"Blind date: ‘He probably thinks I’m a bit full-on’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Andy on Liam What were you hoping for?

Families of the victims murdered in the two explosions in the city centre said they hoped the judge’s decision would bring closer the possibility that the suspects would be named at a future inquest. In July, the coroner, Sir Peter Thornton QC, ruled that the names of the alleged perpetrators would not be part of the framework of the new inquests. But at the high court on Friday, Mrs Justice Sue Carr said: “We will quash the coroner’s decision.” Julie Hamilton, whose sister Maxine was killed in the bombing, said it was “surely logical and rational” that as a result of the judge’s decision the IRA members involved could be named during the inquests. “We are pleased about today’s ruling as the coroner’s original decision was simply irrational and devoid of logic. It brings the possibility to naming suspects closer now and we welcome that,” she said. “All we want is the truth. How hard can that possibly be?” After the bombings, six Irish men were wrongly convicted of being responsible for the explosions. The Birmingham Six spent 17 years in jail before they were freed in 1991. Their plight led to the establishment of the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates alleged miscarriages of justice. An investigative television programme by Granada TV’s World in Action team the year before named a number of men it alleged were the real bombers. Paddy Hill, one of the Birmingham Six, has given his backing to the victims’ families and their campaign group, Justice4the21. The group has fought for years to have inquisitions into the deaths reopened. It raised £40,000 in crowdfunding to pay for Friday’s judicial review."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/27/building-homes-britain-housing-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T06:00:59Z","webTitle":"Why building more homes will not solve Britain’s housing crisis | Ann Pettifor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/27/building-homes-britain-housing-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/27/building-homes-britain-housing-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Why building more homes will not solve Britain’s housing crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Everyone – from the government, to housing charities, to housebuilders – has bought into the conventional wisdom that the dysfunction that racks our housing market is a matter of demand and supply. We’re not building enough houses, so house prices have been sent rocketing, taking home-ownership out of reach for growing numbers of young people. But in reality, our housing problems are not a simple feature of supply and demand. Rather, our housing market has a bitcoin problem. What has bitcoin mania got in common with house prices, especially in the capital? For starters, both are speculative bubbles. Vast sums of money have been poured into finite supplies of bitcoins and London property. Both have consequently exploded in value, albeit over different time periods. And so both have become financialised assets that deliver capital gains far in excess of people’s ability to earn income from work, or from investment in the real economy. And as with bitcoin, so with London property: speculators are convinced that prices will continue to rise for ever. It’s speculation in the property market that is fuelling stratospheric house price rises, not shortage of supply. When the “fuel” of private capital, mortgage credit and cash from the bank of mum and dad is supplemented by government subsidies and tax breaks, house prices rise. Moreover, wealthy global and non-resident buyers have funnelled more than £100bn into London property over recent years, making the problem even worse. So, rather counterintuitively, building more houses is not the right prescription. House prices won’t fall until the tide of cash flowing into the market abates, for example by tightening mortgage credit, or shrinking the pool of buy-to-let investors. That may already be starting to happen as real incomes continue to fall, the Bank of England toughens up buy-to-let mortgages, and stamp duty rises are phased in for second properties. Despite this, the government pretends the real cause of unaffordable housing is a shortage of new builds. It uses this argument to provide cover for further taxpayer-funded subsidies and tax breaks that benefit its property-owning core voters, its close allies in the construction industry and property market, and its supporters in the City of London. But the evidence is clear: increases in housing supply, and a contraction of demand thanks to a fall in the number of households, have not dampened prices. At last count, in 2014, there were 28 million dwellings in the UK, but only a predicted 27.7 million households in 2016. As the director of consulting at Oxford Economics, Ian Mulheirn, highlights, London’s number of dwellings grew faster than the number of households between 2001 and 2015. Similarly, in Ireland more than 90,000 homes were built in a country of just 4 million people in 2006, and yet prices continued rising – by a whopping 11% that year. To make things worse, land has a financial advantage that bitcoin lacks. It is a physical, low-risk asset against which both homeowners and financiers can borrow, quickly creating new money. For many homeowners, homes virtually became cash machines in the 1980s and 90s. Today many buy-to-let owners borrow against the monthly income they get from renting out property. So the key to making housing more affordable in this country is not to build more, but to stop the flow of cash flooding into expensive areas. Build more without doing this, and prices won’t fall: the market will simply absorb more cash. The best way to do this is through the tax system. First for consideration should be a property speculation tax (PST), as in Germany. This could be used to levy punitive rates on speculators, or those who own second homes and empty properties, encouraging them to invest their cash elsewhere. Second, the government must manage speculative capital flows in and out of Britain by taxing them through a Tobin tax on global financial transactions. Corrupt politicians in the poorest countries and oligarchs in weak economies shift often-fraudulent cash into stable jurisdictions such as the UK. These mobile flows of capital inflate the price of Britain’s fixed supply of land. Creating a managed fall in property prices through these sorts of measures would be good for young first-time buyers, and would help shrink the generation gap in property ownership. But it would also create losers. Pensions have become markedly less secure in the past 30 years. If prices were to fall, a generation of wealthier homeowners in the south would see their retirement security slip away. To make up for this, the government must play a more active role in providing households and investors with assets such as ultra-safe government bonds that can be used to generate a steady source of income. There’s another problem. Consumer spending makes up two-thirds of the British economy, and it is driven by the rising property prices that feed public confidence in the economy. In the economy as currently structured, a fall in confidence and consumption would undoubtedly damage growth. But an economy such as ours – excessively dependent on consumer spending, property speculation and high levels of debt – is vulnerable to shocks. And rising land values dampen productivity: money gets channelled towards speculative property investment, starving the real economy of the investment it needs to improve productivity and boost people’s wages. So the government must use its firepower to increase property taxes and force a shift to a different sort of economic model. It should drive investment in capital and social infrastructure in order to generate an alternative source of growth: productive, skilled, better-paid employment. A more affordable housing market will not be achieved by building more private housing, or by channelling more subsidies into propping up the property market. Deflating that bubble is something we must do urgently – before the bubble further deflates the British economy. • Ann Pettifor is director of Policy Research in Macroeconomics"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/05/ruby-tandoh-fine-to-enjoy-ready-meal-eat-up-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T08:00:14Z","webTitle":"Ruby Tandoh: ‘I want to remind people that it’s fine to enjoy a ready meal’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/05/ruby-tandoh-fine-to-enjoy-ready-meal-eat-up-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/05/ruby-tandoh-fine-to-enjoy-ready-meal-eat-up-interview","fields":{"headline":"Ruby Tandoh: ‘I want to remind people that it’s fine to enjoy a ready meal’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Born in Southend in 1992, Ruby Tandoh is the author of two cookbooks, Crumb: The Baking Book and Flavour: Eat What You Love. She studied philosophy at UCL and was a runner-up on The Great British Bake Off in 2013. Since then she has written a baking column for the Guardian, reviewed fast-food outlets for Vice and co-founded a zine about mental health called Do What You Want. Her new book, Eat Up! Food, Appetite and Eating What You Want (Serpent’s Tail, £12.99), deals with eating disorders (Tandoh had something “akin to bulimia” for several years in her teens), the wellness craze and food snobbery, arguing for a more relaxed and pleasurable approach to food. She lives with her partner Leah, a musician and trainee counsellor, in Sheffield. What compelled you to write Eat Up? There are so many food books out there – but I couldn’t find any that dealt in an accessible way with cultures of eating and our relationship with food. The books in this area were either really academic or food memoirs; there wasn’t really a middle ground. In a sense I’m writing this book for my younger self and anyone coming up through their teens now who wants to enter adulthood with a good relationship with food. You suggest that we’ve forgotten how to take pleasure in food. Why? I think there’s too much focus on hardcore foodie stuff – being preoccupied with provenance and so on. Or else focusing on nutrition. These things are actually pretty interesting and useful in themselves, but what we’ve lost is the focus on just enjoying food. I want to remind people that it’s actually fine to enjoy a ready meal. We live in a time when you can get a macaroni cheese and it’s done in four minutes – that’s pretty amazing. Do you have a favourite food scene in a novel? It’s incredible how often food comes up in the Harry Potter series. There’s the start-of-term feasts [at Hogwarts] where the food appears magically on the table and keeps replenishing itself – that’s more interesting to me than the dragons and so forth. By and large, JK Rowling describes food that’s very familiar to us – toast with butter or a roast dinner – but she allows these very normal foods to be imbued with the same kind of magic that permeates the whole novel. I really like that. What books are on your bedside table? One book I’m really enjoying – I’m halfway through – is The Word for Woman Is Wilderness by Abi Andrews. It’s about a girl in her late teens who decides she wants to go on a Bear Grylls-style adventure, but finds that, as a woman, her experience is very different. I’m also reading Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat by Samin Nosrat. It’s about the basic elements of good cooking, but I’ve been reading it like a novel. Everything I’ve been doing so far in the kitchen has been wrong, it turns out, but I’m fine with Samin telling me I’m a fool. I would put my life in her hands. What’s the last really great book you read? It’s not new, but I read On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan recently and loved it. It’s about a newlywed couple staying at a seafront hotel in Dorset on the first night of their honeymoon. They get brought this dreadful meal and the waiters are at the door watching them eat – it’s so uncomfortable. The husband is a working-class guy, his wife is from a middle-class family, and there are little details in their backstory that describe the food they ate growing up and how weird he feels when he goes round to her house. I thought it was fantastic. Which genres do you particularly enjoy reading? I’ve slowly come to realise that my favourite kind of novel is one in which nothing happens. It turns out this is my niche. I like books that are about just the way people think and the mundane details of their lives. For example, I really enjoyed How Should a Person Be? by Sheila Heti. For the life of me I couldn’t tell you what it was about, but I know I liked it. I’m certainly not a fantasy-epic type of person. I don’t have the attention span to keep loads of characters in my head. How do you organise your books? I’ve got lots of cookbooks, as you can imagine – I keep them downstairs – and then there’s a jumble of novels, nonfiction and poetry on the shelves upstairs. I didn’t think my cookbook habit was that bad, but we had a friend around the other day and he was like, “Oh my God, I can’t believe how many you’ve got”. There are definitely too many in the sense that I do not cook from all of them and there are some I’ve never opened. In Eat Up!, you say you’ve never read Elizabeth David or Jane Grigson, which is a brave thing for an English food writer to admit. It is my personal theory that no one has read Elizabeth David. What book did you expect to like and didn’t? There are a few books by the American psychiatrist Irvin D Yalom that I hated. I usually love books with all the juicy goss from the therapist’s chair. Susie Orbach did one recently [In Therapy] and Stephen Grosz did one as well [The Examined Life]. I loved those but Yalom’s work left me cold. He said some terrible things about how a woman sitting across from him disgusted him sexually and therefore he found it hard to counsel her. So that was one I found disappointing. What’s the best book you have ever received as a present? I went to visit a friend who lives in Oslo. She recommended [the American author] Lydia Davis and took me to a bookshop to buy her Collected Stories. There’s one story called Happiest Moment, about a man who says his happiest moment was the time that his wife ate duck in Beijing. I just thought it was wonderful. Who is your favourite literary hero or heroine? Antihero or villain? This is terrible and deeply childish, but Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker in James and the Giant Peach. They’re so cruel and awful and I kind of love them. They feed James burnt crumbs from the oven and make him run around after them all day and chop wood. They’re always bickering between themselves – you’re too thin, you’re too fat, you’re too lazy – I think they’re really quite funny. Merged together, I see something of myself in them. Are you done with writing cookbooks? At the moment I think I am, not because I don’t love them – I really enjoy the process – but I don’t know what more I can really contribute in terms of recipes. There are plenty of far better cooks out there who I’ll leave to the recipe-making. The thing that’s always interested me most about food is how it figures in popular culture. I love food when I see it in films, or hear about it in music, or read about it in books. Writing this book, I was allowed to talk about My Big Fat Greek Wedding and all these pop-culture references. That was fantastic. • Eat Up! is published by Serpent’s Tail (£12.99).

In December 2016 a call came and it was one of those that everyone dreads. The Tottenham winger’s younger brother, Axel, had banged his head in a swimming pool in their native Argentina and the damage would be grave. Axel was paralysed. “For a few months, he couldn’t move anything,” Lamela says. “Right now, he is getting some movement back and working day by day to return to a normal life. The doctors say that he may be able to walk again but it all depends on how the rehab goes. It’s going to be a slow process and we just need a lot of patience. He is wheelchair-bound. “Axel’s 21 and what can I say? I’m very close to him and, right now, I’m trying to push him to rise up above this hard experience. It’s one of those things that makes you realise what is important in life. It makes you realise, for example, that health is a lot more important than football.” At the time of the accident Lamela was out with a hip problem. His previous game had been at Liverpool in the EFL Cup on 25 October. The injury was described as relatively minor but it was beginning to feel troublesome. As has been well documented, it would require operations in April and May of last year and keep him on the sidelines for 13 months. All Lamela could think about was Axel and he was gripped by a familiar pang. Home felt a long way away. It is something with which he has learned to cope, since his move from River Plate to Roma as a 19-year-old in 2011. Initially, it was tough; then it became bearable and it would morph into a way of life. Lamela knew that he had to be with Axel and so did the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino. Lamela would return to Buenos Aires for about a week. “I have my career in football and injuries are a part of that but what we are talking about with Axel is completely different and it could have been much worse,” Lamela says. “I thank God that he was able to survive this accident and is now able to go through a recovery process. “Hearing the story scared me. I was a long way away and it was really difficult. Thank God he survived it and Mauricio, who is a great man, let me travel to Argentina to be with him. Actually, it was more than that. He was the one who made me get that ticket to go to Argentina so that I could be by his side.” When Lamela returned to London, he was shaken by the death of his dog, Simba – it was akin to a family bereavement, as any dog owner would attest – and, all the while, the hip problems were not getting any better. Lamela went to Rome last January for a change of scene and to visit his trusted physiotherapist from his Serie A days. “He’d said that we could treat it without an operation,” Lamela says. The hope proved ill-founded. Lamela trained but he continued to feel pain. “That’s when I took the decision to have the surgery,” he says. From a seemingly innocuous injury, the 25-year-old ended up losing a chunk of his career and not for the first time. He missed the second half of his debut season at Tottenham in 2013-14 because of a back problem. “It hit me hard,” Lamela says. “There were really sad days for me, particularly being here in London. OK, I’m with my close family but I’m here to play football. I can’t lie. If it weren’t for that, I would be back in Argentina. You’re so far from the rest of your family, your friends, the things you hold dear. You are in that place just to play football, so it’s an ugly situation. You want to play but you are unable to do so. “I am someone who can’t be without football – I have to play so it was incredibly hard. I had the doctors telling me the whole time that I’d get better, I’d get back to my level, but your head doesn’t let you relax. There were always doubts running around. I worried that I might never be OK again.” Lamela faced an additional issue, which comes with the territory of being a high-profile footballer and makes him smile broadly – the wild rumours on social media. “I will answer this question because it makes me laugh,” he says. “These things always get back to you eventually and I heard thousands of complete inventions while I was injured – that I’d tested positive for drugs; that I wanted to leave Tottenham. They were things that people had invented. “It’s normal as a footballer that you’re going to hear these sorts of rumours but the most important thing is that you keep your head focused on what is important – your family. I’m a calm person and I was able to do that. When you focus on the important things and keep your head, that’s when good things will come to you.” For Lamela, the good things have come, even if he is a major doubt for Saturday’s FA Cup tie at Newport with a bruised glute. He and his girlfriend, Sofia, celebrated the arrival of their first child, Tobias, on 25 November and three days later Lamela made his comeback in the 2-1 Premier League defeat at Leicester. On as a late substitute, he set up a goal for Harry Kane within two minutes. He describes the assist as a “beautiful moment”. Lamela has done a lot of growing up over the past year or so and he has new-found perspective – largely because of Axel’s accident and Tobias’s birth. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt such happiness as I’ve done with my son,” Lamela says. “It’s something completely unique and I’m just making the most of it every day. It has changed me.” What has always shone through with Lamela is his strength of character. The setbacks do not break him; they drive him. He says that he did not see a sports psychologist during his annus horribilis because he never felt the need. “I have a lot of belief in myself and I am also someone who has a lot of faith in God,” Lamela says. “I get a lot of strength from my Catholicism.” Lamela has divided opinion among Spurs fans. The kids love him for his tricks and feints, for the rabona goal against Asteras Tripoli and for the slick hairstyles, although his current crop is unusually sensible. Some of the grown-ups have dismissed him as a fancy dan. But Lamela has evolved into something else, which is a tribute to his lack of ego and his willingness to take instruction on board. It is not something for which one-time River Plate wonder boys are generally noted. Under Pochettino, he has added defensive steel, with a few cynical edges, and a ferocious work ethic. “I had to fight so hard to play for River and that gave me a lot of strength to go on,” Lamela says. “I also moved a long way from Argentina for my football. It was difficult to leave at 19 but it made me grow as a person. My mentality is that I play football to win. You have to do everything you can to win. The most important thing is that you leave nothing out there on the pitch.” Lamela’s contract expires in the summer of 2019 but, after everything he has been through, he does not want to look further than the next game. “I’m happy at Tottenham,” Lamela says. “If not, I would have left. I feel a part of the club, I’m at home here. I am not thinking about how long is left on my contract.” Erik Lamela was talking at ‘Shape Up With Spurs’, one of the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation’s health and wellbeing programmes designed to help local people who are above a healthy weight get fit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/10/where-to-move-for-best-rail-connections-property-tom-dyckhoff","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-10T08:00:12Z","webTitle":"Where to move for... train connections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/10/where-to-move-for-best-rail-connections-property-tom-dyckhoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/10/where-to-move-for-best-rail-connections-property-tom-dyckhoff","fields":{"headline":"Where to move for... train connections","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You’d think I’d asked the universe’s most baffling question. Where do neutrinos come from? What, exactly, is consciousness? No. Where in the UK has the best train connections? Not the busiest station. Easy-peasy: Waterloo, which, according to the government’s Office of Road and Rail, last year clocked 100m entries and exits through its turnstiles. Anyway, not that. Not where has the worst connections, either. Only patches of the Scottish Borders, its western coast, Skye, Mull, the far north-west, the Cairngorms, around Loch Ness, north-east above Aberdeen, and a snippet by Bude and Burnham Market are more than 30km from a station. Anyway, not that. Rather, which place has the most departures going to the most destinations. I briefed my network of trainspotters (father-in-law wrote timetables for British Rail). Hmm, it said. I asked Trainline’s data bods. “Blimey,” they exclaimed. But, at last, days later, the answer. The most trains? Clapham Junction, with one every 13 seconds at peak. The most destinations? Manchester Piccadilly, Leeds or Birmingham New Street, all hubs of vast regional networks with intercity and local stations. At New Street, say, you can go direct to Penzance and Aberdeen, or Smethwick. Network Rail agreed: Clapham Junction for volume, Birmingham New Street for the most destinations over the greatest distance. Another mystery solved!

How to keep going?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What kind of a revolution is this anyway? As the news spread, commentators insisted that nothing would change. Rich men and young girls – what’s new? This is corporate entertainment, and it happens all over the City on a weekly basis. But hours later, the Presidents Club had been forced to close down. There’s a wild, giddy sense that the endemic but outmoded and tawdry tradition of powerful men groping subordinate young women has finally been shown the door. But has it? Even as we fight to overthrow tradition, history has lessons to teach us about thwarted revolution. So how do we make a success of an uprising? First, choose your cause at the right moment. Among many, there’s a sense of creeped-out nauseous bafflement that powerful men require the attention of women in matching underwear before donating to charity. Socially acceptable sexual harassment has been around for a long time. From Hollywood to the Dorchester, we’ve had enough. Has gathering unrest brought us to the brink of real change? There’s a difference between cultural revolution and storming the Bastille, but historical parallels offer timely warnings. It feels like the time is now, just as it did nearly 200 years ago, when more than 60,000 people dressed in their Sunday best and gathered in Manchester. Less than 2% of the population had the right to vote, and repressive legislation had made bread unaffordable. People were starving. It was time for a change. Panicking local magistrates tasked yeomanry with dispersing the crowd, and a peaceful demonstration ended in the Peterloo massacre. Second, why must we sacrifice our heroes? In 2018, Twitter gives a voice to the previously voiceless. We make ourselves heard, in force, in a matter of minutes. Men resign and apologies are made, investigations are promised. All this is real, and all this is valuable, but if Twitter is a weapon, it’s used by both sides. Standing up to demand a change, however peacefully, is a dangerous business. As Anita Sarkeesian learned, those who speak out are first to feel the sharp edge of the very weapon that enables us to do so. Third, watch your back. In the wake of Peterloo, a small group of radicals conspired against those they held responsible for the carnage. They plotted to murder the entire cabinet over dinner at the Grosvenor Square home of Lord Harrowby. The plan was an extraordinary challenge to the traditional order. One conspirator, William Davidson, went to the gallows saying “I can die but once in this world, and the only regret left is that I have a large family of small children, and when I think of that, it unmans me.” Two hundred years ago, open revolution never came, and there was no total overthrow of the established order. Instead, Davidson and his co-conspirators fell victim to an extraordinary act of misdirection. Infiltrated by an agent provocateur who shaped and moulded the entire plot, they were betrayed. Can social media act as an agent provocateur, capable of derailing a cause if not actually betraying it? Sometimes, our anger and horrified disbelief is so great that we believe things must change. Long after the death of Alan Kurdi, the refugee crisis is unresolved, and months after the fire at Grenfell Tower, what has changed? Does the lightning-fast pace of news scupper progress? Can online revolution become a distraction if we don’t also change our day to day lives? Many internet commenters still believe those women had it coming that night at the Dorchester. In The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, Ursula K Le Guin, who died this week, leaves us with a brutal portrait of Omelas, a society of outward glamour with a dark secret. Her symbol of atrocity is an imprisoned child, either ignored by the people or accepted as a necessary evil. But some can’t reconcile the hypocrisy of superficial beauty existing alongside hidden injustice: “They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness, and they do not come back. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.” Le Guin speaks of a quiet kind of revolution, one that consists of individual people making uncomfortable choices. Revolution is asking a child we know and love for a hug and cheerfully accepting no as an answer. This is not because innocent love and affection are now “not allowed”, as straw-man arguments about sexual harassment so often suggest but because an understanding of physical boundaries and how they change – our own and others’, platonic or sexual – should be as natural as breathing, something we all grow up with from our earliest youth. Revolution is not reading Madison Marriage’s quietly furious exposé and saying, “What about Syria?”, because it is actually possible to care about more than one thing at a time. Revolution is not just having so many women in the boardroom that no one dares suggest using other women as entertainment, although that would be a good start. Revolution is men in the workplace vociferously treating this kind of corporate entertainment with the contempt it deserves, even if that means the office alpha takes exception. Revolution is in our hands. • KJ Whittaker is a historical novelist.

Yet for executives of Brightline, an ambitious $3bn venture that will eventually ferry travellers from the theme parks of Orlando to the beaches of Miami in just three hours, the champagne moment soon lost its fizz. Even before passengers left the station at Fort Lauderdale on opening day, a pedestrian was struck and killed at a road crossing by a Brightline train meant to showcase a high-speed link to journalists and dignitaries. Two further crossing strikes in the next seven days, one of them fatal, reignited a contentious safety debate, even though the victims had all passed barriers. Now, with environmental concerns also lingering over the final construction phase of the 235-mile line, from Palm Beach county to Orlando, lawmakers are seeking greater oversight of the private railway. One US congressman, Brian Mast, has called to shut down work altogether, pending an inquiry, and US senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio are demanding a federal review. “It’s terrible PR,” said Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation and a former White House transport adviser. The controversies threaten to overshadow what was meant to have been a new beginning for mass transit in Florida. Train projects had stalled for decades, most recently in 2011, when governor Rick Scott killed a proposed rail link from Tampa to Orlando, ended hope of a statewide high-speed rail network. Florida East Coast Industries, the real estate and transportation giant behind Brightline, and its subsidiary All Aboard Florida, which operates the railway, have enthusiastically pushed the project. Both have stressed what they say are the environmental benefits of Brightline’s low-emission, diesel-electric trains. According to the company, the trains will mean three million fewer cars on the roads, improving air quality in cities, and providing millions of tourists and commuters a more comfortable, speedier and less costly alternative to flying or driving. Best of all, supporters said, the railway – which FECI has promoted as funded and operated entirely by private money – uses about 200 miles of its own existing freight line, from Miami to Cocoa. That means minimal new construction or land clearance, apart from widening the trackbed for a second lane, upgrades to crossings and signals, and a final 40-mile, cross-country leg inland, from Cocoa to a new hub at Orlando airport, a stretch expected to be operational by 2020. To Brightline’s opponents, the shared freight line poses one of the projects biggest potential environmental hazards, especially in cities that trains will travel through at speed. “The freight trains carry hazardous and very dangerous commodities: ammonia, chlorine gas, LNG [liquefied natural gas], deadly farm chemicals, anhydrous ammonia, all routinely moving on the line at an average 33mph,” said Steve Ryan, attorney for Citizens Against Rail Expansion in Florida (Care-FL). The group is challenging an environmental impact statement issued by the federal railroad administration (FRA) that projected no significant adverse effects. “There’s very dangerous things on those trains, and they’re proposing to do a ballet where 32 passenger trains, travelling as high as 110mph, are going to be weaving in and out of the slower moving freight trains,” he said. “The possibility of trains contacting trains exists, and obviously vehicular and pedestrians coming into contact can cause derailment.” Ryan’s group also rejects Brightline’s estimate that it would remove three million vehicles from area roadways. “The traffic estimates they’ve made are nonsensical. Nobody believes them,” he said. Referring to Brightline’s recent application for a $1.6bn loan, in case a planned sale of $1.1bn in private equity bonds fell through, Ryan said: “If the market believed it, they would have been able to obtain the money in the private sector to do this, and wouldn’t need government subsidies and bonds.” Several counties along Florida’s so-called Treasure Coast have also sued Brightline, whose trains will run nonstop through their territory, between West Palm Beach and Orlando. None of the lawsuits, including one from Martin County seeking to halt the project citing “damage to neighbourhoods and environmental resources”, have been successful. “What they’ve been trying to do with the various lawsuits is typical ‘not in my backyard’ stuff,” said Poole, the transportation analyst. “They’re throwing anything they can think of to gum up the works and increase the cost to the point where maybe they’d think the company would give up because it’s not worth the litigation. Poole said that every construction project entailed “some environmental effects”, but that the almost $7m spent by counties has failed to derail Brightline, merely “caused difficulties and delays”. “For small county governments without huge populations, that’s a lot of taxpayer money,” he said. “To continue to spend in an effort to delay Brightline further or otherwise make it more expensive to construct and operate Brightline is not good public policy.” Brightline declined the Guardian’s request for an interview. Instead it provided a list of safety upgrades it said it was planning to the line to Orlando."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/26/yorkshire-football-team-stateless-peoples-league-isle-of-man-pontefract","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T13:41:50Z","webTitle":"Yorkshire football team set for debut in league of stateless peoples","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/26/yorkshire-football-team-stateless-peoples-league-isle-of-man-pontefract","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/26/yorkshire-football-team-stateless-peoples-league-isle-of-man-pontefract","fields":{"headline":"Yorkshire football team set for debut in league of stateless peoples","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Yorkshire’s first “international” football team will play its debut match on Sunday after being welcomed into a world league for repressed minorities, independent nations and stateless peoples. The fledgling team, who trained together for the first time last weekend, will take on the Isle of Man in front of a crowd of hundreds in Pontefract. In true Yorkshire style, the squad from God’s Own Country has snubbed joining the English Football Association and instead become part of the Confederation of Independent Football Associations (Conifa), meaning it will play against the likes of Tibet, Quebec, Greenland, Zanzibar, Darfur, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus and Myanmar’s Rohingya group. The Yorkshire International Football Association, nicknamed the Vikings, has not officially revealed its “national” anthem, but it is expected that players will run out to the rousing unofficial Yorkshire song On Ilkla Moor Baht ‘at. While Yorkshire may not seem to have much in common with many of the others in the Conifa league, the Yifa chairman, Philip Hegarty, said the white rose region was engaged in a similar political struggle to regions such as Tibet. “Every single one of these regions, to some greater or lesser extent, feel like their culture isn’t being given a voice or representation in some way, whether that’s to the extremes of Tibet, [or] to Yorkshire, which is having a fight against the government’s version of devolution,” he told the Guardian. “Everything that reaches the outside world about Yorkshire goes through this London-centric lens. There is no voice internationally for Yorkshire, even through we’re a significant region. As far as the outside world is concerned, we’re just a subdivision of England, but of course we consider ourselves much more than that.” Founded in July, Yifa advertised for players in December with only one caveat – a birth certificate that proved they were born in one of the ridings. “If Lionel Messi’s mum was born in Barnsley, we will be happy to take a look at him, but otherwise we are just looking for those born in Yorkshire,” Hegarty said in an interview last month. The squad, who will wear a blue kit bearing the white rose of York, are drawn from semi-professional clubs. Their first training session, in early December, was cancelled due to forecasts of 20cm (8in) of snow. Hegarty said Yifa had already sold replica shirts to Yorkshire expats as far afield as New Zealand, the South Pacific and the Americas, and a football shirt museum in Peru had requested one for display. The team has already had its first run-in with the FA, which Hegarty accused of using scare tactics when it warned grassroots clubs that playing for Yorkshire’s “national” side would be a breach of its regulations. Hegarty said Yorkshire was ready to fight the “pointless threat”, which he said contravened the right to associate as enshrined in the European convention on human rights. “It’s got no teeth at all and all it’s done is rattled us up here a little bit, and they can expect a fight if they carry on,” he said. It may be a long way from Wembley, but the 1,000-capacity Hemsworth Miners Welfare FC Community Club is hoping to be nearly full for Yorkshire’s first game against Ellan Vannin, the Manx name for the Isle of Man team, who are ranked fourth in Conifa’s world league. About 340 tickets have been sold, priced at £10 for adults and £5 for children, with a further 300 people expected to pay on the day. While the line-up may be finalised, Yorkshire are still looking for a kit man or woman and a mascot to play Ragnar the Viking for kick-off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/live/2018/jan/27/weekend-reading-a-maverick-signs-off-mark-e-smith-all-male-charity-dinner","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: A maverick signs off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2018/jan/27/weekend-reading-a-maverick-signs-off-mark-e-smith-all-male-charity-dinner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2018/jan/27/weekend-reading-a-maverick-signs-off-mark-e-smith-all-male-charity-dinner","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: A maverick signs off","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"How the establishment maintains male power The sexual harassment at a men-only gala dinner is just another example of the institutional sexism that poisons the British establishment Why do so many white people do this?

A spokesman for the prime minister insisted that she had full confidence in her chancellor, despite distancing herself from remarks he made in Davos on Thursday, where he said the UK should seek to diverge only “very modestly” from the EU after Brexit. The chancellor, along with the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and business secretary, Greg Clark, presented a united front on Friday by signing a joint letter to business leaders, seeking to reassure them that rules and regulations will remain the same during the post-Brexit transition period. Hammond told Sky News: “There are people that wanted to stay in the EU customs union – we reject that argument. There are people that want us to sever our trade links with Europe and give up this market – we reject their arguments too. “We have got to stick to the middle way, which is negotiating the maximum access we can get to European markets compatible with the red lines we have already set out about repatriating control over our laws, our borders and our money.” But privately, senior government figures remained at loggerheads, with Brexiters claiming the Treasury is plotting to extend the transition to three years and beyond, in the hope of leaving Britain indefinitely in a “Hotel California” status, in which “you check out, but you never leave”. Another said: “There are different views, and some of those views are going to have to crystallise over the coming months.” After Boris Johnson was given a dressing-down over well-briefed calls for more cash for the NHS on Monday, the spat with Hammond underlined the continued divisions in May’s freshly reshuffled cabinet. In Brussels, meanwhile, European officials increasingly fear that May is drifting on Brexit, amid growing concern that she is unable to make hard political choices. “There is a growing view that for domestic reasons [the British] want to play everything long and avoid making difficult choices that will antagonise the Eurosceptics or give Jeremy Corbyn an advantage,” one senior European diplomat told the Guardian. The British were waiting “for the for the EU to fill in the dots … and that is a high-risk strategy”. Asked if that increased the risks of no-deal Brexit, the diplomat said yes, “in particular given the ticking clock”. Davis stressed government unity on Friday, saying that while there would be “arguments about the tactics”, Hammond and the prime minister fundamentally agreed on the way forward. Answering questions after a speech on Brexit in Middlesbrough, Davis said Hammond had been correct in his assessment, but had been talking about what would happen during a transition period. “At the beginning, when we’re out, there will be very, very little initial difference between the standards and regulations that apply in our country and on the continent of Europe. And therefore access to the markets will continue with very, very little disruption. That was the point he was driving at.” Describing the transition period as “a bridge to the future partnership,” Davis said the UK will begin to negotiate trade agreements with the rest of the world as soon as the transition period begins. In Davos on Friday, Hammond said he had not spoken to May since his speech, but said Downing Street had “quite rightly” argued that leaving the EU, as well as the customs union and single market, were significant changes. The government nonetheless faced continued unrest from among some Conservative MPs over the apparent divisions. The Eurosceptic backbencher Bernard Jenkin told BBC2’s Daily Politics: “I think that if there are really big ideological divisions between the chancellor and the prime minister, that is usually not very good news for the stability of a government, and the PM will have to address that one way or the other – and I will leave that thought there with you.” Jenkin said the government’s Brexit policy was clear, adding: “[Hammond] should not try to play blow football with the policy and to try to make it into something that it isn’t.” Mark Pritchard, a formerly pro-remain Conservative MP, tweeted that there was “no major revolt on the Tory backbenches”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/26/larry-nassar-abuse-gymnasts-scandal-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T13:47:00Z","webTitle":"How was Larry Nassar able to abuse so many gymnasts for so long?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/26/larry-nassar-abuse-gymnasts-scandal-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/26/larry-nassar-abuse-gymnasts-scandal-culture","fields":{"headline":"How was Larry Nassar able to abuse so many gymnasts for so long?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Larry Nassar was a wonderful doctor – everyone said so. The little girls who were sent to him were told it was an honour. Their parents were told it was a sign their daughters were destined for greatness if this doctor – who treated Olympians! – would treat their children. USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University employed him for decades and, according to his former patients, when complaints were made about him they were ignored. After all, Larry Nassar was a wonderful doctor, and no one said this more than Nassar himself, who used his reputation to groom his hundreds, possibly even thousands, of victims. “I was a wonderful doctor,” he wrote in a letter while on trial for multiple charges of sexual assault, most against minors. “You are not a doctor [now],” the sharp-shooting Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told him, shortly before sentencing him to up to 175 years in prison. The Larry Nassar scandal is the biggest sexual abuse scandal in sports history. Nassar’s victims, who include some of the most famous female athletes around today, including Simone Biles and McKayla Maroney, outnumber the alleged victims of Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby combined. The abuse was global: he abused girls in London at the 2012 Olympics; at the Károlyi Ranch, USA Gymnastics’ training centre in Texas; at gymnastics meets in Rotterdam. Over the course of the week-long sentence hearing, more than 150 women made impact statements in which they described lives crushed by trauma and shame. Shy little girls who briefly found self-confidence through sport became deeply self-loathing teenagers and adults because the man who was supposed to help them do the sport they loved instead molested them, over and over again. The most obvious word this case sparks is “how”: how could this have ever been allowed to happen? How could USA Gymnastics have required hundreds of girls under its care to submit to mandatory treatment from a man who would give them “pelvic exams” in their hotel or dorm beds at night, wholly unsupervised? And how could the complaints about him have been dismissed for so long, as detailed by the gold medallist Aly Raisman in her unforgettably blistering testimony? “It’s easy to put out statements talking about how athlete care is the highest priority. But [USA Gymnastics] has been saying that for years, and all the while, this nightmare was happening,” Raisman said in court. To outsiders, these questions seem inexplicable. But to those with more experience of the sport they are all too easily explained. “There is no other sport in which this could have happened but gymnastics,” says Joan Ryan, whose 1995 book, Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, about the physical and psychological toll gymnastics takes on girls and young women, is still regarded as one of the seminal books about the sport. “These girls are groomed from an incredibly young age to deny their own experience. Your knee hurts? You’re being lazy. You’re hungry? No, you’re fat and greedy. They are trained to doubt their own feelings, and that’s why this could happen to over 150 of them.” Jennifer Sey was the 1986 US national champion and a seven-times national gymnastics team member. She says she was very aware of sexual abuse in the sport when she was training in the 80s: “There were two men who worked in my gym, both coaches, who were abusers. One was a girls’ coach, who was especially emotionally abusive and a sexual abuser, too. One of my teammates, now an adult, told me how he abused her for several years. My brother’s coach in the same gym was a known paedophile. It was openly discussed among the boys. No one did anything. The abuser was a revered coach and no one wanted to tarnish his reputation. Plus there was always concern that if you rocked the boat you would be ostracised, you wouldn’t be chosen for the team, you would be blackballed in the sport. Which was true, as we have heard from athletes in the Nassar case.” Aside from the number of girls and women abused, the most shocking revelation about this case is how the abuse was covered up, and for how long. Complaints were made to Michigan State University about Nassar as far back as 1998, but no one did anything. An investigation conducted by the Indy Star during Nassar’s trial revealed a long pattern in USA Gymnastics of hushing up or downplaying complaints about sexual abuse in the sport. Repeatedly, coaches and officials were protected at the expense of the athletes. “Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee didn’t want to scare off sponsors and they didn’t want to risk the piles of Olympic medals. So they covered it up. And at a certain point they were so far in on the cover up that they were implicated. So they dug in deeper to protect themselves from criminal and civil liability,” says Sey. Nassar’s trial has shone a light on a mentality in the sports world that values performance over protection, medals over morals, and this has long been a concern about the gymnastics world. Indeed, the unspoken assumption that this is how gymnastics works might explain why, until the final week, there was so little media interest in the Nassar case compared to previous sexual abuse scandals in other parts of the sports world. “This administration has never had a desire to win at any cost and we expect the athletes’ welfare to be given the highest priority,” says Claire Jackson from British Gymnastics when asked about the Nassar case. Ryan wrote about the notoriously brutal regime at the Károlyi Ranch, run by Béla and Márta Károlyi and where Nassar worked, detailing how girls were so deprived of food and water they would beg their male teammates to smuggle them snacks. Yet as long as the Károlyis brought in medals the media loved them. When the gymnast Jamie Dantzscher spoke out about the Károlyis in 2000, one US columnist sneered that Dantzscher’s “finger-pointing trill was a far more graceless performance than our fourth-place finish”. Almost two decades later, Dantzscher was one of the women who testified about the abuse she had suffered from Nassar, and the Károlyis are named in a handful of lawsuits tying them to Nassar. USA Gymnastics has announced it will no longer use the Károlyis’ ranch. “When I wrote about the ranch in 1995 there was all this backlash from coaches saying: ‘Oh, these girls are just annoyed they never won. It’s sour grapes.’ It’s so sad that it ended up being the girls who brought Nassar to justice – they knew the adults around them wouldn’t help them,” says Ryan. Since the start of Nassar’s trial, the president of Michigan State University has resigned under pressure and multiple officials have resigned from USA Gymnastics. But given that no one from the US Olympic Committee even bothered to come to Nassar’s trial many are questioning how committed officials truly are to changing the culture. “We need change to come from lawmakers, not organisations. There needs to be government oversight with hard and fast rules, because these girls are children, and if they win fewer medals, so be it,” says Ryan. Champion Women, an advocacy group for girls and women in sport, chaired by the former Olympic gold medallist Nancy Hogshead-Makar, has sent a letter to Congress, signed by hundreds of elite athletes, including Martina Navratilova, demanding that laws be passed that protect young athletes from predators. “Research shows that the more elite the athlete, the more likely they are to be sexually abused by someone within their own entourage. The legislation is necessary to fill gaps in legal protections for athletes not participating in school-sponsored sports,” the letter reads. But those with long experience in the sport aren’t holding their breath. Would Sey allow her daughter to go into professional sports? “No,” she replies. “I think childhood is best spent being a child.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/28/freedom-great-deal-of-that-inside-the-eu-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:05:04Z","webTitle":"Freedom?

We have a great deal of that inside the EU","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The ghost at the feast during the annual Venice seminar held by the Italian government for British and Italian journalists last weekend was the shadow of Brexit. While Italian officials were scrupulously reticent about voicing opinions on the subject, the undercurrents were obvious – not least because the Italians value the UK as an “outward-looking” ally in some of the more introspective discussions in Brussels. Reports from Davos, too, show bafflement on the part of fellow Europeans and others about the UK referendum and subsequent debate. Back in London, the first item I came across on the Today programme was the sound of economist and former Conservative minister Jim O’Neill saying that, although he was a Remainer, Brexit was really not so bad. But the main reason for this appeared to be the upturn in world economy, and in continental Europe – our main market, which the Brexiters want to leave. Later in the week we had David Cameron saying Brexit was “a mistake, not a disaster”. In both these cases, and many others, including regular proclamations from the Daily Mail, the main point has been missed. The main point is that Brexit has not actually happened. The serious damage, unless the British people change their minds, has yet to come. Yet already it is evident that the UK is a laggard in the world economic recovery, and that investment plans are being shelved at the mere prospect of Brexit. Now, in recent weeks we have seen olive branches being extended by President Macron of France and Donald Tusk, president of the European council. While the French are quite content to look for financial pickings that Brexit might offer them, it is abundantly clear Macron would prefer us to remain. However, the so-called “negotiations” tend to go around in circles. The British side persistently ask for concessions, in demands that are tantamount to a wish to enjoy all the benefits of EU membership while officially going through the departure gate. How many times do Michel Barnier and others have to repeat that “cherry-picking” and “having your cake and eating it” are simply not on? The hard fact is that, if we are intent on leaving, we have few cards. The ultimate irony is that, as members of the European Union, we have been able to cherry-pick to a point where we enjoyed all sorts of concessions: although late joiners, we were still able to negotiate the famous budget rebate; we did not have to join the eurozone or the Schengen arrangement; and, notwithstanding the misinformation that streams from the Brexit camp, we possess a “get out of jail free” card from any moves by the others towards “ever closer union”. This is a very important point, of which many people concerned about sovereignty do not seem to be aware. Non-membership of the eurozone gave a freedom to policymakers that countries such as Italy do not possess. When Italy joined the euro it lost the flexibility to adjust its exchange rate to keep competitive pace with low-inflation Germany. This affected its manufacturing sector (which, by the way, is twice the size of the much-depleted British manufacturing sector). The financial crisis and the constraints of the eurozone precipitated a 10% collapse in Italy’s national product between 2009 and 2013. Recently there has been a gradual recovery, and the economy is growing in line with the eurozone average. There is an unresolved debate as to how much this is due to “cyclical” factors – the expansionary policies of the European Central Bank – and how much is “structural”, that is, attributable to boosts to productivity from manufacturers who can no longer rely on exchange rate adjustments within the single currency area. Which brings us to the unfortunate observation that, in spite of the UK’s freedom from the constraints of the euro, our present and prospective economic performance is widely considered to be abysmal. More and more commentators make the point that the Brexit referendum vote was the culmination of a series of winters of economic and social discontent, which have to be addressed. I could not agree more! But this does not destroy the case for, one way or another, reversing the referendum result. Going ahead with Brexit can only aggravate these sources of discontent. Finally, a reminder of that revealing quote a year ago from Dominic Cummings, one of Boris Johnson’s accomplices in the referendum battlebus campaign. To the question whether the Brexiters would have won without the £350m National Health Service claim, he replied: “All our research and the close result strongly suggests no.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"housing-network/2018/jan/29/uk-homelessness-fixed-statistics-councils-landlords","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T10:37:37Z","webTitle":"Shameful spectre of UK homelessness can be fixed  | Paul Noblet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2018/jan/29/uk-homelessness-fixed-statistics-councils-landlords","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2018/jan/29/uk-homelessness-fixed-statistics-councils-landlords","fields":{"headline":"The shameful spectre of UK homelessness can be fixed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The shameful spectre of rough sleeping in 21st century Britain is entirely avoidable. The latest figures showing the scale of rough sleeping across England are shocking, but the sad reality is that this has been brought about in large part by changes to the benefits system and the inability of the private and public sectors to provide an adequate supply of truly affordable housing. The government has recently committed funding to tackle the problem of rough sleeping. If it wants to end not only rough sleeping (by 2027), but also homelessness, including youth homelessness (the number of young people rough sleeping has risen by almost 30% since last year), it needs to go much further and sort out the systemic problems too. Here’s how: Improve family support services The first step in tackling rough sleeping and youth homelessness is prevention, stopping people becoming homeless in the first place by making better use of existing services to support families, through mediation or respite services. It’s critical for such services to be funded by central government; councils cannot be expected to tackle this problem alone. But the reality is that many young people will simply not be welcome to return to the family home. That is why it is vital at the very least to stop the erosion of accommodation for people who are homeless. Stop subsidising landlords For the past decade, funding for hostels has steadily reduced as councils have seen their funding from Whitehall stripped away. For many providers and councils, it is only the generosity of the public which is keeping services going. Should they find support in a hostel, for an increasing number of young people a further barrier to leaving homelessness behind is their ability to access the private rented sector. In a climate where there are too many people chasing too few properties, the fact that many young people will need to claim some or all of their housing costs through universal credit puts them at a distinct disadvantage. The poor running of the system, combined with changes to eligibility for claimants who are 18-21 and the freezing of the local housing allowance means that even if a young person can scrape money together for rent, landlords may be put off from renting to them. The way around these problems is to stop subsidising landlords through the benefit system and use that money to build bricks and mortar, whether it is through councils borrowing at low interest rates or insistence on truly affordable units in new private developments. Keep an accurate count of people without homes But the biggest systemic failure is the inability to count or fairly assess the number of people who are homelessness. The latest figures, based on just 15% of councils actually undertaking a street count as opposed to making an estimate, is an underestimate of the true scale of homelessness. Add to that the level of hidden homeless revealed by things like the recent BBC/ComRes poll, which showed that 41% of respondents had stayed with friends on floors or sofas for at least one night, and a much larger picture of homelessness soon emerges. This is something about which the UK statistics authority and a cross-party select committee of MPs have raised concern. This picture is made worse by the narrow English definition of a homeless person. Councils and charities no longer have funding to support people who are homeless but not deemed legally entitled to help. In Scotland, and to a lesser degree in Wales, a political decision was made to broaden the definition of who could get support. The thousands of young homeless people we support every year need action to be taken. Not next year, but now.

No wonder there's a crisis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The health select committee’s report on the nursing workforce is a excoriating critique of the multiple errors in policy and practice that have created a recruitment and retention crisis. Indeed, it is difficult to identify a single aspect of nursing workforce management that is not being mishandled. The UK has relatively few nurses compared with many EU countries – yet there are still 36,000 NHS nursing vacancies in England. Around 33,000 of these are filled with bank and agency staff, which ramps up costs. While the headlines focus on shortages in hospitals, the rush by acute trusts to recruit nurses in the light of the Mid Staffordshire inquiry has fuelled shortages in other parts of the NHS. The result is that since 2010, the number of nurses in general, elderly, adult, children’s and midwifery services has grown by between 7% and 11% – while the numbers working in community services have dropped by a tenth, district nurses have fallen by almost a half, learning disabilities have lost almost 40% and mental health has lost 13%. So despite the rhetoric about “parity of esteem” for mental health, and commitments to move services into the community, in the desperate scramble for staff, the needs of acute hospitals are warping the entire system. Trying to identify the impact of different policies on recruitment and retention is all but impossible because there is so much simultaneous upheaval. Recent changes include the removal of student bursaries, the arrival of nursing associates and nursing apprenticeships, changes to the language test for overseas recruits, and Brexit. The bursary cuts have been followed by a significant fall in applications for nursing degrees, with a sharp drop in the number of mature students. As the health select committee notes in its report, mature students bring valuable life experience to the workplace. Meanwhile, the expansion in nursing places that was supposed to follow the funding changes has been delayed. Quality and safety is being compromised. The Care Quality Commission provided shocking evidence of the consequences of too few staff, including inconsistent identification and management of life-threatening conditions such as sepsis; poor audits of key safety priorities and quality improvement projects; poor infection control; failures to provide essential safety training such as safeguarding; poor information sharing; and treatments being delayed or repeated unnecessarily. The MPs heard consistently that nurses feel undervalued. While pay is an issue, there is palpable anger among staff at cuts to their continuing professional development. In just two years, this has been slashed from £205m to £84m at a time when the government is calling for higher nurse productivity. NHS Employers spelled out why this is a “fundamental priority for national action”, as it is undermining the quality of everything from community practice to intensive care nursing. Local employers aren’t even getting the basics right. Nurses complained about the lack of facilities, such as kettles and fridges. A failure to use e-rostering hampers flexible working. Bureaucratic barriers inhibit nurses from applying for vacancies in their own organisation, and there are difficulties in having skills recognised when moving between employers. As recruitment of nurses from the EU slumps, Health Education England is ramping up national-level recruitment from overseas. But this is being hampered by poor professional development and the lack of clear career structures. With a global shortage of healthcare staff, the UK is in a highly competitive market. Health Education England is consulting on its draft workforce strategy, published in December. The initial proposals require substantial development if they are to meet the multiple challenges spelled out by the health select committee. It needs to raise the ambition for recruiting and retaining nurses, confront the problems of pay and professional development, be honest about the shortcomings in the education system, and push employers to get the basics right. Everything in the NHS is tough at the moment, but the nursing crisis is being exacerbated by unforced errors.

Because he already has one","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Art can be a terrific way of insulting the powerful. It is the ultimate smirking courtier, seeming to suck up while in reality, gesticulating rudely behind the king’s back – or, in the case of Donald Trump and the golden toilet, under his backside. President Trump can’t really complain about Guggenheim curator Nancy Spector’s offer to install, or rather plumb, a valuable work of contemporary art in the White House. It might even be seen as a sensitive response to the president’s known tastes. What else can you give a man who regularly boasts he has everything and whose New York home boasts gold ceilings, golden plant pots and a gold lift? A golden toilet might seem like the ultimate homage. It is a genuinely generous offer and the president should have said yes. When Trump asked the Guggenheim museum to lend him Vincent van Gogh’s melancholy and introspective 1888 painting Landscape with Snow, Spector refused – yet what she offered instead is one of art’s most celebrated recent masterpieces. Maurizio Cattelan’s America was first unveiled at the Guggenheim in 2016. It was on view until September 2017 – and in use. Yes, 100 years after Marcel Duchamp submitted an ordinary urinal to an art exhibition, Cattelan’s toilet went one better – it was actually plumbed in. And people queued up. Inviting visitors to use an 18-karat toilet seemed a comment on the insanity of the art market as well as the grotesque iniquities of runaway capitalism. It is an appropriate thing for Trump to sit on at the White House. However, given his terror of germs, he would be unlikely to ever use a toilet on which more than 100,000 museum visitors are known to have done their business. Or maybe he has a golden toilet already? If this work is intended as an insult, it wouldn’t be the first time art has mocked the face of power. It is the fate of artists to work for the rich and influential. Art is a luxury good: its patrons and collectors have always been the 1%, not the 99%. Understandably, artists often snap. And they weave their protests into their work with varying degrees of subtlety and wit. In 1918, Duchamp was commissioned to make a painting – not his idea of fun – by the US art collector Katherine Dreier. He hinted at his true feelings toward her in the title he gave it: Tu m’, which is generally thought to be short for either “tu m’emmerdes” (you annoy me) or “tu m’ennuies” (you bore me). Mark Rothko lacked Duchamp’s subtlety. Soon after he accepted a lucrative commission to paint decorations for the Four Seasons restaurant in New York, he bitterly called the restaurant “a place where the richest bastards in New York will come to feed and show off”. He created his darkest paintings: black, purple and blood-red premonitions of the abyss warning all who ate there to abandon hope. Mercifully, he realised the insult would probably not be understood by a bunch of steak-chomping Mad Men, so rejected the commission and gave many of the paintings to the Tate Modern instead. Such insults pale beside the colossal cheek of portraitists who made their powerful employers look stupid, ugly, ill or mad. In the Napoleonic age, Francisco de Goya painted the Spanish royal family as a sad bunch of feeble grotesques. Why did they accept the insult? No one who looks at his Family of Carlos IV can miss its unflattering truthfulness. But Goya was actually complying to a Spanish tradition of ruthless honesty in royal portraits that goes back to his 17th-century predecessor Velázquez. In Velázquez’s portrayal of Philip IV of Spain as an old man, there is no hint of flattery – just a wretch, whose face is sagging as his life decays. Thanks to the grave Catholic culture of Spain such honesty was taken not as an insult, but as reflecting a simple truth. Everyone dies, everyone gets old – even a king. And sometimes, even the president of the United States has to go to the toilet. The point about a gold loo is that, no matter how expensive it is, it still cannot disguise the smell of what’s inside it. If he had it plumbed into the White House, Trump would show he had a sense of humour and understood democracy. He might even become more human."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jan/28/prehab-the-humble-warm-up-gets-a-makeover","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T15:00:21Z","webTitle":"Prehab – the humble warm-up gets a makeover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jan/28/prehab-the-humble-warm-up-gets-a-makeover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jan/28/prehab-the-humble-warm-up-gets-a-makeover","fields":{"headline":"Prehab – the humble warm-up gets a makeover","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In some circles, “prehab” means preparing for overindulgence on a colossal scale – a mega-bender before a voluntary stint of detox. But the word has been co-opted by the fitness industry to describe one of the hot-to-trot workout trends of 2018: a session of sensible limbering up before you pig out on pullups and kettlebell reps – less risky than a blowout and a whole lot more relaxing. Going bigger, faster, stronger and longer has been the way to exercise in recent years (think HIIT, CrossFit and endurance events), but this has led to a rash of injuries. “I don’t like to use the term ‘dangerous movement’, but it can be dangerous if you don’t prepare,” explains Firas Iskandarani, “functional fitness master trainer” at Gymbox, the London gym that has offered 30-minute prehab sessions for the past 18 months. Women’s-only members gym Grace Belgravia also offers prehab. “It’s a fundamental part of our training,” says gym manager Duncan Vincent. “Our timetable is designed around preventive exercise to make the body as efficient as possible.” Ten Pilates offers prehab, too, describing it as “too important to be the preserve of elite athletes and boutique providers. It’s about time the UK’s mainstream fitness companies got on board.” James Duigan, known for training Rita Ora, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Lara Stone at his Bodyism gym, will spend 20 minutes of an hour-long session preparing his clients for the burn, and includes a prehab circuit in his recent Blueprint for Health book. What’s involved? Expect a range of gentle exercises to improve your mobility, flexibility, posture and alignment. Be prepared to meet foam rollers (these guys can hurt), trigger point balls and resistance bands. It’s a bit of stretching, then? Sort of, but very special stretching that elite athletes swear by. “It’s not just like a warm-up,” says Vincent. “It preps the body and corrects imbalances depending on what you’re going on to do.” Sounds great, but I’m too lazy to run a marathon afterwards. Iskandarani says that while the majority of people who come to Gymbox’s prehab sessions then do a high-intensity class, many others go straight home and relax, happy they have spent 20 minutes doing something good for their body."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/05/accent-comedy-standups-home-town-humour-ardal-ohanlon-jayde-adams-tez-ilyas","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T10:00:17Z","webTitle":"'My accent's ridiculous so it's great for comedy': standups on their home town's humour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/05/accent-comedy-standups-home-town-humour-ardal-ohanlon-jayde-adams-tez-ilyas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/05/accent-comedy-standups-home-town-humour-ardal-ohanlon-jayde-adams-tez-ilyas","fields":{"headline":"'My accent's ridiculous so it's great for comedy': standups on their home town's humour","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman walk into a bar. The punchline? That depends on which part of the country you’re in. We’ve long been making gags about our neighbours. The English joke about the Irish, southerners make fun of the north, Liverpudlians tease Mancunians. And vice versa. A comedian can go on stage at a comedy club anywhere in Britain and call a nearby town a dump, and that’s the audience won over. But what about the crowds themselves? Do some jokes go down better in the Midlands than the Highlands? Is there such a thing as a regional sense of humour? Comic Jayde Adams is from Bristol, and she’s a firm believer that the West Country – and her city in particular – has a distinctive sense of humour. “Bristolians have a keep-calm-and-carry-on attitude to life,” she says. “We’re positive and upbeat. We try to find the funny in most situations, mainly because we’ve got a ridiculous accent. Even if we’re not trying to be funny, we sound funny.” The Bristol accent has been an effective weapon in Adams’s comedy arsenal. Not only because it makes people laugh, says the Edinburgh comedy award-nominated standup, but because she can use it to wrongfoot an audience. “People are bright in Bristol, but we’ve got the accent of people who probably aren’t,” she says. “Audiences think you’re going to be thick, so no one expects me to sing opera at them. It’s fun to play with stereotypes in that way. It’s a great accent for comedy.” Accents can play a part in how well a comedian is received across the country, says Adams. Speak with a regional accent, and other regions will respond more positively. “But if you’ve got a middle-class accent – or you haven’t got an accent – you’re going to have a much tougher time,” she says. “If you go round the country with a posh accent and you don’t make excuses for that, it’s not going to work.” Ardal O’Hanlon – from the border town of Carrickmacross in Ireland – agrees that having a clearly locatable tone can be an advantage. “It’s quite telling that the really big comedians – like John Bishop from Liverpool, Kevin Bridges from Glasgow, Peter Kay from Bolton – stand out with their strong regional accents,” says the Father Ted star. “People love authenticity in comedy and, coming from a region, you get a very strong sense of place. They can place you straight away, so they can relax.” O’Hanlon has been gigging across the UK and his home country for decades, but when he started in the early 90s – co-founding the International Bar in Dublin – Ireland had no comedy scene. “Carrickmacross always had a border mentality,” he says. “Smuggling would have been a big thing there in the past; there would have been spillover from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. So people kept their mouths shut. They were very reserved, and as a result the humour was very deadpan and straight-faced. When I was growing up, you never knew whether people were being serious or not. There was a lot of nodding and winking.” When O’Hanlon started performing standup he adopteda persona with similar traits: low-key, monotone, never cracking a smile. Head further south in the republic and the sense of humour becomes more garrulous, he says, more stereotypically Irish. But, despite the regional differences, O’Hanlon believes there is a distinctive sense of humour to the country as a whole. “First, we speak a different dialect,” he says. “Technically it’s called Hiberno-English – it’s very influenced by the old Irish-Gaelic language. Sentence construction is different, vocabulary is different, pronunciation is different. Second, the storytelling tradition is monstrous. The Romans never made it as far as Ireland, the Reformation didn’t take hold in Ireland, we didn’t really have an industrial revolution – so one of the only forms of entertainment was storytelling. I think that inspired the current generation of Irish comedians.” To the rest of the world, the UK also has a particular comedic reputation. There’s a British sense of humour – sarcastic and self-deprecating. We love innuendo and satire. But what seem like barely noticeable regional traits to a foreigner seem like huge differences from within the country. “I see certain regions almost like ethnic minorities within Britain,” says Blackburn-born standup Tez Ilyas. “Scouse is almost an ethnic minority, as is Geordie, as is Glaswegian, or living in the Welsh valleys. And they all have their own brand of humour that as an outsider you’d struggle with – in the same way that ethnicities have their own sense of humour as well.” Lancashire is a particularly sarcastic place, says Ilyas, but equally specific is the northern Asian-British sense of humour. “Blackburn’s a highly segregated town and there’s a very clear line between where the Asian people live and where white people live. Because of that, most Asians in Blackburn grew up in quite insular communities, so we only interacted with white people at school or work. We came up with coping mechanisms to deal with talking with the other side, and part of that is the sense of humour.” While these regional shifts might seem alienating to outsiders, to natives there’s a sense of ownership and comfort in being able to laugh at a joke that others can’t latch on to. “Take Four Lions,” says Ilyas. “I enjoy that film on a level that some can’t enjoy it on, because I grew up with people who sound like [protagonists] Waj and Faisal … There’s something unique about it to me. When I do a home town gig I spend half an hour ripping different parts of the town apart, and it goes down brilliantly. You can only do that if you know a place super well.” With such a sense of locality and ownership across the UK and Ireland – where every town argues that it has the best sense of humour – which locations actually make for the best audiences? “Bristol is a magical place to gig,” says Ilyas. “The people there want to have a really good time. They’ll laugh at things that are stupid or silly, but, if you get political, they’ll go with that, too.” Brighton aside, south coast audiences are the toughest, says Ilyas. Is that because they respond less well to a northern comic? “Possibly,” he says. “It’s also a little bit Ukippy, so I think that’s part of it.” “I’ll tell you what’s a bloody tough gig,” says Adams. “A Wednesday or Thursday night at Soho theatre in London – you can get some right stinkers there. But it’s difficult all over the place. The less the local area has going on, the more interested they are in the gig.” For O’Hanlon? “Well, I always enjoy the Belfast audience,” he says. “You always knew that people there were going to be lively and up for it. Partly because of the Troubles, I suppose they always appreciated people who made the effort to go there. Every single audience is different, every single night is different – and it’s baffling. Sometimes you think, ‘Yep, I’ve got this absolutely cracked. I know what to expect.’ And then you go out there and it’s entirely different, and you’re wrongfooted from the start. It’s endlessly fascinating. It’s what keeps me in the game.” • Jayde Adams is at the Leicester Comedy festival on 11 February and Machynlleth Comedy festival on 4 May.

The suffocatingly dense district of Shuafat is a Palestinian refugee camp that has grown into a maze of illegally built high-rises, but the Palestinian Authority has no power here. Israel considers Shuafat under its jurisdiction – its residents pay tax – yet people say the only state presence they feel is when soldiers come in. Sewage spills on to the road, rubbish burns in old oil drums, and there is no mail system. Few streets have names. Israeli ambulances and fire trucks won’t enter. So for many residents of Shuafat, the closest thing to a government is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA. The body was set up to help Palestinians uprooted in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war – at the time considered a temporary crisis. In the absence of peace, UNRWA has continued operations for seven decades, running schools, clinics, sanitation efforts and shelters. But the aid agency is in crisis after Washington targeted its funding. For the residents on the crowded streets of Shuafat, already notorious as the drug and crime centre of Jerusalem, an end to UNRWA would mean the collapse of nearly all their infrastructure. Donald Trump says he is using humanitarian aid to Shuafat and more than 5 million Palestinians across the Middle East as leverage to force their leaders into signing up to his yet-to-be-detailed peace initiative. “That money is on the table and that money’s not going to them unless they sit down and negotiate peace,” he said on Thursday, sitting opposite Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Cutbacks have already started. Last year, the US was the single largest donor to UNRWA, paying $355m, close to half its operating budget. This year, it has contributed $60m. Blocked off by Israel’s separation barrier, there is only one exit from Shuafat into the rest of Jerusalem, through a military checkpoint. There are no accurate figures regarding how many people live in the camp, which was annexed by Israel after 1967, although UNRWA estimates about 24,000 live there. Khalid al-Sheikh, 48, works in the Palestinian Child Center, a group in Shuafat that runs reading, music, yoga and other activities. With overcrowding in schools – up to 46 in a class, al-Sheikh says – the group hopes to reduce psychological stress in a neighbourhood he describes as a “prison”. A week ago, the girls’ school run by UNRWA was raided by thieves who stole computers. “There are hardly any janitors, no guards,” he said. “If it was bad before, imagine the situation after. Trump’s decision: it’s a death sentence to the children of the camp,” he said. “If you remove these services, people have nothing left but their dignity.” He warned that the result would be violence. Shuafat has a history of attacks, both criminal and political. In 2015, the Times of Israel described the camp as a “ticking time bomb”. Chris Gunness, a spokesman for UNWRA, also warns of the danger of cuts. “Is it in American and Israel security interests to have the collapse of a functioning service provider in Jerusalem?” he asked. UNRWA also works across the West Bank and Gaza, where Trump’s Middle East policies have met an explosive reaction. A joint Palestinian-Israeli poll found support for militancy among Palestinians jumped 17% immediately after the US president said he would recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The declaration broke international consensus that the city’s status would be negotiated by the two sides. Trump now says that issue is off the table. More than half of the Palestinian refugees UNRWA supports live in other countries –Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. In Lebanon, slum-like conditions and state discrimination in camps regularly lead to clashes with the army. “We run schools for over half a million children across the region,” said Gunness. “Imagine if those services were to stop ... You would have half a million children on the streets of the Middle East and not in UN schools at a time when extremists are in full recruitment mode. How does that fit with the counter-terrorism narrative of western governments? How does that contribute towards stability in the Middle East?” UNRWA’s commissioner-general has been travelling around the world meeting governments and individuals in an attempt to cover the shortfall. A public campaign, named “dignity is priceless”, has launched online. For the moment, Gunness says UNRWA is determined not to make any cuts: “We are robustly determined to maintain services because we are talking about some of the most disadvantaged people in the region.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/jan/30/new-war-rise-endless-urban-conflict-saskia-sassen","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"Welcome to a new kind of war: the rise of endless urban conflict","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jan/30/new-war-rise-endless-urban-conflict-saskia-sassen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jan/30/new-war-rise-endless-urban-conflict-saskia-sassen","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to a new kind of war: the rise of endless urban conflict","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the 21st century, the search for national security has become a source of urban insecurity. The traditional security paradigm in our western-style democracies fails to accommodate a key feature of today’s wars: when our major powers go to war, the enemies they now encounter are irregular combatants. Not troops, organised into armies; but “freedom” fighters, guerrillas, terrorists. Some are as easily grouped by common purpose as they are disbanded. Others engage in wars with no end in sight. What such irregular combatants tend to share is that they urbanise war. Cities are the space where they have a fighting chance, and where they can leave a mark likely to be picked up by the global media. This is to the disadvantage of cities – but also to the typical military apparatus of today’s major powers. The main difference between today’s conflicts and the first and second world wars is the sharp misalignment between the war space of traditional militaries compared to that of irregular combatants. Irregular combatants are at their most effective in cities. They cannot easily shoot down planes, nor fight tanks in open fields. Instead, they draw the enemy into cities, and undermine the key advantage of today’s major powers, whose mechanised weapons are of little use in dense and narrow urban spaces. We have seen this across Iraq since 2003, when the US and its allies led their second war in Iraq. Along with Vietnam, this conflict was one of the first major examples in our current epoch of these asymmetric wars, and a good case for examining how irregular combatants can derail a massive conventional army. While the attack on Iraq’s regular army was a quick war, almost an easy war, fought and won largely from the air over six weeks of absolutely superior air bombardment that destroyed the Iraqi army, the ground war is still not quite over all these years later. Nor do contemporary urban wars even prioritise direct combat. Rather, they produce forced urbanisation and de-urbanisation. In many cases, such as Kosovo, displaced people swell urban populations. In other cases, such as Baghdad, ethnic cleansing expels people – in that case the “voluntary” departures of Sunnis, Christians and other religious groups, all of whom had long co-existed in Iraq’s large cities. Indeed, warring forces now often avoid battle. Their main strategy is to gain control over territory, through the expulsion of “the other” – often defined in terms of ethnicity, religion, tribal membership or political affiliation. Their main tactic is the terror of conspicuous atrocities, such as in South Sudan, home to a brutal and bloody war with no end in sight fought between two strongmen (and former collaborators), or the Congo, where irregular armies fighting for control of mining wealth have killed millions. The western military is learning. The US now has training camps featuring imitation “Arab” urban districts, and has picked up the Israeli practice of entering a dense neighbourhood not via the street, but by crossing through homes – a parallel pathway to the street, running from one interior room to another by carving holes in contiguous walls, and dealing with the inhabitants as they come across them. They have learned, above all, that the city itself has become an obstacle. And while it is true that they can simply bomb a city to pieces – as we’ve seen with the bombing of Aleppo and other cities by Syria’s government and its allies – we have not recently seen the total destruction of the Hiroshima nuclear attack or the fire-bombing of Dresden. Why? What is it that makes the city a problematic, uneasy target for our major military powers? Consider why the 6 million people, including United Nations “blue helmets”, killed in rural Congo over the past decade by irregular and regular armies is rarely mentioned in the global media, while 13 killed in London is front-page news. Global media certainly have an easier time reporting on major cities than on villages and fields. But even when those “remote” deaths are invoked, the shock and the engagement is not as strong as it is with terrorist attacks in cities. This engagement with the urban goes beyond attacks on people: when a major historic building or work of art is destroyed, it can generate huge responses of horror, pain, sadness, sense of loss – but 6 million killed in Congo? Nothing. This is both shocking and revealing. Is it because the city is something we’ve made together, a collective construction across time and space? Is it because at the heart of the city are commerce and the civic, not war – even if many cities started as fortresses? Certainly, the global resonance of tragic events in cities explains why small bands of angry, hurt youth or loners consider even minor terror attacks in their cities: the attention of global media, particularly if those attacks happen in cities that are not part of the narrowly defined “war zone”. The new urban map of war is expansive: it goes far beyond that war zone. The attacks in Madrid, London, Casablanca, New York, Bali, Mumbai, Lahore, Jakarta, Nice, Munich, Paris, Barcelona, Manchester, Brussels – and on and on – are all part of this map, whether or not their countries are involved in the active theatre of war. We have gone from wars commanded by hegemonic powers that sought control over sea, air, and land, to wars fought in cities – either inside the war zone, or enacted in cities far away. The space for action can involve “the war”, or simply specific local issues; each attack has its own grievances and aims, seeking global projection or not. Localised actions by local armed groups, mostly acting independently from other such groups, let alone from actors in the war zone – this fragmented isolation has become a new kind of multi-sited war. In the old wars, there was the option of calling for an armistice. In today’s wars, there are no dominant powers who can decide to end it. Today’s urban wars, above all, are wars with no end in sight.

In response to the question “Will you vote to change the constitution so that the government can legislate for abortion up to 12 weeks, or will you vote not to change the constitution?”, 56% said they would vote in favour, 29% said they would vote against, and 15% said they did not know or offered no opinion. Changing the constitution would mean repealing Ireland’s eighth amendment, which recognises the equal rights to life of a foetus and the mother during pregnancy and in effect bans abortion in almost all circumstances. Pro-choice campaigners say the amendment, added to the constitution after a referendum in 1983, creates a legal “chill factor” in the health system, even in cases where Irish law allows for a termination, such as when a pregnancy would result in the mother’s death. The responses to the Irish Times/MRBI opinion poll suggest a significant swing towards the repeal side. When asked if their view on abortion being more widely available had changed in the last year, 19% of respondents said they were more open to the idea, while 3% said they had become less open. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, under pressure in recent weeks to state his position on abortion, has said he will do so before a special meeting of the cabinet on Monday night. It is expected the meeting will give the go-ahead for a referendum later this year, with May being suggested as the preferred time for the vote.Varadkar’s Fine Gael party and the main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, are divided on the issue. Generally speaking, MPs from more rural, conservative constituencies are opposed to reforming the law, while those in urban areas are more likely to be in favour. Micheál Martin, Fianna Fáil’s leader, shocked many in his party last week when he came out openly in favour of a yes vote to repeal the eighth amendment and allow for limited abortions. A large group of Fianna Fáil MPs who oppose liberalising abortion laws are trying to prevent the referendum being held in May, which they argue would benefit the pro-choice side because it would be easier for students to vote in big cities. There is a generational angle to the debate: support among 18- to 24-year-olds in the poll was 74%, while among those over 65 it was 36%. While the country remains overwhelmingly Catholic, public opinion has become far more socially liberal in recent years. A complete ban on abortion was only lifted in 2013 to allow terminations in cases where the mother’s life was in danger. The abortion debate has become increasingly heated and acrimonious in recent months. This week, the charity Down Syndrome Ireland criticised the anti-abortion Love Both group over leaflets it had distributed with the headline “90% of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome in Britain are aborted”. “This is very disrespectful to both children and adults with Down syndrome and their families,” the charity said. “It is also causing a lot of stress to parents. People with Down syndrome should not be used as an argument for either side of this debate.” Meanwhile, the Methodist church in Ireland has become the latest of the four main Christian denominations in the Republic to oppose the proposed abortion reforms. A statement from the Methodist Council on Social Responsibility said the church had “consistently been against abortion on demand”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/26/ellie-butler-mother-seeks-to-have-cruelty-conviction-overturned-court-of-appeal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T11:14:03Z","webTitle":"Ellie Butler's mother seeks to have cruelty conviction overturned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/26/ellie-butler-mother-seeks-to-have-cruelty-conviction-overturned-court-of-appeal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/26/ellie-butler-mother-seeks-to-have-cruelty-conviction-overturned-court-of-appeal","fields":{"headline":"Ellie Butler's mother seeks to have cruelty conviction overturned","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A woman who was found guilty of child cruelty after her partner murdered their six-year-old daughter will go to the court of appeal next month to seek to have her conviction overturned. Jennie Gray, the mother of Ellie Butler, was convicted having previously admitted perverting the course of justice over her role in a “cover-up” to protect Ellie’s father, Ben Butler. Gray, who is due to be released soon, was sentenced to 42 months in jail, while her partner was sentenced to a minimum of 23 years for murder. The couple were found guilty of child cruelty for leaving Ellie with an untreated shoulder fracture in the weeks leading up to her death. She suffered “catastrophic” head injuries at the family home in Sutton, south London, in 2013, 11 months after she returned to her parents following a high-profile custody battle. She had been cared for most of her life by her grandparents, Neal and Linda Gray, who did not want her to return to her parents because of concerns about her welfare. Ellie was returned to her parents’ care in November 2012 after Butler’s conviction for violently shaking her when she was a baby was quashed. Neal Gray has severed all contact with his daughter. He said he was “very upset” that she had decided to apply for leave to appeal to overturn her conviction for child cruelty. The case will be heard on 23 February. It is possible that part of the proceedings may be filmed. Butler was accused of beating Ellie to death in a violent rage while home alone with her. Jennie Gray pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice after admitting her role in an attempt to make it appear that Ellie died two hours later than she had. The couple claimed her death was the result of an accident, with Butler’s defence suggesting Ellie may have fallen while jumping on her bed in imitation of cartoon character Peppa Pig. The couple have twice appeared via video link from prison at inquest hearings into the death of their daughter, interrupting the proceedings several times. Linda Dobbs, the retired high court judge presiding over the inquest, said the hearing would be article 2-compliant, meaning the role of the state in Ellie’s death would be examined. “Were there failures on the part of the authorities, agencies and individuals to protect Ellie’s life and prevent her death?” said Dobbs. The full inquest is due to begin on 12 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/26/talking-horses-coneygree-out-of-cheltenham-festival-trials-day-horse-racing-tips-friday-26-january","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T09:47:15Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Coneygree out of Cheltenham Festival trials day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/26/talking-horses-coneygree-out-of-cheltenham-festival-trials-day-horse-racing-tips-friday-26-january","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/26/talking-horses-coneygree-out-of-cheltenham-festival-trials-day-horse-racing-tips-friday-26-january","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Coneygree out of Cheltenham Festival trials day","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Cheltenham’s Trials day card on Saturday lost a significant name this morning with the news that Coneygree, the 2015 Gold Cup winner, has been ruled out of the Cotswold Chase, in which he was due to run for the first time since undergoing wind surgery following a disappointing run in the Ladbrokes Trophy Handicap at Newbury in early December. Coneygree was reported to be on course for Saturday’s race earlier in the week, and had been quoted at around 8-1 to record his first win since November 2015. The testing ground at Cheltenham, though, means that he will now be an absentee. “We’ve decided we’re not going to run on Saturday,” Sara Bradstock, the assistant trainer at her husband Mark’s stable, said on Friday morning. “It was always going to be tight after the wind op and especially with the way the ground is, so we’ve decided we’ll wait for Newbury [the Denman Chase on 10 February]. “Newbury is only two weeks away, so we don’t have long to wait. We just don’t want to rush him back and run on horrible ground.” Doncaster’s two-day Sky Bet meeting gets under way today with a competitive and interesting card, including a second run over fences for Malcolm Jefferson’s Mount Mews (1.55). The seven-year-old was a useful hurdler but has always seemed likely to come into his own over the bigger obstacles, and could hardly have been more impressive on his successful chasing debut at Friday’s track a fortnight ago. He has been found another good opening for his second start this afternoon and it will be disappointing if he fails to progress as expected. Perfect Harmony (1.25) finished in mid-division in the Champion Bumper at Cheltenham in March and while he has yet to win in two starts over hurdles this season, a repeat of his form at Ascot last time out would probably be good enough to get him off the mark on Friday. Muthabir (4.10) put up a career-best performance to win in a decent time at Kempton Park in November and is a fair price at around 12-1 to follow up on Friday, while Ar Mest (1.35) ran with promise behind If The Cap Fits on his hurdling debut at Kempton on Boxing Day and could show the benefit of the experience this afternoon. Tigerfish (2.20) should go well on the Flat card at Lingfield, while Wiff Waff (7.45) has progressed rapidly on his past two starts and should be up to completing a hat-trick at Kempton Park on Friday evening."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/02/juliet-jacques-hollywood-transgender-fantastic-woman","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T08:45:27Z","webTitle":"A fantastic leap – trans cinema's breakthrough moment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/02/juliet-jacques-hollywood-transgender-fantastic-woman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/02/juliet-jacques-hollywood-transgender-fantastic-woman","fields":{"headline":"A fantastic leap – trans cinema's breakthrough moment","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Fantastic Woman, Chilean director Sebastián Lelio’s best foreign language Oscar nominee, is not the first film about a trans woman to be in contention for an Academy Award. Some argue that playing a trans character is a sure-fire way to contend for a statuette – look at the nominations for John Lithgow for The World According to Garp (1982); Jaye Davidson for The Crying Game (1992); Hilary Swank in Boys Don’t Cry (1999); Felicity Huffman for Transamerica (2005); Jared Leto for Dallas Buyers Club (2013) and Eddie Redmayne for The Danish Girl (2015). What is new is that Lelio’s lead actor, Chilean actor/singer Daniela Vega, is herself trans, and was briefly in the running to become the first trans person to be nominated for best actor. Vega missed out, but her performance as trans woman Marina, whose older lover Orlando dies in her arms, leading to her being ostracised by his family and suspected of murder, was integral to the film’s Oscars recognition. Those interested in trans representation did have something to celebrate with Yance Ford’s nomination for Strong Island, which made Ford the first trans director to be considered for an Academy Award – for best documentary. That Ford’s film does not directly deal with LGBT issues, but with his brother’s murder by a white man who was never brought to trial is significant for a community so often typecast. However, Vega’s prominence has raised another question, which has become more prominent as advocates have broken into mainstream media in the last decade: should trans characters in feature films be played by trans actors? Historically, there has been a divide: underground films in which trans people play themselves, often with improvised dialogue that uses their own experiences; and mainstream films in which A-list, cisgender actors portray a trans character. The latter doesn’t have to be worse than the former, or bad in itself – a talented actor can produce an interesting and intelligent performance, given a well-researched and sensitively written script. As a trans teenager, I found films such as Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994) or I Shot Andy Warhol (1996) helpful, as they showed the difficulties of cross-gender existence with nuance and wit, never degenerating into cliche or melodrama. Leto’s Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club met with hostility not just because it embodied so many stereotypes (“a sad-sack, clothes-obsessed, constantly flirting … drug-addict prostitute” as Steve Friess wrote in Time) but also because no trans consultants were enlisted, and because Leto used his speech on winning the Golden Globe for best supporting actor to talk about how that “tiny little Brazilian bubble butt was all mine” rather than anything he had learned about the realities of trans living. The Crying Game was notable for not using a big-name actor, unlike Priscilla with Terence Stamp or Myra Breckinridge (1970) with Raquel Welch. The film’s twist, zealously protected by its US marketers (just before the internet made this impossible) relied on Jaye Davidson, who played Dil, the main romantic interest, being unknown. This meant the viewer realised Dil was trans at the same time as protagonist Fergus – played by the more established Stephen Rea. The Danish Girl is a strange case. Adapted from David Ebershoff’s novel, it is loosely based on the life of Lili Elbe, who died in 1933 after one of the first sex- reassignment surgeries. The film took10 years to get from a script to the screen. It was long delayed by financiers pulling out, worried that the story was not commercially viable, and the inability to secure a big name to play Elbe. Originally, Nicole Kidman was lined up to star and produce, but the film went through three false starts and six directors before its eventual release with Eddie Redmayne as its lead. During the 15-year lag between Ebershoff’s novel being optioned and Redmayne receiving his best actor nomination in 2016, much had changed. Telling the story through a cisgender woman (Alicia Vikander, who won in 2016 for best supporting actor) struggling to accept her lover’s trans identity, felt old-fashioned, the reverse-mirror shots of Elbe modelling for her painting utterly cliched. The scene where Elbe gets beaten up by people who ask: “Are you a girl or a boy” felt heavy-handed, plastering a familiar transphobic trope over a situation that was far more nuanced. Again, though, the problem was not so much Redmayne’s interpretation of the role as the hackneyed script and ponderous direction, and for me, the film’s worst crime was being boring. During that interregnum, there had been one other significant Hollywood portrayal of a trans woman: Transamerica. When I saw it in 2005, Transamerica felt like an exercise in compromise, written in the awareness that studios would not cast a trans actor as a lead, but trying to make space by using trans people in supporting roles. The first person on screen was trans woman Andrea James, teaching Bree (Felicity Huffman) how to feminise her voice. Despite this, and a scene where Bree attends at a party for trans women, played by trans women, Huffman could not escape the need to establish her character’s transsexuality through a series of clichés: putting inserts in her bra; applying make-up in the mirror (while dressed all in pink); seeing a psychiatrist who praises her “authenticity”. Even this timidity, though, outdid The Danish Girl. For now, trans actors still aren’t cast in those roles, partly because producers feel there aren’t any qualified to play them. But trans people are seldom given other parts (and if they are, don’t get nominated for awards for their “brave” portrayals of cisgender characters) so the problem persists. Technological advances have offered ways around this: Netflix made space not just for Ford’s Strong Island, but also Laverne Cox’s rise to prominence as trans inmate Sophia Burset in Orange is the New Black, which led to her cover appearance on Time ’s Transgender Tipping Point issue in May 2014. Cox’s success showed the film industry that it wasn’t just a handful of activists who wanted to see trans actors playing trans characters. The following year, a surprise, low-budget hit confirmed this: Sean Baker’s Tangerine, which also relied on digital advances to get around traditional barriers. It was shot in Hollywood on an iPhone 5, a process that, unlike traditional films, did not require a permit. Baker used two trans actors, Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor, from a Los Angeles LGBT centre, who brought their own experiences of sex work, poverty and transphobia into the script. This way of working has a long underground tradition. Several of the New American Cinema film-makers, including Jack Smith, Ken Jacobs and Ron Rice, assembled groups of outsiders, including gender-variant individuals such as Mario Montez and Francis Francine, pointed a camera at them and turned the results into a film. Plot wasn’t usually their main concern – the films were more about celebrating their own survival, and creating spaces away from straight society where they could express themselves without restraint. This movement arose in the early 1960s: Jacobs’s Little Stabs at Happiness, Rice’s Chumlum and Smith’s Flaming Creatures were all made between 1959-1963, with Smith’s film confiscated by police and censored by the Supreme Court. Paul Morrissey and Andy Warhol took a slightly more structured approach, in their films with the Factory’s trio of transgender superstars, Jackie Curtis, Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn. The point wasn’t so much that they were trans, but that being so placed them on the margins, where Trash (1970), featuring Joe Dallesandro as a heroin-addicted hustler and Woodlawn as “Holly” was set. In Europe, two notable directors followed this lead. The first was German film-maker Rosa von Praunheim, whose films are more intelligent and interesting than (heterosexual or cisgender) critics realised. City of Lost Souls (1983) was badly received on its release for its minimal plot; certainly, its scripted parts are its weakest. Like Warhol, Von Praunheim brought misfits – specifically, queer Americans in West Berlin – together, and let them improvise dialogue. The film’s best scene, has transsexual performer Angie Stardust and transvestite Tara O’Hara, playing themselves, arguing about whether surgery is necessary to be a woman. Angie’s passionate explanation that “it’s because of the old school that you can be what you are” wins the debate. Maybe someone with no direct experience could have performed their heated but humane conversation with similar clarity and conviction – but it’s unlikely. It’s not impossible, though. The greatest film about trans living is Pedro Almodóvar’s All About My Mother, which won the foreign language Oscar in 2000. Antonia San Juan’s performance as Agrado, peaking in a brilliantly-observed monologue on being an “authentic” transsexual woman, was so good that speculation about her gender was intense: she later said “I’m not a transvestite or transsexual, and that’s all there is to say about that”, but the rumours did not go away. Whatever San Juan’s history, those who maintain that the only criteria for trans casting should be good acting should consider Stanislavsky’s “system”, which made “emotional memory” of a real-life situation central to its realistic depiction. Given this, it is far more likely that a trans person would be best placed to portray trans life, and the performance of non-professional trans actor Stéphanie Michelini in Sebastian Lifshitz’s Wild Side (2004), where she plays a transsexual woman trying to reconcile with her dying mother, is more subtle and less predictable than the ones recognised by the Academy. Likewise, I found Daniela Vega’s stoic responses to endless micro-aggressions far more convincing than they might have been if played by an outsider. It helped that Lelio wrote A Fantastic Woman after extensive consultation with Vega, letting her draw on her experiences without crossing the line between feature and documentary, and letting him take his storyline beyond the basics of transgender living. The result is a vibrant combination of romance, fantasy and detective story, unlike any of its predecessors. Whether or not it tears down the barriers for trans actors is yet be seen – but it’s certainly a huge step forward. •A Fantastic Woman is released on 2 February in the US, 22 February in Australia and 2 March in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/26/uk-gdp-grows-faster-than-expected-ons","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T10:32:59Z","webTitle":"UK GDP beats forecasts but growth remains uneven","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/26/uk-gdp-grows-faster-than-expected-ons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/26/uk-gdp-grows-faster-than-expected-ons","fields":{"headline":"UK GDP beats forecasts but growth remains uneven","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The British economy grew at a faster rate than expected in the final three months of 2017, despite pockets of weaker and more uneven growth triggered by the Brexit vote. GDP grew by 0.5% in the fourth quarter after expansion of 0.4% in the previous three months, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). City economists had forecast growth of 0.4%. However, officials said the rate of expansion for the year as a whole was the slowest since 2012, having fallen from 1.9% in 2016 to 1.8%. The ONS also said the bigger picture showed weaker and more uneven expansion. Darren Morgan of the ONS said the boost to the economy came from recruitment agencies, letting agents and office management, adding that there was slow and unsteady growth elsewhere, particularly in consumer-facing sectors. The UK has suffered over the past year as rising inflation prompted by the slide in the value of the pound after the EU referendum outstrips weak wage growth, denting the spending power of consumers. “Despite a slight uptick in the latest quarter, the underlying picture is of slower and uneven growth across the economy,” he said. Hotels, caterers and transport and distribution firms recorded weaker growth owing to constraints on consumer spending, the ONS said. There was also weaker growth across the car industry and for cinemas. Peter Dowd, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the latest GDP figures showed “continued Tory austerity” was undermining the UK economy at a time of falling real wages and rising household debt. “We need an urgent change of direction,” the Labour MP said. Despite the pockets of weakness, the acceleration in the fourth quarter reflected solid expansion of 0.6% in the country’s dominant services sector. Manufacturing also had an upbeat three months, rising by 1.3% on the back of a strengthening global and Eurozone economy, which has bolstered UK exports. The pound extended recent gains made over the past few weeks against the dollar on foreign exchanges to hit almost $1.43, amid speculation that the stronger-than expected reading on the economy may encourage the Bank of England to further raise interest rates after its first rate rise in a decade last year. The figures come after the employment rate, which measures the proportion of 16- to 64-year-olds in work, hit its joint highest level since comparable records began in 1971. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said both pieces of economic news were “achievements to be proud of”. Britain’s economy has proven more resilient than forecast before the EU referendum 18 months ago, helped by improving economic conditions around the world. The fall in the pound after the Brexit vote also helped to strengthen exports. Economists have said the UK could have performed better still without the vote to leave the EU, having trailed the US, France and Germany, where growth has surged ahead in recent months. The International Monetary Fund forecasts a growth rate of 1.5% for the UK this year, compared with 2.7% for the US and 2.2% for the eurozone. Britain could have grown almost one percentage point faster at about 2.5% last year without Brexit, according to Kallum Pickering at the City bank Berenberg. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at payments transfer firm World First, said: “The UK economy is in a chronic crawl at the moment whilst the rest of the world is enjoying a significant skip higher in growth.” The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said the UK should however begin to “recouple” with the world economy later this year, should the UK gain greater clarity over its future trading relationship with Europe in the Brexit negotiations. Speaking from Switzerland on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Carney said Britain then begin to “recouple” with the upswing in growth being enjoyed by the world economy towards the end of this year . “If I can use that term borrowed from Gwyneth Paltrow – [there is the prospect of] a conscious recoupling of the UK economy with the global economy,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/26/phil-neville-tv-bore-scores-own-goal-sexist-tweets-england-womens-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T11:02:33Z","webTitle":"Phil Neville: TV bore scores own goal with sexist tweets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/26/phil-neville-tv-bore-scores-own-goal-sexist-tweets-england-womens-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/26/phil-neville-tv-bore-scores-own-goal-sexist-tweets-england-womens-football","fields":{"headline":"Phil Neville: TV bore scores own goal with sexist tweets","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2014, more than 440 viewers complained to the BBC that Phil Neville was too boring. His voice on commentary, they said, was turning them off the World Cup. Neville, controversially appointed as manager of the England women’s football team this week, must have wished a monotonous tone remained the severest criticism of him. Despite spending more than half his life in the public eye, first as one of Manchester United’s famed “class of 92” alongside older brother Gary and David Beckham, and later as Everton captain, Neville has largely managed to steer clear of controversy. But a series of sexist tweets, coupled with the conviction of many within the women’s game that he is underqualified to manage a national team in the ascendancy, has left the former defender scrambling to rescue his reputation. The tweets, posted several years ago and presumably an ill-advised attempt at humour, will forever haunt the 41-year-old, particularly one sent on 1 July 2011: “Relax I’m back chilled – just battered the wife!!! Feel better now!!!” he wrote. Another read: “Morning men couple of hours cricket be4 work sets me up nicely for the day!” When asked why he failed to mention women, Neville replied: “When I said morning men I thought the women would of been busy preparing breakfast/getting kids ready/making the beds – sorry morning women!” A popular and respected figure in footballing and sports media circles, many rushed to Neville’s defence, insisting his comments did not reflect a man they knew as fiercely loyal and kind. But less than 24 hours after his appointment – which the FA announced on the men’s team Twitter feed, rather than the women’s – Neville issued a statement: “Following comments made a number of years ago I would like to clarify that they were not and are not a true and genuine reflection of either my character or beliefs and would like to apologise.” For many, the tweets did not present as much cause for consternation as his appointment in the first place – Neville has little to no experience of the women’s game and previously displayed scant interest in it. England are ranked number one in Europe and third in the world while their age group teams are blessed with talented youngsters. “People are rightfully pointing out that if you were asking the men’s side to employ someone they would never go for a woman, let alone a woman who has never been a head coach and has no experience in the men’s game,” said Kieran Theivam, a women’s football writer. The Football Association has been beset by controversy in both the men’s and women’s game in recent years. Last September, Neville’s predecessor, Mark Sampson, was sacked after the full detail of inappropriate relationships he had with female players in a previous job became known. Earlier in the summer, the Guardian revealed Sampson was accused of making racial remarks towards leading player Eni Aluko, for which the FA later apologised. “This was supposed to be an appointment which brought a lot of positivity after the cloud that Mark Sampson left under,” said Theivam. “I would say a woman would have been preferred and there were very capable female coaches out there and for one reason or another they either did not apply for it, dropped out of the running or were not interviewed at all. There were certainly more suitable candidates than Phil Neville.” Neville was born in Bury, Greater Manchester, into a family obsessed with sport. His father, Neville Neville, was a league cricketer in Lancashire, and his mother played netball to a good level. Gary was already kicking a ball around by the time Phil arrived, and their sister, Tracey, became a netball international. As a player, Neville learned his trade at Manchester United under the celebrated academy coach Eric Harrison and alongside Gary, Beckham and Ryan Giggs. He spent the majority of his career playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, widely accepted to be the greatest manager in the history of the English game. Neville’s first appearance for United was against Wrexham in 1995 and he became a defensive stalwart in their best teams in the late 90s and early noughties, winning six Premier League titles, three FA Cups and one Champions League. In 2005 he moved to Everton, where he spent eight years until his retirement in 2013. He represented England on 59 occasions, although his international career was blighted by a penalty he conceded against Romania that sent England out of Euro 2000. “I got publicly abused afterwards and found it really difficult,” he said in a documentary film, The Class of 92. “My wife came home from work and the gates were on fire with an England flag on top of it.” Of all the character references for Neville this week, his wife Julie’s Instagram post stood out: “In response to some of things I’ve been reading about my husband, I would like to point out that Phil is the most honest, kind, generous, gentle and hardworking man I have ever met.” It is no more than she has said before, when reflecting on the challenges they faced as new parents. They already had a 17-month-old son, Harvey, when a pregnant Julie woke one day to discover her waters had broken at 28 weeks. Neville was playing abroad for Manchester United at the time but Ferguson allowed him to fly home and he spent the next fortnight sleeping beside his wife on a camp bed in hospital. Isabella was born 10 weeks premature and her parents were told she had 24 hours to live. “It changed our lives completely,” Neville said in 2010. Even with his world turned upside down, Neville’s much-vaunted work ethic meant he would still turn up for training every day, lagging behind the rest of the squad due to exhaustion. “It’s not my style to take time off,” he has said. “I’m quite old-fashioned. I don’t miss work.” For the first 18 months of Isabella’s life they endured the agony of watching her miss developmental milestones without knowing quite what was wrong, until she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy due to suffering a stroke in the womb. The couple are now involved with several charities which support children with the condition. There seems little doubt that Neville will work tirelessly in pursuit of success with the women’s team. Ferguson wrote in his autobiography: “He was one of those players to whom you could say: ‘Phil, I want you to run up that hill, then come back and cut down that tree.’ And he would say: ‘Right, boss, where’s the chainsaw?’” After he finished playing, Neville gained his UEFA B coaching licence and worked as an assistant for David Moyes during a turbulent time at Manchester United. In 2015, the Nevilles moved from Manchester to Valencia, Spain, after Harvey was offered a place at a football academy nearby. Neville worked there as an assistant coach but has only taken charge of one football match, as caretaker manager of Salford City, the non-league club he co-owns. Neville and the FA will hope the debate around his appointment has dissipated by March when he takes charge of his first games, facing three of the world’s top six teams in the She Believes Cup in the US. “If he comes through those games with positive performances and good results that’s what people will be talking about,” said Theivam, “If he doesn’t he will be the coach who had no experience of the women’s game, had no head coaching experience at all, who made silly jokes on social media and can’t get results for the national team.” Potted profile Born 21 January 1977 in Bury, Greater Manchester. Career A defender for Manchester United and Everton, he made 505 top-flight appearances and represented England 59 times. He retired in 2013 and has worked as a pundit and co-commentator for the BBC and Sky Sports. He has a UEFA B coaching licence and was part of the backroom staff at Manchester United and Valencia. Non-league club Salford City is co-owned by Neville and four other former United players. High point Winning the treble – Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League – with Manchester United in the 1998-99 season. Low point Conceding a penalty in Euro 2000, which sent England out of the tournament. He says “I was playing for the club I love playing for against the club I used to love playing for. It was like Christmas Day at home when your dad says it doesn’t get much better than this with all your family around you. It was one of the happiest moments of my career.” – on playing for Everton against Manchester United. They say “I remember sitting with Phil for a chinwag and ranting about a team-mate of mine who I found annoying. When I’d finished I expected Phil to reciprocate. But there was not a word. ‘What an absolute prick!’ I thought, after pouring my heart out. Later I concluded his approach was an exemplary way to carry yourself through a career in football.” – David James, former England goalkeeper."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/26/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-nuclear-war-doomsday-clock","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T11:48:11Z","webTitle":"Here's how to turn back the Doomsday clock | David Shariatmadari","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-nuclear-war-doomsday-clock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-nuclear-war-doomsday-clock","fields":{"headline":"Here's how to turn back the Doomsday Clock","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s two minutes to midnight. That’s the view of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which has published its wake-up call to humanity every year since 1947. Midnight, of course, stands for the end of civilisation: the moment the very technological prowess that allows us to live such sophisticated lives finally destroys us. Nuclear war has long been the principal threat, though the Bulletin has increasingly included climate change in its gloomy warnings. Surveying 2017, it said “the greatest risks last year arose in the nuclear realm,” citing tensions between North Korea and the United States. Over the last 12 months of brinkmanship between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, we’ve had threats to turn Washington and Seoul into “flames and ashes”, promises to visit “fire and fury” on Pyongyang, and an underground nuclear test. The Bulletin said that “hyperbolic rhetoric and provocative actions by both sides have increased the possibility of nuclear war by accident or miscalculation”. This is undoubtedly true. But it’s also clear that some in the US believe a planned strike against North Korea could be in order. In September, the well-connected thinktanker Charles Grant tweeted: “My main takeaway from 3 days of meetings in Washington, incl senior officials: war between US and N Korea is much closer than many people realise. Officials think deterrence unlikely to work v a madman.” This week, the BBC’s Frank Gardner quoted former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers as saying the “chance of a pre-emptive US military strike is much higher than people in Europe realise”. As Grant suggests, the thinking seems to be that Kim Jong-un is crazy, and therefore the traditional logic of deterrence – don’t bomb us because we’ll bomb you – won’t work on him. He might fire nuclear weapons at US targets even though it would be tantamount to suicide, because he’s unhinged and would probably quite like the idea of going out in a (literal) blaze of glory. Even among tyrants, however, genuine madmen are few and far between. Kim may be a narcissist, psychopathically unconcerned by the suffering of his people, but narcissists and psychopaths want to go on living so they can continue to enjoy the trappings of unfettered power. His actions are also very much in line with a North Korean tradition: behave badly in order to bring your enemies to the negotiating table and extract concessions from them. It was most successful in 1994, when Bill Clinton offered the country $4bn in aid in return for a promise to dismantle its nuclear programme. Looked at in this light, the regime’s actions look not insane so much as coldly rational. What’s more, Kim has just given us new evidence that he is a rational actor. With the credible threat of war hanging over him, the dictator has been making friendly overtures to South Korea, conducting high level talks and agreeing to field a unified team for the Winter Olympics. Now, you might say this vindicates the Trump administration’s strategy of high pressure and harsh rhetoric. But that brings us back the Bulletin’s warning about the increased likelihood of accidental nuclear war during times of intense hostility. (The false alarm in Hawaii earlier this month is a cautionary tale: human and technological error are ever-present dangers). If, as all the evidence suggests, the North Korean regime doesn’t want to bring about its own destruction, then it can be contained in the usual way, with calm implacability and assurances to its neighbours that they fall under the US defence umbrella, while leaving the door open to talks. The extraordinary risks of heightened tension aren’t worth the hoped-for outcome, which would be the same as if we relied on traditional deterrence – North Korea realises it is too interested in its own survival to start a war it cannot win. Kim Jong-un’s nukes aren’t going anywhere. But that is something the US and the world can live with, because they’re only useful to him when they’re not being used. Understanding this is the first step towards turning back the Doomsday Clock."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/18/the-10-film-performances-that-deserve-more-awards-attention-this-year","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T11:00:12Z","webTitle":"The 10 film performances that deserve more awards attention this year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/the-10-film-performances-that-deserve-more-awards-attention-this-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/18/the-10-film-performances-that-deserve-more-awards-attention-this-year","fields":{"headline":"The 10 film performances that deserve more awards attention this year","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Golden Globes have come and gone, the Bafta and Guild nominee lists are out, and the Oscar race appears to be taking clear shape in advance of the nomination announcement on 23 January. Happily, it remains a more lively and contested one than usual in the acting races: in no category has a single name hogged the critics’ and precursor awards in the manner of a Helen Mirren for The Queen or a Daniel Day-Lewis for There Will Be Blood. Yet as fluid as the competition remains, any number of worthy names have already been frozen out of the race – victims of diminishing buzz, undernourished campaigns or films that were simply never in voters’ wheelhouses, or even on their radars, in the first place. Here are 10 under-rewarded performances that deserve at least as much chatter as Gary Oldman and Frances McDormand. Claes Bang in The Square A long-serving TV and stage actor in his native Denmark, Claes Bang is suddenly, at age 50, poised for international stardom – suave and magnetic enough to prompt “next James Bond” rumours among the more suggestible. Whatever the future holds, it probably won’t bring many roles as multifaceted as the lead in Ruben Ostlund’s Palme d’Or-winning art-scene satire The Square: as a hotshot museum curator undone personally and professionally by a PR catastrophe, Bang stitches a nimble flair for farce to an inside-out study of male crisis. His elegant tragicomic turn should be leading this year’s best actor race, but the film hasn’t managed to break out of the foreign-language holding pen. For now, Bang must settle for having the new best name in showbiz. Kirsten Dunst in The Beguiled Six years ago, Dunst was the toast of Cannes – winning best actress for fraught, gutsy work in Lars von Trier’s Melancholia – only to see the US awards parade pass her by months later. Something similar is happening this year: on the Croisette, Dunst earned best-in-show reviews for her beautifully modulated, sensually awoken work as yearning, buttoned-up schoolmarm Edwina Morrow in Sofia Coppola’s pastels-and-blood reimagination of the civil war revenge parable previously filmed by Don Siegel. More than anyone in the fine ensemble, she gave Coppola’s stylish vision a bruised, fluttering heart beneath its gorgeous ruffles and corsets, yet months later, the actress has received not so much as a passing mention from any awards body. Michael Fassbender in Alien: Covenant This year’s best film-saving performance by a supporting actor in a Ridley Scott blockbuster? No, not Christopher Plummer’s merely serviceable substitute turn as J Paul Getty in All the Money in the World, whatever Bafta and the Golden Globes would have us believe. Rather, it was Fassbender’s delicious twin turn as synthetic androids David and Walter – the former’s uncanny humanity already familiar from Prometheus, the latter a whole new lurid surprise – that gave the latest, unabashedly trashy but surprisingly likable Alien retread its eerie, nasty pulse. Generally a stern presence on screen, Fassbender has never leaned this playfully into richly cured ham: voters won’t stoop to such genre antics, but he deserves the nomination for his gleeful “don’t let the bedbugs bite” line reading alone. Sally Hawkins in Maudie OK, so Sally Hawkins hasn’t been overlooked this season: the eternally endearing British actress is all but guaranteed the second Oscar nomination of her career for her affecting silent turn in best picture-fancied fantasy The Shape of Water. But it’s not her best work of the year. In Aisling Walsh’s little-seen, beautifully formed biopic of juvenile arthritis-stricken Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis, Hawkins astonishingly meshes her signature emotional vulnerability with intricate, even transformative physical technique – the kind of all-rounder tour de force that would rake in honours if showcased in a more visible film. The National Society of Film Critics awarded her best actress for both performances, but that joint citation is likely to be all she wrote for Maudie this year. Sylvia Hoeks in Blade Runner 2049 Denis Villeneuve’s eye-ravishing sequel to the 1982 sci-fi touchstone has thus far received the awards attention it merits for its wondrous cinematography, soundscape and design properties, while Villeneuve himself scored a surprise Bafta nod – though its human components have gone unrecognised. But Dutch up-and-comer Hoeks deserves notice: as terrifyingly driven replicant enforcer Luv, she effectively fills the narrative space so memorably occupied in the original by her compatriot Rutger Hauer, but with a kinky, off-kilter, uncanny-valley energy that’s entirely her own. It’s too strange and ice-edged a performance to overcome the Academy’s general bias against sci-fi performers, but one hopes Hoeks’s reward from Hollywood isn’t just a surfeit of similar-but-lesser fembot-villain roles: she’s one of the year’s most intriguing revelations. O’Shea Jackson Jr in Ingrid Goes West Matt Spicer’s wicked Instagram-age black comedy has received a scattering of breakthrough mentions for the film-maker himself, but none for its terrific ensemble: I was tempted to list Elizabeth Olsen’s devastatingly pointed sendup of hipster wellness goddesses or Aubrey Plaza’s gangly millennial spin on Tom Ripley. But it’s Jackson Jr, the livewire son of Ice Cube, who lands the film’s broadest laughs and most poignant grabs for the heart as a dimly Batman-obsessed screenwriter trying to make whatever human connection he can in LA’s nightmare purgatory of industry wannabes. Jackson Jr already made an auspicious debut playing his own dad in Straight Outta Compton; this follow-up proves he can hold the camera’s gaze without the benefit of canny stunt casting. Melissa Leo in Novitiate If you’d heard the buzz a year ago, in the snowy heights of Sundance, for first-time director Maggie Betts’s subtle, solemn, morally torn convent drama, you’d have bet money that Melissa Leo would now be contending for her second best supporting actress Oscar. As an unhinged, outmoded, abusive mother superior raging against Catholic church reform, she was one of 2017’s most vivid villains: a conflicted tangle of sadism and spiritual devotion, played with emotional candour and just a hint of camp relish. Yet despite the prestige muscle of distributor Sony Classics, all awards talk for the film seemed to dissipate after it quietly opened in October. Leo won her 2010 Oscar for The Fighter after paying for her own, now-infamous “Consider” campaign ads; one wishes she’d taken matters into her own hands again this year. Nahuel Pérez Biscayart in BPM (Beats Per Minute) Robin Campillo’s rich, sprawling, Cannes-storming reflection on the Act-Up Aids activism movement was looking a solid bet for a foreign language Oscar nomination before its shock omission from the pre-nomination shortlist. If the film fell at that hurdle, don’t hold your breath for awards attention in any other categories, least of all the best actor nod it deserves for the Argentinian Pérez Biscayart, a fevered ball of rhetorical fury, erotic energy and proudly queer charisma as the group’s thorniest, most volatile member. Campillo’s film is a generously weighted ensemble piece, but as his character’s own battle with Aids becomes its narrative crux, Pérez Biscayart shoulders its emotional burden with aching tenderness and worn body language. Daniela Vega in A Fantastic Woman Throughout this season, Oscar pundits have listed Vega, the riveting transgender star of Chilean director Sebastián Lelio’s beguiling character study, as a notable outlier in the best actress race – though for all the compelling “Could Daniela Vega Be The First Transgender Oscar Nominee?” headlines, not one critics’ group or awards body has yet taken the (click)bait. That’s a shame: Vega deserves notice not simply for the sake of precedent or posterity, but because her vibrant, full-hearted turn as a waitress and singer battling the prejudice of her lover’s transphobic family after his sudden death is as emotionally acute and screen-filling as any of the household names in the best actress race. Taliah Lennice Webster in Good Time She scored a surprise Independent Spirit Award nomination at the outset of the awards season, but nothing has followed since for tack-sharp discovery Webster – or, indeed, for anyone involved with the Safdie brothers’ swaggering, justly acclaimed but sadly under-seen heist thriller. In perhaps the year’s most auspiciously self-possessed debut, the 19-year-old newcomer smashes into the frenzied proceedings midway through, without missing one of the film’s quick, hard beats: as an accidental teenage accomplice to Robert Pattinson’s chaos-causing bank robber, she coolly wrests entire scenes from her co-star, himself in the form of his life. Webster’s IMDb page lists no upcoming features; one can only hope casting directors catch up with the film and rush for her number."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/20/word-of-week-steven-poole-witch-hunt","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"Word of the week: witch-hunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/20/word-of-week-steven-poole-witch-hunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/20/word-of-week-steven-poole-witch-hunt","fields":{"headline":"Word of the week: witch-hunt","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The #MeToo campaign against sexual violence and harassment by powerful men has become “a bit of a witch-hunt”, mused craggy action star Liam Neeson, echoing Catherine Deneuve. Which is slightly confusing, since the targets of the alleged witch-hunt are all men. Shouldn’t it be a wizard-hunt? The first appearance of “witch-hunt” in the OED, though, makes it clear that such sport is gender-inclusive. In Rider Haggard’s King Solomon’s Mines of 1885, we find it announced: “To-night ye will see. It is the great witch-hunt, and many will be smelt out as wizards and slain.” As a political metaphor, “witch-hunt” was popularised by George Orwell, and then widely used for Senator Joseph McCarthy’s obsessive investigations into supposed communists. The phrase is rather awkward, though, in the #MeToo context, given that the term “witch” was historically used to denounce women who failed to conform to gender norms. And the most salient feature of the actual witch-hunts in Salem, Massachusetts and elsewhere, of course, was that witches didn’t actually exist. The same, regrettably, cannot be said of predatory men."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/17/ben-bradley-to-stay-tory-vice-chair-after-vasectomies-for-unemployed-row","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T15:15:53Z","webTitle":"Ben Bradley to stay Tory vice-chair after ‘vasectomies for unemployed’ row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/17/ben-bradley-to-stay-tory-vice-chair-after-vasectomies-for-unemployed-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/17/ben-bradley-to-stay-tory-vice-chair-after-vasectomies-for-unemployed-row","fields":{"headline":"Ben Bradley to stay Tory vice-chair after ‘vasectomies for unemployed’ row","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May’s spokesman has said Ben Bradley will keep his job as Conservative vice-chair for young people, despite having suggested that unemployed people should opt for free vasectomies rather than having children they could not afford. The prime minister’s press secretary said Bradley’s apology was the “right thing to do”, but added that his views had changed since he wrote the 2012 blogpost, when he was 22. Asked whether Bradley would be keeping his job, the spokesman confirmed that he would. Bradley said he was sorry on Tuesday after it emerged he had claimed that the UK would soon be “drowning in a vast sea of unemployed wasters” if jobless families had four or five children while others limited themselves to one or two. In the blogpost revealed by BuzzFeed, Bradley said: “It’s horrendous that there are families out there that can make vastly more than the average wage, (or in some cases more than a bloody good wage) just because they have 10 kids. Sorry but how many children you have is a choice; if you can’t afford them, stop having them! Vasectomies are free. “There are hundreds of families in the UK who earn over £60,000 in benefits without lifting a finger because they have so many kids (and for the rest of us that’s a wage of over £90,000 before tax!).” Another post subsequently emerged under the headline: “Public sector workers: They don’t know they’re born!” “I can’t believe for the life of me that people in the public sector are so lost in their own fantasy land that they can’t see how good they’ve got it,” Bradley wrote. “Yes, okay, many teachers and teaching assistants and nurses work hard for their money and deserve to get excellent pay and pensions, but headmasters on seventy-odd grand a year?” Bradley, who unexpectedly defeated Labour’s Alan Meale last year to become the Tory MP for Mansfield, made the comments in 2012 in support of a government policy for a benefit cap. Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary who was the architect of the policy, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain programme: “The proposal actually had nothing to do with people having vasectomies or the numbers of children. The proposal about the benefit cap was limiting the amount people can collect together in the course of a number of different benefits, so it would never get above essentially average earnings. That was the principle and actually that has turned out to be reasonably well received. “All the evidence now shows those in the benefit cap are more likely to go back to work and have gone back to work directly as a result. All of those are positives. They had nothing to do with whether people have children or do not have children.” Bradley, who is now 28 and was promoted to Conservative vice-chair representing young people in May’s new year reshuffle, apologised for the blogpost and said he had since matured. Labour said the comments were evidence that the “nasty party” lived on. It has also emerged that Bradley said police brutality should be encouraged in a blog post written during the London riots in 2011. The article on bradders32, which has been made private, read: “We need to come down hard on these morons before somebody gets killed! If we have any sense as a nation we’ll stay home tonight and make it easy for the police to find the ones hanging around town centres with their faces covered. For once I think police brutality should be encouraged!” He apologised for the post, telling the Times that his outlook on life has changed with age."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/17/instagrammers-travel-sri-lanka-tourists-peachy-backsides-social-media-obsessed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T18:34:09Z","webTitle":"Instagrammers are sucking the life and soul out of travel | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/instagrammers-travel-sri-lanka-tourists-peachy-backsides-social-media-obsessed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/instagrammers-travel-sri-lanka-tourists-peachy-backsides-social-media-obsessed","fields":{"headline":"Instagrammers are sucking the life and soul out of travel","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A recent trip to Sri Lanka reminded me of that well known Buddhist proverb: “If you visit a temple but do not take a selfie, did it actually happen?” At these sacred sites, tourists are free to take photographs – as indeed I saw a delegation of enthusiastic monks doing at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy – but you are asked to please not pose with statues of the Buddha, or be photographed with your back to him. Naturally, I observed several western tourists, most of them young, ignoring this request. The Instagrammability of a destination is apparently now the number one motivation for booking a holiday for millennials. The eternal quest for social approval, which the platform was accused of taking advantage of this week by “withholding” likes from certain users to encourage them to log in more frequently – a charge Instagram denies – continues apace. I joined Instagram relatively recently, mainly to look at travel photos of places and people around the world, a cheering endeavour in these cold, dark Brexity times, but was disappointed how many of the photos seemed to follow a particular format. A thin, blonde, white girl stands in a floaty dress, her back to the viewer, in a seemingly preordained beautiful location. Off camera a queue of other “influencers” wait patiently to get the perfect shot. Many of them are paid in brand endorsements and partnerships with luxury travel companies. Then you have the “arses on tour” – bums with a backdrop, basically (and if there is a sunset peeking through your thigh gap, even better).At some hotels, you can now even pay extra for your very own “Instagram butler”, who will show you all the most picturesque spots and help you and your bum conduct your own photoshoot. These Instagrammers are collectively sucking the joy and spontaneity out of travel photography, and for those unfortunate enough to bump into them abroad, possibly travel itself. We must pity the poor locals, who have to put up with them. Consider the train I took last week from the mountain village of Ella to Sri Lanka’s cultural capital of Kandy. Widely regarded to be one of the most beautiful train journeys in the world, it traverses verdant mountain passes, waterfalls, and tea plantations. But many of the passengers under 35 were interested only in obtaining the same photograph – lifted right from Instagram – of themselves hanging barefoot out of the open doors of the train, with significant risk to life and limb. Meanwhile, in contrast, an older couple sitting in our carriage wondered aloud what on earth the young people were playing at and spent the journey watching the scenery go by through the window. Tourists have always taken photographs. Like graffiti, it’s a very human way of saying “I was here”. But in the pre-digital age, because of the expense of film as well as high shooting ratios, you were lucky if you ended up with one usable picture. Now “influencers” can take as many photographs as they need, photoshopping and filtering until they are able to post the perfect advertisement (for that indeed is what these images are). The centering of the self to such an extent is new too, and at the expense of knowledge, exploration and adventure. When most travel photographs on Instagram begin to look like fashion editorials you have to wonder whether anyone is learning anything. And when people are taking idiotic risks such as hanging out of fast moving trains or proffering food to tempt wild animals into shot, all for the sake of a photo that isn’t even an original composition, you might start to think that we’re approaching the end times. It all goes to show how ineffective the internet can be as a lens for human experience, especially within a capitalist system. You might think social media would diversify the range of images we see, yet the most popular users operate according to a strict schema that takes full advantage of the relevant algorithms (creative, fascinating accounts are still there, but said algorithms make them harder to find). And it’s not just travel – it’s interiors, fashion, weddings, food, children. Social media encourages the memeification of human experience. Instead of diversity we see homogeneity. It’s extremely boring. There is, of course, an irony to being a tourist who is complaining about other tourists. And we all fall victim to the odd corny snap every now and again. Live and let live, you might say. We all just want to see the world. Some of us just want to see it without someone’s peachy backside blocking the view. On the plus side, while the easily influenced will see these pictures and flock to the lupin fields of New Zealand or Tegalalang in Bali, or to selfie-stick the sunset in Santorini, those of us too grumpy, paunchy and tired to travel fashionably might be left in peace. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a columnist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/21/mcmafia-recap-series-one-episode-five","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T22:00:32Z","webTitle":"McMafia recap – series one, episode five","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/21/mcmafia-recap-series-one-episode-five","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/21/mcmafia-recap-series-one-episode-five","fields":{"headline":"McMafia recap – series one, episode five","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“You are doing this for power, the same as all of us.” - Semiyon Kleiman What is Alex’s motivation? Is he really being swallowed in the quicksand of organised crime or voluntarily diving in? He claims only to be departing from his previous code of ethics because he was so upset about the murder of his uncle. But was Boris really so emotionally special to him that he would jeopardise everything, his firm, his probity, his relationship with his fiancée, just to avenge him? It’s the explanation he sticks to in this episode but it rings a touch hollow, not least to Kleiman himself, as Alex increasingly begins to take control of matters. As for Kleiman, we learn that despite his possessiveness over Lyudmilla, frustrated at not being given the passport to go home he promised her, his own sexual interests lie in another direction. At the poolside of his Tel Aviv residence he greets a young man, Ezra, with a kiss full on the lips. Glad times all round for Kleiman, who, greeting an investor in Eilat, grandly discusses his plans to build Las Vegas-style casino emporia in the Negev desert. He takes a call from Alex and confidently overrides his advice regarding the heroin shipment they stole from Vadim. Give it back to the Pakistanis? Never. “We have all the time in the world,” he reckons. Later, Kleiman and Ezra attend a lavish party hosted by one Yariv Ableman, an old Russian friend. Lyudmilla is present. Watchful as she has been trained to be, she sees Ezra rub the old man’s thigh under a table - then later, near the toilets, spots Ezra and another young man in congress in the shadows. Turns out this is the night Kleiman’s world is to come crashing down. There’s a warrant for his arrest. Ezra has improbably claimed that he was beaten and raped by Kleiman at the back of the garden. The case is headline news, with Kleiman facing a possible 25-year jail sentence. Meanwhile back in London, Masha takes Katya to lunch and breaks to her the not easily digestible news that Katya’s father has impregnated her. Katya takes this about as poorly as can be imagined - needless to say, they don’t even get to the first course - yet later, Katya visits Masha at her flat in search of further clarity. Can they somehow get past this? Antonio Mendez is back in the frame; he contacts Alex regarding Kleiman’s case. He sees an opening here, a chance to retrieve the shipping deal Kleiman spurred. Can Alex help? Alex assures him he has no incriminating links to Kleiman but tells a different story to Rebecca. He resolves to visit Kleiman in Tel Aviv, out of a loyalty to him, he says. Rebecca bluntly states that she doesn’t believe him. In fairness, every time he speaks now his nose seems to grow half a yard. In Tel Aviv, Kleiman cuts a genuinely crumpled, distraught figure. He has no counter-strategy. He grasps pathetically at Alex, even strongly suggests to him that he take this episode as a sign to return to his past life, extricate himself. However, tellingly, despite earlier assurances to Karin, Alex has no intention of doing so. Turns out there is an ace up the sleeve. Lyudmilla reports what she saw at the party to Joseph. She knows her testimony could get Kleiman off - but will he let her go home in return? Joseph puts her case to Alex and following a visit to Ableman, they establish that the name of the party guest Lyudmilla caught with Ezra is Reuben, a graphic designer (synonymous with “out of work” - a truthful touch right there). Posing as an art dealer, Alex lures him to an interview, which Reuben flees, only to be gut punched by Joseph, upon which he spills the beans - the whole incident was set up by mysterious “Russian-Israeli” agents, with Ezra raped in the process - and they place him in a safe house. Back in London, Rebecca, feeling lonely and estranged with Alex having insisted on going to Tel Aviv, arranges to meet Mendez. She questions him about Alex but Mendez defends him, reminds her of the multiple stresses he is under. The meeting turns into dinner and a late, tipsy cab ride to Rebecca’s house; they hover on the verge of taking matters further before Antonio bids her goodnight. Alex tells Kleiman that his case has been “taken care of”. But by whom, a relieved but curious Kleiman asks. Alex places a set of contracts on the table. From Antonio’s people. Kleiman is to agree to allow them access to his fleet, with 30% payable for every successful shipment. Kleiman protests and repeats to Alex his warning about his dangerous new friends. Alex says they need their help to destroy Vadim. Feeling blackmailed, Kleiman signs - but refuses Alex’s request to give up Lyudmilla. Alex and Joseph fetch Reuben from the safe house but it turns out to be not so safe - Reuben is barely out of the door before he’s pumped with bullets by a motorcycle assassin. As for Ezra, his mother finds him dead. He’s evidently overdosed on the pills he’s been taking to cope with his trauma. Tanya breaks the news to Kleiman as a quietly seething Lyudmilla looks on from across the room. Alex returns to the airport and who should he run into but Vadim? They affect warm and cordial relations, Alex out of breeding, Vadim perhaps out of more sincere respect for his foe. Over sparkling water, Vadim casually mentions that he has been in town to meet party host Ableman - an old friend. Alex blanches inwardly. Nothing is certain. No one is safe. Additional notes The actor playing the BBC reporter is Misha Glenny, author of the original McMafia book and a producer of this show. The sound of phones on vibrate is a recurring feature of this show. Clearly, the players in this discreet criminal game can’t put their phones on silent mode. “Can I have a glass of wine, please?” Katya asks Masha at her flat. “It’s nine o’ clock in the morning.”, Masha reminds her. Whatever her line of work is, it clearly isn’t working the bar at Wetherspoons. Again, we see Alex working out with his heavy duty Russian fitness instructor. Is he ever going to be called upon to display his prowess in physical combat?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/17/queen-christmas-glitter-ball-decorations-german-president","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T15:56:04Z","webTitle":"Queen given Christmas glitter ball decorations by German president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/17/queen-christmas-glitter-ball-decorations-german-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/17/queen-christmas-glitter-ball-decorations-german-president","fields":{"headline":"Queen given Christmas glitter ball decorations by German president","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"During her long reign the Queen has received all manner of official gifts so it requires imagination to come up with something she might especially appreciate. The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, no doubt having appraised himself of the Windsor family’s tradition of inexpensive and jokey Christmas gift-giving, seems to have entered into the spirit by presenting the British monarch with two sets of glitter balls for her festive tree at Sandringham House in Norfolk. The decorations were disclosed on the official gifts list released on Wednesday by Buckingham Palace. He was not alone in deducing such a gift would appeal. The list shows Her Majesty’s secret service – the men and women at the national GCHQ listening and monitoring station – chose the same theme. Their unique Christmas decoration, presented on the Queen’s visit to the National Cyber Security Centre in London, contained paper from the Enigma machine. Equally unique was the union flag, originally sewn on to the space suit of the British astronaut Tim Peake and worn during his time on the International Space Station, which he personally presented to her. The Queen, who was seen on television this week examining the crown jewels and wearing the gigantic 18g 94.4 carat Cullinan III and 12g 63.6 carat Cullinan IV diamonds – or “Granny’s chips” – added several brooches to her jewellery collection. She also added to her reading list with presents including 70 Years a Draper, Building a Name – The History of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, A Culinary Epic of Indian Festivals and, undoubtedly her favourite, The Centennial History of the Thoroughbred Breeders’ Association. Her passion for all things equine was also reflected in a miniature sculpture of The Kelpies – two 30-metre-high horse head sculptures on the Forth and Clyde canal. Prince George and Princess Charlotte each received a menagerie of soft toys and armfuls of books from wellwishers, according to the annual list of presents received by members of the royal family. The Belgian monarchy sought to introduce the four-year-old prince to one of their most popular exports, giving him five Tintin figurines and a book on the comic hero by the Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi under the pen name Hergé. The young royals were each given traditional hobby horses by wellwishers in Finland, while the Polish president chose a dreamcatcher and wooden train for George, and a toy pram and doll for Charlotte. Two lollipops were among gifts from the mayor of Gdansk. The Duke of Edinburgh, who retired from solo official duties last year, collected a military bugle, a Spanish cloak and a travel backgammon set among items presented to him. The Duke of York received one of the most unusual gifts in the form of a prosthetic hand on a visit to UTC Leeds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/22/david-olusoga-books-uncovered-secret-history","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"Further reading: David Olusoga on the books that uncovered our secret history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/22/david-olusoga-books-uncovered-secret-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/22/david-olusoga-books-uncovered-secret-history","fields":{"headline":"Further reading: David Olusoga on the books that uncovered our secret history","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"That old cliche, “history is written by the victors”, doesn’t go anywhere near far enough. It is much more unfair than that. History is written by the literate, and is biased towards societies with written languages. Those doing the writing needed to be wealthy and leisured enough to afford the time and connected enough to be able to access the records and persuade the publishers. History is mostly about men rather than women, and until depressingly recently, little was written by women. Histories can only be written if the records exist – if people at the time regarded the events they were witness to, and the people those events affected, as being significant enough to be worthy of recording. All of this conspires to leave much of the past and most of our ancestors beyond reach. Not that this has stopped modern historians from uncovering hidden stories. The London Hanged (Verso) by Peter Linebaugh focuses on the two places where the lives of the 18th-century poor were routinely recorded – the courtroom and the gallows. The 17th-century politician George Savile made a famous comment on capital punishment: “Men are not hang’d for stealing Horses, but that Horses may not be stolen.” The notion of the gallows as public spectacle and moral lesson collided in the 18th century with the stark reality that many of the poorest could not make a living. Looking through the records of London’s hanged, Linebaugh details the tragic story of how an austere legal system obsessed with deterrence and making examples was unleashed against desperate, hungry people. When human beings are turned into commodities they leave uncomfortable imprints in the records. We often know more about enslaved Africans than poor white people. The enslaved, by being reduced to human “property”, appear in wills and deeds of sale, alongside real estate and livestock. Something ostensibly similar but more subversive took place during the second half of the 18th century, when another commodified group, London’s prostitutes, were catalogued. Hallie Rubenhold’s 2005 account, Harris’s List of Covent-Garden Ladies (Doubleday), is fascinating and shocking, as she uncovers the biographies of the three remarkable individuals behind the list and its incredible success. Adam Hochschild’s King Leopold’s Ghost (Pan) shows how the world came to know about the private African colony that Leopold II of Belgium turned into a genocidal slave state in the last years of the 19th century. Hochschild, one of the finest writers of history, tells his story through intertwining biographies. While never shying away from the horrors taking place in Congo, he lays out the detective work of how the truth was pieced together and exposed. In 1865, when a rebellion broke out in Jamaica, officials in the Caribbean and newspapers in London almost instinctively compared the situation to an earlier event that few people today remember. The Black Jacobins (Penguin) by CLR James relates the story of the Haitian revolution, 1791-1804, the slave revolt that succeeded. Armies of former slaves led by black generals defeated the British and Napoleon, to the shock of the world. They went on to create a new black republic, Haiti. Finally there’s The History Thieves (Portobello) by Ian Cobain, about how aspects of British history have, and are being, intentionally hidden. Cobain concludes that the details of Britain’s final decades as a colonial power have been denied to future historians and that the key documents went up in smoke, deliberately destroyed as the flags were being lowered and British prime ministers were espousing the virtues of the new commonwealth. As British official records are still “going missing”, the significance of Cobain’s work only increases.

The Home Office said Hamza bin Walayat’s failure to identify Plato and Aristotle as humanist philosophers indicated his knowledge of humanism was “rudimentary at best”. The Home Office also said Walayat did not face persecution for his beliefs. In a letter rejecting his asylum claim, seen by the Guardian, it said his assertion that he would be at risk in Pakistan, and could be killed by his family because of his beliefs and his renunciation of Islam, was unfounded. Walayat, who has lived in the UK since 2011, said he had received death threats from members of his family and community in Pakistan after integrating into secular British life, forming a relationship with a non-Muslim partner and refusing to conform to the expectations of conservative Islam. Apostates are subject to discrimination, persecution and violence in Pakistan. In March last year, a student who had stated he was a humanist on his Facebook page was murdered at his university. Blasphemy is punishable by death under Pakistani law. In August, 24 British politicians wrote to the Pakistani government urging it to repeal its draconian blasphemy law, which has been used against religious minorities and humanists. Walayat claimed asylum in July last year after being served with removal papers for overstaying his student visa. After an interview with immigration officials, the Home Office said he had “been unable to provide a consistent or credible account with regards the main aspect of your claim, namely that you are a humanist”. When tested on his knowledge of humanism, Walayat gave a “basic definition” but could not identify “any famous Greek philosophers who were humanistic”. The letter said: “When you were informed by the interviewing officer that he was referring to Plato and Aristotle, you replied: ‘Yeah, the thing is because of my medication that is strong I just forget stuff sometimes’.” The Home Office concluded: “Your knowledge of humanism is rudimentary at best and not of a level that would be expected of a genuine follower of humanism.” Walayat joined the Humanists UK organisation in August, but said he had believed in the basic principles of humanism from childhood. According to Humanists UK, “humanism is not a ‘canonical’ belief system, where adherents must learn and follow a strict set of behaviour codes. As a descriptive term, humanists can be someone who has simply rejected religious belief but holds some positive conception of human values.” In a letter in support of Walayat’s asylum application, Bob Churchill, of the International Humanist and Ethical Union, said: “For many, the broad descriptive ‘humanist’ is just a softer way of saying atheist, especially if you come from a place where identifying as atheist may be regarded as a deeply offensive statement.” Andrew Copson, of Humanists UK, said the move “set a dangerous precedent for non-religious people fleeing persecution. The Home Office is simply incorrect to claim that non-religious people seeking asylum don’t get the same protection in law as religious people do.” The questions put to Walayat “reveal a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of humanism”, he added. Walayat told the Guardian he believed his life would be in danger in Pakistan. The Home Office decision had come as a shock, he added. “I’ve told the truth and instead of believing me they are trying to find excuses to kick me out of the country,” he said. Many Christians he had encountered in the UK did not have a detailed grasp of the history of their faith, he said, “but it doesn’t mean they’re not Christian”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and each claim is carefully considered on its individual merits.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/shortcuts/2018/jan/17/the-girther-movement-is-donald-trump-fatter-than-the-white-house-doctor-says","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T14:34:25Z","webTitle":"The girther movement: is Donald Trump fatter than the White House doctor says?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/jan/17/the-girther-movement-is-donald-trump-fatter-than-the-white-house-doctor-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/jan/17/the-girther-movement-is-donald-trump-fatter-than-the-white-house-doctor-says","fields":{"headline":"The girther movement: is Donald Trump fatter than the White House doctor says?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: The girther movement Age: One day old. Appearance: Questioning, sceptical, suspicious. Is it like the birther movement, but for ventriloquists? No, it is like the birther movement, but for Donald Trump’s weight. What are its chief aims? There is just one: to promote the theory that Donald Trump is fatter than the White House says he is. Sounds good. Where do I sign up? Don’t worry – if you’ve got a Twitter account, you are in. How did it start? The term “girther” – an obvious play on “birther”, the common name for someone who, like Trump, maintained that Barack Obama was born in Kenya – was coined by MSNBC’s Chris Hayes on Tuesday. Why? Because that was the day that Trump underwent his first physical examination as president, and was found to be in great physical shape. Did the doctor perform the examination blindfolded? OK, Trump’s in “excellent health” for a 71-year-old man who takes no exercise and subsists largely on a diet of fast food eaten in bed. How can this be? White House physician Dr Ronny Jackson put it down to “incredible genes”. That said, at 6ft 3in (1.91m) and 17st 1lb (108kg), with a Body Mass Index of 29.9, Trump is overweight, and three pounds heavier than he was in 2016. What is there for the girther movement to question in that assessment? For one thing, they have been comparing Trump’s physique with that of various top athletes who are the same weight and height. In every case, the resemblance is less than striking. That’s probably because he goes everywhere by helicopter and golf cart, like an entitled slug. For another, Trump’s New York driving licence says he is only 6ft 2in. What’s an inch? Were Trump but an inch shorter or a pound heavier, he would officially be classified as obese. Conspiracy! Is the doctor in on it? It seems unlikely. Dr Jackson was Obama’s White House physician. Did he check Trump’s mental capacity? Yes. Trump scored 30 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test. Stable genius! Not really – it’s just naming animals, drawing hands on clocks, that sort of thing – but it probably means he doesn’t have incipient dementia. Do say: “I think we need to take this firther.” Don’t say: “Technically it’s a rhinoceros, but ‘pointy horse’ will do, Mr President.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2018/jan/29/i-left-nhs-to-work-as-a-cosmetic-doctor","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T08:15:42Z","webTitle":"I left the NHS to work as a cosmetic doctor.

I've never looked back","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I didn’t grow up wanting to be a cosmetic doctor. I trained to be a surgeon in the NHS. So how did I end up working in the private sector injecting botox into people trying to avoid the ageing process? Growing up, I wanted to be an artist. My dad had other ideas and gave me five options: be a doctor, dentist, lawyer, engineer or accountant. That may sound mean, but I realised later in life that my Nigerian parents were preparing me for the harsh realities of being a black man in the UK; they wanted to give me the best chance possible. I graduated from Leicester medical school in 2005 and was on a path to become a surgeon. As I progressed through training, my image of what I thought it would be started to fade. The NHS was under increasing pressure to provide a service on finite resources, and there was a lot of politics between managers and clinical staff. I thought I would be in theatre most days learning my trade, but with the wards so short of staff I spent most of my time writing prescriptions. My boss at the time would say: “It wasn’t like this in my day. Maybe if my time was now I would have second thoughts.” That’s exactly what I was having. I was introduced to the world of aesthetics when assisting my boss in theatre. The patient was undergoing a procedure and I noticed she looked much younger than the age on her notes. “She must have good genes, she looks great,” I said. “That and some carefully placed filler and botox,” my boss replied. He talked me through what he had done to lift and shape her face, and I was fascinated. A few injections had made her look 10 years younger without the need for a scalpel. My enthusiasm was noted and I was invited to do see some non-surgical sessions outside work in one of my boss’s private clinics. Non-surgical meant everything before the knife, including lasers and injectables. I loved it. And when I was allowed to start doing cases, I was really good at it. I’d reached a crossroads: should I pursue this or stick on my current path? I took a leap of faith over five years ago and have never looked back. There’s a lot of stigma associated with aesthetics. It’s private sector and many people assume you’re in it for the money. Aesthetics is a saturated market where many end up quitting, unable to earn a decent living. Many people feel you’re not giving back – but I worked in the NHS for 10 years, and have set up a charity for people with congenital deformities. Dentists and lawyers belong to professions that are partly state-funded, and many enter the private sector. I’m not sure they face the same judgment. Another common misconception is that I’m a failed surgeon because I’m not operating any more. I normally see 15-20 patients a day; the mix is vast. There’s the patient you might imagine: rich, somewhat vain, looking to have better lips or eliminate wrinkles. I remember sitting in clinic with a well-known celebrity demanding to see me because she had an event and her botox was an “absolute emergency”. I thought of my NHS days, when an emergency meant life or death. I explained to her that, in most cases, aesthetics was a want not a need. As she flounced out of the room, I caught myself thinking: “Is this what I trained to do?” Then in walked another woman, head down, shoulders hunched; everything in her body language told me she was nervous. She had a broken nose caused by her ex-partner. She was too scared to have surgery but had heard about the non-surgical nose job. I assessed her, and within 15 minutes her nose was straight. She held the mirror with shaking hands, burst into tears and hugged me. In 15 minutes, her world had changed. We forget that a physical attribute can have a huge psychological effect on us. Having the power to change that in moments is an amazing feeling. I may not be saving lives, but I’m certainly changing some of them for the better. Do I miss my original vocation? I didn’t think I did until an ENT secretary came to see me. She wanted to get lip fillers as she was conscious of her top lip. She had discussed this with the surgeons in her department, who recommended me. I received a card from the secretary that was also signed by her bosses, thanking me for taking care of her. For a moment, I missed the camaraderie of being part of a surgical team, getting a pat on the back after a good result. But it was only a moment. I respect and love what they do, but it’s not my path.

The play is based on the true story of Can Dündar, a Turkish newspaper editor sentenced to jail and now in exile after exposing covert state arms deals with Islamic fundamentalists in Syria. However, the RSC’s deputy artistic director said it would be more than a biography. It felt like a universal story, one that could happen anywhere, including the UK, Erica Whyman said. “It is also our world, it is about things which could be taken away from us today or tomorrow. We think that they are entitlements but actually it would be very easy to take them away … the right to print something in the public interest, for example, is very easy to take away from someone and it is happening to some degree in the debate about fake news or not fake news.” The play, #WeAreArrested, is based on Dündar’s book about his experiences. As editor-in-chief of Turkey’s oldest serious newspaper, Cumhuriyet, Dündar was arrested in November 2015 after publishing footage of weapons being sent by the intelligence service to rebel fighters in Syria. He was held in jail for 92 days, accused of espionage and revealing state secrets, before the supreme court ordered his release. In May 2016 Dündar survived an attempted murder outside the Istanbul courthouse where he had been defending himself against charges of treason. He is now living in exile in Germany. Whyman said the story deserved to be better known. “When I read the book I thought: oh my God, this is a country that is like ours in so many ways. He describes a liberated, liberal press, he describes a world of many equalities, many freedoms and privileges and pleasures, and yet in such a short space of time it has, for some people, become the equivalent of a police state or a totalitarian regime. “To see it unravel is almost Orwellian. I really didn’t know. I thought I knew that press freedoms were under threat there, that things were shifting, but I didn’t understand that this was a catastrophe. It is almost like Turkey is at the periphery of our vision, we know something is changing but do we understand that liberties that were hard won there and we take for granted have, in large part, collapsed?” The RSC approached Dündar, who gave the project his blessing and visited Stratford-on-Avon to see readings of the play and meet the actor playing him. Whyman said it was a “fantastically dramatic” story about an honourable surrounded by his family, colleagues, compatriots and, on the other side, expected and unexpected enemies. Adapted by Pippa Hill and Sophie Ivatts and directed by Ivatts, the play will be part of the RSC’s Mischief festival in Stratford in June. It will run alongside another new play, Day of the Living, inspired by events in Mexico in 2014 when 43 students were forcibly taken and disappeared. The RSC Mischief festival runs from 31 May - 23 June at The Other Place, Stratford-on-Avon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/19/would-be-parents-moving-house-to-get-free-ivf-on-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T14:00:25Z","webTitle":"Would-be parents moving house to get free IVF on NHS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/19/would-be-parents-moving-house-to-get-free-ivf-on-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/19/would-be-parents-moving-house-to-get-free-ivf-on-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Would-be parents moving house to get free IVF on NHS","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Many would-be parents are moving house in order to access free IVF on the NHS, sometimes saving themselves £10,000, according to the lead fertility doctor at the UK’s largest sperm bank. Dr Raj Mathur, a consultant gynaecologist at Saint Mary’s hospital in Manchester, said he “constantly” saw patients moving house and/or GPs in order to get more free IVF cycles. Mathur, whose clinic accepts NHS patients from 23 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) across the north-west of England, said the geographical differences in funding were discriminatory. “It’s a bloody nightmare, localism in the NHS. I’m all for centralisation. It’s a scandal because it should really be decided by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence [Nice] … They came up with national guidelines but everywhere in the country has its own version of those criteria,” he said. Nice recommends that women aged under 40 should be offered three cycles if they have been trying to conceive for two years. Cost-cutting CCGs are defying advice set out by the government and NHS advisers. “Some CCGs will specify that both should be childless; others will specify that there should be no children in that relationship … In my clinic Mrs Manchester will get one cycle and Mrs Rochdale will get three,” Mathur said. Some borders between Greater Manchester boroughs are so tight that patients can be one house away from qualifying for extra NHS fertility treatment. Some streets in Bolton, which offers one free IVF cycle, turn into Bury (three free cycles) across the road. Mathur said people constantly move house to register with a GP in another CCG: “You set up a game and people will play the game.” Greg Horne, a consultant embryologist at Saint Mary’s, agreed: “It’s like if you try to find a house in the catchment area of a particular school.” The average market price for a single cycle of IVF in a private clinic is £3,348, research by Opinium found. With just one in three cycles resulting in pregnancy, many patients spend in excess of £10,000 on three attempts or more. “It’s discriminatory. It’s a classic example of a postcode lottery, it goes against evidence-based guidelines,” said Mathur, who is also secretary of the British Fertility Society. Provision is being reduced as a cost-cutting measure in some areas and has been cut altogether in others. Mathur’s patients in most parts of Cheshire used to have three IVF cycles funded but as of last April are offered one. Saint Mary’s, which was the first hospital in the UK to offer an NHS IVF service, is home to the UK’s biggest sperm bank. Working in partnership with a private American company, Fairfax Cyrobank, sperm from 100 American donors is held in a depot in Manchester. The sperm is frozen in liquid nitrogen and flown over in “dry shippers”, which look like metal milk churns. It is then inserted directly into a woman’s uterus via a small catheter through the cervix – a process known as Intrauterine Insemination, IUI, which has a one-in-10 success rate – or is used for IVF where a woman’s egg is fertilised in a laboratory and is then returned to her womb as an embryo. Like most fertility clinics, Saint Mary’s has faced a severe shortage in donor sperm since a 2005 change in the law giving children the right to know the identity of their donor once they reach 18. Donors cannot be paid more than basic expenses and can contribute to a maximum of 10 families. In recent years, the hospital had just three regular donors on its books, all of whom were white. This was a problem as 20-25% of the hospital’s fertility patients are British Asians. In Sunni Islam, sperm donation is forbidden “... so they wouldn’t have told people it’s a donor child, so it’s very tricky. There’s a red-haired gene that pops up in the caucasian population of the UK, for example,” said Mathur. In 30 years working at the clinic, Horne said he could recall just one Asian donor. Ten of Fairfax’s current US donors are of Asian heritage and all have accepted that their donor children may contact them in adulthood. Faye Penny is the donor coordinator at Saint Mary’s, and sits down with each patient to look through Fairfax’s online catalogue. They can search by detailed criteria including physical characteristics, personality, baby photos and can even hear his voice. “Most straight couples don’t want to see the photos,” said Penny. “Often all they want to know is the hair and eye colour and the ethnicity.” Donor 4848 is 175cm tall and 90kg and is of Indian origin. His favourite animal is a hamster, he is Muslim, likes going to the theatre and reading. Donor 5319 is described as: “Shy at first, he is insightful with a warm heart and caring spirit. He loves spending time around children and seeing the potential of the world’s future first-hand ... Our staff consider him attractive, with a handsome face and a tall, athletic build.” Penny believes that being able to offer patients a choice of donor without making them wait is important. “Previously, you didn’t know the donor was going to be available the next time someone came in, because they can only make 10 families.” According to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (Hefa), more than 300,000 children in the UK have been born from licensed fertility treatment since 1991. Of those, at least 15,000 were born at Saint Mary’s in Manchester."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/20/stetsons-beards-and-good-honest-sweat-why-pop-stars-are-going-back-to-basics","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"Stetsons, beards and good, honest sweat: why pop stars are going back to basics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/20/stetsons-beards-and-good-honest-sweat-why-pop-stars-are-going-back-to-basics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/20/stetsons-beards-and-good-honest-sweat-why-pop-stars-are-going-back-to-basics","fields":{"headline":"Stetsons, beards and good, honest sweat: why pop stars are going back to basics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the new year’s biggest surprises has been the appearance of a pensive son of the soil by the name of Justin Timberlake. In a short teaser video announcing his fifth solo album, Man of the Woods, the former ‘NSync star went a-wanderin’ through forests, fields, mountains and streams, lookin’ fer answers to this big ol’ riddle we call life. Bearded and rugged, he looked like a man who wouldn’t think twice about climbing into the body of a dead horse for warmth. This on-the-nose rebrand inspired rather more hilarity than Timberlake might have expected, resembling as it did a commercial for a cologne that smells of cattle, woodsmoke and good, honest sweat. For pop stars, the tropes of country music, and rural America in general, are alluring shorthand for maturity and sincerity. In 2016, Lady Gaga reversed out of a club-pop cul-de-sac with the relatively earthy Joanne. Last year, Miley Cyrus mothballed her twerking pants and revisited her country roots on Younger Now. Kylie is promising a new album, Golden, inspired by Dolly Parton, the hot-pink intersection of country and camp. Even Beyoncé turned to country on 2016’s Daddy Lessons, her riff on inheritance, religion and the second amendment. In various ways, pop has never been so country-curious. “I think when pop stars get rich, there is an instinctive move to buy a farm,” says Chris Willman, music critic and author of Rednecks &amp; Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music. “And once you’re out there, you may wonder why you aren’t making records as folksy as your new off-the-grid lifestyle. I’d maybe call it ‘ranch hypnosis’. But I find it reassuring that country does still read as authenticity to some degree, long after some of us have given up on it being anything other than southern ex-urban lifestyle music.” Artists have been heading down to Tennessee to avail themselves of crack session musicians and rootsy ambience since Bob Dylan and Neil Young almost 50 years ago. Nashville is both a thriving music industry hub and an abstract ideal; a factory that turns out myths as well as hits. “When a major artist comes (or comes back to) this region, it’s not just an act,” says Ann Powers, a critic and author who lives in Nashville. “It also usually signals a genuine attempt to tap into a rich musical resource.” At this stage, the extent of Timberlake’s interest is unclear. When he solemnly claims that Man of the Woods is inspired by “where I’m from”, he isn’t whistling Dixie. He was born in Memphis and now owns a decent chunk of Leiper’s Fork, an hour outside of Nashville. But the snow-covered landscapes in the video suggest Montana, where he owns a ranch, rather than Tennessee. By eliding the deep south with the old west, he isn’t so much exploring his roots as creating a moodboard of heartland Americana. How that manifests itself in the music remains to be seen. The album promises a duet with Nashville crossover star Chris Stapleton, and the tracklisting reads like an Apprentice team’s whiteboard after a long morning brainstorming names for an air freshener: Breeze Off the Pond, Livin’ Off the Land, Flannel. But its first single, Filthy, is Timbaland-produced electro-funk with a video in which Timberlake dances with a robot. Neither he nor the robot look like they could erect a sturdy cabin afore winter comes. Lady Gaga also played it both ways on Joanne, co-writing songs with country hitmaker Hillary Lindsey but hiring Mark Ronson as producer. Pop has always been about dressing up. Stars adopt new guises to refresh the narrative for another album cycle. It gets tricky, though, when the new identity reads as a statement of authenticity. Is this incarnation the “real” one or just another costume? “Country imagery has been played for comedy so much, there’s a danger of seeming self-parodic if you put on the Stetson or go romping in the trees,” says Willman. “I don’t think Lady Gaga meant to seem campy or patronising with her Joanne look but she just did. And I think Miley desperately wanted to convey authenticity to the world, yet maybe it was that very thirst for authenticity that read as inauthentic.” As the Tennessee-born daughter of Billy Ray Cyrus and goddaughter of Dolly Parton, Cyrus has country credentials; even her eye-poppingly postmodern Bangerz tour included a throaty rendition of Jolene. But Younger Now retrospectively underscored criticisms that her interest in urban music was just a calculated phase, especially when, in a Billboard interview, she caricatured mainstream hip-hop as: “Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock”. Pivoting from an urban identity to a rural one attracts an awful lot of racial baggage, especially under the current administration. Ann-Derrick Gaillot at news and comment site the Outline criticised Timberlake for “pandering to a whiter America”, while Buzzfeed’s Anne-Helen Petersen went so far as to compare the singer’s new aesthetic to Donald Trump Jr’s Park Avenue frontiersman shtick. Powers, whose new book Good Booty explores the sexual and racial politics of US popular music, points out that the history of country music is racially complex. It’s always been informed by black music – blues, rock’n’roll, soul – and now young country artists such as Sam Hunt and Maren Morris are absorbing hip-hop and R&amp;B into their sound. “While the culture and business of country music remains overwhelmingly white and male-dominated, the sound is not so monochromatic,” says Powers. “In fact, many singers sound like they’re influenced by Justin Timberlake or Beyoncé.” But in the popular imagination, and the tourist traps of Nashville’s main drag, country codes as culturally conservative and blindingly white. For pop stars who built their success on assimilating – some would say appropriating – black music, a new engagement with country music raises thorny questions. “These moves suggest that these artists are aiming for racially unconfined sounds and images,” says Powers. “Maybe their invocations of the south or the west are meant as a form of acknowledgment: we are white, they seem to be saying, we know it, and we’re not going to fake our racial identities any more. If that’s the intention, it seems to be failing.” Pop stars don’t necessarily ponder racial politics when crafting a new direction but they do consider the bottom line. On that front, the wisdom of turning to country is uncertain. Younger Now flopped and Joanne was no hit machine but those albums may prove to be canny routes to longevity. With rock in decline, country is the new epicentre of traditional instrumentation, midtempo ballads and other ingredients that appeal to older listeners. “Justin Timberlake is 36 years old,” says Powers. “He’s a dad. Who can blame him for being inspired by Chris Stapleton, who had his commercial breakthrough at 37? Country fans are loyal, they support live music, they even still buy recordings.” Rock or pop artists who court the country audience know that if they can connect with these fans they will likely have them for life. Pop’s biggest star may be travelling in the opposite direction but she knows the territory better than most. Don’t be surprised if, after the celeb-saturated urban pop of Reputation, Taylor Swift finds her way back to Nashville. And she won’t have to stand in the woods lookin’ thoughtful to do it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/18/complex-engineering-and-metal-work-discovered-beneath-ancient-greek-pyramid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T09:21:06Z","webTitle":"Complex engineering and metal-work discovered beneath ancient Greek 'pyramid'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/18/complex-engineering-and-metal-work-discovered-beneath-ancient-greek-pyramid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/18/complex-engineering-and-metal-work-discovered-beneath-ancient-greek-pyramid","fields":{"headline":"Complex engineering and metal-work discovered beneath ancient Greek 'pyramid'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 4,000 years ago builders carved out the entire surface of a naturally pyramid-shaped promontory on the Greek island of Keros. They shaped it into terraces covered with 1,000 tonnes of specially imported gleaming white stone to give it the appearance of a giant stepped pyramid rising from the Aegean: the most imposing manmade structure in all the Cyclades archipelago. But beneath the surface of the terraces lay undiscovered feats of engineering and craftsmanship to rival the structure’s impressive exterior. Archaeologists from three different countries involved in an ongoing excavation have found evidence of a complex of drainage tunnels – constructed 1,000 years before the famous indoor plumbing of the Minoan palace of Knossos on Crete – and traces of sophisticated metalworking. The Dhaskalio promontory is a tiny island as the result of rising sea levels, but 4,500 years ago was attached by a narrow causeway to Keros, now uninhabited and a protected site. In the third millennium BC Keros was a major sanctuary where complex rituals were enacted. Earlier excavations by the team from the University of Cambridge, the Ephorate of Antiquities of Cyclades and the Cyprus Institute have uncovered thousands of marble Cycladic sculptures – the stylised human figures which inspired western artists, including Pablo Picasso – and which appear to have been deliberately broken elsewhere and brought to the island for burial. Maintaining as well as constructing the settlement would have taken a huge communal effort. The now-deserted slopes of Dhaskalio were once covered with structures and buildings, suggesting that 4,500 years ago it was one of the most densely populated parts of the islands – despite the fact that it could not have been self-sufficient, meaning that most food, like the stone and the ore for metal working, had to be imported. The first evidence of metal-working was found in excavations 10 years ago. The new finds have uncovered two workshops full of metalworking debris, and objects including a lead axe, a mould for copper daggers and dozens of ceramic fragments from metalworking equipment including the mouth of a bellows. Archaeologists will return to excavate an intact clay oven, found at the very end of the last season. Joint director of the excavation Michael Boyd, of the University of Cambridge, said metalworking expertise was evidently concentrated at Dhaskalio at a time when access to both skills and raw materials was very limited. “What we are seeing here with the metalworking and in other ways is the beginnings of urbanisation,” he said. Far-flung communities were drawn into networks centred on the site, craft and agricultural production was intensified, and the architecture became grander, gradually overshadowing the original importance of the sanctuary. Excavated soil reveals food traces including pulses, grapes, olives, figs and almonds, and cereals, including wheat and barley. Evi Margaritis of the Cyprus Institute said: “Much of this food was imported: in the light of this evidence we need to reconsider what we know about existing networks to include food exchange.” The pyramid of terraces would have blazed in the Greek sun, visible from far off, covered in white stone imported from Naxos 10 kilometres away. The complex of drainage tunnels was discovered when archaeologists were excavating an imposing staircase in the lower terraces: research continues to discover whether they were for fresh water or sewage. Lord Renfrew, joint director of the excavation, former Disney professor of archaeology at Cambridge and now the senior fellow at the McDonald Institute for archaeological research, first landed on Keros as a student and has returned often throughout his long career. He believes the promontory may originally have become a focus for development because it guarded the best natural harbour on the island, with wide views across the Aegean. The excavations are being recorded digitally, using the iDig programme running on iPads for the first time in the Aegean. This creates three-dimensional models using photogrammetry recording of the entire digging process, giving everyone involved access to all data in real time.

In the wake of the collapse of public service provider Carillion, the National Audit Office found little evidence that government investment in more than 700 existing public-private projects has delivered financial benefits. The cost of privately financing public projects can be 40% higher than relying solely upon government money, auditors found. They also disclosed that the government has a £2.6m equity stake in one of Carillion’s major projects – public money that is now at risk. There are currently 716 operational private finance deals with a capital value of around £60bn, the report said. Annual charges for these deals amounted to £10.3bn in 2016-17. Even if no new deals are entered into, future charges that continue until the 2040s amount to £199bn, it said – money that could finance the entire NHS for 20 months. The findings come hours after Theresa May claimed the government was merely a “customer” of Carillion, which collapsed on Monday following involvement in dozens of major public projects. The prime minister also told the House of Commons that the government could claw back some of the bonuses that have been paid to Carillion’s executives, such as £1.5m dished out in 2016 to the former chief executive Richard Howson. Employees on most private sector contracts held by the failed construction company will continue to be paid, it emerged on Wednesday, as the government urged banks to deal “swiftly and sympathetically” with small firms caught up in the crisis. Unions reported cases of workers being laid off across the country as a number of construction projects were stopped, with no certainty over when work would restart. Following publication of Thursday’s report, Meg Hillier – the chair of the public accounts committee, launched a scathing critique of the private finance deals. “After 25 years of PFI, there is still little evidence that it delivers enough benefit to offset the additional costs of borrowing money privately,” she said. “Many local bodies are now shackled to inflexible PFI contracts that are exorbitantly expensive to change. “I am concerned that [the] treasury has relaunched PFI under new branding, without doing anything about most of its underlying problems. We need more investment in our schools and hospitals but if we get the contracts wrong, taxpayers pay the price,” she said. Auditors examined PFI deals drawn up over 25 years under Tory and Labour governments, as well PF2, introduced as improved public-private financing deals set up under David Cameron’s premiership. They did not comment on the merits of the PFI and PF2 systems, which raised funds to build schools, hospitals and roads in return for regular payments. But the report found that overall cash spending on private finance deals is higher than publicly financed alternatives. An analysis of costs for building one group of schools “found costs are around 40% higher than the costs of a project financed by government borrowing,” auditors said. Whitehall has no means of measuring whether PFIs are value for money, the report said. “There is still a lack of data available on the benefits of private finance procurement.” Under PF2, the government will gain a smaller proportion of profit if deals are refinanced – a cut from 50% of gains to 33% – which could cost taxpayers millions of pounds. This was done, the report said, to keep PF2 projects off the balance sheet. “HM treasury acknowledges that these changes could have a moderate negative impact on [value for money],” the report said. The report examined six PF2 deals to finance schools and hospitals. It disclosed that the then chancellor George Osborne considered bringing historic PFI debt on to the government’s books in 2012, but rejected this, partly because of a risk to the UK’s AAA credit rating. Months later, Britain’s rating was downgraded to AA1 following an economic slump. The report, which was written before the collapse of Carillion, said the government has a equity stake in the delayed £350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Smethwick. “The winning bidder for the 40% stake was Richardson’s. The government holds 10% of the equity and Carillion, the primary contractor, holds the other 50%.” Research by auditors found that private investors who charge public bodies for insurance on each project, have not passed on 15 years of lower insurance costs. “Public bodies are paying more for insurance than the actual cost, providing a gain to [private] investors,” it said. The report also reveals that bringing the largest PFI deals back in to public ownership would cost more than £2bn with other costs on top – on average an additional 23% on top of the outstanding debt of these deals. Labour and the unions have called for an end to risky public-private deals. Jeremy Corbyn said: “These corporations need to be shown the door. We need our public services provided by public employees with a public service ethos and a strong public oversight.” Rehana Azam, the national secretary of the GMB union said the report showed PFI to be “a catastrophic waste of taxpayers’ money”. She added: “Carillion is just the latest example of how bad things go wrong when public services are left in the hand of profit-hungry companies.” A government spokesman said vital infrastructure projects like roads, schools and hospitals are paid for by PFI and PF2, stimulating the economy and creating jobs. “We have reformed how we manage PFI contracts, and through PF2 have created a model which improves transparency and offers better value for money,” he said. “Taxpayer money is protected through PFI and PF2 as the risks of construction and long-term maintenance of a project are transferred to the private sector.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.

Not only was it the first mainstream LGBTQ sitcom on TV, but it was one in which gay life was portrayed in a naturalistic way; where the characters weren’t walking cliches but just … existed. The arrival of Will &amp; Grace in 1998 – a year after Ellen had come out on her self-titled sitcom – was political by its very presence on primetime. The success of its eight-season run was significant: in 2012 Joe Biden, Obama’s vice president, commented that the show “probably did more to educate the American public” on LGBTQ issues “than almost anything anybody has ever done so far”. It opened the doors for gay characters on TV, paving the way for the likes of Modern Family’s Cam and Mitch. Comedian Billy Eichner (Difficult People, Billy on the Street) recently said: “If it wasn’t for [Jack, played by Sean Hayes] I wouldn’t be able to have a television show.” Still, no one could have expected the reaction when the sitcom’s classic quartet (Will, Grace, Jack and Karen) resurfaced in September 2016 with a 10-minute reunion video. The Trump-baiting clip found the foursome sparring in classic Will &amp; Grace style on themes such as Jamie Dornan using a “butt double” in 50 Shades of Grey, Brangelina, and the revelation that Karen is a good mate of the Trumps. “Donny’s one of my oldest friends,” she says, “I helped him pick out Melania.” Released hours before the first presidential debate, the clip’s political humour felt like a two-fingered salute to the right, not just a viral hit but a call to arms. Its success (7m views and counting) also led to the show being recommissioned for a ninth season. “This reincarnation was born out of all of the turmoil in America,” Eric McCormack, who plays Will, explains. “It was born because we did that video. It started from a pure need to say something, on behalf of Hillary and on behalf of sanity.” “It came out and was getting millions of hits,” adds Megan Mullally (Karen). “And then, all of a sudden, NBC was like: ‘Hey guys, about that video … ’” The first episode of the new season, 11 Years Later, continues the mood of political defiance. In it, the gang end up in the White House, where Grace has been hired to do an interior design job on the Oval Office (when she needs to colour match the space to Trump’s colouring she pulls out a bag of Cheetos). Although she spends the episode in a moral quandary about the potential gig, she ends the show with a definitive “F-you”: his office remains untouched except for a Make America Gay Again cap that she leaves on his presidential chair. When it was first on the air, the comedy – which mixed slapstick with scathing insults – felt bitingly fresh. Not only were Will and Jack both gay, but the love/hate dynamics between the dysfunctional characters (Karen v Jack, Karen v Grace, Jack v Grace, Jack v Will) were like a primetime punch to the face: delivered with wit, a musical cadence and a specific knowing humour that felt unique. As the show returns, McCormack believes the United States may need a reminder of that particular brand of “gay de vivre”. “We, as a nation, advanced under Obama, and now that has been wiped away,” he says. “The Republicans would love to undo marriage equality, just as they would love to undo everything that Obama achieved. So it’s not like everything is safe now, it’s not like everyone has a gay best friend. If we are so advanced, how the hell did he [Trump] get elected?” While there was clearly a public appetite for the show to return (Jack and Karen, the two characters considered the heart of the show by fans, had a much talked-about spin-off that never got to pilot stage) it wasn’t the obvious choice for a reboot compared to other revered sitcoms. In the period since its last season, all the characters have matured but are essentially the same: caustic, barbed, kept-woman Karen has softened only a little in the intervening years. “She is still horrible, and still says terrible things to people,” says Mullally. “But she’s a little more three-dimensional. There is an episode this season, about Rosario [Karen’s housekeeper] which is the greatest episode they’ve ever written for my character.” Elsewhere in the show, both Will and Jack are dealing with the ageing process and how it affects their dating lives. The second episode of the new season, Who’s Your Daddy, tackles getting older in the gay world with a hilarious Death Becomes Her angle; Jack meets a much younger, millennial suitor and can’t sit down because his Spanx are too tight (plus he has magnets stuck to his neck to pull his face back), while Will’s date barely acknowledges the importance of former guest star Madonna (“He should be beaten with a VHS tape of Evita,” says Jack). “I think that, at the core, every person is pretty much the same as they have been since high school or college,” believes Hayes. “Yes, they are a little older, and we talk about that, but Jack will always be Jack, because people are generally always the same.” Perhaps surprisingly, Hayes was not out publicly until after the show had come off air. “We would get death threats to the show and I was scared,” he recalls. “I didn’t have the tools at such a young age to deal with the ramifications of coming out as gay in a huge public way. “But wisdom comes with age, and you realise, oh, I was doing more damage in not coming out sooner. I should have been more fearless, like my character.” Television – particularly on cable and streaming sites – has changed exponentially in the 20 years since the show began, with a myriad of diverse representations of the LGBTQ community, in shows such as Orange Is the New Black and Transparent. With long-standing comments that Will &amp; Grace only ever presented a narrow, white, male version of gay life (Vox called out its tendency to “make a punchline out of any LGBTQ person who isn’t a white gay man”), is there pressure to break more boundaries second time around? “We are not responsible for representing gay America or gay culture; we are only responsible for writing the characters of Jack, Karen, Will and Grace as responsibly and funnily as we can,” says producer Max Mutchnick. Although the show has always felt poignant, this new season takes more explicit stabs at society. As well as the Trump baiting, the fourth episode, Grandpa Jack, follows Jack as he discovers he’s a grandfather, and visits a summer camp where his grandson has been sent to “straighten” him out. The camp, at which Girls actor Andrew Rannells guest stars as a member of staff, features a subtly placed photograph of evangelical Christian vice president Mike Pence above the fireplace. “Any creative choice you make feels more highly politicised in these highly politicised times,” explains co-producer David Kohan. He is determined that the show not attempt to emulate the edginess of much of the new comedy that has flourished in the intervening years. “Either people will take to it or they won’t, but to try to change it and modify it, to conform with whatever this new landscape is, would have been a big mistake,” he says. “It would fly in the face of fans who want to be comforted by their old friends. At a time when things are very much in flux, and many people are very anxious, this is a dose of comfort every week.” Levels of comfort among audiences may have shifted, too. In the first incarnation, there was seemingly very little actual sex happening for Will or Jack. “We were hyper-aware that we were walking a tightrope,” says Debra Messing (who plays Grace). “We wanted to talk about Will and Jack’s sex lives, but it had to be done in a way that was non-threatening, in a way that would not make people uncomfortable and turn off the TV.” That concern has apparently been eradicated in the past decade. “We have a joke in the episode we are rehearsing today that is about gay sex,” reveals McCormack. “It is a conversation that two gay men might have about what they like and what they don’t like. It’s a ‘tops and bottoms’ conversation, and we actually can’t believe that the network is allowing us to do it.” Will &amp; Grace is on Friday 26 January, 10pm, Channel 5"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/17/the-right-has-a-quasi-mystical-belief-that-the-poor-are-inferior-sterilisation-is-the-logical-next-step","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T16:22:28Z","webTitle":"The right has a quasi-mystical belief that the poor are inferior – sterilis​ation​ is the logical next step ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/17/the-right-has-a-quasi-mystical-belief-that-the-poor-are-inferior-sterilisation-is-the-logical-next-step","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/17/the-right-has-a-quasi-mystical-belief-that-the-poor-are-inferior-sterilisation-is-the-logical-next-step","fields":{"headline":"The right has a quasi-mystical belief that the poor are inferior – sterilis​ation​ is the logical next step ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Eugenics gets a bad rap because of its unfortunate Nazi heritage and antiquated, confusing language – “purity”, “bloodlines” – where you can never immediately tell whether they are talking about people or horses. The more commonplace eugenicist, who merely wants poor people to stop breeding, barely gets a look in. Yet they can ascend quite high, quite fast, up the ranks of the party of government. Ben Bradley, vice-chair of the Conservative party, fretted in 2012 that the nation was “drowning in a sea of unemployed wasters” – metaphors from the natural world (floods, seas, insects, tides, swarms) are an absolute staple of the eugenics diet, as they are for racists. It is always hard to conjure a proper, full-blooded hatred for other people on a case-by-case basis. You have to transform them into a vast force, united by a shared, destructive agenda. Conundrum: wasters, presumably, have no agenda. But tolerate enough wasting, and soon there is a sea of it. Anyway, his fix was for unemployed people to have vasectomies. As interim women’s officer for the Eugenics-Concern movement, I would like to know what the sterilisation offer is for women, or whether, as with universal credit, this is a breadwinner-family model, wherein any unwanted fertility of the underclass should be tackled at its source – the testicle. It only seems like a short time ago (nine days) that a board member of the universities regulator resigned, following reports of his attendance at a secret eugenics conference. The newly unemployed Toby Young came stoutly to his own defence; he was just sitting at the back during the dodgy symposium; the “intelligence” conference he spoke at was “super-respectable”. Sorry, that was unfair: he is not unemployed and nobody here thinks he should have a vasectomy. He has another job, with which his views are totally compatible. He is director of the mainly government-funded New Schools Network, supporting free schools within the English state sector. So if he thinks intelligence is pre-determined, evidenced by household income, and it is reasonable to at least give those at the bottom the choice to snuff out their sub-standard offspring before they are born, that wouldn’t be a problem at all. This is what kite-flying is all about; sometimes you find a new bit of sky, other times you veer off course and get tangled with a drone. Bradley is tasked with attracting young people to the Conservative party, for which he would have to come up with some eye-catching ideas, in the absence of “anything good for young people”. Yet this quasi-mystical belief in the poor as inherently inferior, morally polluting and intellectually diluting the national bloodstream is both the logical conclusion and the theoretical underpinning of the modern right. If hardship is all about individual failure and opportunity is working perfectly well, how do you account for such radical divergence in outcome, except by a radical difference in input? The godfather of it all is the American political scientist Charles Murray, big in the 90s for zingers such as: “What’s holding back [the poor] is that they’re not bright enough to be physicians.” He is Rupert Murdoch’s ideas-mentor (Murray, along with Niall Ferguson, were the two authors Murdoch passed on to Trump, back in the day when people still thought he read). It is a credo in which the poor are poor because they “sit in their undershirts, drinking”, while the rich are drinking higher quality alcohol and wearing sports jackets, so, you know, QED. In a novel, the hubris (“I’m rich ergo I’m brilliant”) would get a comical comeuppance; in real life, it ends in unfathomable darkness (“It would be better if those poor people weren’t alive, because they’re obviously stupid”). This is why novels are more nourishing than engaging in politics, but they are not lucrative to either read or write, so if this is your plan, remember not to have children. Trump’s sweary problem with bad plumbing Donald Trump has taken his yearly medical and aced everything: he has invented a new measurement of height, the Trump Inch, in which he is 6’3”. Barack Obama, at 6’1”, always appeared the taller man, but he was using the fake inch. The president also scored 100% in a test designed to detect cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. But, we could have guessed that from the devilish sophistication in his “shithole” argument. Some clarifications had already emerged: he only called unspecified African countries “shitholes”; of Haiti, he merely said: “We don’t need any more Haitians,” which is fine, because if you call a series of unrelated foreign countries shitholes, that makes you sound quite xenophobic, whereas if all your shitholes are clustered on the same continent, that is geopolitical analysis. Yet there’s more. Now White House officials are saying the word was not “shithole” but “shithouse”, and was a specific reference to paucity of infrastructure, specifically plumbing. The good news for the free world is threefold: first, to deny calling a country a shithole means you know that it is bad to call a country a shithole. Someone in this administration knows right from wrong. Second, it is quite a fine point of difference, between “bad place” and “place with bad plumbing”. It has the close attention to detail of a legal mind. Therefore, not all the legal minds have been fired. Third, “shithole countries” has been a common racist chant for ages on the alt-right alter-web (I have a screengrab of Jo Marney, ex-first lady of Ukip, accusing someone of coming from one in 2016), which raises the spectre of Trump spending his life roaming around online hate swamps, looking for ideas. This turns out not to be true: he spends his downtime thinking about modern amenities, as so many reasonable people do. Playground wisdom to live by I have just discovered Greater Good magazine, science-based advice for leading a better life. It’s full of lists: Five Ways to Be More Inspiring, Three Surprising Habits of Happy People, Seven Ways to Raise Children Who Are More Tolerant Than You, some of which I would dispute on principle (I don’t want my children to be more tolerant than me; I tolerate them and they are outrageous). However, some of it is gold, including one way to be more authentic – “Know your own truth and stay out of other people’s”. Very close analysis (I read it all the way through) reveals what this means – “Mind your own business”. While we are rediscovering playground wisdom, can I add: “He who smelt it also dealt it”. And “your mum”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/29/porto-portugal-city-guide-local-guide-cafe-restaurant-hotel","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T06:30:40Z","webTitle":"A local’s guide to Porto, Portugal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/29/porto-portugal-city-guide-local-guide-cafe-restaurant-hotel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/29/porto-portugal-city-guide-local-guide-cafe-restaurant-hotel","fields":{"headline":"A local’s guide to Porto, Portugal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sitting in my customary Porto cafe, a non-descript place on Praça Carlos Alberto across from my kids’ school, a troupe of Asian tourists march by. They are sheltered under umbrellas, heads down, following their guide in an orderly step to the next tourist honeypot. For a whistlestop visit to Portugal’s delightful second city, a guided tour is probably a good idea. Porto’s tourist route is now well-worn, but wonderful nonetheless. It starts with a climb up Torre dos Clérigos, then a walk across Ponte de Dom Luís I, a visit to a port wine cellar in Gaia, a pastel de nata (or three!) in Majestic Café, and finally a bacalhau (cod) dinner in one of the city’s picturesque riverside restaurants. For those with more time to spare, take a stroll down the bustling Rua das Flores, or a boat ride along the Rio Douro, or even a bus out to the Atlantic coast at Matosinhos. There is no doubt: this Unesco heritage city makes for the perfect weekend break. It comes as little surprise that holidaymakers have named it Europe’s best destination twice in the last four years, nor that the low-cost airlines are now jetting here in their droves. With mass tourism comes inevitable change, however. Only 15 years ago, locals admitted that the cobbled medieval streets of downtown were “mortas” (dead). Today, cool kerbside cafes and hip hotels are replacing the derelict tenements of yesteryear. But what of the city away from the tourist trail? Construction cranes may nowadays be cramming the skyline and the clickety-clack of cabin-sized suitcases may be filling the air, but life in the backstreets still goes on. So, once done with the city’s hotspots, or if they don’t appeal, here’s an alternative guide to some of Porto’s best off-beat gems. Pedro Limaõ Be sure to eat at this fantastic restaurant in the up-and-coming Bonfim bairro. With just six tables around an open kitchen, the space is unpretentious and intimate. That’s all to the good because it takes a while to tackle the 10-course tasting menu (€37 without drinks). A former architect, chef Pedro Barreiros produces each individual dish with an eclectic combination of mathematical precision, gastronomic mastery and creative flare. The result is a whirlwind of inventive delight, with simple yet sublime courses like chestnut cream and mushroom foam, masala-spiced tuna tartare, and squid risotto. Each dish arrives at the table with a short introduction by the charming staff, who are happy to recommend accompanying wines and other tipples. If chef Pedro were in London, or even Lisbon, he would be fêted as a trailblazer in Portuguese modernist cuisine. Luckily for Portuenses, he’s stayed true to his home-city roots. • Rua do Morgado de Mateus 49, on Facebook Café Candelabro Hidden away down the backstreets close to Aliados, Porto’s main avenue, Café Candelabro is a relaxed, convivial bolthole a world away from the tourist rigmarole. It is open day and night during the week (Mon-Fri 10.30-2am; Saturday 4pm-2am; Sunday 4pm-12am), its morning fare of coffee and cake slipping languidly into lunchtime snacks (bruschetta, €3.50, hummus, €3.50, soup, €2) and a glass or two of wine. Candelabro is rare in the breadth of its wine selection, with 60 varieties from across Portugal. Be sure to try an alvarinho, the country’s only terroir wine. The cafe is also atypical in selling wine by the glass (average price €3). By mid-afternoon in summer, students begin to drift in, filling the sun-drenched pavement patio. Occupying a former bookshop, Porto-born owners Hugo and Miguel have kept true to the spirit of the place and the walls are lined with secondhand books for sale. Most reflect the owners’ personal interests in photography, cinema, music and the arts in general and there’s a “playlist” of video art projected on the wall (Thur-Sat evenings). Because of its late opening this is also the place to go for a quiet, postprandial glass of port. • Rua da Conceição 3, cafecandelabro.com myhomeinporto Porto is now awash with short-term rentals, but finding an apartment that’s not furnished floor to ceiling by Ikea is another matter entirely. For a unique alternative, book into the exquisitely decorated myhomeinporto. Former Lisbon-based interior designer Juan de Mayoralgo has turned this classic 1930s townhouse into an oasis of stylish calm. True to its name, everything has a familial, cared-for feel to it, from the family photos on the walls to the collector’s pieces sprinkled about the place. Light and airy, the three en-suite bedrooms are decked out with the same trademark taste and attention to detail. Breakfasts brim with a homemade freshness, thanks to the daily supplies from Porto’s famous Mercado do Bolhão. Originally from Spain, Juan retains a newcomer’s fascination with this city and is more than happy to pass on insider tips. • Doubles from €110 B&amp;B, myhomeinporto.com Gostar de Ler bookshop For a marker of how a city is holding out against the tide of global brands, count up its independent bookshops. By that measure, Porto remains in good shape. It’s true that a few bookshops have been lost of late to boutique hotels, but books – and book-selling – still survive. For Instagramable biblioporn, join the queue outside Lello &amp; Irmão, the wood-panelled bookshop that reputedly inspired JK Rowling, who taught English in Porto in the early 1990s. Otherwise, head to nearby Gostar de Ler. A recent creation of Lurdes Paiva (formerly of the four-storey Chaminé da Mota on Rus das Flores), this dinky bookshop feels part-film set, part-living room, filled as it is with furniture and photo albums, trinkets and typewriters. Books are arranged together as much by aesthetic sensibility as subject matter, a sort of Dewey Decimal system for the soul. Livraria Académica next door is also worth a visit, as is the nearby poetry bookshop Poetria and the comic store Timtim por Timtim. • Rua Mártires da Liberdade 120, on Facebook Mercearias Edge-of-town hypermarkets and their miniaturised city-centre offspring are now firmly entrenched in Porto, but the city’s mercearias (grocery stores) have not given up the ghost yet. Far from it, in fact. The best examples can be found on the streets surrounding Mercado do Bolhão. Start at the wonderfully named Comer e Chorar por Mais (Eat and Cry for More). Founded in 1912, this diminutive store is packed to the rafters with Portuguese wines and regional foodstuffs. Everything is traditional and tasty, from the sardines and Portuguese pâtés, to the port wines and tinned sardines. Try the Montesinhos sausage (€30 per kg), the dried figs (€8.80 per kg) and the sun-dried pine nuts (€69 per kg). For oriental herbs and medicines, like antioxidant-rich gingko and “super-detox” chia, head to Casa Chinesa on the next block. It’s also the place to go in Porto for pulses and lentils, teas and spices. Save some space for some salted cod, best procured from nearby Casa Natal. Cantinho das Aromáticas Porto is famous for its eponymous wines. By all means, go stick your nose into a glass or three of the strong stuff. But don’t leave without checking out one of the city’s lesser-known olfactory treats. On an elevated plot over the Rio Douro, in Vila Nova de Gaia, sit the fragrant fields and nurseries of Cantinho das Aromáticas. From just 2½ hectares, this beautiful organic farm manages to produce a whopping 150 or so different plant species. Visitors are invited to wander along the neat rows of aromatic flowers, medicinal plants and kitchen herbs. (Don’t worry about the kids: the farm’s stone dovecote makes for the perfect playground). For those wanting to get their hands dirty, opportunities also exist to volunteer. At the end of the visit, enjoy one of the farm’s freshly plucked infusions (two of these won two stars at the 2017 Great Taste Awards) in the well-stocked café-cum-shop. The farm’s 50-plus products include bee glue extract (€9.60), extra virgin olive oil (€6.90-€38.00) and various fruit and floral liqueurs (from €10) • Rua do Meiral, Vila Nova de Gaia Mercado de Matosinhos Such is the draw of the city’s vibrant, historic riverside that it’s easy to forget that the Atlantic Ocean lies just a stone’s throw away along its banks. On summer days, surfers and sun-bathers fill the sandy shoreline. The year-round stalwarts of the sea, however, are Porto’s fishermen. For a sight (and smell) of their deep-water catches, take a half-hour bus ride to Matosinhos and stroll around the fish stalls of the bustling Mercado Municipal, where talkative stallholders will happily advise not just on what is freshest that day, but on how best to prepare it. If descaling and gutting sounds a bit much, fear not – dozens of cooks are waiting along Rua Heróis de França to do the honours. The restaurants may all look a bit spit-and-sawdust, but that’s just a sign of their harbourside heritage. The food is universally excellent, with Salta o Muro and O Lusitano particularly recommended (two courses from around €20 a head). • Rua França Júnior, Matosinhos. Most restaurants closed Monday, on Facebook New science museum When the 20th-century Portuguese poet and writer Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen was a child, she liked to say that her palatial family home was big enough to house a whale. So when the University of Porto chose it to house the city’s first Natural History and Science Museum, they hung a whale’s skeleton from the ceiling. The museum’s interactive and informative exhibits have proved a hit with locals since its inauguration last summer, although it’s still a novelty on the tourist trail. Book in time to have a potter around the wonderful botanical gardens, which occupy the grounds of this impressive mansion house. The gardens house the university’s herbarium, containing thousands of historic specimens from across Portugal’s former colonies. The better-known Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, which is also within the walls of a one-time grand estate, is just a 25-minute walk away. • Adult €5, child €2.50, family of four €14, Rua do Campo Alegre 1191, mhnc.up.pt, closed Monday Porto Running Tours Porto offers endless opportunities for getting around. Hop on and off one of the open-top city tour buses or totter along in an old-school tram. Helitours will whiz those with deep pockets high above Porto’s red-tiled rooftops. For smaller budgets, try renting a bike and heading out along the coast (Foz-based Dourobike is worth renting from, if only for the chutzpah of its marketing slogan: “The last bike shop before New York”). But explore on foot to get a real taste for the city’s back streets. To escape the herd, head out alone but for the really adventurous, there’s another option: Porto Running Tours. Run (literally) by the ever-friendly and well-informed Sérgio Miranda, this is a chance to exercise and explore the city at the same time. Sérgio is a history and street art buff, but tours are tailored to all interests. The same goes for different age ranges and fitness levels. • €30 for one (€20pp thereafter, maximum of five to a group), portorunningtours.com Way to go Flights Easyjet flies to Porto from Bristol, Gatwick, Luton and Manchester from £22.66 one way. British Airways flies from Gatwick from £36 one way. Best time to go March/April for Easter celebrations, including concerts and plays. The São João festival in late June commemorates the patron saint of the city with barbecues and street music. Also in June, NOS Primavera Sound is the biggest urban music festival in Portugal. And the Porto marathon takes place on 4 November.

I’ve met thousands of potential students at university open days, as they arrive bright-eyed at the prospect of their new lives on campus. It’s always an exciting, hopeful period. But once it’s over, I’m left wondering whether I should tell them about what really happens behind the scenes after A-level results are announced. I work at a leading university. Like many others, we pay close attention to university league tables. Although these tables are designed to help students choose what university is best for them, in reality some of them restrict student choice and hold back widening participation. The problem lies in the metrics, notably entry tariff scores, which reflect more than students’ A-level results. This score is the decisive factor in who gets in and who gets turned down. While A-level results make a considerable contribution to tariff scores, so do all sorts of other things. Does the applicant have a good qualification in dance or a grade six in music? 12 points. Another qualification in speech and drama? A further 12 points. An A for an extended project? 24 points. Level 3 certificate in British sign language? 16 points. To provide some context, a B at A-level is worth 40 points. Last year, as we looked closely at students who had not quite made the grades – BBB instead of ABB, for instance, or BBC instead of BBB – those with extras such as ballet and piano qualifications were offered places. Other applicants with the same A-level results who did not achieve an acceptable tariff score were denied a place. Speaking to colleagues from other departments revealed that this happened across the university. This sort of league table game-playing by the university administration has an obvious impact on widening participation in universities. Students whose parents or guardians are unable to pay for piano or dance lessons, or whose schools do not offer extended projects, for example, ultimately lose out. Last year, my department closely re-examined the applications of every student who had just missed their A-level grades. Their personal statements revealed that many had done remarkably well given their circumstances, and we felt they had great potential and would flourish at university. But the university administration, fearing for the university’s position in the league tables, denied them admission. Once the widening participation quota – this year defined by those receiving free school meals – was full, equally deserving students missed out. I know that some league tables try to mitigate against this. The Guardian University Guide’s value-added score is designed to counteract lower tariff scores by giving universities points when students from under-represented groups do well. This is helpful, but since it focuses on student outcomes, there’s a two- to three-year time lag between admitting a student from an under-represented group and gaining points for them. In the short-term view of the administration, this is unacceptable. Until tariff scores are removed from the league tables this practice will continue. It’s ironic that the data designed to help students make decisions ultimately limits their options. If we’re serious as a society about allowing anyone to access university education, then the league tables need to be rethought. As educators, we want to teach these students. In the meantime, the best admissions advice I can give those students and parents visiting on open day is to keep at those piano and ballet lessons – if you can afford them.

The champions of England were pushed all the way tonight by Championship side Norwich City, at one point losing their heads to the extent that they ended extra time with only nine men. But they regained their composure during the penalty shoot-out, and a home time against Newcastle United in the fourth round is their reward! Hats off to Norwich, though, for making it one hell of a fight. Penalties: Chelsea 5-3 Norwich. Hazard rolls his spot kick into the bottom left, and Chelsea will host Newcastle in the fourth round! Penalties: Chelsea 4-3 Norwich. Murphy has to score. And he does, pelting one into the top right, sending Caballero the other way. But if Eden Hazard scores next, it’s all over. Penalties: Chelsea 4-2 Norwich. Kante hits high and hard into the top right. Gunn went the correct way, but had no chance. Penalties: Chelsea 3-2 Norwich. Vrancic hooks one into the right-hand side , Caballero going to the left. Penalties: Chelsea 3-1 Norwich. Azpilicueta blasts one into the right-hand side of the net. Gunn went the wrong way. Penalties: Chelsea 2-1 Norwich. Maddison jinks before hitting one into the bottom left. Cool as you like. Penalties: Chelsea 2-0 Norwich. Luiz smashes his into the bottom right, Gunn going the other way. Penalties: Chelsea 1-0 Norwich. Oliveira goes high to the left ... and Caballero parries it away brilliantly! Penalties: Chelsea 1-0 Norwich. Willian sends Gunn the wrong way, rolling into the bottom left. Who’ll host Newcastle United in the fourth round? We’ll finally get an answer soon. But only after a penalty shoot-out. And the kicks won’t be taken in the ABBA sequence; it’ll be the more conventional alternate system. Chelsea to take first. Here we go, then... Klose flashes a header at Caballero, who grasps the ball comfortably. And that’s it! We’re going to penalty kicks! “I am in favour of VAR,” said Antonio Conte before the game. “It is a good option to solve some strange situations and mistakes. It is right this way!” Compare and contrast: he’s ranting in the face of the fourth official in the animated style. His press conference is going to be good fun. With three minutes of stoppages having been played, Norwich earn a free kick to the right of the Chelsea box! They couldn’t, could they? Morata protests too much, and he’s shown another yellow. Chelsea are down to nine men! The extra 30 minutes are up. Morata tries to round Zimmerman on the outside. He goes over in the box, feeling a hand on his shoulder. The referee thinks he’s gone down too easily. No VAR intervention, and so it’s a yellow card for Morata. And then ... Two minutes left. After a long period of Chelsea pressure, Norwich are first to everything right now. All the action in the middle of the park. The hosts are getting super-frustrated. Pedro, booked for simulation earlier on, slams into Hoolahan from behind. It’s a late lunge, and an obvious second yellow. Off he goes. At least he won’t have to take a penalty kick. Three-and-a-half minutes to go! Five minutes until penalty kicks, unless Chelsea can do something about it. Or Norwich, obviously, but you see the general direction of travel right now. Pinto is hooked, Tettey coming on in his stead. Once he leaves, that is: Pinto takes an age to get off. Expect at least one added minute once the 120 is up. Six minutes to go. Zappacosta curls deep from the right and it’s hacked out of play for a corner. Norwich deal with the set piece, but they’re effectively playing with ten men, because Pinto is knackered. Chelsea fling the ball into the mixer again from the right. Morata meets the ball with his head, six yards out! He must score, but it’s straight at Gunn, who drops to the line and smothers. What drama! It’s attack versus defence. Kante bursts down the left channel and reaches the corner of the six-yard box. He looks for Morata in the middle but Zimmerman is on hand to flick the ball clear. Pinto goes down with cramp. The clock ticks on. Seven minutes left, and the Chelsea faithful are giving the stricken Norwich defender the bird. Ten minutes to go. It’ll seem like ten years to Norwich. But Chelsea will hear the clock ticking loudly. Azpilicueta sprays a simple pass out of play, under no pressure other than time pressure. The hosts are frustrated. Corner for Chelsea. Willian hooks it into the six-yard box. Gunn is forced to tip the ball from under his bar at full stretch. Then Morata tries to work the ball round a sliding Klose in the Norwich box. It hits his chest, but Chelsea claim the penalty. The ref - and presumably his VAR sprite - is having none of it. The teams switch around, Chelsea getting the ball rolling again. We’re 15 minutes away from penalty kicks. It’s raining quite a lot. It’s stormy in Antonio Conte’s soul. If the late, late equaliser wasn’t enough, the Willian penalty non-decision will have put the tin lid on it. A fun first period of extra time comes to an end with the teams still level. A shame the original 90 minutes weren’t like that. Vrancic lobs a pass down the left and nearly releases Lewis into the Chelsea area. A deep ball finds Hoolahan tight on the byline to the right of goal. Hoolahan performs a thoroughly pointless rabona, a pretty flourish that puts an end to a very promising move. Chelsea nearly punish him thoroughly, Willian and then Morata denied by some staunch work from Gunn. Eden Hazard comes on for Drinkwater. He’s straight into the action, dancing down the right and very nearly making space for himself in the Norwich area. Not quite. But with 20 minutes of extra time still to play, the brave visitors have a new problem to solve. Cantwell is sent scampering into acres of space down the inside-right channel. A better cross and he’d have found Hoolahan in the centre. He settles for a cornerl, which comes to naught. But Norwich are giving as good as they’re getting. “Conte will have a face on his face when he recalls that his Chelsea have the early Saturday kickoff at Brighton,” suggests Marie Mayer, not unreasonably. Now Morata goes down in the Norwich box, Klose getting a bit saucy with his hands. The defender taking a chance there, but he just about gets away with it. Incidentally, the VAR dude didn’t feel the Willian incident was a “clear and obvious error”, so the ref’s original decision stood. Ah, grey areas, the VAR’s Achilles heel. Willian drops a shoulder in the Norwich box and goes over Klose’s leg. He’s booked for simulation. However, there’s a little contact, but to Conte’s red-faced disbelief, the referee doesn’t go to the VAR ref. Neither does the VAR ref step in. They’ve probably decided that Willian was already going down, looking for the decision before contact was made. But no doubt you’ll hear more of that. It should have been a penalty kick. And we’re off again! Chelsea will be kicking themselves: that was uncharacteristically sloppy by Azpilicueta, and sloppy by Luiz. Penny for Conte’s thoughts. You’ve a fair idea, though, haven’t you. Norwich get the ball rolling for the first half of extra time. That was pretty much the last act of the game. In the stand, Delia Smith beams with delight. On the touchline, Antonio Conte has a face on. What a dramatic end to an otherwise dull match! We’re heading to extra time ... and possibly penalty kicks. Newcastle United still don’t know who they’ll be playing in round four! We’re heading for extra time! And it’s no more than Norwich City deserve! Klose, out on the left, curls a delicious cross into the area. Lewis rises above the static Luiz and Azpilicueta, and flicks a header into the top right! Kante - who came on for Kenedy - slips a ball down the middle of the park for Morata, who tries to spin free on the edge of the Norwich area. His control lets him down. Hoolahan hoofs up the other end. It’s an artful hoof, and it nearly releases Murphy. But Christensen sticks on his shoulder, between man and ball, allowing Caballero to rush out from the area to clear upfield. Pedro whips a cross into their box from the Chelsea left. Morata should slide it home, but can’t get his extended leg onto the ball. His confidence is shot. Which is why, in the next Chelsea attack, he tears free down the left but lays off for Willian instead of shooting. Willian hesitates on the penalty spot, in a futile attempt to dummy Gunn, and the chance is gone. Time is running out for Norwich as the board goes up: four minutes. Kenedy goes off, to great applause. He’s done well tonight, setting up the goal and nutmegging Pinto with an outrageous piece of close control. ♬ Ken-e-dy for them. ♬ “He always uses his quick feet to escape defenders in the middle of the park,” writes Luke Forrester. “That’s why they call it the Kennedy Space Centre.” All of which leaves us with the last knockings at Stamford Bridge. Unless Norwich can somehow find an equaliser from somewhere. There are five minutes to go. Morata very nearly put the tie to bed, but from close range flashed a header wide left. A reasonably sized shock, as the League One leaders see off the Premier League strugglers. Wigan host West Ham in the next round. Wolves’ wait for their first FA Cup since 1960 goes on. Swansea travel to Notts County in the fourth round. Chelsea replace their goalscorer Batshuayi with Morata, while Christensen comes on for Ampadu. Signs that Conte isn’t taking any chances, with his team holding onto their slender lead, but not with any great conviction. Meanwhile Norwich throw the dice by replacing Reed with the imaginative Hoolahan. Eight minutes, plus any stoppages, for the Canaries to save themselves. Drinkwater has a punt at goal from the best part of 30 yards. Nope. Chelsea might have ended their goal drought, but they’re not looking any more confident as a result. Up the other end, Oliveira has a pop from similar distance. Caballero claims with ease. “Pedro booked for simulation?! That’s what he gets for jumping the Gunn.” Ladies and gentlemen, please be upstanding for Peter Oh. Like many of the punters dependent on the District Line to get home, he’s here all week. A long hoick upfield, and Kenedy nearly tears clear down the Chelsea left. Fortunately for Norwich, Pinto is wise to what’s going on and snuffs out a potentially decisive attack. ♬ Kenedy, Kenedy, Ken-e-dy. ♬ Meanwhile Kennedy is also for Drew Goldie. “I’ll inject a bit of culture. When he went all punk/etc, Nigel Kennedy, precocious, young and an admittedly brilliant violinist, decided that he wanted to be called Kennedy. I can see why he thought that would work, and in those days (not now, I think, no-one actually cares any more) he worried that the name Nigel was tainted, but sadly the world moved backwards and eventually he reverted to the norm. I’m not going to look it up to tell you which, but he played the National Anthem on the violin in the ring before one of those IBO/WBA/WTF World Title boxing fights that took place in GB a while back. It was ludicrous, a real moment of - Whaaat? Hope things aren’t so dull that this gets a mention, but bless you for being there so that the rest of us don’t have to.” Things aren’t quite as clear cut at Stamford Bridge. The champions of England may be a goal to the good, but Norwich are asking some serious questions. Reed, cutting in from the left, tees up Maddison on the penalty spot. Maddison looks to slot powerfully into the bottom left, but Caballero spreads himself to save the day for Chelsea. And here’s a measure of Chelsea’s slight desperation: Pedro has been booked for a ludicrously brazen dive, having scampered past a prone and innocent Gunn, chasing a lost cause and throwing himself over some thin air. Aye, that’s surely a home tie against West Ham United secured for the League One leaders. Callum Elder makes it three, and the Latics can party like it’s 2013 all over again. The Cherries feel the Burn. Dan doubles Wigan’s lead, and the Premier League side are in a lot of trouble now. A shock on the cards. A game of pinball in the Chelsea area, set off when Caballero and Azpilicueta confuse each other. Amid the melee, Murphy, to the left of the D, whips a shot towards the bottom right. Luiz just about has the line covered, while the ball crashes off the right-hand post! Norwich hit the woodwork for the second time tonight. ... only for Wilfried Bony to almost immediately restore the Swans’ lead! And it’s all happening! Because in rainy south Wales, Diogo Jota brings the Championship leaders level ... Finally Chelsea score a goal! And it’s set up by that man Kenedy, who makes room down the left and fires a low and hard cross towards the near post for Batshuayi. The striker can’t miss with a simple sidefoot, and Norwich’s resistance is broken. Altogether now: ♬ Kenedy, Kenedy, Kenedy, Kenedy, Kenedy, Kenedy, Ken-e-dy for me. ♬ With absolutely nothing of note going on in west London, there’s time for me to mention Kenedy’s (admittedly inconsequential) cameo towards the end of the first half. First, he was caught rolling around the floor with Oliveira, attempting to land a very limp slap on the Norwich striker’s mush. On another day, etc. Then, moments later, from the ridiculous to the sublime, as he nutmegged Pinto with an exquisite dragback and flick, all in one smooth motion. What an all-round entertainer! ♪ ♫ Kenedy for me! ♬ They’re off again at Stamford Bridge, an unchanged Chelsea getting the ball rolling once more. Some midfield ping-pong. The BBC’s on-screen clock is jiggered again. It’s been that sort of night. No early second-half goals at Wigan or Swansea. We’ll be off again in a minute at Stamford Bridge, where the bollocking being delivered by Antonio Conte will be coming to a rousing climax right about now. Let’s not try to sugar-coat it ... that was a fairly miserable half of FA Cup football. Lucky there’s Sid Lowe to put a grin back on your face (with just a little help from a certain Brazilian showman). Chelsea have now gone three-and-a-half matches without scoring a goal. Norwich look very comfortable. Kenedy has a pop from distance. It’s not up to much. Up the other end, Murphy swings a cross in from the left but Luiz is behind that all the way. The half-time whistle can’t come soon enough. “I was sort of enjoying the Chelsea match, as I enjoyed my lunchtime cheese sarnie here in New Mexico,” reports Marie Meyer. “But the repeated viewings of the advertising hoardings saying NOTHING IS CERTAIN has cast me into an existential funk.” They should display that slogan on the displays at Fulham Broadway station as well. The League One leaders are 45 minutes away from a fourth-round home tie against West Ham United. Chelsea have been poor so far tonight, and Norwich are beginning to sense a potential upset. They’ve certainly grown in confidence, anyway, as their hosts get frustrated. Oliveira sends another shot whistling just over the Chelsea crossbar. Then Murphy is sent scampering into space down the left. He reaches the Chelsea box, and decides to go for goal instead of squaring it for Oliveira. His shot nearly hits the right-hand corner flag. Oliveira isn’t too happy, but Murphy deserved the chance to shoot after making a lung-bothering run. The Premier League strugglers go in leading, thanks to Ricky Villa tribute act Jordan Ayew. And now it’s Norwich’s turn to twang the crossbar! Batshuayi plays a dreadful ball across the face of his own area, gifting possession to Oliveira! The Norwich striker takes a touch and sends a looper over the straining Caballero and off the top of the bar! A few Chelsea hearts in mouths there, and that’s woken a sleepy Stamford Bridge up. Another free kick for Chelsea to the right of the Norwich D. This time it’s Willian’s turn, after Luiz’s earlier fluffed effort. He lamely sends an effort, meant for the top right, sailing high into the stand. This Chelsea-Norwich tie isn’t much of a game. Never has switching over to ITV / sitting on a stationary train outside West Brompton seemed so attractive. Chelsea hit the bar! Drinkwater pearls one from the edge of the box. It’s a beauty of a riser, heading into the top left at some pace. Gunn manages to get his fingertips onto the ball, tipping it onto the crossbar. Zimmermann hooks it away from danger. It was Chelsea’s tenth attempt on goal; Norwich have yet to trouble Caballero in any way. Kenedy releases Batshuayi down the left. But the striker can’t beat Gunn from a tight angle, and he’s offside anyway. We’re a quarter of the way into this game, and not a great deal has happened yet, the Azpilcueta near-miss apart. Norwich will be happy enough with the way things are going. Wigan’s opener was a fine effort, Colclough dancing his way around a rash Fraser challenge down the left, and nearly setting up Grigg in the centre. The ball broke to Morsy, who slotted low and hard into the bottom left from 12 yards, wrong-footing the stranded Boruc cleverly. Meanwhile Jordan Ayew’s goal for Swansea was an FA Cup dribble from the Ricky Villa playbook. The white shirts help. Luiz sidefoots gently over the net and straight into the hands of Gunn. Not a great effort. Gunn launches long in the direction of Oliveira, who is about to race towards the box with the ball. But Caballero comes out of his area, ushers Oliveira out to the right wing, and then hoicks the ball out of play, allowing his team-mates to catch up with play. Brave goalkeeping, to say the very least. Willian looks in the mood tonight. He powers down the inside-right channel and is upended by Vrancic, just to the right of the D. This is a free kick in a very dangerous position. Luiz is narrowing his eyes. He fancies it. And now Chelsea’s captain Azpilicueta lifts a pass down the inside-left channel to release Willian into the Norwich box. Willian screws a shot across the face of goal, and out on the right. He should have worked Gunn in the Norwich goal at the very least. He probably should have scored. Those Chelsea nerves didn’t jangle for long. The ever-excellent Azpilicueta spreads a gorgeous left-to-right pass for Willian on the wing. Willian earns a corner, and swings it into the mixer. Bakayoko eyebrows it towards the left-hand post, and Azpilicueta is an inch or so away from toe-poking the ball over the line. If he was half an inch taller. Chelsea are a wee bit nervous in these early exchanges. Kenedy creams a backpass towards his keeper Caballero, who does very well to trap the fizzing ball. He then rather spoils the effect by returning it towards Kenedy, over the wing-back’s startled head, and into the stand. Rather better for the home side is Drinkwater’s speculative shot from distance, which flies inches wide of the bottom right. Anyway, Norwich have got the ball rolling at Stamford Bridge. The atmosphere’s a bit hollow and tinny, as you’d expect with the stadium yet to fill with punters. The BBC have yet to fire up their on-screen clock, too, giving the entire evening a lovely old-school ramshackle feel. Nothing much to report in the early stages. Meanwhile at the Liberty, Jordan Ayew keeps the Premier League’s end up, drawing first blood for Carlos Carvalhal’s strugglers against the runaway Championship leaders. Sure enough, having announced that nothing was going on, Sam Morsy opens the scoring at the DW for the League One leaders. A shock? Well, let the record state that Wigan have led their Premier League opponents for all but 12 minutes of the 99 they’ve played so far in this tie. It’s on. A slow start to the evening’s action. No goals yet at either Swansea or Wigan, and no play at Stamford Bridge. But the teams are finally about to come out on the Fulham Broadway, even if quite a few fans are clearly still stuck on the District Line. A lot of empty seats still. Chelsea will play in blue, Norwich in yellow. The Liquidator blasts out of the PA, and we’ll be off in a minute! And now Daniel Farke has his say. “Today we are not the favourites, so we can enjoy this game. But we believe in cup competitions. We want to put in a good performance and get the best result we can. January is always a bit annoying: we have lost a key player in Alex Pritchard, who was pretty important for us. But you have to accept that and we have to find some solutions with the other lads. When you face an opponent with such a high individual quality in comparison to us, it is always necessary to create a special plan, and fulfil this plan with a special performance on the pitch. And we will need a bit of luck, and also perhaps Chelsea will not be at their best. We will see!” A word with Antonio Conte, who is asked whether he’s taking a chance with his line-up, having made nine changes from the side that drew with Leicester City in the Premier League at the weekend. “I don’t know, but for sure we do not have any other way. We are also in the other cup, in the semi-final. I think this is the right way, and I trust my players, every one. We want to win and go to the next round. We are conceding less, but we are not scoring a lot, and for sure we have to improve the quality of our finishing. I am in favour of VAR, it is a good option to solve some strange situations and mistakes. It is right this way.” The kick-off of the Chelsea-Norwich game has been delayed by 15 minutes due to “difficulties with public transport”. That one won’t be kicking off until 8pm. Huw Edwards, hanging about to read the late news on BBC1, will be cursing the District Line right now.

Welcome to a special edition of Clockwatch, as the third round of this year’s FA Cup comes to an exciting close. There are three ties yet to be settled ... Chelsea v Norwich City Swansea City v Wolverhampton Wanderers Wigan Athletic v Bournemouth ... and they’re all very interesting indeed. Seven-time winners Chelsea will be hot favourites to overcome mid-table Championship concern Norwich, though the Canaries gave them a good game at Carrow Road the other week, and Antonio Conte’s men aren’t exactly in the best of form, coming off the back of three goalless draws in a row. Chelsea usually swat aside their opposition in Stamford Bridge, but there’s always a Bradford City lurking around the corner in the cup, so you never know. The other two replays are fascinatingly balanced. Wolves haven’t won the cup since 1960, when they beat ten-man Blackburn in a final so mundane they were pelted with half-eaten fruit and scrunched-up pages of the match programme on their lap of honour. But they’re flying high in the Championship now, and will fancy their chances at Premier League strugglers Swansea. Meanwhile the 2013 winners Wigan are on the up again after a couple of dismal seasons. They’re top of League One, and really should have put Bournemouth to the sword in the original match at Dean Court, having been two goals up. A shock isn’t beyond anyone. All the matches kick off at 7.45pm. Extra time and penalty kicks may be required. It could be one hell of an evening. It’s on!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/17/mythconceptions-10-things-from-history-everyone-gets-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T15:32:27Z","webTitle":"From prudish Victorians to arrows in the eye  – 10 things from history everyone gets wrong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/17/mythconceptions-10-things-from-history-everyone-gets-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/17/mythconceptions-10-things-from-history-everyone-gets-wrong","fields":{"headline":"From prudish Victorians to arrows in the eye  – 10 things from history everyone gets wrong","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You wait years for a historical theory to be debunked and then three come around at once. So far this week, we have been told that the mysterious pestilence that wiped out 15 million Aztecs between 1545 and 1550 was not smallpox or measles, but enteric fever, that the Black Death was spread by fleas and lice from humans as well as rat fleas (a theory that, in truth, has been around for a while), and that the supposed origins of the phrase “whipping boy” (where surrogates were punished in place of young royals) seem to be false. In the spirit of debunking myths, here is my (in no way exhaustive) list of 10 historical “mythconceptions”. Mythconception #1: Harold took one in the eye at Hastings It seems like one of the most certain facts in English history, but accounts relating to Harold Godwinson’s death vary considerably. Some sources simply state that he was killed in battle. The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio, written shortly after the battle, goes a little further and details how he was lanced in the chest, beheaded and had his entrails “liquefied” with a spear. It was not until the 12th century that chroniclers started to claim that he was killed by an arrow through the eye. Scholars believe this is in part due to reports about the sophisticated archers present at the battle, but also because of the image believed to be Harold Godwinson on the Bayeux tapestry (which you will soon be able to see in the UK). Created shortly after the battle, the tapestry shows two figures under the inscription: “Harold the King is killed.” The first figure has an arrow in his head, the second is being trampled by a horse. Is the first man Harold? Is the second? Could the figures show Harold’s death in sequence? There is no consensus. Mythconception #2: We think we know the Queen of Sheba The Queen of Sheba is perhaps second only to Cleopatra when it comes to historical female notoriety. Yet, despite the power of her legend and the fact that she appears in Christian, Islamic and Jewish texts, little is known about the real figure behind the tale. In the biblical story, she is presented as an independent sovereign who visits King Solomon and brings with her gifts of gold, precious stones and spices. Some scholars believe she may have been the ruler of a kingdom called Saba, in what is now modern-day Yemen. Another theory anchors the Queen of Sheba to Ethiopia. According to the Ethiopian national epic Kebra Nagast, she was Queen Makeda who bore King Solomon a son, Emperor Menelik I, the founder of the Solomonic dynasty. Mythconception #3: Columbus ‘discovered’ America In popular imagination, the first European to “discover” America was Christopher Columbus in 1492. Yet there is evidence of a European presence in the Americas that precedes Columbus by several centuries. It is thought that the first European to discover America was a Norse explorer named Leif Erikson who voyaged from Greenland to what is now Canada in about AD1000. The theory is supported by carbon-dated archaeological discoveries at the site of L’Anse aux Meadows in Canada. Mythconception #4: Genghis Khan was an unsophisticated warlord In popular culture, Genghis Khan is remembered as a barbaric caricature of a brutal and hot-headed warlord. While it is certainly true that a mixture of conquest and bloodshed (some estimate he was responsible for up to 40m deaths) saw him preside over the largest land empire the world has ever known, the caricature suggests a lack of sophistication and forward planning which is at odds with reality. Genghis Khan used a combination of military might, ruthlessness, psychological warfare and terror to dominate his enemies – from lighting extra fires to give the impression of a larger army to promoting soldiers on merit rather than social standing. All of this was bound together by a sophisticated postal system that enabled him to gather and send information in record time. Mythconception #5: The Glorious Revolution wasn’t as glorious as advertised In 1688, William of Orange invaded Britain, overthrew his father-in-law, James II of England, and (in 1689) became joint sovereign of England, Scotland and Ireland. According to the 19th-century historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 was “bloodless, consensual, aristocratic and, above all, sensible”. Yet the truth of the revolution is far from bloodless. In Reading, 50 men were killed during an uprising. In Scotland, it exacerbated tensions between Lowlanders and the Highlanders, resulting in a number of rebellions and plots, and was linked to the Glencoe massacre. In Ireland, it provoked a land war – with William and James leading opposing sides at the Battle of the Boyne – which cost many people their lives. William’s ultimate victory entrenched centuries of religious division. Mythconception #6: The free press was a man’s game This is not so much a myth as a surprisingly unknown fact. For those interested in the history of journalism and printed news, a few names stand out. There is Johannes Gutenberg, the man who kickstarted the print revolution in Europe; there are Daniel Defoe and Jonathan Swift, the early innovators of professional journalism in Great Britain; and there are pioneers of investigative journalism, such as WT Stead. Ask who created the first daily newspaper, however, and you are likely to draw a blank. It was, in fact, established in 1702 by a woman named Elizabeth Mallet, who assembled and published it at her printing house on Black Horse Alley, near Fleet Bridge in London. In the first edition of what was known as the Daily Courant, Mallet wisely asserted that she would: “Relate only matter of fact; supposing other people to have sense enough to make reflections for themselves.” Mythconception #7: Women in medicine started with the Lady with the Lamp For many, the story of women and medical care begins with Mary Seacole and Florence Nightingale, who are rightly remembered for their pioneering work in reforming 19th-century nursing. But, as medical practitioners, women have a rich and varied history that stretches much further back than the 1800s – from the groundbreaking medical writings and practices of the 12th-century abbess Hildegard of Bingen and the astonishing career of Dr Laura Bassi, who held the position of professor of anatomy at the University of Bologna in 1732, to the hundreds of everyday medical practitioners conducting blood-letting, prescribing treatments, examining urine and conducting abortions and surgery during the early modern period. Mythconception #8: Napoleon knocked off the Sphinx’s nose Legend has it that when Napoleon’s expedition reached Egypt in 1798, some of his soldiers knocked off the Sphinx’s nose during a spot of target practice. It is a fun story, but untrue. Drawings of the Sphinx by a Danish naval captain named Frederic Louis Norden, created decades before Napoleon was even born, clearly show the Sphinx without a nose. Going further back, Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi commented on the missing nose in the 15th century. How the nose came to be destroyed is still debated, with theories ranging from weather erosion to iconoclasm. Mythconception #9: The Wright brothers were first to take to the skies The Wright brothers may lay claim to making the first controlled, heavier than air, manned flight in 1903, but they were by no means the first humans to take to the skies. Perhaps the most significant aviation breakthrough occurred in 1783 when the Montgolfier brothers successfully orchestrated the manned flight of a hot-air balloon in France. In a short space of time, manned hot air balloons became so ubiquitous that they were used for observational military purposes during the French Revolutionary wars. The first recorded use in this way occurred during the Battle of Fleurus in 1794 and “observational balloons” continued to be used during the American civil war and the first world war. Mythconception #10: The Victorians were prudes One of the most stubborn myths about the Victorians is that they were sexual prudes. This is, in part, thanks to contemporaneous ideas such as The Angel in the House and the very real legal inequality between men and women. However, Victorians were quite direct in affairs of the flesh. Queen Victoria wrote in her diary, for example, how Prince Albert had “clasped me in his arms and we kissed each other again and again”. As the historian Fern Riddell notes: “The Victorians were the opposite of prudes, this is the era of women publishing guides to contraception, and a belief that female sexual pleasure was paramount to a healthy and happy relationship. Too often we have only looked at the Victorians through legal, medicinal or scientific attitudes to sex, but every day sexual culture was vastly different.” Rebecca Rideal is a writer, freelance television producer and historian. Her book, 1666: Plague, War and Hellfire, is published by John Murray (UK) and St Martin Press (US)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/18/stop-brexit-second-referendum-britain-inequalities","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T08:00:08Z","webTitle":"Through humility and understanding, we can still stop Brexit | Andrew Adonis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/stop-brexit-second-referendum-britain-inequalities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/stop-brexit-second-referendum-britain-inequalities","fields":{"headline":"Through humility and understanding, we can still stop Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When President Macron meets Theresa May at the Franco-British summit at Sandhurst, the elite military academy, on Thursday, the vital “take away” for him is that Brexit is not a done deal. It can, and quite possibly will, be reversed by an increasingly likely referendum on May’s Brexit terms early next year – once the Brexit terms are clear, but before Britain is due to leave on 29 March 2019. It is essential, therefore, that Macron – who believes passionately in a strong and united Europe – continues to express his heartfelt support for continued British membership of the European Union, should that ultimately be the will of the British people. There are some in Brussels – and Paris and Berlin – who think there might be rich commercial pickings from Brexit. Macron and Angela Merkel rightly understand that the ill effects of European fragmentation and division far outweigh any immediate “beggar thy neighbour” advantages of EU nations gaining short-term business at the expense of Brexit Britain. Why I am I so confident that Brexit can be halted? When Theresa May became prime minister 18 months ago, she called for national unity behind the narrow Brexit majority of the June 2016 referendum. An unenthusiastic remainer from the outset, she morphed overnight into to a hard Brexiteer, foolishly hoping to appease the right wing of her party, and Nigel Farage of the populist Ukip insurgency, by supporting the idea of leaving the European customs union and single market. She failed to obtain that unity. “Hard Brexit” alienated not only the British business community, but swathes of moderate voters and almost all young people who fiercely oppose a “fortress Britain” which limits their ability to live and work across Europe. It also led to a crisis with the island of Ireland because of the near universal determination, in both the Republic of Ireland and the political parties in Northern Ireland, to avoid a “hard border”. In an attempt to regain the initiative, May called an early election last June. This completely backfired. In a dramatic turnabout determined in large part by younger voters, many of whom had not voted in the referendum, May failed to win the election and the opposition Labour party made big gains. Under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has been reluctant to commit to a firm position on Brexit, but the voters – especially the young – correctly believed Labour to be opposed to hard Brexit and in its “heart of hearts” a pro-European party, and this was a significant factor in the election outcome. Opinion polls have for months now shown a majority against Brexit and there has been a surge of support for continued EU membership among young and middle-aged people. The costs of Brexit have become apparent, with research suggesting that the value of Britain’s output is now around 0.9% lower than was possible if the country had voted to stay in the EU, which equates to almost exactly £350m a week lost to the British economy – an irony not lost on those who backed leave because of the claim made on the side of the infamous bus. There has also been a change of tone in national media coverage of Brexit. Until recently, Brexit was regarded as inevitable and the only issue was what terms Britain would secure from Brussels. Now Brexit is regarded as far from inevitable, and commentators have started pointing up the reality that, while Britain obsesses about Brexit, our European partners are going about their business of forging a single market in services and integrating their trade and economies intensively. A further important new theme is the “opportunity cost” of Brexit in terms of the distraction it represents from the real challenge facing Britain – namely, the social crisis afflicting the poorer cities and regions of the country, which voted heavily for Brexit in the referendum as a protest for being neglected by the elite in London. As the son of a poor Cypriot immigrant into Britain, I understand this profound sense of alienation. Having become a parliamentarian, and therefore part of the “establishment”, I admit our collective failure to understand the plight of those in this country who didn’t go to university and get well-paid jobs, and whose children are faced with declining living standards. We have let them bear the brunt of the rebalancing act between the west and China and the developing world which we call “globalisation”. It is a big mistake to patronise those who voted for Brexit as if they were ignorant or misinformed. Today’s social crisis is ours to own, with humility. The imperative, I believe, is for a radically reforming government in the tradition of Clement Attlee, Britain’s great postwar social democratic leader. It needs to work tirelessly to eradicate the inequalities magnified by the deregulation of the Thatcher era which, in key respects, persisted under Tony Blair and his successors. Britain is facing a crisis in housing, education, healthcare, employment and the incessant rise of social and regional inequalities. All this is feeding populism and undermining the fabric of our nation. I resigned last month as head of the National Infrastructure Commission in order to help create an agenda for a radical “Attlee mark two” government. I believe the British parliament and people can be persuaded to ditch Brexit before “D-day” of 29 March 2019, but it will only come from a new settlement at home. In the coming months, I will be touring Brexit strongholds around the country, not to convince but to listen and learn. Out of this, I hope, will come a programme to get Britain moving, as a credible antidote to Brexit and the scapegoating of “Brussels”and foreigners which underpins it. There are still 15 months until Britain’s departure from the EU, time enough to hold a referendum on the government’s proposed Brexit terms. I am confident that the British people, provided with a credible and ambitious social plan, will recognise that the balance of advantages lies in continued EU membership. The Brexit nationalist spasm can be stopped. But this is a time for humility, purpose and courage, not insults. And we need our European friends and allies to take the same approach. • Andrew Adonis is a Labour peer, former transport secretary"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/17/software-no-more-accurate-than-untrained-humans-at-judging-reoffending-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T19:00:28Z","webTitle":"Software 'no more accurate than untrained humans' at judging reoffending risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/software-no-more-accurate-than-untrained-humans-at-judging-reoffending-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/software-no-more-accurate-than-untrained-humans-at-judging-reoffending-risk","fields":{"headline":"Software 'no more accurate than untrained humans' at judging reoffending risk","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The credibility of a computer program used for bail and sentencing decisions has been called into question after it was found to be no more accurate at predicting the risk of reoffending than people with no criminal justice experience provided with only the defendant’s age, sex and criminal history. The algorithm, called Compas (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), is used throughout the US to weigh up whether defendants awaiting trial or sentencing are at too much risk of reoffending to be released on bail. Since being developed in 1998, the tool is reported to have been used to assess more than one million defendants. But a new paper has cast doubt on whether the software’s predictions are sufficiently accurate to justify its use in potentially life-changing decisions. Hany Farid, a co-author of the paper and professor of computer science at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, said: “The cost of being wrong is very high and at this point there’s a serious question over whether it should have any part in these decisions.” The analysis comes as courts and police forces internationally are increasingly relying on computerised approaches to predict the likelihood of people reoffending and to identify potential crime hotspots where police resources should be concentrated. In the UK, East Midlands police force are trialling software called Valcri, aimed at generating plausible ideas about how, when and why a crime was committed as well as who did it, and Kent Police have been using predictive crime mapping software called PredPol since 2013. The trend has raised concerns about whether such tools could introduce new forms of bias into the criminal justice system, as well as questions about the regulation of algorithms to ensure the decisions they reach are fair and transparent. The latest analysis focuses on the more basic question of accuracy. Farid, with colleague Julia Dressel, compared the ability of the software – which combines 137 measures for each individual – against that of untrained workers, contracted through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk online crowd-sourcing marketplace. The academics used a database of more than 7,000 pretrial defendants from Broward County, Florida, which included individual demographic information, age, sex, criminal history and arrest record in the two year period following the Compas scoring. The online workers were given short descriptions that included a defendant’s sex, age, and previous criminal history and asked whether they thought they would reoffend. Using far less information than Compas (seven variables versus 137), when the results were pooled the humans were accurate in 67% of cases, compared to the 65% accuracy of Compas. In a second analysis, the paper found that Compas’s accuracy at predicting recidivism could also be matched using a simple calculation involving only an offender’s age and the number of prior convictions. “When you boil down what the software is actually doing, it comes down to two things: your age and number of prior convictions,” said Farid. “If you are young and have a lot of prior convictions you are high risk.” “As we peel the curtain away on these proprietary algorithms, the details of which are closely guarded, it doesn’t look that impressive,” he added. “It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use it, but judges and courts and prosecutors should understand what is behind this.” Seena Fazel, a professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Oxford, agreed that the inner workings of such risk assessment tools ought to be made public so that they can be scrutinised. However, he said that in practice, such algorithms were not used to provide a “yes or no” answer, but were useful in giving gradations of risk and highlighting areas of vulnerability – for instance, recommending that a person be assigned a drug support worker on release from prison. “I don’t think you can say these algorithms have no value,” he said. “There’s lots of other evidence suggesting they are useful.” The paper also highlights the potential for racial asymmetries in the outputs of such software that can be difficult to avoid – even if the software itself is unbiased. The analysis showed that while the accuracy of the software was the same for black and white defendants, the so-called false positive rate (when someone who does not go on to offend is classified as high risk) was higher for black than for white defendants. This kind of asymmetry is mathematically inevitable in the case where two populations have a different underlying rate of reoffending – in the Florida data set the black defendants were more likely to reoffend – but such disparities nonetheless raise thorny questions about how the fairness of an algorithm should be defined. Farid said the results also highlight the potential for software to magnify existing biases within the criminal justice system. For instance, if black suspects are more likely to be convicted when arrested for a crime, and if criminal history is a predictor of reoffending, then software could act to reinforce existing racial biases. Racial inequalities in the criminal justice system in England and Wales were highlighted in a recent report written by the Labour MP David Lammy at the request of the prime minister. People from ethnic minorities “still face bias, including overt discrimination, in parts of the justice system”, Lammy concluded. The findings were published in the journal Science Advances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/21/blueprint-for-british-housing-2028-not-utopian-dream","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"A blueprint for British housing in 2028","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/21/blueprint-for-british-housing-2028-not-utopian-dream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/21/blueprint-for-british-housing-2028-not-utopian-dream","fields":{"headline":"A blueprint for British housing in 2028","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It is 2028, and in the old mill towns of east Lancashire terraced houses once destined for demolition have been rescued and renovated by residents who bought them for almost nothing. In the garden towns that have grown up in Bedfordshire you can walk to work through natural landscape. In Somerset, as in other shires, the next generation no longer has to move out, thanks to additions to villages planned by and for the people who live in them. London borough councils are jointly building tens of thousands of the homes the city needs each year. Luxury towers in London, Manchester and Birmingham, left empty after the Great Crash of 2019, have been colonised by squatters who have formed themselves into cooperatives. In the outer suburbs of the big cities, declining high streets have been revived through the construction of four- and five-storey apartment buildings. Nationally, house prices have stopped rising, with the result that they have gradually become more affordable as incomes go up. There are more homes to rent at affordable prices. Young families on modest incomes can once again expect to grow up in houses with gardens. New housing has been planned with shared open spaces, with schools and shops in walking distance, and with minimal need for cars. It is well designed, with good space standards, abundant natural light, accessibility for the disabled, durable finishes and net energy consumption of zero. Much is built to high standards in factories and transported in pieces to site. Some is hand-crafted. Some is built by its own residents, or comes in the form of weatherproof shells that they can finish off. There is choice. You can live in a terrace, a suburb, a tower, a bungalow, a mansion block, a concrete estate. Your home can be old or new, perhaps to a contemporary design by one of the nation’s many talented architects, or in one of the popular revivalist styles: neo-Georgian, neo-brutalist, neo-postmodern (the true early adopters now go for neo-Blairian, which with witty irony emulates the glassy, optimistic architectural style of the late 1990s). Renting is as attractive as owning. You can join one of the increasing number of co-housing projects, or buy or rent from one of many community land trusts. In this magical year, British housing is the envy of the world for its affordability and accessibility, for its planning, for the diversity and quality of its designs, for its intelligent use of new technologies in construction, for the multiplicity of tenures and of providers of housing – community groups, councils, housing associations, large and small developers. Delegations come from China, Canada and Sweden to study and learn. It did not happen easily, though: it was only after the Great Housing Riots, also of 2019, in which young doctors, teachers and solicitors linked arms with the ever more numerous homeless, that government was forced to take measures equal to the scale of the crisis. This sounds utopian, given the current state of housing in Britain – too scarce, too expensive, small and often badly designed – and its serious effects on social mobility, family life and economic growth. In London, average house prices are 14.5 times average income. It might take decades to save up enough for a deposit. For swathes of the population under 40, the prospect of ever owning a home has dwindled almost to zero. The idea that people might get homes they actually like, in which they might repose their identities and dreams, rather than the least bad option available to them, is fading. But the great, remarkable truth is that the ideas behind this imaginary future exist already – the tools are here now – and most are already being put successfully into practice. To be sure, their application tends to be small-scale and piecemeal. What is lacking is the concerted political will to turn valiant and thoughtful initiatives into a programme that could transform millions of lives across the country. This vision is not-utopian in another way, in that it does not rely on a single grand plan laid on a tabula rasa. Pretty much every week, if you write about housing and architecture, you get a press release announcing that such-and-such a bright idea – exceptionally tiny flats, factory-made houses, floating homes, homes built on stilts over railway lines or hospital car parks – will “solve the housing crisis”. Invariably, they will not, but collectively they might achieve something. This is partly because, since there will always be stresses and strains as housing strives to keep up with changing needs, it will never be “solved”. More important, housing is too complex a matter to be subject to a single magic bullet. What you need depends on who you are and where you are. The first prerequisite for getting to this promised land – hard, for market-loving conservatives – is to abandon the belief that big business always knows best. It is the mindset, clung to over decades, that has given us the Carillion catastrophe. The current housing quagmire is in large part due to the belief that volume housebuilders can, by themselves, provide homes in the numbers and at the cost the country needs. They do not, have not and never will. No amount of reduction in planning controls, the preferred option of libertarians, will change this fact. Other providers of housing – community groups, local government, housing associations and small-scale builders – will have to make good the shortfalls of the handful of companies that dominate British housebuilding. Hence the rising popularity of community land trusts, co-housing schemes and cooperatives, concepts that vary in detail but have in common the belief that a housing project is run by and on behalf of a community. Rather than selling homes for profit, surplus is recycled as community benefit. Typically, homebuyers pay only the part of the price that reflects construction cost rather than land value, with resales carried out on the same basis. The effect is that homes can be both bought and rented for considerably lower than market rates. There are many forms. On a sliver of land on the edge of Keswick, for example, there are two rows of houses, available for rent and part-ownership, that aim to counterbalance the way expensive holiday homes push locals out of the market. There are new terraces in Bristol and Bournemouth. There is the conversion of St Clements hospital in east London into 252 homes, with prices starting at £130,000. There is the Rural Urban Synthesis Society, which is planning to create housing in Lewisham, south London that will be partly built by its residents. In Barnet, north London there is a block of flats for a group called Older Women’s Co-Housing, which provides just what it says on the tin. In Leeds, there is Lilac – Low Impact Living Affordable Community – a five-year-old co-housing development of 20 homes where construction in straw bales and timber, and designs that capture and store the heat of the sun, result in heating bills of almost zero. Residents share green spaces such as allotments, a pond, play areas and a “common house”, for communal meals, laundry, parties, film screenings and whatever else they fancy. Alongside these ingenious, bottom-up approaches there is something government can do: wield a great British invention forged in the country’s imperial zenith in the late 19th century, and since emulated all over the world. I speak of council housing. It has been a triumph of recent years that local authorities, which had been banned from building homes since Margaret Thatcher’s time, have been allowed to do so again. The result, especially in some London boroughs, has been homes not only superior to those generally offered by the private sector, but which also, in some ways, provide the best council housing the country has ever had. One example is Dujardin Mews, the first council-led social housing created by the borough of Enfield in 40 years. Architects Karakusevic Carson have designed two rows of pitched-roof, house-y looking buildings that provide 38 homes and a sheltered common street. Another is Worland Gardens in Stratford, by Peter Barber, a brick terrace poised on a row of bouncy-looking parabolic arches. There are more, for example in the boroughs of Hackney, Camden and Brent. The success of such projects is partly a matter of building regulations and technology, which make them warmer, drier, safer and more accessible than ever before, and of the design standards imposed by the London mayor, which give them decent dimensions and outdoor space. It is also the effect of talented and dedicated architects, who squeeze the most out of the dry constraints of designing housing. If their works lack the heroism and creative invention of the best projects of the 1950s and 60s, they also lack that period’s architectural grandstanding. They are good at the things that matter most, like the success of shared spaces such as courts and gardens, the relationships of homes to streets, or getting homes and balconies to face the right way. And then there are the property developers, rarely popular, and less so since it was revealed that the chief executive of the housebuilders Persimmon received a bonus of £110m, with the assistance of profits probably boosted by the publicly funded “help to buy” scheme. (Help to buy what, it might be asked – private jets? Yachts? Mansions?) But here too are signs of creative thought. For some time, there have been architecturally intelligent developers producing small projects in the better-off parts of the country. I’d cite an enclave of well-lit, well-proportioned, well-sited houses that the architect Tony Fretton designed in Pewsey, Wiltshire, for the developer Baylight. Or the just finished 81-87 Weston Street in south London, by the developers Solidspace and the architects AHMM, whose split-level interiors make a home into an event, rather than an accumulation of square-footage. The agreeable mini-neighbourhoods made by Hab housing, the company of TV-personality-turned-developer Kevin McCloud, deserve mention too. If it might be objected that these smart, intriguing projects are for now but acupunctural pin-pricks on the flabby body of new housing, the same cannot be said of the new settlements being built by Urban and Civic, a company that deals in thousands of homes at a time. Their preference is for locations rarely discussed in the great housing debate – Rugby, or smallish Cambridgeshire towns called Alconbury and Waterbeach – which nonetheless feel the pressures of growth. The houses in these projects do not look architecturally radical, but Urban and Civic aim to plan the whole development as a coherent community and promise delightfulness in, for example, the schools they are building. The significance here lies in scale – housebuilders outside London have never before been able to build in these numbers at once – and forethought. It’s an exaggeration to say that a thousand flowers are yet blooming. But there are, thanks to people driven by public spirit, the profit motive, creative impulse and/or frustration, more and better ideas being put into practice in British housing than has been the case for decades. Importantly, they take many shapes. The doctrinaire modernists of legend once prescribed towers and slabs in all cases, and there are now dogmatic nostalgists who say everything must be formed around a street. But there are many different ways to live. As, it should be blindingly obvious, there should be: a quick survey of existing villages, towns and cities would show there are many shapes in which to live. One of these might be the garden city, influential invention of the late Victorian parliamentary clerk Ebenezer Howard, successfully realised in the form of postwar new towns, and proffered since the 1980s as a neat and nice-sounding way to get a lot of houses built in one place. It hasn’t proved so easy in practice – the “ecotowns” proposed by the last Labour government foundered on local opposition in the areas where they were proposed – but the actual, partly achieved development of North West Cambridge realises the basic principles of a garden city. It combines building and landscape, has easy access to nature, and puts homes close to work, schools and recreation. Its main departure from Howard is that it aims for higher densities than the old guru liked. If you are looking to minimise the use of land for building, this is for the good Should a garden city’s harmonies of buildings and nature be too enervating for you, or its well-considered reed beds and cycleways too tedious, you can still live in a dirty old city like London. You might choose a tower, a typology alternately celebrated and demonised, and the subject of renewed debate since the Grenfell disaster. In reality, a tower is intrinsically neither good nor bad, safe nor dangerous – it all depends how it’s done. You might then choose one of the 198 homes now nearing completion on the Colville Estate in Hackney, to the designs of Karakusevic Carson and Sir David Chipperfield, hexagonal 20- and 16-storey blocks that bear a superficial resemblance to the towers the borough of Hackney once liked to blow up. Thanks to the aforementioned advances in regulations and construction, and more considered design, they are likely to be more loved and long-lived. Or, if you want something between urban vibrancy and a garden city, you might find yourself in one of the intensified suburbs promoted by mayor Sadiq Khan and envisioned by the architects HTA under the title of “Supurbia”. The idea here is that more homes can be created in outer boroughs by increasing, in areas close to public transport, the prevailing two-storey building height to four or five. More people would mean more business for local shops and restaurants, which would give a shot in the arm to declining high streets. Lest anyone fear that the special character of roads of semi-detacheds is threatened, the majority of these suburbs, further from train stations, would stay much as they are. The past will also be part of the future: in a decade’s time most of us, bar an apocalypse, will be living in buildings that exist now. In which case, the rescue and renovation of the 19th-century Welsh Streets in Liverpool, after a long campaign by local residents and Save Britain’s Heritage, will be another model for this non-utopian utopia. There are plenty of Victorian terraced houses in ex-industrial cities. In London, they are worth six- or seven‑figure sums; in parts of the north and the Midlands, they have been threatened, as the Welsh Streets were, with demolition. They are a neglected national resource, an unmined seam of housing stock that could be recovered by selling cheaply to individuals prepared to give the energy needed for their restoration. If new housing follows the best current models it will be exemplary in its sustainability, its use of renewal energy and encouragement of walking, cycling and public transport over cars. We know how to do these things. It may even be that, by 2028, housebuilders will have realised the century-old dream of building homes like cars, in factories in large numbers, so that they can be erected quickly, efficiently and with the better quality that comes from making elements under cover rather than outdoors. Here, I’d like to point you towards some factory-built housing in which the insurance company Legal and General has decided to invest, but it’s not here yet. Instead, you might get a glimpse of a prefabricated future in Ladywell, in the London borough of Lewisham, where Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners have created a temporary residential development that can be picked up and moved around like a set of shipping containers. We can also hope that new homes will in some sense look good. In recent years, architects have perfected the art of building simple, well-proportioned, usually brick structures. In the capital it’s called New London Vernacular, an updated Georgian that is at best handsome and dignified, at worst inoffensive. There is, by now, a certain amount of carping from the aesthetes’ gallery that it’s getting a bit dull and predictable. Leaving aside the riposte that British cities used to be built in much the same way over decades and centuries, without ill effects, it can be hoped that these complaints will provoke some liveliness in future housing. Architects of the future might draw inspiration from Barber’s bouncy arches, or look back to housing projects in Manchester (2006) and Middlesbrough (2013) by the late lamented architectural practice FAT, whose symphonic-pop, cartoon-Dutch-style vernacular for now represents a road not taken in housing design. Of course, there’s a high chance that in 2028 we will still be lamenting the state of housing. Not all the bright ideas popping up now will prosper. Many are small-scale and marginal, and some will remain so. Nothing will be perfect and no one will be happy with everything (which is as it should be – imagine how dismal a country it would be if every house and every place were equally likable). Some might quake at those Hackney towers; others might find insipid the pitched-roof houses traded by Hab. Speaking for myself, I don’t want to live in a garden city: again, diversity of taste as it should be. Very little will change if government doesn’t give the same sort of financial and political support that it currently gives to high-speed rail lines. It is a small, positive gesture that the word “housing” has been added to the job title of the communities secretary, Sajid Javid. It is slightly more positive that a Conservative government has said it will fund both council housing and community building, albeit with sums inadequate to the scale of the task. Last October, a packed house at the Hackney Empire theatre in London, nearly 1,300 people gave a standing ovation to the 88-year-old architect Neave Brown after a lecture by the former local authority employee, who thought he had been forgotten. It was as moving as the often dry business of architectural talks could be. They were clapping because, as an architect working for Camden council in the 1960s and 70s, Brown had imbued public housing with thoughtfulness and creativity, which seemed to the youngish crowd about the best thing an architect could do. On 9 January this year, Brown died. His career was proof that we have been capable of such things in this country. His legacy should be that we do so again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/blog/2018/jan/17/tetrodotoxin-the-poison-behind-the-japanese-pufferfish-fugu-scare","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T13:28:19Z","webTitle":"Tetrodotoxin: the poison behind the Japanese pufferfish scare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/jan/17/tetrodotoxin-the-poison-behind-the-japanese-pufferfish-fugu-scare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/blog/2018/jan/17/tetrodotoxin-the-poison-behind-the-japanese-pufferfish-fugu-scare","fields":{"headline":"Tetrodotoxin: the poison behind the Japanese pufferfish scare","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Gamagori city in Japan was put on alert this week after toxic fish went on sale in a local supermarket. Pufferfish are considered a delicacy in Japan, often eaten raw as sashimi or cooked in soups. But if the fish are not carefully prepared they can be deadly. The supermarket in Gamagori failed to remove the liver from the fish before putting them on sale, and unfortunately the liver is one of the organs that can harbour the potent neurotoxin tetrodotoxin. In an effort to recall the potentially poisonous fish sold, loudspeakers across the city have been warning citizens of the danger; at the time of writing, three of the five packs of fish sold had been traced. The risks of eating pufferfish are widely known in Japan and the preparation and sale of the fish is tightly regulated. Nevertheless, poisonings happen every year but, because the symptoms are recognised, effective treatment can be very successful and fatalities are rare. However, pufferfish are widely distributed in tropical waters – and those consumers and those fishing outside Asian countries aren’t always aware of the dangers. The fish has also invaded new territories in recent years posing new problems, especially for fishermen not familiar with the species. Relatively recently, the fish have arrived in the eastern Mediterranean. The Suez Canal when it opened in 1869 brought dramatic changes to world trade. It also brought with it invasive species from the Red Sea: 925 non-native species have been recorded in the eastern Mediterranean since the opening of the canal. Migration of species in the opposite direction is relatively rare because the Red Sea is comparatively saltier and nutrient poor. One of the invading species, the silver-cheeked toadfish (Lagocephalus sceleratus), is a type of pufferfish most usually found in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The toadfish appears to be thriving off the Turkish coast and is of particular concern for several reasons. The main cause for concern is its economic impact. The silver-cheeked toadfish has strong teeth that it can use to bite through fishing lines and nets to get to the trapped fish. The damage to fishing gear is one thing, but the toadfish will then go on to feast on the abundance of food it finds inside the nets, meaning several kilos of the catch are often unsaleable. The financial losses to fishermen, who are already often on very low incomes, have been increasing in recent years. The other concern is the toxicity of the fish. Tetrodotoxin is found in several of the silver-cheeked toadfish organs, including the ovaries and liver. This powerful neurotoxin, when pure, can kill an adult human at a dosage of as little as two milligrams. It is far more potent a poison than arsenic or cyanide. In the body, tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channels that enable nerves to fire. It kills because nerves no longer trigger muscle movement controlling breathing and the victim suffocates. The toxin can also induce heart failure. There is no antidote and treatment is to support breathing artificially until the body excretes the toxin naturally. The treatment is very successful, with many people making a full recovery. There is no market for pufferfish as a delicacy in Turkey but the fishermen often eat the fish they catch because they can’t sell it elsewhere. A recent survey found that 38% of surveyed fishermen had consumed pufferfish and of that group, 11% had shown symptoms of intoxication. Clearly, messages about the dangers of this fish have not been getting through. The poison is not produced by the fish itself. Rather, it is a product of environmental bacteria that accumulate in the fish. Pufferfish are not the only species that can accumulate tetrodotoxin in this way. There is evidence that tetrodotoxin-contaminated seafood is spreading northwards – it has even been found off the southern coast of England. In this case it the fish involved wasn’t the silver-cheeked toadfish, as these are likely to remain in the eastern Mediterranean where the water is much warmer. Instead, tetrodotoxin was detected in molluscs – pacific oysters, native oysters, mussels and hard clams. The studies carried out so far have been small but substantial enough to highlight a potential problem and give hints of the causes and circumstances to be wary of. For example, not all species in all conditions are affected in the same way. Pacific oysters in the summer months from shallow, low saline sites show the highest levels of the toxin. Sea temperatures of at least 15°C seem to be needed to produce detectable levels of the toxin. Sea temperatures around the UK coastline have already shown an increase of over 0.7°C over the last 30 years. These temperatures are likely to increase, as is rainfall, due to global warming. The speculation is that conditions will become increasingly favourable for the tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. What is certain is that more studies need to be carried out to understand the nature of any potential problem and identify what can be done. Educating people about the dangers is certainly one important aspect of poisoning prevention. Screening can also help stop contaminated food from going on sale, but there might be ways of reducing the levels of toxin in the first place. For molluscs this may not be easy, but there are ways of removing the silver-cheeked toadfish from the Mediterranean and reducing the threat of poisoning there. Fishing for the toadfish and removing it from the environment is one method, but there are few incentives to do this. There is no market to sell the fish for food, so bounties have been proposed for each fish landed. Unfortunately, the amount offered per fish is unlikely to be enough to give financial incentive for Turkish fishermen to catch the species. Fortunately, there might be another market for this fish: medicine. Tetrodotoxin, whilst proving extremely dangerous in high doses, may have medical benefits in lower doses. Studies have shown that in some circumstances the toxin may relieve pain, particularly in cancer patients. At a time when we are increasingly looking for alternatives to opiates for pain relief, tetrodotoxin may be one candidate; it has even been shown to reduce the pain of withdrawal from opiates. It may ultimately be the case that this invasive species could provide valuable benefits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/24/i-didnt-tell-anyone-i-was-raped-at-university-im-not-alone","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T10:36:32Z","webTitle":"I didn’t tell anyone I was raped at university.

I’m not alone","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When I was a student, I was pressured into having sex. Like many others, when it happened I believed the entire experience was my fault and wasn’t serious enough to share. I said no to him multiple times, but I still felt responsible. I was left feeling dirty, violated and ashamed. I’d been on a social with other students. Towards the end of the night when I was tired and ready to leave, one guy offered to walk me home. He said he lived near me. It seemed safer than walking alone. When we arrived at my house, he asked if he could come inside and grab a glass of water. I felt a little unease but thought nothing of it. There was no sign it would end in him refusing to leave until we had sex. He seemed to gain more confidence with every sip of water. First came his requests to go to my bedroom, which I repeatedly rebuffed. Then came the inappropriate comments and suggestions that I was “asking for it” and “wanted it” because I let him in. As soon as I said I wasn’t interested, he became aggressive. He grabbed my arm so hard it left a mark that would linger for days. It was then that I really noticed our size difference, and the position I’d put myself in. I tried and tried to get him to leave. But he became more forceful. It was strange, feeling so vulnerable in my own home. Now, in the rational light of day, I could list endless ways I could have got him to leave. But in that cloud of fear, it felt as if yielding was my only option. He removed my tights. When he was done, he finally left. It turned out he didn’t live nearby, and his intention was never to get me safely home. My university experience was far from unique. As a student journalist, I wanted to find a way to highlight the scale of this epidemic, but finding people who were comfortable enough to publicly share their experiences was difficult. For the same reason I said nothing, no one wanted to report their stories. It’s not easy when the perpetrator is someone who shares your study, living and socialising spaces. Running into them is inevitable. It was then that I read about two rape survivors in India who anonymously shared details of their rapes through Snapchat. I was inspired to think about how we could use social media platforms to highlight and humanise the issue of sexual assault on campus. Revolt Sexual Assault is a national campaign I set up to expose the truth about the nature and extent of sexual assault and harassment experienced by students in the UK. Using Snapchat’s face-tracking software, students can choose to apply filters, facial and vocal obscuration to conceal their identity; this ensures each student feels safe and in control while sharing their stories. So far, I have heard too many stories of students waking up in the night to find that their partner or the person they went home with had been having sex with them while they were unconscious. These individuals often feel unable to call it rape. Alcohol and drugs are frequently used as an excuse or explanation. Or victims blame themselves. Approximately 90% of those who are raped know the perpetrator. With each testimonial, we hope to give survivors a voice, and to shed light on the “insignificant” details. From these stories – and my own experience – it is apparent that universities often don’t have the specialist policies in place for students to get the support they need. One student explained how, after being raped and bruised by another student, the university offered no support. “I reported it to the police and the university, but there wasn’t enough evidence so they dropped the case. The university sent me a letter regarding the ‘serious allegations’ I’d made against another student. It made me feel like I was the criminal. I had to change gyms; I’ve never been on the university ski trip. The way I was treated was revolting.” Another student told us about walking home with a friend after a night out. “I was never intending for anything to happen but he kept pushing me for more. I said no to him but he replied: ‘It’s not rape, you want this’.” We have launched a national survey on this issue in partnership with The Student Room. It will produce robust statistical evidence, revealing the nature and extent of sexual assault and harassment experienced by students. The data will help us to campaign for a uniform national policy response, and compel university communities to accept the ugly, uncomfortable truth. I hope that by setting up this campaign we can create a new minimum standard of care for students who experience sexual violence. Universities need a separate policy for sexual violence disciplinary hearings – currently, many apply the same procedures for cheating in an exam to a rape allegation. Consent and bystander training for students should be compulsory, and universities need specialist support in place: many institutions have no trained staff or specific policy for sexual violence, and the report rates are shockingly low. Those who have shared their experiences with #ItsRevolting found that taking part helped them come to terms with what happened, and believed they had helped others in doing so. One participant told me: “Telling my story anonymously has been so empowering and I’ve felt safe and in control the whole time.” Those affected by rape or sexual abuse can contact Rape Crisis on 0808 802 9999 (England and Wales) or on 08088 01 03 02 (Scotland)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/17/lindsay-riddoch-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T13:53:50Z","webTitle":"Lindsay Riddoch obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/17/lindsay-riddoch-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/17/lindsay-riddoch-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Lindsay Riddoch obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My daughter, Lindsay Riddoch, who has taken her own life aged 24, was an ardent and articulate advocate for better mental health services. She was a fiercely independent thinker and debater who was intent on exposing injustice, and if she saw something wrong she would try to put it right. She often talked about becoming a politician in later life. Lindsay was born in Edinburgh and went to Boroughmuir high school in the city, where she was an accomplished diver, trampoliner and trombone player, and where she fixed up work experience in the Scottish parliament and with the Scottish government. At 16 she won a place at the UWC Atlantic College near Cardiff, where she gained an international baccalaureate. While she was there she joined a youth delegation to the global climate summit at Cancún in Mexico in 2010. She also set up a website to help teenagers with mental health problems and persuaded the comedian and actor Stephen Fry to help promote it on social media. She then studied history at Soas University of London, specialising in Islam and the Middle East, learning Arabic, taking part in student politics and graduating with a first class degree in 2014. At university she also volunteered at London Nightline, a charity offering confidential support to students, and helped out at the Westminster office of the Green party MP Caroline Lucas. Her first job was with the digital activist group 38 Degrees, where she campaigned for MPs to become more accountable. In 2015 she joined the NHS, working with mental health service users in Camden, north London, and then became a service development officer with the mental health charity Rethink. Her career options seemed manifold and she had a host of loyal friends. In July 2016 she admitted herself to Highgate Mental Health Centre, and later moved to Cornerstone House in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire. There she ended her long, difficult struggle with serious and inadequately understood mental health problems. In her last two years poems poured out of Lindsay; they were angry, personal, political, dark and funny, lucidly probing her demons and examining the world at large. She performed some of them at the Roundhouse in London and posted others online. Lindsay is survived by me and her mother, Fiona Riddoch, and by her sister, Robyn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/10/mulch-soil-gardening-alys-fowler","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-10T11:00:16Z","webTitle":"Itching to get digging in the garden?

Fight the urge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I can never get over how much the desire to see clean, neatly dug winter beds is at odds with what the soil needs. Soil always wants to be blanketed, not left bare and exposed to the elements. It wants the warmth of mulch, or the cover of a crop, be it green manure or winter weeds. Still, I recognise that winter is the time to get on with planning and creating a garden, and beds need to be ready by spring. I’d advocate a no-dig policy every time for this. If you’re starting from scratch, put down cardboard and a thick layer (10-15cm deep) of well-rotted mulch, farmyard manure or compost. Job done, pass go and do not dig. The ideal vegetable bed is 1.2 metres wide, with a 60cm path between beds; any smaller and you’ll find it hard to push a wheelbarrow along the path. This means you should be able to reach the middle of any bed from either side and thus never have to walk on it. Soil compaction is the enemy of good root growth, particularly with annuals, so the less you have to stand on it to work, the better. I do realise that some people just love to dig and nothing is going to persuade them otherwise. But even if you love your spade, you must heed the soil’s needs and never work it when it’s wet. This is particularly important if you have even a trace of clay in your soil. Wet, heavy clay compacts, and every spade or heavy movement is remembered and played out in the summer, when that clay hardens and reminds you that it didn’t want to be stepped on – it becomes impenetrable to all but the most persistent of roots, namely dandelions and docks. If you have to wheel heavy barrows of, say, mulch, then use boards, planks or garden track over beds. Garden track is a movable pathway that you unroll and allows you to work on lawns or beds without compacting or damaging the soil, by distributing the load. It is usually made of plastic, though in Geoff Hamilton’s day it was made from old offcuts of wood and chicken wire, if you’re that sort of handy. Finally, don’t hoe off any winter weeds right now; they may bother you, but they are doing just as good a job as mulch in protecting the soil from erosion, compaction and the winter chills. Treat them like green manure and either smother them with mulch or hoe them off in spring, preferably before they flower and set seed, letting them rot back into the soil all the fertility they’ve stored over the winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/17/bbc-equal-pay-row-culture-secretary-urged-to-intervene","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T18:05:04Z","webTitle":"Culture secretary urged to intervene in BBC equal pay row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/17/bbc-equal-pay-row-culture-secretary-urged-to-intervene","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/17/bbc-equal-pay-row-culture-secretary-urged-to-intervene","fields":{"headline":"Culture secretary urged to intervene in BBC equal pay row","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 70 MPs have called for the culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, to force the BBC to allow female staff who have campaigned about equal pay to talk about the issue on air. A letter signed by the group of MPs warns Hancock that preventing discussion could have a “chilling effect”. It urges the government to use powers in the royal charter to “give a direction to the BBC to ensure the freedom of speech of staff in pursuit of equality of opportunity”; this would provide clarity about how the government expects organisations to respond to equal pay claims, the MPs say. The issue of BBC pay was dragged back into the open last week when Carrie Gracie resigned as China editor and accused the broadcaster of a “secretive and illegal” pay culture. The BBC faced accusations of censorship when prominent female broadcasters, such as Radio 4’s Jane Garvey and Winifred Robinson, were told they could not report on the equal pay row if they had publicly expressed support for Gracie or a campaign for equal pay at the broadcaster. The letter to Hancock was orchestrated by the Labour MP Stella Creasy and is signed by another 72 MPs from Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru. It says: “These reports that members of staff at the organisation have been told that they cannot comment on these matters in public without this affecting their duties directly impacts on their capacity to be able to seek equal pay. “Freedom of speech is vital to tackling these often difficult and sensitive issues – the debate over the BBC’s handling of this situation will set the tone for employers across the country in how they respond to equal pay claims. “Without action to protect the right of all staff to discuss this matter, their conduct could have a chilling effect on both the employment rights of staff at the BBC as well as wider public perceptions about the appropriate conduct of employers in responding to the law on equal pay.” The MPs say Hancock has the power to intervene in the issue through the BBC’s royal charter – the agreement that protects its independence, defines its public responsibilities and sets the licence fee it receives. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission has already said it will write to the BBC to seek answers about allegations of pay discrimination, but the MPs claim the government has cut funding to the organisation and left it “under-resourced and grossly underfunded”. Creasy said the BBC’s response to the pay row “could well influence how many other employers respond too”. She told the Guardian: “That’s why we’re asking the secretary of state to turn words into deeds and use his direct powers to ensure that men and women within the corporation can express their views on this equally and defend their right to free speech in the workplace.” Hancock told ITV’s Peston on Sunday that “we have got to have equal pay for equal jobs” and that the BBC “has a special responsibility to lead and to be a beacon because this issue is broader than the BBC”. In a statement, the DCMS said: “It is clearly important that the BBC remains operationally and editorially independent from government. However the secretary of state has been very clear that the BBC must be a beacon for the British values of fairness that this nation holds dear. “That includes fair pay and equal pay for equal jobs – it’s not just about levelling women’s pay up but reasonable pay at all levels. The BBC must act, because the brilliant women working at all levels of the BBC deserve better.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We will be publishing a report and setting out a range of further actions shortly. People should see that work and action before judging our approach. “Meanwhile we will continue to report the story across our airwaves. Whilst we’re always mindful that presenters and correspondents need to be aware of our impartiality rules, no other media organisation would have covered a story about itself in such great depth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
