The tech company plans to invest $1bn on original TV programming over the next year and is reportedly in discussions with the Culver Studios, close to the Culver City offices of Beats, which it acquired from co-founders Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine for $3bn two years ago. The studio, which has been owned by RKO, Howard Hughes and Cecil B DeMille, has more than a dozen soundstages for TV and film work. However, Apple is mainly looking for office space, according to the Financial Times. Moving the management of its original content division to such a status symbol location would mark Apple’s latest signal that it is to ramp up its challenge to streaming giants Netflix and Amazon as well as traditional TV broadcasters. Apple made no comment on the talks and Culver Studios was unavailable for comment at the time of publication. In June, Apple recruited Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg from Sony as its new TV chiefs. The pair have been responsible for striking a £100m co-production deal with Netflix to make The Crown, and have overseen production of hit shows including Breaking Bad and The Black List. Apple has so far only dipped its toe in original programming, striking a deal to spin James Corden’s popular Carpool Karaoke segment from his late night TV show in the US into a 16-episode series featuring stars such as Will Smith. There was also Planet of the Apps – a sort of Dragon’s Den featuring Gwyneth Paltrow, will.i.am, Jessica Alba and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk on a panel that sees app developers competing for funding – which Apple Music made available in June. In development are documentaries about Sean “P Diddy” Combs and Clive Davis, as well as a six-part series on Dr Dre. Given Apple’s huge resources – it has a stock value of $815bn, almost twice Jeff Bezos’s Amazon ($474bn), five times Disney ($168bn), and more than 10 times Netflix ($77bn) – its intent to enter original programming makes it a serious new player in the TV market. Netflix has committed $6.6bn to buying and creating TV programmes and it makes about 1,000 hours of its owns shows annually; HBO, the Game of Thrones and Sopranos maker, spends about $2bn a year. Amazon, which paid up to £150m to lure former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, is estimated to spend about $4.5bn annually on its Prime Video service. Analysts had speculated that Apple could buy Disney to bolster its content strategy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/01/ann-jellicoe-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T15:46:56Z","webTitle":"Ann Jellicoe obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/01/ann-jellicoe-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/01/ann-jellicoe-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Ann Jellicoe obituary","bodyText":"There were two distinct, equally significant, phases to the career of the playwright and director Ann Jellicoe, who has died aged 90. Both were rooted in her dedication to making good theatre of text, and good text of theatre. This led to a slightly conflicted attitude towards her profession that was only fully resolved when she broke clear of the Royal Court – where, in George Devine’s game-changing English Stage Company of the late 1950s, she was a much favoured and respected linchpin, writing two plays that are part of a legendary canon in Sloane Square, The Sport of My Mad Mother (1958) and The Knack (1962). The second of these made an unusual, quirky star of Rita Tushingham on stage and in Richard Lester’s “swinging London” 1965 screen version, which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes. It was only after leaving London for Lyme Regis, Dorset, in 1975 with her husband, the photographer Roger Mayne, and starting what was to become a highly influential career in community theatre that, for the first time, Jellicoe said: “I didn’t feel a divided person.” She wrote a play about the Monmouth rebellion, The Reckoning (1978), for the local comprehensive school, which was staged, with a cast of 80 amateurs and a few professionals, by the University of Exeter, with financial support from local trusts and charities, as well as the local council, which supplied a large banner and plenty of chairs. In 1979 she set up the Colway Theatre Trust to further explore doing plays in the community, producing more than 40 large-scale pieces, including those of major playwrights – David Edgar, Howard Barker, Fay Weldon, Nick Darke – with a south-west of England historical connotation. Subjects included a female brewer’s confrontation with a crusading Dorchester vicar during the cholera epidemic of the 1850s (Edgar’s Entertaining Strangers) and social unrest in the post-Napoleonic industrial slump (Barker’s The Poor Man’s Friend). In 1985 she passed the baton to Jon Oram whose renamed Claque Theatre continues to evolve spectacular “living history” community epics, not only in Devon and Dorset but all over Britain. Jellicoe was born in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, and grew up there and in Saltburn on the north-east coast, attending Polam Hall school in Darlington and then Queen Margaret’s, Escrick Park, near York, before going to London and the Central School of Speech and Drama as the second world war ended. She was an unhappy child, her father, John Jellicoe, an officer in the armed forces, and mother, Frances (nee Henderson), having separated before she was two. The idea of being an actor was her solace from the age of four. She took dancing lessons and supervised plays and charades throughout her school days. Between 1947 and 1951, after Central, she worked in London and the regions as an actor, stage manager and director. She made a study of the relationship between acting and theatre architecture before founding and directing the Cockpit theatre club to produce experiments on an open, Elizabethan-style stage, the first in London for 400 years. She was invited back to Central in 1953 as a teacher of acting. She stayed for three years while submitting plays, one of them, The Sport of My Mad Mother, to the Observer playwrights’ competition organised by Kenneth Tynan. The play, awarded third prize jointly with NF Simpson’s A Resounding Tinkle, featured a bunch of wild boys given to casual violence, a couple of outsiders and a spiritual leader who gives birth to the creative future. It was, said Tynan, a tour de force that belonged to no known category of theatre, but it was booed off by critics and public alike, and reluctantly withdrawn by Devine after only 14 performances. Devine, who co-directed the play with Jellicoe, recognised in her, said the critic Irving Wardle, a tough professional competence as well as an experimental writing talent. He regarded himself as her “mad uncle” and invited her to join his writers’ group (along with Arnold Wesker, John Arden, Keith Johnstone and Wole Soyinka). She continued writing and also translating, first Ibsen’s Rosmersholm for Devine, starring Peggy Ashcroft and Eric Porter in 1959, and then, in the West End in 1961, Ibsen’s The Lady from the Sea, starring Margaret Leighton, Vanessa Redgrave and John Neville. Her 1964 translation (with Ariadne Nicolaeff) of Chekhov’s The Seagull for the English Shakespeare Company at the Queen’s was an unforgettable occasion, starring Devine as Dorn, Ashcroft as Arkadina, Peter Finch as Trigorin, Redgrave as Nina, and Peter McEnery as Konstantin. By then, she had scored a bull’s-eye with The Knack, which she co-directed with Keith Johnstone; James Bolam, Julian Glover and Philip Locke were the three men circling Tushingham as the girl who comes to the house they share. The play was an international hit and was directed in New York by Mike Nichols. When William Gaskill took over as the Court’s artistic director in 1965, following Devine’s death, he opened with Jellicoe’s production of her own Shelley, a documentary-style biography of the poet wrestling with notions of goodness, the rejection of creative artists and the place of women – Shelley was portrayed as a misogynist. Described by one critic as “a strange, almost wilfully unappealing play”, it was followed by Simpson’s The Cresta Run and two other equally snubbed but embryonic classics – Edward Bond’s Saved and John Arden’s Serjeant Musgrave’s Dance. After her first play bombed, Jellicoe had nonetheless been approached by the Girl Guides Association to write a spectacle for a cast of hundreds. In The Rising Generation, girls were urged to reject men and claim Shakespeare, Milton and Isaac Newton as female. Unsurprisingly, the Girl Guides rejected the play, but it surfaced briefly as a Sunday night show “without decor” at the Court in 1967 – with three actors and a mere 200 children – in what Jellicoe described as “the most successful first night I ever had”, thus leading her to think more along the lines of plays in the community. She briefly took a more commercial tack in a West End comedy, The Giveaway (1968) at the Garrick, in which another plot of sexual siege-laying was wrapped in an absurdist scenario of a family who had won a 10-year supply of breakfast cereal contained in eight huge on-stage crates. After a break to have two children, she was invited back to the Court as literary manager, and directed there Paul Bailey’s A Worthy Guest (1974) as well as a series of children’s plays (“Jelliplays”), before decamping for good to Dorset with her family. She wrote several community plays for her new company and a fine practical handbook, Community Plays: How to Put Them On (1987). Her productions always had a core of professionals – usually the writer, director, composer and designer – but everything else was done by and with the community. After stepping down from running the Colway Theatre Trust, she still wrote for the organisation as it widened its geographical net beyond the south-west: Changing Places (1992) was a play about suffrage in Woking, Surrey, and its local heroine, the composer Dame Ethel Smyth. Her first marriage ended in divorce. Mayne, whom she married in 1962, died in 2014. She is survived by their daughter, Katkin, and son, Tom. Michael Coveney David Edgar writes: In 1984, I was invited to Lyme Regis, Dorset, to see Ann Jellicoe’s fourth community play, The Western Women. I’d known of this work but was unprepared for its overwhelming impact in practice. I was asked to be the writer on the next-but-one play, and accepted immediately. Ann was aware of the sensitivities of the communities she worked with, but also of the likely politics of the playwrights she would attract. She told me that, if I had to make the play about wicked capitalists, it would be best if they came from out of town. In fact, we came up with a story of a titanic struggle between a pioneering woman brewer and a fundamentalist parson. Entertaining Strangers: A Play for Dorchester was performed in St Mary’s, the church the vicar founded, with more than 100 community actors. The play was remounted at the National Theatre in 1987, with Judi Dench and Tim Pigott-Smith in the leads. The revival fed a myth that Ann’s method was essentially colonial, airlifting in her fancy theatrical friends to impose their vision on the community and move on. In fact, Dorchester is the best possible example of the long-term impact of the form: my play has been followed by six more, with a seventh (by Stephanie Dale) coming up. The Ansell family – three generations, participating in every Dorchester play so far – is a prime example of how Ann’s community plays changed lives. • Patricia Ann Jellicoe, playwright and director, born 15 July 1927; died 31 August 2017 • This article was amended on 4 September 2017.

Economists had expected the US to add about 180,000 jobs over the month. But the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a marked slowdown on the previous month, with a rise of 156,000 jobs. The figure for July was revised down to 189,000 from an initial 209,000, while for June number was reduced from 231,000 to 210,000, compounding the weaker picture. The figures made for disappointing reading for Donald Trump, who hasput jobs and wage growth among the top priorities for his administration. There was a modest rise in the unemployment rate from 4.3% to 4.4%, as the number of unemployed people in the US economy stood at 7.1 million. Average hourly earnings rose by 3c to $26.39 (£20.34), after rising by 9c in July. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 65c, or 2.5%. The August jobs report showed the rate of growth in US employment to be below the average of 176,000 per month so far this year – the average gain in 2016 was 187,000. The services sector had the weakest growth, as employment increased by only 95,000, little more than half the size of gains made in recent months. The August report, however, may have included statistical anomalies that will be ironed out in future. The data will probably be revised a couple of times and may end up showing a brighter picture, according to Ian Shepherdson, founder of research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. “We expect a rebound in September,” he added. While the figures for last month were disappointing, there is potential for an even weaker outlook for the US economy, should damage from Tropical Storm Harvey continue to linger. The Department of Labor said there was “no discernible effect on the employment and unemployment” rate from the storm last month because the survey was compiled before it hit. While it could still be too early to do a full damage assessment, Harvey has the potential to have a negative effect on the US economy in the third quarter. The storm means there will be zero economic output in the affected states of Texas and Louisiana, which could hurt the wider economy. With a weaker outlook for employment, the August jobs report adds an additional problem for the Federal Reserve to consider as it weighs a further interest rate rise before the end of the year. There are still some expectations for an increase in December, although a slowing jobs market, the fallout from Harvey and low levels of inflation could build a case for maintaing the status quo. Dennis de Jong, managing director at currency trading firm UFX, said: “A stronger than expected reading would have made that almost a certainty, now it’s very much up in the air.” Investors have been looking for a better sense of the next Fed policy move by it chair, Janet Yellen, who gave away few clues last month at a meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. There are further potential pitfalls ahead, as Washington faces a showdown over the debt ceiling, a statutory limit on how much money the US can borrow that can only be increased by Congress, which could rattle markets, and delay action by the Fed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2017/oct/11/paying-to-stay-safe-why-women-dont-walk-as-much-as-men","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"'Paying to stay safe': why women don't walk as much as men","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/11/paying-to-stay-safe-why-women-dont-walk-as-much-as-men","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/oct/11/paying-to-stay-safe-why-women-dont-walk-as-much-as-men","fields":{"headline":"'Paying to stay safe': why women don't walk as much as men","bodyText":"Vivi Restuviani would try to make herself look as invisible as possible when she was out at night in her former hometown of Semarang, Indonesia. “If you looked at me from behind, you’d probably have thought I was a boy,” she says. One night, Restuviani was taking her regular short walk home, swamped anonymously in an oversized hooded sweater. As she walked along the main drag, she heard a motorbike approach; suddenly its rider was in her face. “He was trying to talk to me but I knew this guy wanted something else,” she recalls. “You know there’s that moment when you are being harassed, and you stop being surprised or shocked and just scream? Well, that isn’t what happened. I said nothing and then he started groping me.” Finally, Restuviani managed to pull away and run towards a security guard, while her attacker sped off unchallenged into the night. “I was trying so hard to scream,” she says. “I tried so hard – but I couldn’t.” In almost every country in the world, women walk disproportionately fewer steps each day than men, according to a recent Stanford study which analysed the smartphone data of 717,527 people worldwide over 68 million days of activity. While media coverage focused on the overall results (generating headlines such as Do YOU live in the world’s laziest country?), the study shed new light on an important health inequality issue. The researchers found that high “activity inequality” – where a country has a wide gap between those who walk a lot and those who walk very little – was a strong predictor for a nation’s obesity levels among the 47 countries studied. Furthermore, the “gender step gap” between men and women was typically widest in high-obesity countries – putting women at greater risk of exercise-related health problems later in life. In Sweden, the researchers found virtually no gender gap, with men and women walking roughly the same average number of steps each day. Yet in Qatar, women walked 38% fewer steps a day on average than their male counterparts. “If one person doesn’t walk a whole lot, maybe they’re lazy. If hundreds of thousands of people – and especially women – don’t walk a lot? That’s not an individual laziness problem, that’s a societal problem,” says the Stanford study’s lead researcher, Tim Althoff. “One thing that is clear is that, on average, women are not as tall as men – so that typically translates into shorter legs. If you are shorter, you actually have to take more steps.” There could be many reasons for the gender step gap, Althoff says, from differences in cultural gender roles to urban environmental issues (the researchers found the difference in step counts between men and women diminished greatly in cities with higher “walkability” scores). However, talk to women all over the world about their walking habits, and one issue comes up again and again: personal safety. Frightened off her feet In Washington DC, non-profit worker Hannah Geyer has all but given up her regular 15-minute walk through a park to and from the venue where she performs in a variety show. The groups of men who loiter in the park have literally frightened her off her feet. “They would get really, really, really close to me,” Geyer says. “It’s one thing if you’re yelling at me from across the sidewalk, because I can just be, like, ‘whatever’ and keep walking. But physically putting their bodies into my path or getting into my bubble when I don’t answer or look irritated at them – which is all the time ... It was [them saying]: ‘I’m gonna stop you from walking where you’re walking.’” Now Geyer takes ride-share cars, paying US $5-10 each time. But she is adamant that if she still felt safe enough to walk, she would. “I’ve noticed that, because I tend to take cars such short distances, guy friends will go: ‘Oh my god, you should have just walked, you’re so lazy’,” Geyer says. “I think it’s funny that to men it can come across as lazy, when it’s so obvious to women that it’s self-preservation. I’ve never got that comment from a woman.” Feeling forced to use transport instead of walking makes safety a privilege, according to Stop Street Harassment founder Holly Kearl. Women can only choose not to walk if they have the financial means to access transport – which means for teenage girls in particular, cost can be a barrier to safety. A report released last month by the Children’s Society showed one in three girls aged between 10 and 17 in Britain said they felt afraid of being followed by strangers. Multiple girls described being “beeped” at while in their school uniforms by men driving past. “We know so many women feel they have to take public transit, or pay for a taxi, or drive and pay for parking wherever they’re going,” says Kearl. “There are definitely ways in which women are paying to stay safe.” PhD student Natalie Jester says she sometimes “feels like prey” after dark in central Bristol. She will regularly spend her wages on a cab or bus home to avoid walking in the centre, where she can feel threatened by the groups of men milling about drinking. “I feel really resentful that I don’t feel safe enough to walk around my city, to the point that I have to pay extra money,” Jester says. “I don’t think men really understand the degree to which women feel unsafe.” Women may also be paying with their health. According to Public Health England (PHE), English people are 20% less active today than they were in the 1960s – with each person walking, on average, 24km (15 miles) less per year. And the Stanford researchers found that UK women took 1,074 fewer steps on average than men every day – adding up to almost 400,000 fewer steps a year. According to PHE’s One You walking campaign adviser, Professor Sir Muir Gray, this leads to further health inequalities, owing to the sedentary nature of many jobs today. “Poor people ... are now often less active than wealthy people, because poor people work more often at these dreadful desk jobs,” Gray says. “In general, that contributes to the social divide.” The threat of harassment Ever since she was assaulted in Semarang, Vivi Restuviani has had to work hard at regaining the confidence to walk in public alone. The few hundred yards she walks as part of her daily commute in Jakarta, her new home city, used to come with an unwanted chorus. But the cat calls have begun to fade – which she attributes to her new defence weapon: high visibility. “I have blue hair so I think the guys that pay attention think: ‘Oh, the girl with the blue hair always talks back.’ Now when I walk to the train station, no one dares say anything to me.” Dea Basori also lives in the sprawling capital of Indonesia – the country whose people walk the least, according to the Stanford study. On average, women there took 611 fewer steps than men each day. But Basori rejects the “lazy” label, saying it is not only Jakarta’s heat, pockmarked roads and poor public transport access that keeps them from walking. The threat of harassment can, she says, stop women in their tracks. Every day, the dentistry student navigates a traffic jam so notorious it has its own word in Bahasa: macet. But she says it is the final, five-minute walk to her class that she dreads most. “It’s just so annoying,” she says of the incessant cat-callers who motivate her to keep that daily walk as short as possible. “The construction workers, the motorbikes, people in the cars – they all honk. It’s always gonna be there, and it’s less than 100 metres – but I still have to find the motivation to walk … it’s exhausting.” Are you a woman who feels unable to walk as much as you’d like?

The official exploratory study also shows that young black people are more likely to be identified with “gang concerns” and be considered a risk to others when being sentenced than any other ethnic group. The research was released on Friday, before next week’s expected publication of the final report of the landmark review into the treatment of black people by the criminal justice system. The report, commissioned by Downing Street and carried out by the Labour MP David Lammy, is expected to include strong recommendations for action. The Lammy review was given a political boost by Theresa May when she pledged to fight racial injustice during a speech on the steps of No 10 after she became prime minister last year. “If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white,” she said. An interim report by Lammy last November confirmed that people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were more likely to be jailed for some crimes than those who were white. It revealed ethnic disparities at many stages of the criminal process, including arrest, charging, prosecution and imprisonment. However, the MoJ analysis shows that the problem is more acute for young black people. While black people are four times more likely to be in prison than white people, the incarceration rate rises to nine times more likely for those under the age of 18. About nine in every 10,000 young black people in the general population were locked up in young offender institutions, secure training centres or secure children’s homes in England and Wales in 2015-16. This compared with one in every 10,000 of those from white ethnic backgrounds, four in every 10,000 of those from mixed ethnic backgrounds, and two in every 10,000 of those from backgrounds classified as “Asian and other”. The report also shows that while the overall numbers of young people aged 10-17 in the daily youth custody population has fallen sharply in recent years, from 7,096 in 2005-06 to 924 in June this year, the number from BAME backgrounds has fallen at a slower rate than those who are white. The report said this meant their share of the custodial population has increased over the past decade. The latest figures show that 237 young black people were sentenced to youth custody in 2016 out of a total of 1,372 young people. The number of young white people imprisoned was 674 in the same period. “The analysis in this report indicates that the high proportion of young black people in custody is likely to be driven by a number of factors such as arrest rates, custodial sentencing at the magistrates court, and the fact that they have spent longer in the custodial estate on average than other groups in the past five years,” it concludes. The analysis also highlights a higher rate of gang affiliations as one possible factor influencing sentencing decisions. It finds that gang concerns featured in 34% of pre-sentence reports on young black men written by youth offending teams, compared with 21% for those from mixed backgrounds, 11% from Asian backgrounds and just 5% for those from white ethnic backgrounds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/07/tesco-criticised-for-deducting-34m-from-plastic-bag-tax-charity-donations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T09:31:48Z","webTitle":"Tesco criticised for deducting £3.4m from plastic bag tax charity donations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/07/tesco-criticised-for-deducting-34m-from-plastic-bag-tax-charity-donations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/07/tesco-criticised-for-deducting-34m-from-plastic-bag-tax-charity-donations","fields":{"headline":"Tesco criticised for deducting £3.4m from plastic bag tax charity donations","bodyText":"Millions of pounds in administration costs were deducted from the charitable donations made by Tesco using funds generated from the plastic bag tax, government data has revealed. No other major supermarket made any such deductions, leading senior MPs to urge Tesco to follow their lead. The 5p charge for plastic bags was introduced in England in October 2015 and has led to an 83% reduction in their use, equivalent to 9bn fewer bags. It is also credited with a drop by nearly half in plastic bags found littering beaches. The government is clear that it expects shops to donate the proceeds of the 5p plastic bag tax to good causes. The latest official statistics, covering the year to March 2017, show that Tesco sold 637m carrier bags, raising £31.9m in proceeds. But the supermarket giant deducted £3.4m to cover the “cost of administering donations”, equivalent to more than 10% of the total. Tesco topped the list of plastic bags sales but no other company in the top 10 made administration deductions, including Asda, Morrison, the Co-op, Marks and Spencer, Aldi, Iceland and Waitrose. “The legislation for the 5p plastic bag charge is clear that the money raised should go to good causes,” said Mary Creagh MP, chair of the environmental audit committee. “Five years after the horsemeat scandal and three years after a false accounting scandal, Tesco finds itself again in the spotlight for doing the wrong thing. They should drop this ridiculous charge immediately.” Neil Parish MP, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, said: “As much money as possible from the plastic bag tax should be going to charitable causes. It would be great to see Tesco follow the lead of other retailers and not deduct admin costs. That would be a very positive step for Britain’s biggest supermarket to take.” A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “There is clear expectation to donate the proceeds of the plastic bag charge to good causes. We know that £95m raised has been donated to good causes so far and by publishing the data on donations, along with the number of bags distributed, this has the added effect of encouraging retailers to donate to good causes.” Tesco’s spokesman said: “Since launching in 2015, our Bags of Help initiative has provided more than £33m to over 6,400 local community projects. A small proportion of the money raised is used to run and administer the scheme in partnership with the charity Groundwork, who help distribute the money to good causes.” Companies can deduct a portion of the revenue to cover “reasonable costs” of administering the donations. The spokesman said Tesco’s administration costs included customer communications and the provision of voting tokens and booths which customers use to choose the charities that are supported. The spokesman said Tesco did not profit from money retained for administration. Tesco stopped selling 5p “single-use” plastic bags on 28 August, instead offering a “reusable” 10p bag, which will be replaced free of charge if damaged. The company said the proceeds of the 10p bag sales would continue to fund community projects. All employers with more than 250 staff are required to charge customers in England for disposable plastic bags. Legally, retailers can choose whether to donate their bag tax revenue to charity. The government data lists the revenue of some, including Poundstretcher (£250,000), as “retained by company”. Companies can deduct a portion of the revenue to cover “reasonable costs” of administering the donations.

Abdullah Alkhamesi, 76, a leading doctor, established the organisation in the early 1970s, and it has since saved countless lives. On Thursday, however, the ailing Yemeni became a victim of conditions on the ground which, according to the UN, have left less than half of the country’s health facilities able to operate, and even then with limited functionality. Alkhamesi, who worked with international aid agencies in Yemen for decades, was a former head of the Yemeni doctors’ union. His son, Zubair, told the Guardian the family were initially unable to find stents – expandable tubes used in narrowed arteries – needed for his father’s heart surgery. He could not be transferred abroad for treatment because of restrictions on movement imposed by Saudi Arabia. He died in a hospital in Sana’a, and was buried on Friday. The conflict in Yemen is between Houthi rebels controlling the capital Sana’a who are allied with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, and forces loyal to another president, the ousted Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has led a military intervention to counter the advance of the Iran-backed Houthis, with the ultimate aim of reinstating Hadi. The UK has been criticised for selling arms to Saudi Arabia despite the high casualty rate of its US-backed airstrikes in Yemen. “First, [the hospital] couldn’t find the stents. [Then] they found one and they found another one, and they bought some from an Indian nurse. Stents cost them $1000, it’s just crazy. It’s massive money in Yemen,” Zubair Alkhamesi said. “They collected all of them, they made the operations and then the doctor said he needed more, but they didn’t have any more. “He got the stents but he didn’t get better, since then he deteriorated and there was no way to get him out to Cairo, or Amman, the queue was very long, there’s a queue for names for patients, the Saudis have stopped the planes.” The Saudi-led coalition has imposed restrictions on Yemeni airspace, leading to the closure of Sana’a airport in August 2016. Less than a dozen humanitarian flights are allowed into Yemen each week, landing in Sana’a and Aden. There are no commercial flights. The UN has estimated that the airport’s closure means 20,000 patients have been denied potentially life-saving healthcare abroad. Few flights, if any, are scheduled each month to transfer patients who need to be treated overseas. Zubair, said his father was taken to hospital two weeks ago and he spent most of that time in intensive care. “Of course, he died because of lack of access to life-saving medicine,” he said. “It’s very hard to get anything in Yemen now, you can’t get the medicine, you can’t get the stents. You have to go and bribe the people and find everything through the back door, everything is very, very expensive, doctors would say buy this now and go sometime and it would take you a week to find this medicine.” Born in 1941, Alkhamesi was part of the first group of around 30 people sent to Russia by Imam Ahmad bin Yahya, the former Yemeni ruler, to train as a doctor. He founded the Red Crescent in 1973, and remained as its general secretary until the early 2000s. Zubair Alkhamesi, who is now based in the UK, said he was shocked by his father’s death. “You are angry, you can’t do anything, because it’s not the people’s fault, it’s the government, it’s the king of Saudi and the [emir] of Emirates, they are all playing politics, they’ve destroyed the whole country,” He was equally critical of the rebels: “Houthis made the coup, they invaded Sana’a and they took over Sana’a without any election, it was by force. There’s no hope, that’s the problem. No chance for peace at all.” Wa’el Ibrahim, country director in Yemen for Care International, said there have been fewer airstrikes around Sana’a recently, but conditions were continuing to worsen. “Healthcare has deteriorated, I think more than half of clinics and medical centres in Yemen have collapsed. Civil servants have not been paid in eight months. Airports have been closed for one year,” he said. “Life is really difficult for people in Yemen, not to mention cholera – 550,000 have been suspected and 2,000 have died as a result, 20 million people in need of aid. People are really worried about their future, schools have not operated [or] functioned properly for over two years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2017/oct/02/the-waitrose-effect-boom-times-for-homeowners-but-evictions-for-tenants","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"The Waitrose effect: boom times for homeowners but evictions for tenants | David Adler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/02/the-waitrose-effect-boom-times-for-homeowners-but-evictions-for-tenants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/oct/02/the-waitrose-effect-boom-times-for-homeowners-but-evictions-for-tenants","fields":{"headline":"The Waitrose effect: boom times for homeowners but evictions for tenants","bodyText":"In July 2001, Emily and her two children moved into a terraced house in the London borough of Islington. She purchased the house for £290,000, but her interest-only mortgage brought her monthly costs to just £320. The place was “a bit of a dive,” Emily says. The paint was peeling, there was no central heating, and the neighbourhood was rough around the edges. But over the next decade-and-a-half the borough transformed – and with it the value of the house. “Islington is unrecognisable compared to when I first moved in ... New shops, new restaurants. It’s green, it’s nice, it’s easy.” In January 2016, Emily thought it was “time to cash in”. She put the house on the market. It sold – with multiple bidders – within a day. The selling price was £1,310,000. George arrived to Islington in 2005, renting a bedroom in a shared house. He had a steady job in advertising and was excited about his new home in an up-and-coming neighbourhood. He signed a one-year contract for £500 each month. Within two years though, George was priced out of the borough. “More than anything, the increases in rent were phenomenal ... I had to move to the south of London just to stay in London at all.” But the relief did not last long. George’s new six-month contract meant that his landlord could raise the rent every six months. There was harassment from the landlord, harassment from the letting agent. There were threats of eviction, even as the house went unmaintained. Finally, in December 2015, George decided to leave the city all together. He quit his job. He started looking for a new one. He now lives in Edinburgh. **** Portraits of urban inequality are often painted in extremes. On one side, slums suffer from slipshod construction and poor city services. On the other, skyscrapers offer penthouse views to wealthy executives. But these inequalities do not just pertain to the margins. As housing markets tighten around the world, a gap is growing between those who own property in the city and those who rent it. Homeowners enjoy security – in their sense of place and, as house prices rise, in the value of their property. Renters face precarity – a struggle to earn enough to pay the rent while affording daily expenses. “I think people can forget how much of an impact it can have on your life if you have to move around,” one tenant in Birmingham told me. “I have never been homeless. But I feel like I am a hop, skip, and a jump away from that.” One of the most common defences of rising inequality is merit. CEOs deserve their multi-million-pound compensation packages, we are told, because they deliver that value to their shareholders. Construction workers deserve minimum wage because they contribute only £7.50 each hour to the projects they labour on. The growing disparities between tenants and owners strike at the heart of this myth. In the housing market, the rich get richer, while the poor get poorer – all on the basis of luck, circumstance, and inheritance. Many governments pay lip service to the “humanitarian crisis” of housing: homelessness, or rough sleeping, and the many disadvantages that flow from it. But few address housing as a crisis of inequality. Around the world, homeowners are fighting hard to hold onto their housing privileges, campaigning to protect the countryside, slow the pace of property development, and keep their property taxes to a minimum. They remain one demographic that politicians refuse to cross. As an MP in Islington, Jeremy Corbyn watched as Emily and George drifted apart. In his conference speech last week, he indicted “the yawning inequality in one of the wealthiest ... cities in the world.” **** Housing serves two distinct purposes – wealth and welfare. As real estate, housing is a core asset for home-owning families and a key component of national economies. As shelter, housing is a core component of an adequate standard of living. Over the last three decades, housing markets have seen growing inequalities in both. In terms of wealth, homeowners have gained enormously from their position on the housing ladder, while renters have been kicked off it. Since 1971, the value of British real estate has risen from roughly $60bn to over $6tn – a 100-fold increase, adjusted for inflation. Today, in many parts of the country, owners earn more from their homes than they do from their jobs. Renters have been excluded from these gains. Instead, they face the “housing headwind” – their earnings may be growing, but their housing costs are growing faster. For households headed by someone aged 25-44, income grew by just 2% between 2002 and 2015, while housing costs grew by 25%. For these renters, living standards are not stagnating – they are declining. In the housing market, it’s expensive to be poor. In 2015, mortgagors in England paid just 20% of their average earnings on housing costs, while private renters paid 43%. In London, that number was 72%. The statistics are equally striking in the United States, where renters are more than twice as likely to be burdened by housing costs than their home-owning neighbours. 11 million American households spend over 50% of their income on rent. “We’re seeing drastic rent increases in historically low-income neighbourhoods,” says Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal, member of the Los Angeles Tenants Union. “Since 1980, rents in LA have gone up 55%, while incomes have increased just 13%. Just last year, our homeless population grew 23% – up to 58,000 people.” The result is a growing wealth gap within cities, across countries, and – especially in the case of America – between ethnicities. “The divide between owners and renters in this country goes back to the history of redlining and planned disinvestment from low-income communities of colour,” says Rosenthal. “The federal government helped bar people of colour from securing home loans, while subsidising loans for white people. Today, the average black household would need 228 years to accumulate the wealth of the average white family. A Latino household would need 84.” And so the inequality trickles down through the generations. One family remortgages their current home to finance their child’s next one. Another family keeps struggles to avoid eviction. As the rent burden grows, the cost of upward mobility – a college education, for example, or a car – grows, too. Housing tenure also implies more basic inequalities of everyday life. Without the financial resources to repair their homes and without the bargaining power to force their landlords to make repairs on their behalf, many renters live in dark and damp properties. According to the 2015-16 English Housing Survey, more than one-third of private rental properties fall below the Decent Homes Standard. The standard was devised to regulate social housing, and isn’t legally enforceable in the private sector, but it is a reliable benchmark for assessing whether or not a home can be considered fit for habitation. In many parts of the United States, too, rental properties are not fit for human habitation. “There is currently no standard practice for inspecting rental units,” says Tara Raghuveer, Community Policy Fellow at the Center for Neighborhoods, University of Missouri-Kansas City. “The only way that people have reached the attention of the Kansas City council is by calling the health department to report when there are leaks or when the landlord turns off the heat in winter.” This August, the council finally considered an ordinance on interior inspection. They tabled it indefinitely. “Private landlords in Kansas have been unaccountable to anyone for so long that their business model relies on minimal investment in property upkeep.” If tenants are at risk inside their homes, they are at even greater risk of being thrown out of them. In Britain, evictions in the private rental sector are reaching record highs. In the United States, an estimated 2.7 million renters were evicted in 2015 alone. Such figures underestimate the scale of the eviction epidemic, ignoring those informal cases in which tenants are forced out of their homes without legal process. Kansas City alone sees 42 evictions each day. “It’s a bleak but not unique story about evictions in an American city,” says Raghuveer. “The data that we have show that these evictions have been steady for years.” Another common defence of inequality is the trickle-down model. The rich may be getting richer, but their wealth — one way or another — will eventually reach the masses. It’s a rosy view of a rising tide lifting all boats, absolving the rich of responsibility for the plight of the poor. Again, the housing case presents a challenge. In the housing market, the interests of owners and renters are broadly opposed: owners’ wealth comes directly at the cost of decreasing disposable income for the renter. Consider gentrification. Homeowners gain in wealth as the value of their property rises, and they also gain in welfare: services improve and amenities diversify as luxuries like upscale supermarkets set up shop. Lacking security of tenure, however, gentrification displaces tenants through rising rental costs. Conversely, when house prices begin to fall, owners face fears of negative equity, while renters rejoice. Renters and owners are locked in a zero-sum conflict. Waitrose – that supermarket “where the godless middle-classes go to worship” – illustrates this conflict. When a new Waitrose opens up, homeowners profit. They gain access to Britain’s favourite supermarket, and, as a result of their proximity to Waitrose, their properties increase in value by an average of £40,000. This is known the “Waitrose effect,” and it is celebrated by homeowners and estate agents alike. But the arrival of Waitrose has another, hidden, effect on renters. My recent research with Generation Rent demonstrates that the arrival of a Waitrose is associated with an increase in local eviction rates of between 25 and 50%. The two Waitrose effects go hand in hand. The rise in property values associated with the original Waitrose effect encourages local landlords to evict their tenants in order to raise their rents or put their properties up for sale. Far from a rising tide, housing markets drain from one side of the pool into the other. There are winners and losers. The role of the reformer is to pick them. If the economics of the housing generate inequality, the politics of housing exacerbate it. Around the world, urban policy is oriented toward a defence of homeowners’ interests. In cultures that prize homeownership, in particular – the “property-owning democracy,” the American dream, the pay de proprietaries – renters rarely figure. Property tax systems are most striking. Council taxes in the United Kingdom are based on property evaluations conducted in 1991, ignoring two decades of rapid house price inflation. Meanwhile, policies like the bedroom tax – which charges for any room left unoccupied in a council flat – penalise renters the government perceives to be using more than their fair share of square footage. American property taxes are similarly skewed. Where owners receive massive subsidies, like the American mortgage interest tax deduction, tenants receive little support from the government. In March, the White House proposed budget cuts to the Department of Housing and Urban Development that would take 250,000 rent vouchers away from low-income tenants. In total, 70% of all current housing expenditure by the American government is directed to subsidise homeowners. “We are a forgotten part of society,” John, a tenant in Bristol, told me. “The private rental sector is useful for the government, because it keeps the homelessness numbers down. But there are too many people living in flats that are not suitable to live in,” he said. “We haven’t got a voice at all.” Homeowners – wealthier and older citizens – tend to be more politically active, organising “not in my backyard” coalitions and voting as a consolidated constituency. Renters – poorer and with more precarious living situations – are less organised and, commonly, more disillusioned. The political calculus favours the former. “Politicians are afraid to change their housing policies,” says Sven Bergenstråhle, president of the International Union of Tenants, headquartered in Stockholm. “The OECD and the EU commission have warned Sweden about their growing property bubble, but the politicians do nothing, because they are scared about the reactions from voters.” Tenants today are fighting for change. In Britain, the voice of the renter grows louder each year. The Labour Party’s “government in waiting” appears committed to change. “No social cleansing, no jacking up rents, no exorbitant ground rents,” Jeremy Corbyn promised in his conference speech last week. The Tories are not far behind. Where the Conservative manifesto in 2015 failed to mention the rental sector once, the Conservative manifesto this June promised “New Council Housing Deals” for social housing construction. It’s a change that’s long overdue — and may, in fact, be too little, too late. For renters fighting against the housing headwind, the government’s promises to build new homes fail to account for the full impact of the housing market on their standard of living today and their financial security tomorrow. Their problem is not a lack of policy options. Books, reports, and policy papers overflow with compelling recommendations for land value taxes, inheritance taxes, and rental sector regulations to narrow the gap between owner and renter. But election after election, housing has remained our third rail. “The upshot is that I am a 57-year-old man living in rented accommodation,” John says. “I haven’t got a huge pension, I haven’t got a huge amount of money put away, and I’m worried. When I finally have to give up work, where am I going to live?” Some names have been changed in this article David Adler is a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford and a research partner at Generation Rent Follow the Guardian’s Inequality Project on Twitter here, or email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/01/labour-members-could-force-brexit-policy-rethink-at-party-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T17:11:42Z","webTitle":"Labour members could force Brexit policy rethink at party conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/01/labour-members-could-force-brexit-policy-rethink-at-party-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/01/labour-members-could-force-brexit-policy-rethink-at-party-conference","fields":{"headline":"Labour members could force Brexit policy rethink at party conference","bodyText":"Labour members could force a rethink of party policy on free movement and permanent membership of the single market, with Brexit set to overtake internal reform as the key topic dominating the autumn conference, according to senior sources. Pro-EU MPs and activists are organising to get new commitments to the single market and the continuation of free movement on the agenda for the conference, which takes place in Brighton from 24-27 September. Local constituency parties now have a fortnight to submit so-called contemporary resolutions for the party to debate, which must be on recently relevant topics. The Labour campaign for free movement has organised a draft resolution backing the continuation of free movement, which it is encouraging members to submit to local parties to maximise its chances of debate on the conference floor. The campaign is backed by influential MPs including Clive Lewis, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, David Lammy and Tulip Siddiq as well as Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA union. Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said: “Labour should champion the benefit freedom of movement has brought to Britain, and conference should commit to maintaining it to ensure the UK economy, and particularly London’s economy, is protected.” The resolution drafted by the group says: “Free movement benefits all workers. Without it, migrants are more vulnerable to hyper-exploitation, making downward pressure on wages more likely. Limiting it would damage the economy and hit living standards. Britain and the EU should welcome migration across Europe and from beyond.” Michael Chessum, who is coordinating the campaign, said it was a “really important marker of a renewed democracy in the party” because it was a key issue for members. “Free movement could be the policy that demonstrates that we have become a bottom-up party again, with members – who overwhelmingly back free movement – deciding what the party does,” he said. One party source close to Labour’s ruling national executive committee said party members were likely to support a more liberal approach to EU migration. “Free movement really is the big controversy that could emerge. It would get a lot of support from members and from unions,” the source said. “If a local party submitted a motion backing free movement, that could be problematic. It could pass, and conference could change our policy.” Last week the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would press for the UK to remain a member of the single market throughout an extended transition period, which would include the continuation of free movement, the jurisdiction of European courts and EU budget payments. However, Starmer stopped short of committing the party to long-term membership, citing free movement as the sticking point. He said the party wanted to see “a more effective management of migration, which Labour recognises must be addressed in the final deal”. Tom Watson, the party’s deputy leader, said Labour could accurately be described as the party of “soft Brexit”, and he hinted membership of the single market could continue indefinitely under a Labour government. “We think that being part of the customs union and the single market is important in those transitional times because that is the way you protect jobs and the economy, and it might be a permanent outcome of the negotiations, but we have got to see how those negotiations go,” he told the BBC’s Newsnight. Local parties will submit motions to commit Labour to staying permanently in the single market, coordinated by a campaign from the MPs Heidi Alexander and Alison McGovern via a new website, Labour4singlemarket.org. “Government policy on Brexit is in total disarray since the election,” McGovern said. “I think the remain vote had a far bigger effect on the Labour surge at the last election than many people realise. Last year, because of the leadership election, it was understandable that it wasn’t the focus. But it would be very surprising if Europe didn’t dominate this time.” With Brexit and the general election result set to take centre stage at the conference, Labour sources said anticipated rows over party rule changes to make it easier for leftwing candidates to get on future leadership ballots were likely to be a damp squib. One vote that will divide the conference floor will be on the so-called McDonnell amendment, named after the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who had favoured reducing the number of MPs needed to nominate a leadership candidate to get their name on the ballot of party members. Activists have proposed reducing the threshold from 15% to 5% of MPs. Details are yet to be finalised by the party’s national executive committee but a compromise deal of 10% could reached, a move backed by some of the biggest trade unions. One source close to the NEC described all-out efforts to make it “a big peacemaking conference” rather than reopening old wounds. “We are so close to power, we need a 1%-2% swing to be in government,” the source said. “So the conversations around sealing Jeremy’s legacy really aren’t relevant any more. There are a handful of people on both the left and the right of the party trying to get people fired up about rule changes but they are pretty lone voices now.” Another senior party source said attitudes had shifted dramatically since the election result. “Jeremy and the leaders’ office are convinced there will be another early election and believe he could be prime minister before Christmas,” one senior party source said. “If the conference becomes all about a fight over insular party rule changes, you squander a big opportunity to look like a statesman-like leader. Even moderates on the NEC are really not that concerned about things like the McDonnell amendment.” NEC members will meet on 19 September, four days before the conference kicks off, to finalise the agenda. The resignation of the Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who will be replaced by her leftwing deputy Alex Rowley on the NEC, will give Corbyn-aligned committee members an advantage in key votes before the conference. Corbyn allies could put forward a motion to create a second deputy leader post, in mind for Emily Thornberry who is currently a de facto second deputy as shadow first secretary of state, filling in for Corbyn at prime minister’s questions during his absence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/01/eu-blackmailing-britain-brexit-negotiations","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T11:04:44Z","webTitle":"The EU is blackmailing Britain – and it may well work | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/01/eu-blackmailing-britain-brexit-negotiations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/01/eu-blackmailing-britain-brexit-negotiations","fields":{"headline":"The EU is blackmailing Britain – and it may well work","bodyText":"The stalled Brexit negotiations are now serious. We used to assume that these matters would resolve into predictable compromises. There is a box of fudge under the table, a quid pro quo at the end of the road. Even in North Korea we sense that sanity will one day out. It is hard to see a fudge over Brexit. The UK negotiator, David Davis, is clearly playing hardball, for the understandable reason that his opposite number, Michel Barnier, is doing likewise. Generations of EU deals have been done on the same basis: of more power to Brussels and more money with it. There is simply no route map for the reverse. Cynics have long said that Barnier will settle anything, provided only that somehow Brussels does not lose a cut of some 10% of its income from the UK. Nothing matters to a bureaucracy so much as its pay. The Brussels establishment will concede transitions and frictionless borders and deals on migration and courts, if London will only come up with the money. Barnier’s team yesterday did some shroud-waving. It pleaded the “green aid” card, the environment card, the animal protection card. Britain’s trade minister, Liam Fox, is right to call it blackmail. Barnier needs to come away in October with hard cash in his pocket. Right now that is Davis’s only real bargaining chip. His reluctance to talk money is risky, if only because the impending crash cannot be in the UK’s favour. Gates slamming shut in 2019 would be a nuisance for the EU, but chaotic for the UK. Davis is playing so tough that any eventual climb-down on the budget will mean a bigger shock to the hard Brexit lobby. There is now an overwhelming consensus, not just among pundits but in public opinion, in favour of what is called soft Brexit. Davis must accept this. The EU and the UK both have a clear interest in the UK remaining de facto in a common European “space”. That has to be negotiable. Yes, the EU is being pig-headed in refusing even to discuss it, until it sees the colour of Britain’s money. Yes, the money may not be legally essential. But this is politics. Bystanders can only watch as this one goes critical. Who will blink first? Of course Europe’s future should not be a game of chicken. Things should never have got to this pass. But they have. If this were a war we would be getting ready to fight. Mercifully it is not. Britain will, of course, muddle through this bizarre adventure into the unknown, but rarely has muddling seemed so impenetrable. Yes, at this stage the EU is blackmailing Britain.

Do not read on unless you have watched The blood’s drying, the dust from the Wall’s collapse has settled, and Jon and Dany are sleeping it off in short-lived but blissful ignorance. Yes, season seven of Game of Thrones is done. So now, as we face the end of HBO’s paean to incest, violence and creative profanity, it’s time to turn our attention to what comes next. The bad news is that we’ve got a fair wait ahead of us. Due to the increasingly vast nature of the production and its profligate deployment of fire-breathing CGI dragonry, the final season may not see the light of day until 2019. Still, as it approaches the finish line, the main hope is that the eighth run can avoid the panoply of errors made by the downright patchy seventh. While ultimately a success – this week’s finale was superb, like the imperial, beard-stroking Thrones of old – few could argue that all criticism of the season was unfair. It was, at various points, weirdly tame, utterly daft and sometimes even total nonsense. More than anything, though, it felt rushed. Season eight had looked destined to suffer the same fate, trimming itself down to just six chunks. But the remaining episodes are each likely to be feature-length 80-minute mini-movies in their own right, which is fortunate because there’s still plenty of knotty plot to get through. Now the Wall has been breached, we’re finally going to see the long-mooted war between the living and the dead. Encouragingly, the one area in which later series of Thrones improved is in the impossibly humongous battle scenes. With the army of the dead shuffling southward and the dragon-riding Night King able to resurrect any of the millions of corpses left littering Westeros after years of inter-house squabbling, it’s safe to assume the show will raise the bar for television spectacle once again. How to top the Battle of the Bastards or the dragon attack in this season’s the Spoils of War is the showmakers’ problem to solve. All we have is the pleasant duty to wait and see what they come up with. In theory there is still plenty of time to allow the story to breathe. Because that is the one area where season seven really fluffed it. Things happened at such a lick that logic and character motivation were abandoned to lead events mechanically into the next battle. David Benioff and DB Weiss would do well to remember that it’s not the war-to-end-all-wars audiences are looking forward to; what we’re waiting for is the Hound’s revenge on the Mountain. For Jaime to betray Cersei. For Theon to die heroically. For the inevitable rift between Dany and Jon when she finds out that the nephew she just slept with is the rightful heir to her throne. Season eight needs to remember that the best scenes of season seven came in the feature-length finale, and they were tiny, intricate, dramatic affairs: the terse exchange between Cersei and Tyrion; Theon rediscovering his courage; a blindsided Littlefinger’s eventual undoing. It’s moments like these that make the show. Battles, zombie dragons and explosive dismemberments are just the window dressing. What will happen is pure speculation at this point, but certain prophecies exist that give us a fair idea. In a flashback in season five, a young Cersei visited a sooth-saying witch who told her she’d marry a king, that the king would have 20 children while Cersei would have three, and that hers would die. All of that came true, which suggests the witch’s further prophecy that Cersei would have her crown taken by a younger, more beautiful queen is worthy of note. The witch also said Cersei would die at the hands of a “valonqar”, or “little brother”, which could either mean Jaime or Tyrion. But with an enemies tally longer than a list of Robert Baratheon’s love-children, almost anyone could kill Cersei. So, a war, with Jon and Dany pretending that awkward “thing” never happened and Jon honouring his bending of the knee to Dany and renouncing his claim. Cersei loses and Dany is crowned. Job done. Doesn’t that feel a bit obvious, though? Too conventional? The whole point of Westeros has always been that good doesn’t prevail. More than anything, the final season needs to subvert expectations in a way the seventh didn’t, giving us the bittersweet ending George RR Martin has always promised. Good people need to die, the more pointlessly and painfully the better. Tragedy needs to ensue. Baddies need to win sometimes. Imagine the furore if Cersei, with the help of her mercenary army, won the battle of the dead, killed everyone, claimed the Iron Throne and Euron’s hand in marriage, and the series ended on a Sopranos-esque note of things just carrying on. That would be awful. Which would make it agonisingly brilliant. If the final season can take the best elements of every season up to now, everything will be just fine. But it might be tempting for the producers to give audiences a neat, happy ending where Brienne and the Hound ride off into the sunset bickering adorably and Jon and Dany make dozens of mini Targaryens in marital bliss. But that wouldn’t be the Thrones we fell in love with. Game of Thrones season eight: please, you have to punish us. Honestly, it’s what we want."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/01/sinn-fein-arlene-foster-irish-language-act-compromise","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T14:43:30Z","webTitle":"Fianna Fáil attacks Sinn Féin rejection of DUP compromise offer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/01/sinn-fein-arlene-foster-irish-language-act-compromise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/01/sinn-fein-arlene-foster-irish-language-act-compromise","fields":{"headline":"Fianna Fáil attacks Sinn Féin rejection of DUP compromise offer","bodyText":"Ireland’s largest opposition party, Fianna Fáil, has criticised Sinn Féin’s rejection of a compromise offer from the Democratic Unionists over an Irish language act in Northern Ireland. The rejection of the offer has cast doubt on the resumption of negotiations aimed at restoring power-sharing in Belfast. Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in the Stormont assembly, accused the DUP and its leader, Arlene Foster, of failing to learn any lessons from the collapse of the previous government. But the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, said Sinn Féin’s decision to spurn Foster’s proposal to restart talks and aim for compromise on language and cultural issues was “unacceptable”. He said Foster’s statement “warranted engagement, not immediate rejection”. Martin said: “We should remember that Sinn Féin initially collapsed the executive because of the renewable heating controversy. Eight months later the issue has now changed to the enactment of the Irish language act. “While Fianna Fáil supports the Irish language act, we do not believe that it should be used as a political pawn, when basic services for citizens are deteriorating.” He added: “The consequences of a stagnant Stormont are too serious for kneejerk reactions. The challenges posed by Brexit cannot be underestimated and it is in the interest of all the citizens in the north that Stormont is reconvened as a matter of urgency.” O’Neill said the late Martin McGuinness had resigned as deputy first minister in January because the DUP had reneged on agreements to introduce equality measures including an Irish language act. Referring to Foster’s keynote speech to the DUP ruling executive on Thursday night, in which she called for a comprehensive deal on cultural issues in Northern Ireland, O’Neill said: “The statement by the DUP leader demonstrates they have not listened or acknowledged the reasons of Martin’s resignation. “Establishing an executive that may collapse after a matter of months on the same issues will only fail all our people. Let’s agree to quickly conclude talks on implementation and rights – that is the only way to build a sustainable executive that will last.” Her remarks raise serious doubts as to whether the DUP and Sinn Féin, the two biggest parties in the assembly, can reach an agreement leading to the restoration of devolution this autumn. Talks between the five main parties had been expected to restart at Stormont within the next week or two. With the odds against the parties reaching a deal to restore a power-sharing government, it raises the prospect of a creeping return to direct rule by London-based ministers in the absence of a local administration. Robin Swann, the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader, said the speed of Sinn Féin’s rejection of Foster’s offer “makes it abundantly clear that Gerry Adams’s intransigence is still in place”. The UUP and DUP believe Adams still holds sway within Sinn Féin and is lukewarm about bringing back power-sharing to Belfast. This month Adams said there would be no Northern Ireland assembly without an Irish language act. Such an act would protect and promote the rights of Irish speakers in the region, putting the language on a par with English. During her speech, Foster said she did not regard the Irish language as a threat to the union or her Britishness. “We have nothing to fear from the Irish language, nor is it any threat to the union. We have previously supported practical measures for the Irish language and we will do so again if we can reach a wider agreement on these matters. However, what we cannot and will not do is simply agree to one-sided demands,” she said. “I have also heard from those within the unionist community who hear others speaking about respect, while at the same time they engage in a campaign to denigrate and demonise any and all aspects of our British identity in Northern Ireland, or insult the Ulster Scots community. This is not acceptable.” The DUP leader said issues such as the Irish language “should not have a greater priority than health or education or the economy”. Foster was the first minister in the previous power-sharing government, which broke up ostensibly because of her refusal to temporarily stand down over a costly green energy scheme the DUP had championed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/01/facebook-you-cant-block-mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-too-many-already-have","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T09:07:06Z","webTitle":"You can't block Mark Zuckerberg or Priscilla Chan as too many already have","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/01/facebook-you-cant-block-mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-too-many-already-have","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/01/facebook-you-cant-block-mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-too-many-already-have","fields":{"headline":"You can't block Mark Zuckerberg or Priscilla Chan as too many already have","bodyText":"Bad news! You still can’t block Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook. And now you can’t block his wife Priscilla Chan either. The saga began back in January, when people first noticed that Zuckerberg’s account was immune to the block button. You can hit “block” on the Facebook chief executive, and the site asks you to confirm your intentions (you can almost see the puppy dog eyes) – but if you do confirm, a warning comes up noting something along the lines of “this profile can’t be blocked for now”. With Zuckerberg, it was a particularly noticeable problem, since his posts are seemingly given extra viral oomph by Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm, leaving him ever present in the feeds of many. But the problem has now spread to another member of the Zuckerberg family. Chan is also unblockable. The family dog, Beast, also has a Facebook page, but he can be blocked, if you are a monster. Oh, and his sister Randi. The quirk isn’t deliberate, according to Facebook. A spokesperson in July said: “This error isn’t specific to any one account. It’s generated when a person has been blocked a certain large number of times. In very rare instances, a viral campaign will develop instructing lots of people to all wrongly block the same person.” A former Facebook engineer further clarified that the error is a side-effect of the way blocks are coded in the site, rather than a specific decision to prevent too many people blocking the same person.

The former 110m hurdles world record holder has been clearing barriers with rare skill ever since but revealing his sexuality to the world earlier this week was an obstacle sized up more carefully than ever. The Swedish LGBT former athletes Kajsa Bergqvist and Peter Häggström, who interviewed Jackson, were not the first to ask. In fact, Jackson – now a BBC pundit and presenter – had twice publicly denied he was gay: in a 2004 autobiography and a 2008 newspaper interview. But he said the circumstances felt right to come out aged 50 in a TV interview, more than a decade since a tabloid kiss-and-tell forced him to reveal the fact to his parents. Jackson was born in 1967, the same year male homosexuality was partially decriminalised in the UK. But while he was competing at the top level, few sportsmen felt confident enough to come out. Jackson’s elite career overlapped with that of Justin Fashanu, the first openly gay footballer, who took his own life in 1998, eight years after revealing his homosexuality. But when approached by the programme Rainbow Heroes, which airs on SVT in Sweden, Jackson became convinced his news would not be “sensationalised” as he had once feared. “The way you asked me, it was a whole storytelling kind of thing,” he told Bergqvist, a former high jumper. “You were just interested in the way it affected me sports-wise, emotionally-wise and my preparation.” There had been speculation about Jackson’s sexuality, which intensified in 2006 when the News of the World published a story in which a gay male air steward claimed to have had a secret affair with him. It prompted Jackson to come out to his parents. “I was waiting for them in the kitchen,” he said. “They walked in and they sat down. My mother could see my face and I was quite distraught. It didn’t faze them at all. “My mum went: ‘First of all, is the story true?’ I said it’s true, so it’s not like I can deny it. And then she went: ‘Well, why are people so disgraceful?’ I just realised, I’ve got the best parents.” While he possessed bags of natural talent, Jackson has always maintained it was a formidable work ethic instilled by his parents, first generation Jamaican immigrants, that marked him out for greatness. His mum, Angela, arrived in Cardiff in 1955 and his dad, Ossie, in 1962 and the pair married later that year. A conservative couple, they were very popular on the council estate where Jackson and his sister, the actor Suzanne Packer – once a regular on Casualty – were raised. Angela was a midwife and later a theatre sister while Ossie worked in sales for an air-conditioning company. When featured in the BBC genealogy programme Who Do You Think You Are? in 2009, Jackson discovered he was descended from Taino Indians, the native inhabitants of Jamaica. They later mixed with escaped slaves and formed their own Maroon communities, who fought against slavery and for Jamaican independence in the 17th century. “The fieriness that the Maroons had, first with their fight with the Spanish and then the English, I think I’ve got that in me now,” said Jackson. “Because when I lined up on many occasions to compete for Great Britain, it took a lot of heart and soul to get out there and to really be at war with my competitors.” In his early years, Jackson primarily identified as Jamaican and family meals were saltfish, rice and peas, and jerk chicken. It was not until he got his first Welsh vest aged 14 that he felt properly British. Ask any of his former teammates what made Jackson a world record holder and they will point to a ferocious determination. He seemed to possess an invisible switch that turned him from happy-go-lucky off the track to ruthless on it. His close relationship with coach Malcolm Arnold, who he joined at 17 and remained with until retirement in 2003, was also a big factor. “His natural strengths were his perception and understanding of the training process, his ability to work hard, his natural psychological strength and an excellent basic speed,” said Arnold. “He was very good at jumping, throwing and running events and there was some discussion when he was a junior about doing the decathlon or becoming a long jumper. “However, when he became world junior champion in Athens and ran 13.44 sec, it was obvious that his future lay in hurdling.” His parents remained unconvinced about athletics as a career choice until Jackson won silver at the 1986 Commonwealth Games – his first major senior medal – when he was just 19. Success soon brought riches Jackson had barely dreamed of. Three years after leaving school he was driving past his old teachers in a Mercedes. He went undefeated at the European championships for 12 years in a row but Jackson’s piece de resistance remains a 12.91 seconds 110m hurdles world record, which stood for more than a decade. He remains the 60m hurdles world record holder. The missing element of Jackson’s career and the reason he is underrated in some quarters is the lack of an Olympic title. He won silver in Seoul in 1988 and was favourite to win gold in Barcelona four years later. But, inhibited by a rib cartilage injury, Jackson – usually clean as a whistle – hit four hurdles in the final and staggered over the line in seventh place. His training partner, the Canadian Mark McKoy, who together with his wife and baby daughter had stayed in Jackson’s home in Cardiff in the run-up to the Olympics, won gold. Jackson has spoken at length of his devastation at missing out. “At first I thought, ‘That was such a shit race, can we do it again?’” he said. “The second thought was, ‘At least Mark won.’ “But that didn’t make things easier to live with. I saw Mark every day and it was the most horrible thing to know he had won and I hadn’t.” In Atlanta in 1996, Jackson was again thwarted in his search of that elusive Olympic gold, pulling a muscle in the final of the 110m hurdles and missing out on a bronze medal by 0.02sec. His former teammate Iwan Thomas maintains that Jackson’s legacy is unaffected by the absence of an Olympic title. “He might be a bit underrated because he never won the Olympics,” said Thomas. “But the stopwatch doesn’t lie, his world record was one of the longest standing in athletics and he was the ultimate professional.” By 2004, when Jackson’s outdoor world record was broken by the Chinese athlete Liu Xiang at the Athens Olympics, Jackson was watching from the BBC studio. He has covered most major athletics events since for the corporation and appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2005. He said getting a job with the BBC helped him deal with the anxiety attacks that accompanied the end of his athletics career. “When you spend all of your adult life doing something and suddenly that stops, you think: how am I going to earn money? How am I going to live?” he told the Big Issue in 2014. Jackson also revealed he had struggled with an eating disorder as he battled to lose weight to give himself a competitive edge early in his career. Friends suggest that he was not ready to come out in 2008 when asked by the Voice, Britain’s biggest black newspaper, how he felt about people thinking he is gay. “I don’t mind having people say what they like in that circumstance,” he said at the time. “I know that I am not but I don’t think it’s for me to be going round screaming it from the rooftops. I think it’s just rubbish. It makes no real sense to me.” Fellow Welsh athlete Iwan Thomas, who first met Jackson at the Commonwealth Games in 1994, hailed Jackson’s decision to come out. “I’ve always thought of him as an absolute superstar but I think the perception of him is even greater now,” he said. “I think it’s very different nowadays to 20 years ago where it might have been frowned upon. “I hope by Colin coming out it might give people in sport in particular the courage to do the same because sport can be quite a difficult place and very judgmental. “Only Colin knows but maybe that’s why he left it so long. I’m going to give him a big hug when I see him because if even one person feels they can come out to their mum or dad because they’ve seen what Colin’s done then that’s amazing.” Potted profile Age: 50 Career: Jackson claimed his first senior medal at the Commonwealth Games in 1986, a silver in the 110m hurdles. A silver medal at the Seoul Olympics followed and he went unbeaten at the European Championships for 12 years. He set a world record to win gold at the Stuttgart World Championships in 1993 and won the world title again in 1999. He retired in 2003 after finishing fifth at the World Indoor Championships in Birmingham, the 71st appearance for Britain in his career. He has been a BBC athletics pundit and presenter since retirement. High point: Gold medal at the World Championships in Stuttgart in 1993 in 12.91sec, a world record which stood for more than a decade. Low point: Missing out on a medal when favourite to win gold at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. He says: “I never look for the highs that I had in that cauldron because I don’t think you get them on the outside – you can never repeat that. Can you imagine being the best in the world? Whatever you do, you are the best hurdler on the planet at that particular moment – you cannot repeat that. Entrepreneurs – can they really say they’re the best the world? I really appreciate having been able to say that.” They say: “His natural strengths were his perception and understanding of the training process, his natural psychological strength and an excellent basic speed” – coach Malcolm Arnold."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/01/pope-francis-psychoanalyst-visits-struggle-argentina-dirty-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T15:05:49Z","webTitle":"Pope's psychoanalyst visits show his struggle in Argentina's 'dirty war'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/pope-francis-psychoanalyst-visits-struggle-argentina-dirty-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/01/pope-francis-psychoanalyst-visits-struggle-argentina-dirty-war","fields":{"headline":"Pope's psychoanalyst visits show his struggle in Argentina's 'dirty war'","bodyText":"One of the mysteries of the life of Pope Francis is how a man regarded for many years as an authoritarian by his colleagues was reinvented as a global icon of forgiveness. The news that he visited a psychoanalyst every week for six months may cast some light on this question. At the time of his therapy, he was 42 and Argentina was two years into the terrible struggle between a military junta that killed about 30,000 people and tortured many more, and the left, which included everyone from urban guerrillas to unarmed priests. Fr Bergoglio, as he then was, found himself in the middle as the head of the Jesuit order. Jesuits were prominent in the resistance to the junta, and two of his priests, who had refused his orders to leave their mission in a shanty town, were kidnapped and savagely tortured for five months by the military. Both men blamed him for their treatment, but much later, one changed his mind. The other never forgave him. Francis secured their release, and that he behaved with exemplary courage is not in doubt. But the incident cast a lasting shadow on his character and relationships with his fellow Jesuits, which would not entirely recover for another 35 years. Paul Vallely, the author of Pope Francis: Untying the Knots, pointed out that the year before he saw the psychoanalyst, Bergoglio had refused to intercede when approached by the father of a pregnant woman who was kidnapped, “disappeared”, and presumably murdered by the junta. It may seem that these are things a priest should ask God to forgive, not a human psychoanalyst. But the choice is not binary. Catholics believe “grace works through nature”, which implies, among other things, that God’s forgiveness can be experienced through human actions. Although Sigmund Freud, one of the founders of psychoanalysis, was an atheist for whom God was self-evidently the projection of human fatherhood, another, Carl Gustav Jung, was deeply concerned with spirituality. He thought the search for meaning and wholeness lay at the heart of human life and mythologies dramatised profound truths inexpressible in any other way. The use of analysis to help you understand your own actions, or “clarify things”, as Francis told his interviewer, is no different in principle from using modern medicine rather than praying for miraculous healing. Indeed, one of the Jesuit retreat houses in Britain is run by a psychotherapist. A great part of any priest’s pastoral work consists of counselling people and helping them through emotional distress, and psychological insight is necessary to help others and keep a check on the temptation to exploit such relationships. So in one sense, these revelations are not at all surprising. But two things about them will shock some traditionalists: the future pope’s analyst was a woman, and she was Jewish. Neither would have been conceivable before the reforming Vatican council of the 1960s, but they show the considerable distance that the pope and most of his church have travelled since then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/15/andy-warhol-jean-michel-basquiat-sandy-nairne-me-in-the-picture","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T13:00:08Z","webTitle":"‘It was surreal': the day I met Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/15/andy-warhol-jean-michel-basquiat-sandy-nairne-me-in-the-picture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/15/andy-warhol-jean-michel-basquiat-sandy-nairne-me-in-the-picture","fields":{"headline":"‘It was surreal': the day I met Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat","bodyText":"State Of The Art was a Channel 4 series I made, as a writer, with producer John Wyver and director Geoff Dunlop – the man crouching down on the far right. This was the early days of the channel; six hours of primetime TV on contemporary art wouldn’t happen now. Each episode was thematic: the final one, featuring Jean-Michel Basquiat, was on identity, culture and power. We filmed him working and did an interview in his studio in Great Jones Street, New York. I remember us sitting in a cafe late one night, waiting for him to come home – I’m pretty sure we weren’t the only media people in there. By 1985, Basquiat had shot to fame. He was still regarded as an artist connected to the Lower East Side music and street-art scene, yet was being exhibited in galleries. It happened really quickly: I first saw his work in the Times Square Show in 1980, when he was considered part of a new generation of talent, along with Keith Haring and Jenny Holzer. His work was striking: it had a graphic quality and a strangeness, full of words, symbols and colour. As a man, he was charming, but enigmatic and a little guarded. By the time we interviewed him, he was already swirling in myth. This photograph was taken by Paula Court shortly after that meeting, at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery, which was staging a show of Warhol and Basquiat – behind us is one of their collaborations. It was a surreal day: the pair were being shot and filmed for the Japanese magazine Brutus, and we were filming it all. We wanted to capture the buzz around them, to convey their fame. Basquiat turned up on a bike 45 minutes late, and Warhol an hour late. This picture was taken between takes: Geoff was chatting to Basquiat, and I was talking to Warhol. He was exactly as you’d expect – calm, clipped, polite and very controlled. Basquiat looks a bit sullen, but it was a relaxed morning, and they were joking around. For me, this photograph captures two of the world’s most outstanding artists at that time, who had become close. Warhol was more of a legendary figure, using emblems and signs in his works, but with Basquiat, you could feel the immediacy of his hands in his art. State Of The Art was broadcast in early 1987. Television critics hated it: with no presenter, and its thematic structure, it was too postmodern for them. Warhol died in February that year, and Basquiat in August 1988, from a heroin overdose. When an artist dies so young – he was 27 – they leave only so much work, so he has always been collectible. The majority of his art is still in private hands; a few of the collectors who discovered and supported him in the early 80s have hung on to his pieces. When they do come up for auction, they can fetch extraordinary sums: this May, a 1982 painting of his sold for $110.5m, a record for an American artist. I was flicking through the book of the series recently, and in my introduction to the second edition of 1990, I noted how much had changed. The Berlin Wall had fallen, and Warhol and Basquiat were dead. Without setting out to, we ended up catching an important moment. • Basquiat: Boom For Real is at the Barbican Art Gallery, London EC2, from 21 September to 28 January 2018.

I can hold a plank for more than a minute, run for a bus (and catch it), stand on my head – and very, very nearly do the splits. And yet 18 months ago, I couldn’t paint my own toenails. What makes this transformation even more remarkable is that it was triggered after I turned 50, just when I imagined it was too late to change the course of my oil tanker of a body. As I contemplated my sixth decade, I was heading for elasticated trousers, baggy sweaters and the inevitable health threats that go along with inaction. Then I discovered yoga. Lovely, mindful, relaxing yoga, which led to regular swimming. Walking helped me lose more than 12kg and has given me extra energy and less anxiety. Now, Norwegian scientists have discovered that, as a recent adopter of exercise, I may have halved the chance of having a stroke. In fact, late bloomers – ie, those in their 50s – have better health prospects than anyone who was once fit but has now stopped exercising. Although the study focused only on men, the lead researcher, Erik Prestgaard, says he believes the findings probably also apply to women. The last 10 years have been filled with work, motherhood and some ill health – there wasn’t time for exercise. The running never happened, the gym memberships were cancelled and the new bicycle slowly rusted without a turn of the wheel. The more inactive I became, the larger I grew and the less zip I had. On the rare occasion I did take to the road, my hips, knees and ankles were incensed. But, at the start of 2016, encouraged by a modest weight loss through a healthier diet, I made what was to become my final resolution. In 2010, I had been diagnosed with breast cancer and, as a women’s-magazine journalist, I was familiar with the warning stories about obesity and lack of exercise. I knew if I didn’t grab this second chance of health in my 50s, I would never, ever change. And so I did. Yoga seemed to me the way to go. As well as making me more flexible, it promised to make me more mindful. Plus it wasn’t as demanding as a session in the gym. (I’ve since found out that it can be every bit as tough, but ignorance drove me on.) I was shy about public Lycra-wearing and not knowing my crow from my lizard, so I looked for an online yoga course and found Adriene Mishler. Her free videos demanded no more of me than 30 minutes a day, and after that first month, I was hooked. With every session, the moves became easier and my stamina improved. One day, I ran up a flight of stairs and found I could still breathe. My feeble wrists strengthened to allow me to hold a downward dog without pain. Each day, after a brief shavasana (the best bit, where you lie on your back when the exertions are over) I would shower, roll up my mat and head to work with a newfound bounce to my step. One month in, I was ready for a public yoga class, and soon I was booking several sessions every week at the local gym. Eighteen months on, I am still practising at least three times a week – I have even been known to take my mat on holiday. I look forward to it being a constant comfort even when I am much older. I’m so happy that I found it. Yoga has led to walking, swimming, and an all-round feeling of wellbeing. Last year, I did the MoonWalk, a walking half-marathon to raise money for breast cancer research. I have discovered that when I haven’t time to exercise I miss it dearly. I think none of us really believes we can be fitter in the future than we are now, especially once we reach our middle years. That is really not so surprising. Ten years ago, I still had three children to support. Now, I am cash and time richer, plus I can reclaim the energies that I once poured into them. The trick, I think, is to find the exercise that suits you; the one you won’t dump when the reality of it kicks in and leaves you feeling more defeated and useless than ever. I was prompted by my 50th birthday, and the thought that for me, it was now or never. Except, as I discovered, that simply isn’t true."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"theobserver/2017/sep/02/observer-letters-brexit-second-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T23:05:27Z","webTitle":"How to give meaning to a second Brexit referendum | Observer letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2017/sep/02/observer-letters-brexit-second-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2017/sep/02/observer-letters-brexit-second-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Letters: how to give meaning to a second Brexit referendum","bodyText":"With reference to Vernon Bogdanor (“Why Britain’s voters must have a second referendum on Brexit”, Comment). While the fact that 87% voted for pro-Brexit parties does not prove that the country has accepted Brexit, it is undoubtedly true that the main parties opposing Brexit – the Scottish Nationalists, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and Plaid Cymru – all lost vote share. One possible explanation for this is that many people who voted Remain in the referendum do not regard Brexit as the most important factor determining their vote and were prepared to vote for pro-Brexit parties because they supported their other policies. Furthermore, if there had been a swing against government policy you would expect the Conservative vote to go down and the opposition to go up. But this did not happen. It is only true that there was a bigger swing to Labour than to the Conservatives. I agree that in order for a second referendum to be meaningful it would be necessary for there to be a clear understanding of the terms on which we would rejoin. But this assumes that the issue is a binary one. I am sure that there are sufficient electors who might wish to leave with no deal as to make it reasonable to include that on the ballot. Perhaps we could have a two-stage referendum: stage one to determine the final two options and stage two to make a final decision. This would be similar to the French presidential election. Turning to the question of changing the voting age, there are arguments both ways on the general principle. However, in the specific case of a second referendum, this would be seen by many as a deliberate attempt to gerrymander the vote by altering the electorate. So I think that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. Andrew Tampion Hinckley, Leicestershire Station building back on track Congratulations to Mark Townsend for highlighting the problems of Hordern, Co Durham, where getting to Sunderland, seven miles away, requires a circuitous sequence of buses (“Regeneration: how one proud pit village is starting to reverse the tides of misfortune”, News). Although Hordern does not have a rail service, it will be getting one soon. The government has agreed to contribute £4.4m to a £10.55m station with the aim of improving access to jobs in an area with low levels of car ownership. The new station will be near housing in Peterlee, and will also serve Shotton Colliery, Easington Colliery, Easington Village and Blackhall Colliery. It should take around 40 minutes to get to Newcastle, with services as well to Seaham, Sunderland, Heworth, Hexham, Hartlepool, Seaton Carew, Billingham, Stockton, Thornaby, Middlesbrough, James Cook, Marton, Gypsy Lane and Nunthorpe. Railfuture has been campaigning for years for communities such as Hordern to get their trains back and railways have proved remarkably successful in encouraging regeneration. Five new stations are to be built over the next three years, with help from the Department for Transport’s new stations fund. But many more are needed. More than 400 stations have been opened (or reopened) since 1960, along with 600 miles of new track, as revealed in Raifuture’s 2017 book, Britain’s Growing Railway. Ray King, editor, Railwatch London E9 An avoidable farce The negotiating stance of “constructive ambiguity” towards Europe, quoted by Andrew Rawnsley (Comment), who quotes Keir Starmer, who quotes David Davis, would better be described as “cowardly ambivalence”. Both Tory and Labour position papers on Brexit are little more than lists of aspirations, delivered with an arrogant assumption that the rest of Europe will be grateful for our final clarity on the matter – and they are far too late. I have no party affiliation, but it is clear that if dissident Tory and Labour MPs had backed the Liberal Democrats’ unambiguous position, both before and after the referendum, the dangerous farce that Brexit has become might have been avoided altogether. But that would have required courage. Instead, they subordinated the national interest to saving their political skins. That political cowardice has characterised the whole European debate from the beginning. Bill Angus Kendal Cumbria Planning for dementia Your science editor’s article on individuals who discover unwelcome predisposition to Alzheimer’s raises more issues (“Genetic ancestry tests stir anxiety over Alzheimer’s”, News). The incidence of dementia is on an upward curve. For the NHS and social care, this is an impending crisis. Foreknowledge of which patients on their list have an increased propensity for these diseases could be a useful diagnostic tool for GPs. I am in my 70s and have seen two close family members wither and die from dementia. I do not know how I would cope with knowing that I carry the Apo4 gene but I would want my GP to have that information. End-of-life planning can be positive, short or long term. Genetic information could contribute to that process and to the necessary debate on attitudes to suicide and assistance. Graham Kelly North Stoke, Oxfordshire Give modern grans their due It’s a great idea to write a children’s book about a grandma with dementia, but how many children can identify with the little old lady with a bun and cardie (“Grandma Forgets: The picture book that helps families cope with pathos of dementia?”, News). Their grandmothers are more likely to wear jeans and T-shirts, and may well be in their 50s or 60s. I’m older than that, but none of my generation of grannies looks remotely like the one pictured. I’m sure my granddaughters would agree with me. Sarah Carter Canterbury Not bog standard English Will Hutton’s “toilet currency” was a new one on me and with no shedding of light from the Oxford, Cambridge or even Urban dictionaries (“In Edinburgh, I understood…”, Comment).

Angus Fraser was named in a deposition in a case settled out of court in the United States in which he was alleged to have administered performance-enhancing drugs to former US junior cyclists in 1990 without their knowledge or consent. The Scotsman was also said to have injected riders on the British team ANC-Halfords with unknown substances in the 1980s. The Guardian understands Fraser has since made attempts to change his name to Kris Tolmie. He was able to get accreditation under the name Angus Fraser as a “helper” – a category usually reserved for mechanics and soigneurs – to attend the London Six Day event in 2015. It is thought he was working with Revolutions Racing, a team based in Shrewsbury. At the event, held in the Olympic velodrome, he was pictured in the track centre with Mark Cavendish as well as next to two young Danish riders. At the Gent Six Day in 2016 he was pictured on a massage bed sat next to the rider Chris Lawless, a product of the British Cycling development programme who currently represents the UCI Continental team Axeon-Hagens Berman and was aged only 21 at the time. There is no suggestion Fraser or any British rider was contravening anti-doping laws in any way but British Cycling admitted having someone with his reputation exposed to young riders would be concerning. A British Cycling spokesman said: “As soon as this matter was bought to our attention we contacted the club and then the relevant authorities – UK Anti-Doping and the NSPCC’s Child Protection in Sport Unit. There is absolutely no place in our sport for doping or for those who take advantage of vulnerable people. We are working to establish the facts and are ready to quickly take any appropriate action.” It is understood Usada, UKAD and the CPSU have told British Cycling that that they hold no information relating to Fraser. Nor has it found evidence of him working in an official capacity with young people for British Cycling. The investigation is ongoing. Stephen Swart, a New Zealand cyclist who rode for the British team ANC-Halfords in the 1980s, said in the book Seven Deadly Sins – about Lance Armstrong’s demise – that the riders were all rounded up and injected with an undetermined substance by Fraser. “We had complete confidence in this guy because we thought he knew what he was doing. Like if you go to the doctor when you are sick, you have confidence in him. “You think it can’t be very bad since it doesn’t test positive. And I wasn’t a big enough cyclist to have the right to ask questions. I remember two cyclists from the team who carried their own briefcases and it wasn’t papers that they carted around with them.” In 2006, USA Cycling paid two former junior cyclists $250,000 (around £194,000) to settle out of court after they alleged Fraser and their junior national team coach, René Wenzel, administered performance-enhancing drugs to them without their knowledge or consent. Greg Strock and Erich Kaiter claimed Fraser and Wenzel injected riders with cortisone, treated them with other steroids and provided them with amphetamines and other drugs on several occasions during the 1990 season. Both Strock and Kaiter, who was later diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, said the combination of drugs left them with suppressed immune systems and masked symptoms of what otherwise would have been easily treated illnesses. Fraser could not be reached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/05/end-university-tuition-fees-raise-taxation-peter-scott","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T06:15:34Z","webTitle":"The only fair way to end university fees is to raise taxation – sorry! | Peter Scott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/05/end-university-tuition-fees-raise-taxation-peter-scott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/05/end-university-tuition-fees-raise-taxation-peter-scott","fields":{"headline":"The only fair way to end university fees is to raise taxation – sorry!","bodyText":"The game is surely now up with student tuition fees. The growing unhappiness about the rising burden of graduate debt, the Labour party’s pledge to abolish fees, which gained unexpected traction in the election, even the road-to-Damascus recantation by Andrew Adonis, originally an enthusiast for fees, have all made free higher education thinkable again. The most common defence of fees was that “there is no (political) alternative”. And suddenly this seems no longer to be the case. The second line of defence – that fees are fairer, and therefore an attack on middle-class privilege – has been exposed as naive now that the downsides of a higher education “market” are becoming more apparent by the day. Universities have been forced into cut-throat competition for students, as demonstrated by the number of places available through clearing this month. The question now has to move on to what comes next. There are two options. The first is to restore “free” higher education, funded by general taxation, as Labour promised in its manifesto and as has been done in Scotland. The second is to introduce a graduate tax, as a fallback from fees. Restoring free higher education will be tough. Taxation has become increasingly regressive: taxes on consumption, such as VAT, have become more important, and income tax less so. Top rates of income tax have been reduced. But that is not an argument for giving up. The one clear message that came out of the election is that people are fed up with austerity – which hits the poor much harder. So ultimately there is no alternative – sorry! – to funding higher education through raising general taxation. And the only way to make this acceptable is to make the tax system fairer and more progressive. Most university leaders, if they cannot keep fees, would opt for a graduate tax – albeit reluctantly, because the proceeds would go to the government, whereas fees are paid more or less directly to universities. But a graduate tax is just a warmed-up version of tuition fees, as far as students are concerned. There are problems with all taxes that are specifically earmarked to fund particular services. It would surely not be fair for a poorly paid graduate to pay more tax than a better-off non-graduate. And it would still be a tax, so why not bite the bullet and make the argument for higher taxes all round? A graduate tax would never in any case be accepted by rightwing Conservatives, who are not remotely interested in social justice. Their driving goal is to produce a “market” in higher education, ideologically pure and commercially lucrative. After six years of high fees in England, and the more recent removal of any cap on student numbers, the grim outlines of that market are becoming plain: for-profit universities bought and sold, and details of these sales shielded from public gaze. Pop-up private colleges milking public funds and exploiting vulnerable students. Universities that have done the most to open higher education to the less advantaged, often the universities most crucial to building local skills bases, are now being forced to adopt survival strategies in which almost anything goes: setting up subsidiaries focused more on training and staffed by lecturers on less secure contracts; dramatic downsizing and cost cuttings. Meanwhile “top” universities are cramming in more students to fatten their balance sheets. None of this is in the public interest. But that, of course, is the point. The political drive behind high fees and this disruptive market is rooted in the belief that there is no such thing as the “public interest”. That drive has to be defeated. Otherwise universities will go further down the road to marketisation, with the same sort of dangers that exist in the National Health Service, as Stephen Hawking has so urgently described. It doesn’t matter how many special access schemes are arranged for disadvantaged students, or small-time bursary offers, when the entire system is geared towards creating inequality. It is time for university leaders to wake up, including any who mistakenly believe their institutions will never get caught out by this “market”. All universities, however eminent, will eventually be trapped in its web. Academic values will be subordinated to market advantage, even among them.

Middlesworth himself – one of three engineers who kept the Mail Rail complex dry and safe even after the system was abandoned in 2003 and the network was mothballed – retired a fortnight ago, but it is his recorded voice the visitors will hear in the trains, explaining his extraordinary workplace. His last works vehicle has become a museum piece, having seen even longer service than his 30 years. The locomotive was built when the Mail Rail first opened in 1927, to carry post through narrow curving tunnels six miles across the city between Paddington and Liverpool Street stations, stopping off at sorting offices along the way. It was battery powered so that maintenance crews could get to a troublespot even in the event of a power failure, and long after all the parts became obsolete Middlesworth made replacements to keep the loco running – some of his tinfoil and fuse wire repairs are still visible. Adrian Steel, director of the gleaming new Postal Museum behind Mount Pleasant in Clerkenwell, once one of the largest sorting offices in the world, of which the Mail Rail is part, described the public interest as “phenomenal”. All the train tickets for September have already sold out. Visitors will ride on two new trains, near-replicas of the originals but with (slightly) padded seats and better suspension. In the early stages of the project there were test runs with volunteers on the original rolling stock, which was never designed to carry human freight, and it was decided that the ride was so tooth-rattlingly uncomfortable it was impossible to use them. In the museum space beside the tracks there is a gleaming green locomotive that appears to have survived since 1927 in mysteriously mint condition. The explanation is one of the embarrassing secrets now revealed to the public gaze: before the service started, one of Middlesworth’s predecessors claimed the trains were too fat for the tunnels. Nonsense, his superiors insisted, and they launched the service – but he was proved right as the trains, loaded down with sacks, were unable to make the tight turns and got stuck. The system had to shut down again while new trains were built. One of the eeriest points of the journey is where riders can look down through an arch into a lower tunnel, tightly packed with old trains parked and gathering dust. Dozens more sleep in a stretch under Oxford Street, after it was judged too expensive to try to extract them. In the 1930s the last survivor of an even earlier system was discovered in a tunnel: a single battered car from the Victorian pneumatic railway, where compressed air was used to drive the trains through tunnels. The system proved expensive and unreliable, and ran only between 1863 and 1874, with many delays while trains stuck in tunnels were hauled free. At its 20th-century height, the Mail Rail carried four million letters a day. During the second world war, when a bomb damaged a tunnel in the Blitz, it was out of service for only a day. It became obsolete as the smaller sorting offices with rail platforms closed and were sold off. The Mail Rail closed in 2003 but the tunnels were maintained by Middlesworth and his two colleagues in case anyone ever thought of a new use for them – a mushroom farm was once proposed, and when Boris Johnson was London mayor he once urged their conversion into a cycle superhighway. The new museum displays part of a vast collection covering 500 years of postal history, including the first roadside postbox, designed by a then unknown young post office worker and author called Anthony Trollope, and a priceless sheet of Penny Black stamps. Another display deals with one of the more unusual delays to the post, when a lioness attacked one of the four horses drawing the Exeter-to-London mail coach on 20 October 1816. A Newfoundland dog then attacked the lioness, saving the horses and the terrified passengers. The enterprising owner of the travelling menagerie from which the lioness had escaped bought the horse and the dog and toured all three animals for years. Mail Rail opens from Monday. Admission to the Postal Museum, including a train ride, is £16 for adults."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/01/a-new-generation-of-premier-league-philosophers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T16:15:49Z","webTitle":"A new generation of Premier League philosophers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/01/a-new-generation-of-premier-league-philosophers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/01/a-new-generation-of-premier-league-philosophers","fields":{"headline":"A new generation of Premier League philosophers","bodyText":"I DON’T WANT TO GO TO CHELSEA The Fiver can’t remember whether it was Thales of Miletus or Dave Lee Roth of Van Halen who declared: “Whoever said money can’t buy happiness just doesn’t know where to go shopping.” But that doesn’t matter because what’s important is the message: mo’ money, mo’ larks. But that’s a shallow way to see the world, according to a new generation of Premier League philosophers. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fernando Llorente and Ross of Barkley are in the vanguard of a movement towards a more wholesome creed, which translates into a noble reluctance to join Chelsea. Once, Chelsea could attract any player they wanted simply by offering them houses made of diamonds and toilets of pure gold. But there’s been a paradigm shift. Some players are no longer charmed by lolly. Nor even, necessarily, by the lure of gleaming thrones or shiny trophies. For those players true wealth and happiness reside in human relationships and joyful expression. This doctrine is of course predicated on already being loaded but, all the same, it appears to have led Oxlade-Chamberlain to eschew Chelsea’s advances this week, Antonio Conte’s obsessive tactical rigour being much less fun than running around with giddy abandon at Liverpool and getting cuddles from Jürgen Klopp. Similarly, Llorente seems to have deduced that Spurs looks a more chipper place right now than Stamford Bridge. And late last night Barkley appears to have had a similar epiphany, so he backed out of a move to Chelsea, despite a transfer having been agreed, in order to return to hang around a while longer at Goodison Park. The decision left Chelsea bewildered, for what fulfilment could Barkley find at Everton when he returns from injury, bearing in mind that Wayne Rooney plays in a similar position and has got his mojo and fitness back? What Chelsea didn’t know – but what many other people did, possibly including Cheshire police following a photo tweeted from an upmarket bar by English cricketer Joel McIver – was that Rooney stepped out for some sustenance last night. At some point following that tweet, Rooney was arrested on suspicion of drink driving. He has been released on bail and is due to appear at Stockport magistrates court on Monday 18 September, the day after Everton play at Manchester United. No one knows what will happen from here. But Barkley may fancy his chances of getting more games for his boyhood team once he recovers from injury. Or maybe he twigged that in a few more months he can join a club for no transfer fee at all, potentially enabling him to trouser a massive sign-on fee and bigger wages.

The leisurewear company has introduced a staff survey system at its Shirebrook warehouse, Derbyshire, which was at the centre of allegations of “gulag” conditions last year after a Guardian investigation. When the warehouse’s 3,500 workers clock in, they are asked to press a touchpad featuring a happy or sad face emoji to indicate whether they are satisfied with working conditions. If they press sad, they are asked whether they are sure about their decision and, if they press it again, they can be called in by managers to discuss why they did so. Staff can be identified because the touchpad uses fingerprint recognition technology to identify those who express discontent. Unite said the staff survey system was “bogus” because workers were unlikely to be candid about their feelings if they could then be singled out for questioning. “Put yourself in their shoes,” said the union’s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner. “Would you risk having hours withheld, possibly losing your job and being called in by management because you indicated dissatisfaction with your work environment?” Turner described the survey as “a bogus exercise to gloss over past failures and some of the problems” which he said still persisted at the warehouse. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs of the work and pensions select committee, said an anonymous feedback system would be better. “All it will reveal is how brave some staff are,” he said. “We ought to extend it to MPs and see how they feel about Sports Direct.” Shirebrook became the focus of a parliamentary inquiry last year after a Guardian investigation revealed dismal working conditions, including body searches, pay below the minimum wage and constant fear of sacking for minor transgressions. Unite said conditions were still poor and that the “vast majority” of workers were on contracts that guaranteed no more than 336 hours a year. “With reports from agency workers of crowded aisles, defective warehouse equipment and products stacked dangerously high, we know that health and safety is still a major cause for concern,” said Turner. “Gimmicks like using emojis do not escape the fact that Sports Direct’s reliance on thousands of insecure agency workers still poses a reputational risk or that many are still owed money for non-payment of the minimum wage. “Sports Direct still has a long way to go to clean its act up and risks the charge of ‘business as usual’ until it makes temporary agency workers direct permanent employees.” Sports Direct said it had put in place multiple ways to protect staff and allow them to provide feedback. “We believe these comments by Unite do not accurately reflect the position at Sports Direct,” said a spokesperson. “We have a range of different measures in place to protect staff. These include a comprehensive system for staff to provide detailed feedback via an initiative called your company, your voice, plus a workers representative who attends meetings of the board.” Sports Direct also had a “staff listening group, a staff health and safety committee and a staff wellbeing service”, said the spokesperson. “Whilst we are disappointed with Unite’s stance we will continue to engage with the union, and we recently contacted Unite on this basis.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/12/hundreds-of-isis-defectors-mass-on-syrian-border-hoping-to-flee","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T10:56:28Z","webTitle":"Hundreds of Isis defectors mass on Syrian border hoping to flee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/12/hundreds-of-isis-defectors-mass-on-syrian-border-hoping-to-flee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/12/hundreds-of-isis-defectors-mass-on-syrian-border-hoping-to-flee","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds of Isis defectors mass on Syrian border hoping to flee","bodyText":"Hundreds of defectors from Islamic State have massed in Syria’s Idlib province, with many planning to cross the nearby Turkish border and find ways back to the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. Several dozen former fighters have already made it across the heavily patrolled frontier to towns and cities in Turkey’s south in recent weeks, the Guardian has confirmed. Four Saudi Arabian extremists arrived in a southern Turkish community in early September after paying smugglers $2,000 each for the perilous journey past border guards who have shot dead scores of infiltrators this year alone. The exodus of fighters from areas controlled by Isis to other parts of Syria and Iraq has continued throughout the past year, as the terror group has lost much of its former heartland to a concerted assault by Iraqi troops, forces allied to the Syrian regime and a US-led air coalition in both countries. However, large numbers of militants and their families are now trying to leave the war-battered states altogether – posing significant challenges to a global intelligence community that, for the most part, views them as a hostile and unmanageable threat, and sees limited scope for their reintegration. A Saudi national who fled Syria in late August told the Guardian that as many as 300 former Isis members, many of them Saudis, had established a community north of Idlib city, which is now dominated by the al-Qaida affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra. “Most want to leave, like me,” said the 26-year-old, who called himself Abu Saad. “A lot of them realise that the group they were with tricked them. Others don’t trust Nusra. There are not many who believe that the people that they were with were on the right path.” Abu Saad said the Saudi nationals, as well some Europeans, Moroccans and Egyptians, had gathered together as a buffer against al-Nusra, which has exerted its influence across Idlib and the surrounding countryside by toppling its rivals. Isis has not had an organised presence in the area since early 2014 when it was ousted by a rebel assault that saw its members flee east to the town of al-Bab in the Aleppo hinterland and further into Minbij, Tabqa, Raqqah and Deir Azzour. Former members of the group, however, have steadily been returning to Idlib and seeking refuge since late 2015. “That was when I left,” said Abu Saad, speaking days after he arrived in southern Turkey. “Others joined me later, and more are coming now.” The full scale of the extremist exodus from Isis-held parts of Iraq and Syria remains unclear, with most of the land it conquered having been recaptured, leaving a divided and demoralised rump with next to nowhere to hide. One of Isis’s two main centres of power – Mosul in Iraq – fell in February, and the other – Raqqa in Syria – is slipping further into the hands of US-backed Kurdish forces who had already hounded the group from most of Syria’s northeast. Tens of thousands of Isis fighters are believed to have been killed in the battle to retain territory it seized from mid-2014, and thousands more homegrown extremists are believed to have returned to their communities. But the numbers of foreign fighters who have survived and are looking to return to their homes have been more difficult to gauge. So too have the true intentions of men who had allied themselves to the world’s most feared terror group during its ascendancy, but claim no further part of it as its reach and influence dwindles. French officials have said privately that they would rather that nationals who travelled to join Isis died on battlefields and have no plans to support those who now want to return. Other European states have expressed similar sentiments. Isis defectors had at one point been of high interest to intelligence agencies who had made little ground in penetrating the group as it consolidated a hold on swaths of Syria and Iraq and plotted attacks in Europe and beyond. As the group has capitulated, MI6, the CIA and France’s DGSE have had increasing access to informants whom they have met within Kurdish controlled areas of Syria’s north-east and in northern Iraq. The increased access to informants with real-time information has left those who fled earlier with less leverage over governments who might otherwise have agreed to talk with them. “It’s a lot better than it used to be,” said one intelligence official. “We have a more complete picture than we did.” Abu Saad said he would not return to Saudi Arabia if doing so meant a prison sentence. “A rehabilitation programme? Maybe,” he said. “I went to Syria some time in 2012. I went to support the Syrian people and in the first few months I was with the Muhajirin (an auxiliary group of foreign fighters). “It wasn’t until early the next year that my unit swore allegiance to Isis. It was a poisoned flower. It wasn’t what I expected.” As the group’s fate worsened, tensions increased within its ranks, Abu Saad claimed. Summary executions were carried out on increasingly flimsy pretexts, such as insubordination, or making contact with Syrian opposition groups, he said. Over time, arguments about the ideology and theology also intensified. “They don’t understand the Tawheed (the oneness of God). They are always arguing about it. I saw no justice with them. I saw cruelty. But how could I disagree? It had such a hierarchy. Everyone has a boss who they are afraid of. And above them all was [Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]. He was the ultimate authority and no one could argue with him about religious law. If you tried to defy them about anything, you put yourself in danger. “My job was to inspect prisons. If there were abuses then I would report on them. One time in Minbij, there was a lady in a cell for 13 days with no toilet and no water for cleaning. She was there because she threatened to kill a man who had killed her husband. There was worse than that though. There were people in prison who had done nothing wrong at all. “In Idlib, there are around 300 people trying to escape. Many of them are Saudis. Some want to see their families one last time and they say they will accept what’s coming to them. I don’t know any of them who believe in the [Islamic] State. They all ran away for a reason.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/01/penelope-gazin-kate-dwyer-women-sexism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T14:50:27Z","webTitle":"When women sign off emails as men, doors open.

It's like magic!","bodyText":"Picture this: you’re a woman. You’ve got a great idea for a startup, but you’re having trouble getting people to work with you on it. You have a sneaking suspicion it’s because of your gender ... although then again, it could all be in your head. What do you do? Invent a male co-founder, of course. A pair of artists and entrepreneurs named Penelope Gazin and Kate Dwyer elicited grim laughter from women all over this week when they revealed they’d done just that in their quest to get their startup off the ground. While the two friends believed they had a good idea in “Witchsy”, an online marketplace for offbeat, feminist, and yes, witchy art, they found the largely male designers and developers they hired to help them were slow-moving and disrespectful. And so, to speed things along, they brought on a third co-founder: a fictional character named Keith (what else?) Mann. “It was like night and day,” Dwyer told Fast Company. “It would take me days to get a response, but Keith could not only get a response and a status update, but also be asked if he wanted anything else or if there was anything else that Keith needed help with.” Imagine that. While it might seem like old news that men get an automatic level of respect not enjoyed by women or gender non-binary folks, a shocking number of people still haven’t gotten the memo. (Of course, this disparity is also true for white v non-white Americans.) According to the Pew Research Center, some 59% of US men – a simple majority – refuse to believe that sexism exists. This army of deniers may have played some part in convincing some 37% of women not to believe it, either. When people reject a systemic explanation for why women and non-white people have lower pay and and are underrepresented in certain professions, they often blame biological inferiority, a theory often justified by the dicey field of “evolutionary psychology”. That these ideas have long been discredited did not stop a now former Google employee from parroting them in the anti-diversity manifesto heard ’round the world. He might have been fired swiftly, but rest assured he’s not the only tech bro who holds such views, either consciously or unconsciously. When men deny the existence of sexism, that message leaks into female minds and manifests in things like “imposter syndrome”, or the feeling that we know nothing about anything and everything we’ve accomplished is a fluke. I realize men have moments of self-doubt too; I invite them to imagine how much worse said moments would be if an unspecified number of their colleagues believed their true calling was acting as a receptacle for their seed. The looming threat of bias colors your world and makes you second-guess your own perceptions. Was that guy talking down to me, or am I just being hysterical? This phenomenon is not limited to tech. When the music journalist Jessica Hopper put out a call for women in the music industry to air their grievances via Twitter, she was inundated with stories of everything from annoying microaggressions to straight-up rape. After receiving lukewarm responses from most literary agents, the novelist Catherine Nichols submitted the same novel under a male name and watched the offers come rolling in. And while I’m a vocal critic of Hillary Clinton’s politics, I would never deny that sexism played a role in her loss to a supremely unqualified huckster when running for the top job in the country. I personally have weathered no small amount of unequal treatment in my quest to survive within capitalist patriarchy. From guys with cameras who broke the “no touching” rule to the boss who asked me back to his apartment after office drinks, I’m well acquainted with the workings of sexism. Nine times out of 10, I’ve laughed it off. Not because I like being degraded, but because I needed the work, and had no union to protect my rights. Of course, I’d be a bad socialist feminist if I did not point out sexism is not only the result of individual bad actors (although it certainly can be) but woven into the very fabric of capitalism. Among other things, it allows those in charge to shame us into buying things we don’t need, underpay female workers, and naturalize valuable labor like cooking and childcare so that we’ll do it for cheap and/or free. Dismantling this will take a continuing, coordinated effort. For now, it will have to be enough to remind the 63% of women who believe in sexism that they’re not crazy, and to remind everyone else to open their eyes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/03/i-intelligent-compact-nothing-like-as-cheap-independent","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T06:00:36Z","webTitle":"The i: as intelligent and compact as ever, but nothing like as cheap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/03/i-intelligent-compact-nothing-like-as-cheap-independent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/03/i-intelligent-compact-nothing-like-as-cheap-independent","fields":{"headline":"The i: as intelligent and compact as ever, but nothing like as cheap","bodyText":"The i newspaper has lived, pretty successfully, under the radar for seven years now. It’s a very bright notion from the creative era of the old Independent. Condense, re-format, re-purpose – and produce a terse, intelligent summation of the day’s news that busy commuters can enjoy. Price was key from the start: 20p a copy, the creation of a whole new market for quality journalism. There was a change of ownership in April 2016 when a regional giant, Johnston Press, paid £24m as the old Indy departed to find a wholly digital future. But many commentators from the print days were still made available to the i. The little brother, crisply edited by Oly Duff and a small team, sailed on. Johnston’s first-half results a few weeks ago seemed suitably buoyant. Circulation revenue for the i increased from £4.4m to £11m and advertising revenue was said to be up from £0.8m to £3m (over a slightly different period). The i’s upward trajectory was forecast to continue as “advertisers seek out a quality, impartial, concise, daily national news provider”. But pause for a moment. The cover price goes up again on Monday, from 50p to 60p. The Saturday edition, 30p when it began in 2011, will hit 80p this week. Duff lays his dilemma on the line. Paid-for journalism is facing “an unprecedented challenge from the avalanche of free, and often not very good, articles online. The types of journalism that hold the powerful to account and shine a spotlight on society are of little interest to many digital media, especially platforms like Facebook which gobble advertising revenue without any regard for the social contract that once existed between reader and publisher.” You can feel much sympathy for that view, and for his sadness that the post-Brexit pound has pushed up costs. Yet a hole in the strategy is starting to appear. Of course Johnston has a massive regional struggle on its hands. Chief executive Ashley Highfield is looking on the bright side: “I am very pleased to announce that we have posted revenue growth in the business (excluding classifieds) of 4.6% during the half”. But “excluding classifieds” (down from £24.3m to £17.3m) is a slightly circuitous pathway to the sun. Classified revenues themselves are down from £24.3m to 17.3m (that’s minus 28.8%). Thus the squeeze is on for everyone, including the profitable i. The next question is unavoidable. Can a slim, cost-effective briefing paper keep bunging up its price year after year, especially when sales are down 9.75%? If Johnston Press has the will and resources to make it stronger, that’s excellent. Perhaps 60p will slip by OK; perhaps not. But the crucial basis of the i’s appeal and pitch is on the line here. Can an escalating price ever be right? • William Rees-Mogg (aka Mystic Mogg in Private Eye) was a failed Tory candidate who became editor of the Times. He was orotund, a courtly gent who departed to his club just after six every editing evening. He was also (as the Observer’s Anthony Howard remarked) a master of “yellow journalism”. Like father, like son? “Mr Juncker’s effort to extort money from us shows he is an amateur even at blackmail. He has nothing to intimidate us with and the British people always stiffen their sinews when threatened… Mr Juncker is a pound-shop Bismarck, arrogant and bullying but without the charm,” Jacob Rees-Mogg declares.

At least not in the way my mother is. Or I am. My siblings and I lived with the comforting and affirming knowledge that he loved us – and if there’s one single thing you could ask from your father, apart from a trust fund, it’s this – but, when it came to Dad, cuddles, kisses and other acts of physical intimacy were rarely instigated by him. He’d always acquiesce when we nuzzled up to his barrel chest, or kissed his bearded cheek, or slipped under his arm as he lay in bed on one of those gloriously indolent Sunday mornings. And some evenings as he watched TV he’d induce us to sit on his shoulders so we could massage his bald patch. “It will stimulate the follicles and the hair will grow back,” he explained, keeping a straight face. We didn’t care that he had a bald patch but the task meant we’d get to watch more TV, so I’d go to bed later than usual with the comforting smell of his scalp on my fingers. Despite all that I often had a sense that Dad remained forever surprised, or at times even embarrassed, by the physical manifestation of our affection for him. I share Dad’s reserve, and his tendency to introversion – one that meant his emotional universe was one you’d frustratingly only get glimpses of, as if from the pointy end of a telescope. If I’m similar to my father in this regard – though I try not to be – I differ in that, for me, it feels like the most natural thing in the world to tell my children I love them and to further express that love through physical affection. It’s a vital part of the way I’ve bonded with my daughters, aged seven and 10. There’s a time when this sort of thing comes to its natural end, and I can sense its approach now like the smell of rain in the air, so I’m hungry for what I can get before we enter a new phase of our lives together. One that I assume will involve, on their parts, much more eye-rolling than hand-holding. So until then we hug, we kiss, we spill over each other on the couch, we wrestle and tickle until they scream for me to stop and when I do, they beg me to start back up again. I chase them down the hallway, roaring, and they flee, screaming, and not entirely for dramatic effect, before jumping on my bed. When I catch them up, I toss them about and I experience an extension of my own sense of proprioception to know where their flipping and turning bodies are in space at any given moment. If I’m not pinning their shoulders to the mattress and dramatically counting out “One! Two! Three!” I’m pretending to suddenly fall asleep mid-wrestle – the kind of deep sleep you’d fall into during your child’s school music concert without your partner’s elbow in your ribs. This leaves them battling and struggling to get out from under my dead weight. If they ever have to muscle a corpse into the boot of a car, they’ll have some experience to call upon. If I leave them with nothing else, they’ll have that. My ease with physical intimacy with my daughters is a gift from my tactile mother but it may have happened anyway. With me being a freelance writer, it made sense that when my partner’s two maternity leave stints came to an end she would return to the responsibility and burden of being the main breadwinner and I would take on the larger share of the at-home duties. This meant fitting my writing around the kids, the washing machine, the stove, excursions to the supermarket, the park, and not the other way around. Ten years on, I know well the toil at-home parenting involves and, at times, the negativity it spawns. Conditioned as a man to believe that the only work of any value is the kind that furthers you intellectually, creatively and, in particular, financially, I regularly endure periods where I devalue myself and entertain the notion that I am wasting time, treading water, not contributing. I’ve felt that many times, usually in the periods between the publication of my articles or books, as if only these paid accomplishments are of value, and not the rearing of, and all the time spent with, happy, contented children who hum as they eat their dinner, who curl into you when you still read to them at night long after they’ve learnt to read themselves. Hand in hand with that comes the self-doubt that all parents entertain. Am I doing a good job with my children? Am I devoting enough time to them? Am I doing whatever I’m doing for their sake and not mine? Am I taking out my frustrations on them? Am I doing too much dictating and not enough facilitating? Am I screwing them up more than is normal? Amid it all, I watch all the lovely moments, the little things, come and go knowing they’ll soon be forgotten, and I mourn their passing. Fortunately this fog always lifts, and I see that for all the Groundhog Day inevitability of another dinner to make, another school lunch to pack, another load of washing to hang out, raising kids is not just a necessary job but a noble, rewarding enterprise. It’s humbling, too, especially since your children can’t comprehend it. When my youngest, Ada, returned from school recently to find there was no bread in the house she asked, with some irritation: “What have you been doing all day?” Not until your children have children of their own will they realise. To be alive for that moment is as good a reason for any parent to live a long life. Being an at-home parent makes intimacy with your children all but impossible to avoid – even if you’re not of the school of parents who’ll sniff a pair of kids’ underpants they find on the floor to see whether they are clean or dirty; a parent’s version of Russian roulette. In those first 10 or so years of being a parent, especially, one’s previously well-maintained fortifications of personal space and sanctity are torn down and tossed on a bonfire. I read recently that the stereotype of the strict, aloof Victorian father is not fully deserved. Nevertheless it seems uncontroversial to state that, historically, the vast majority of fathers avoided cleaning up the steady stream of shit, piss, pus, spit, phlegm, blood, vomit and whatnot that goes along with raising a dependent human being. They never dragged nit combs through their child’s hair or lanced their boils or cut their nails or brushed their teeth or patched up their cuts and scrapes or even wiped their tears away with a swipe of the thumb. Instead, it was accepted that as all this was going on in another room, they could sit in their dens with their newspapers and glasses of Scotch and get on with the important business of being a man. But that was then. Like many other fathers, I know I’m up to my elbows in it. In some ways I’ve revelled in it. When my daughter, Abbie, was about six months old, I sucked snot from her nose when every other effort to relieve her considerable discomfort failed. Standing in the doorway of her bedroom, where the soft light from the hallway illuminated her distress, I cradled her in my arms, clamped my lips around her tiny snout and sucked as if trying to syphon petrol through a snaking length of hose. Unfortunately – or fortunately – my efforts were more or less unsuccessful. Having steeled myself for a foul onrush, I managed only to extract a viscous dollop of something or other. Abbie’s nose remained blocked, if a little shinier. When, later, I told people of what I’d done, I was acknowledging, to myself, to others, the element of stunt to the whole affair. Yet at the same time I was sharing a story that I hoped would graphically illustrate the depths of my love and, in lieu of a careening bus in front of which to throw myself, the sacrifices I was willing to make for my children. Remember that, Abbie, when you visit me in the nursing home. If any man has a yearning to be a father, I wasn’t one of them. As a boy I always figured, I’d have children at some point in my life because – like watching the news, laughing loudly at dinner parties, and getting angry behind the wheel of a car – that’s what adults did. But even as I grew into a man I never longed to have children with the kind of primal, biological ache we attribute to women whether it applies to them or not. Like most other men, then, when it came to the decision about the best time to start a family, I ceded to the imperative of my partner, rather than my own. The irony, then, is that from the moment Abbie was dragged into the world at the end of a pair of forceps, I was smitten. She was puffy-eyed, bruised and bloody, and her head resembled a missile, but I was happier than I’d ever been in my life and my tears fell on her face as I leaned in to kiss her. “Hello, my darling,” I said to her, and I’ve been saying the same thing to her – and then Ada – every morning, and plenty of afternoons too, for the past 10 years. Similarly, I’ve spent that time impressing myself upon them, hoping to make a good impression in their lives as my father made in mine, though I go about it in my own way. A hug and kiss here, a fatherly stunt there. Only last week I placed a ladder on top of Ada’s bed mattress so that I could climb to reach a switch on a ceiling fan. Of course I should have moved the bed out of the way first but it’s heavy and cumbersome and that wouldn’t have been at all entertaining. So despite my daughters’ protestations – “I’m telling Mum,” Ada warned – they were good enough to hold the ladder for me. And as the mattress moved under the ladder, as I swayed like a sailor in the riggings, I could see them down there on the poop deck, their little faces showing such signs of worry, illicit pleasure, and love as to make the whole exercise a roaring success.

On Thursday night, however, that goal looks big enough as the Socceroos’ chances of automatically qualifying for Russia 2018 were put in jeopardy after they were defeated 2-0 by Japan in Saitama. A first ever win on Japanese soil would have ensured Australia’s qualification but, instead, it is Japan – who scored a goal in each half, the sealer coming in the 82nd minute – who have guaranteed their passage to Russia. Australia, meanwhile, level on points with Saudi Arabia, and keen to avoid a third-place play-off scenario, must now beat Group B cellar-dwellers Thailand on Tuesday night in Melbourne in the final round of qualifying. Moreover, they may also need to win handsomely in order to edge out Saudi Arabia on goal difference in the event the gulf state team defeats Japan on Wednesday morning in Jeddah. How crucial now those four draws in qualifying; draws that always had the feel of potential ghosts waiting to haunt the Socceroos, especially that howling, chain-clinking 2-2 draw against Thailand in Bangkok last November. Of a more pressing concern for Postecoglou, however, is lifting his team that lacked sharpness, polish and, tonight at least, an ill Aaron Mooy. Australia’s night got off to a sombre start with the news breaking just before kick-off that the veteran Fairfax and Fox Sports football journalist Michael Cockerill had died, aged 56. Commentator Robbie Slater all but broke down on air as he paid tribute to Cockerill, a tireless advocate for the game over decades. There was no lift in spirits once the game began. For a team leading the group heading into the match, Japan chewed its collective nails in the build-up, but you wouldn’t have known it by the way the Blue Samurai started. With big names Keisuke Honda, Shinji Kagawa and Shinji Okasaki on the bench, Japan began brightly, the blade of their attack catching the stadium lighting just so. Buoyed by a boisterous crowd of 60,000, they pressed Australia high up the pitch, winning a couple of early corners for their efforts. Central defenders Trent Sainsbury and Matt Spiranovic were given plenty of work to do early on but both looked composed and made some telling interceptions. It wasn’t until the seventh minute that the Socceroos made a threatening incursion into Japanese territory, one that ended up with Tom Rogic taking a weak side-foot volley from the edge of the area after Japan failed to clear a James Troisi corner. Though Australia dominated first-half possession (58%-42%) most of it was in their own half. When they did enjoy possession higher up the pitch they struggled to find the right ball from midfield and Robbie Kruse, who started as a lone frontman, seemed to lack support, though Brad Smith was active on the left flank – even if at times he looked rustier than a bike left out in the rain, his touch and pass heavy. It was hardly surprising given his lack of minutes for his Premier League side Bournemouth so far this season. Australia’s best moment came late in the first half. In the 32nd minute Troisi slipped past Takashi Inui on the right touchline as if the latter were wearing lead boots. He then pushed a curling through-ball into the path of Kruse but there was a tad too much weight on it and keeper Eiji Kawashimi was able to collect it. Six minutes later Massimo Luongo brought down a Troisi pass on his chest and beat two defenders with a sudden u-turn before finding Matthew Leckie on his inside. Leckie came within a paint job of putting the Socceroos ahead when his low shot deflected off the legs of Maya Yoshida before striking the far post with Kawashimi beaten. Those efforts aside, the half belonged largely to Japan who showed more enterprise and more willingness to press forward in numbers. While they lacked finesse in the final third at times they fashioned a number of opportunities, first when Takuma Asano sent a header into the side netting following a cross from the left wing. Asano got another similar chance later in the half after Yuto Nagatomo crossed after some lovely tight passing in midfield. The break-through came in the 41st minute when Nagatomo cut inside Leckie on the left wing and sent a low trajectory cross to the six-yard box. The excellent Asano, who threatened throughout the half, had ghosted away from his marker, Smith, to side foot home. Smith looked forlornly to the linesman for a flag that wasn’t forthcoming. In the end Australia were fortunate to go the break just one down. A minute after the goal Asano linked with Gōtoku Sakai on the right wing and his inch-perfect cross found Yuya Osako who, under pressure, volleyed just wide. The second half was dominated by Japan who had a chance in the 77th minute to put the game to bed. Inside his own half Ideguchi started a move that saw substitute Genki Haraguchi careen into space down the left channel. His cross evaded five gold shirts as it travelled through the Australian penalty box to where Idegucki was waiting to meet it with time to triangulate his options. After taking a touch he drove his shot towards the far post where it would have rippled the net but for Sainsbury putting his body on the line. Shortly after Japan coach Vahid Halilhodžić stormed onto the field to protest a strong challenge by Mark Milligan, Japan scored the goal that ensured victory. After Haraguchi pilfered the ball from the feet of Luongo he shuttled the ball out to Ideguchi, still with plenty to do, and with Jackson Irvine in his face.

Right now, he's waist-deep in them","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull likes to talk about wicked problems. Right now, the prime minister is waist-deep in them. Next week, the high court will hear a challenge to the same-sex marriage postal plebiscite, and determine whether that proposal lives or dies. If it dies, and constitutional law experts such as George Williams suspect it will, marriage equality will fly back in the direction of the parliament like a small, dangerous torpedo. The dual citizenship imbroglio, meanwhile, thunders on, cluttering up the landscape and potentially imperilling the government’s lower house majority. In the midst of all this uncertainty, the government is quietly piecing together the elements of its energy policy. On Friday, the government will receive one critical input. The Australian Energy Market Operator has been asked to take a close look at Australia’s requirements for baseload power at a time when ageing coal-fired generators are starting to leave the system. The government needs this technical information because it will influence a range of decisions it will attempt to make in the next little while. I want to do readers a favour now and strip out all the rancid internals, ignore, for a moment, the fact that Tony Abbott (amplified by his media boosters and backers) intends to pursue Malcolm Turnbull doggedly with his “coal is good for humanity” campaign as the prime minister attempts to settle the government’s response to the Finkel review. I suspect we’ll hear enough about the intrigues shortly. For now, let’s just focus on the substance, minus all the migraine-inducing Game of Thrones madness. Right now the government is looking at a national electricity grid where renewables are coming on rapidly, gas power is very expensive and ageing coal assets are heading for retirement. As a direct consequence of the most catastrophic public policy failure that has been visited on the Australian public – the toxic climate policy wars of the past decade (thanks, Tony) – investors have lacked the policy certainty they require to make decisions. The government has to end the uncertainty if we want to keep the lights on, keep industry moving and meet our obligations under the Paris agreement. So, very shortly, it needs to decide whether or not to adopt the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist Alan Finkel. If the target is still happening, and the word is it’s still alive despite those rancid internals I’m trying not to linger on, then the government needs to decide where to set the threshold for determining who gets certificates. Which brings us neatly to coal. While the querulous contemporary right in Australia shows every sign of being entirely post materialist – fixated with the fate of James Cook statues, the perils of feminism and pesky gays wanting to make marriage genderless and put boys in dresses – one quasi economic fight lingers. Coal persists, studded liberally through the talking points on Sky News after dark, and on 2GB. Coal needs to be accommodated. I just want to mention that before returning to plotting the various points of the energy policy compass. I don’t know what the AEMO report will tell the government about the baseload power requirements during this period of transition, but I think it’s reasonably safe to assume the market operator will say we don’t have enough dispatchable power in the system. If so, the government’s task is to ensure there is enough baseload power in the system while we transition to a lower emissions future, and to a future where power generation in Australia is increasingly decentralised. Logic takes us to the nub question: do we need a new coal or gas plant, and if we do, who builds it, the government or the private sector? Gas, I’ve already mentioned, is expensive. That’s not the government’s easy fix. So if you think the way the government thinks, the next logical landing point is coal. The government then has to consider the economics of new “clean” coal builds. They are an expensive proposition, with distinct risks. There is carbon risk and there is political risk – added to the fact that it would take years to build a new plant, so you don’t really have a quick solution to what is largely a transitional problem. So then, back at wicked problems HQ, the next landing point is: can we prolong the life of existing coal plants? Can you make them hang around in the system a bit longer while you push ahead with Snowy Hydro, and with bolting in storage to renewable power generation to deal with intermittency problems? As the government moves into the final decision-making stage of energy policy, there is persistent talk around the traps about extending the operating life of the Liddell coal-fired power plant in New South Wales, set to close in five years’ time. While rightwing culture warriors are fond of banging on about the virtues of cheap coal-fired power, the reality is this: the only form of cheap coal-fired power is the power generated by existing assets, such as Liddell. When the government met privately with Australia’s energy companies (including AGL, which owns Liddell) in early August, the future of the ageing assets came up, and the operators telegraphed a distinct lack of interest in extending the life of their coal plants. Liddell is due to close in 2022. Anyone who turns on a television would already know that AGL in a business sense is already in a whole other place. It has a feelgood marketing campaign predicated on the company getting out of coal from 2022. So if the government wants to push out Liddell’s operating life to solve one transitional problem, and AGL isn’t interested, then we get into territory like how might the government intervene in the market, and at what cost, both in dollars and emissions. All this is swirling around as our parliamentarians prepare to make their journey back to Canberra next week. The government knows the energy policy resolution cannot be squibbed. Having now made itself politically responsible for power prices by picking a cheap fight over Jay Weatherill’s wind farms, which triggered a cascading and at times deeply contradictory sequence ending up in the prime minister getting bogged down in the billing practices and customer communications of electricity retailers – the government now needs to show voters it’s fixing a substantive problem. Now that I’ve laid out the policy dilemma, we can track back, briefly, into politics. We are all painfully aware the Coalition collectively has incredible trouble being sensible when it comes to climate change and energy policy, and we know the Finkel fight is a proxy war to indulge other animus. We know that a prime minister in all sorts of trouble is responding to his current difficulties by trying to put one foot in front of the other. What we don’t yet know is whether a government battling difficulties on multiple fronts can keep its nerve and produce sensible policy. Recent weeks have not given any sensible person cause for hope – but this is a test the Turnbull government cannot afford to fail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/aug/31/laughing-gas-still-illegal-despite-court-decisions-government-says","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T08:21:52Z","webTitle":"Laughing gas still illegal despite court decisions, UK government says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/31/laughing-gas-still-illegal-despite-court-decisions-government-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/aug/31/laughing-gas-still-illegal-despite-court-decisions-government-says","fields":{"headline":"Laughing gas still illegal despite court decisions, UK government says","bodyText":"Prosecutors could in future decline to bring charges against people suspected of crimes linked to laughing gas after two cases collapsed when courts heard the substance was exempt from the law designed to ban it. The Crown Prosecution Service has indicated that it is considering the effect of the two failed prosecutions on its future charging decisions. But the government insisted that despite the cases, nitrous oxide is illegal under the 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act. “Obviously, we have had two cases with similar outcomes, so we are considering the implications for future cases after those,” the CPS said on Thursday. While no decision has been taken on whether to change the way charging decisions are made, the cases raise the prospect that one may follow. Although the judge in one of the cases stressed that it did not set a legal precedent, there have been calls to review the dozens of convictions under the act. A case at Southwark crown court in London was thrown out this week after the court heard that an expert witness for the prosecution defined nitrous oxide as not being covered by the act, which was brought in to ban what were formerly known as legal highs. That followed the collapse of a case against two people charged with intending to supply the substance at Glastonbury this year. The judge at Taunton crown court, Paul Garlick QC, said nitrous oxide was “plainly an exempted substance” on the evidence put before him, according to Metro. The defence teams successfully argued that nitrous oxide, which can be used for pain relief, was covered by an exemption allowing medicinal products, various reports said. The judge sitting in Southwark, David Tomlinson, said it was not a test case, the BBC reported. And the Home Office stressed this point, saying it believed that the act still banned nitrous oxide and each case would have to be decided on its individual circumstances. “Nitrous oxide is covered by the Psychoactive Substances Act and is illegal to supply for its psychoactive effect,” a spokesman said. “However, the act provides an exemption for medical products. Whether a substance is covered by this exemption is ultimately one for a court to determine based on the circumstances of each individual case. “Since the Psychoactive Substances Act came into force, more than 300 retailers across the UK have either closed down or are no longer selling psychoactive substances. Police have arrested suppliers and action by the National Crime Agency has resulted in the removal of psychoactive substances being sold by UK-based websites. “These dangerous drugs have already cost far too many lives and the act is sending out a clear message: this government will take whatever action is necessary to keep our families and communities safe.” According to the BBC, the drugs charity Release said: “The CPS must urgently drop all prosecutions under the Psychoactive Substances Act and review cases where defendants have previously pleaded guilty.” The Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said his party had always argued that the blanket ban on all psychoactive substances was unworkable. “This latest failure reeks of government incompetence. They have brought forward a law that is both unnecessary and undeliverable. It is time the government started to look at the evidence. We must follow what works, not ham-fistedly force through draconian laws,” he said. “The war on drugs has been a disaster from its inception. Drug use should be dealt with as a health issue. Users should be treated, not locked up, freeing up valuable police resources to tackle the dealers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/31/zama-review-lucrecia-martel-emerges-from-the-wilderness-with-a-strange-sensual-wonder","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T06:05:30Z","webTitle":"Zama review – Lucrecia Martel emerges from the wilderness with a strange, sensual wonder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/31/zama-review-lucrecia-martel-emerges-from-the-wilderness-with-a-strange-sensual-wonder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/31/zama-review-lucrecia-martel-emerges-from-the-wilderness-with-a-strange-sensual-wonder","fields":{"headline":"Zama review – Lucrecia Martel emerges from the wilderness with a strange, sensual wonder","bodyText":"Lucrecia Martel is the elusive poet of Latin-American cinema, missing believed lost, the Mary Celeste in human form. She made La Cienaga and The Holy Girl; split the Cannes audience in two with her brilliant, maddening The Headless Woman. And then, all at once, Martel seemed to vanish. There were rumours that she had been unwell, or that she spent years kick-starting a stalled science-fiction picture, or that she’d embarked on a long boat trip right up the Amazon. I think I like the third option the best. It makes her sound like Mr Kurtz. Now Martel is back, after a nine-year absence, with the astonishing Zama, adapted from a novel by Antonio Di Benedetto, about an 18th-century Spanish colony perched on the Asuncion coast. Her film is haunted, haunting and admittedly prone to the occasional longueur insofar as it runs to its own peculiar rhythm; maybe even its own primal logic. It arrives in Venice as if blown in from another world. Audaciously, Martel refuses to provide date or a location, let alone any handy background information. She’d rather set us down at the water’s edge and leave us to find our own way from there, mixed in amid the other colonialists and settlers who cling to this desolate lip of the land, sweating buckets beneath their periwigs. Soon enough we encounter Don Diego de Zama (Daniel Gimenez Cacho). He serves as the crown’s magistrate, a Spanish functionary, but his pleas for a transfer are being constantly rebuffed. He’s pining for home, for cold weather; lying in the grass to ogle women bathing and dreaming of “Russian princesses wrapped up in their furs”. Beyond the settlement there is the jungle, the wilds. This is reputed to contain masked warriors, painted ghouls and a terrifying brigand named Vicuna, who may already be dead, assuming he ever existed at all. But these, perhaps, are mere distractions. Basically Zama is a film about a man who waits, unhappily, for his own release. I hope Martel won’t have to wait a further nine years before she makes her next film. She’s too good a director to be sat on the sidelines for long and Zama may just be her left-field masterpiece; a picture that’s antic, sensual and strange, with a top-note of menace and a malarial air. The heat is intense; the settlers go berserk. Nobody here is quite stable; nothing can be trusted. When Don Diego finally encounters the grinning Vicuna in a meadow at midnight, one half-wonders if he’s suffering from some sick hallucination. But then this fabulous film is full of so many odd scenes – and some of these scenes are very funny as well. One day, for instance, Don Diego is called to meet the governor inside his fancy office. The governor explains that Zama’s latest appeal for a transfer has once again been turned down and that a despised fellow functionary is now being released in his stead. At the peak of Don Diego’s misery - just when things can’t get any worse - a dirty white llama clip-clops into the room and takes up a position at our hero’s back. It’s a devastating moment; insult added to injury. No humiliation, one feels, is truly complete without a dirty white llama breathing down your neck. Zama was screened at the Venice film festival, and will be shown at the Toronto International film festival and New York film festival next month"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/31/native-title-claims-nsw-government-under-pressure-over-systemic-failings","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T07:14:53Z","webTitle":"Native title claims: federal court delivers stinging criticism of NSW government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/native-title-claims-nsw-government-under-pressure-over-systemic-failings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/native-title-claims-nsw-government-under-pressure-over-systemic-failings","fields":{"headline":"Native title claims: federal court delivers stinging criticism of NSW government","bodyText":"The New South Wales government is under pressure to deal with massive delays and “fundamental systemic” failings in its handling of native title claims. The federal court delivered a stinging criticism of the NSW government on Tuesday, saying its native title system was “extraordinarily time consuming”, unwieldy and placed an “enormous” burden on public resources. Federal court justice Jayne Jagot criticised the government’s approach, saying the court was still waiting to finalise claims first lodged in 1998. She said any prospect of dealing with the state’s primary land title claims in the foreseeable future was a “quickly receding fantasy given the day-to-day reality with which we are confronted”. “Whatever the arrangements behind the scenes, the present system means that the resolution of native title claims in NSW is extraordinarily time-consuming, resource intensive, unwieldy and often ineffective,” Jagot said. “Given this, it should be no surprise that consent determinations in NSW, when we finally reach one after years of effort, are at risk of derailment. But this does not mean the current situation is acceptable.” The state opposition has seized on the criticism. The shadow Aboriginal affairs spokesman, David Harris, said the judgment was “a slap in the face to the entire NSW government and its sloppy approach to native title”. “NSW is essentially being accused of undermining some of the basic elements of the Native Title Act, whether in spirit or in fact, by failing to brief the attorney general and other key stakeholders within established timeframes,” he said. “Aboriginal people are already upset by timeframes taken for determination of outstanding land claims and this federal court judgement would give them no cause for optimism that the government has any credible system in place to improve the situation.” Typically, once a claim is first registered, courts are forced to wait for state governments and Indigenous groups to negotiate through mediation on native title claims. If the parties reach an agreement, the court simply formalises it through a ruling known as a consent determination. But Jagot said the government appeared to lack the proper resourcing to deal with native title claims efficiently. It had no clear guidelines for the creation of Indigenous land use agreements, and had no published guidance on what was required to prove a connection to land. That effectively left Indigenous communities “in the dark as to what the state requires”. Jagot made the criticisms while handing down a decision in the landmark native title claim of the Western Bundjalung people, from NSW’s northern rivers region. The claim has taken six years to reach conclusion. Jagot said that was swift by NSW standards. “But six years is not swift or even acceptable compared to any proper standard for litigation in this country, and particularly not when the context is considered,” she said. “I do not know the public resources which have been applied to this matter over the six years but ... it seems safe to say that they have been enormous.” NSW attorney general, Mark Speakman, said he wanted to cut delays and was considering what could be done to streamline the native titles process. Speakman conceded the Western Bundjalung agreement took too long, but said it was the most detailed to date in NSW. “Native title claims are complex, involving numerous issues and parties,” he said. “Long delays in resolving native title claims in the federal court are not unique to NSW.” Speakman pointed to Australian Law Reform Commission data suggesting a national average of six years and three months for a consent determination. He said guidelines were being prepared for Indigenous land use agreements, using the Western Bundjalung decision as a precedent. The court heard the Western Bundjalung people first had contact with Europeans in the 1830s. Conflicts in the 1840s led to a revenge attack that killed at least 17 Aboriginal people at Pagans Flat. Jagot said Pagans Flat was remembered “for this horrific event by the Western Bundjalung people of the present day, and which should be remembered by us all”. The Western Bundjalung people have remained in the area and still practice traditional laws and customs along the Clarence River."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/australia-books-blog/2017/sep/04/imagine-discovering-your-friend-is-a-murderer-and-writing-a-book-about-him","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T18:00:12Z","webTitle":"Imagine discovering your friend is a murderer – and writing a book about him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-books-blog/2017/sep/04/imagine-discovering-your-friend-is-a-murderer-and-writing-a-book-about-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/australia-books-blog/2017/sep/04/imagine-discovering-your-friend-is-a-murderer-and-writing-a-book-about-him","fields":{"headline":"Imagine discovering your friend is a murderer – and writing a book about him","bodyText":"On Valentine’s Day 1994, hitman Lindsey Rose murdered Kerrie Pang and Fatma Ozanal in a Sydney massage parlour. Five years later he pleaded guilty to five murders in total. Campbell McConachie was just a teenager when he first met Rose six years earlier, at a pub in Sydney’s inner west. He only knew snippets of his drinking buddy’s various and past lives, which comprised brothel owner, drug dealer, ambulance officer, private investigator, car thief, hijacker, volunteer fire fighter – and arsonist – and mercenary. As McConachie recalls in his new book, The Fatalist: “When I first drank beer with Lindsey he’d already killed three people. Oh, we had no idea. He’d walk into the front bar of the Burwood Hotel and he’d scan the room. To the eyes he met and knew he’d nod a hello, or perhaps he’d bellow it if it was late-night noisy, and if I’d looked up from the form guide or the pool table I’d look away and hope it was me he came to talk to. He was ebullient and he would give you his full attention.” During the course of 25 visits to Goulburn’s High Risk Management Unit – better known as Supermax – McConachie interviewed Rose about his life and crimes. Of their first meeting there, he describes a man who “zips his lips a couple of times when about to mention people or actions that could incriminate others. He’s perfectly comfortable with who he is and what he has done and he tells me a myriad of stories, often punctuated with his infectious, wheezing laugh, his chin drawn down into his throat. But some of his stories involve the misfortune of others – his victims – and I stop myself from joining him in laughter.” The Fatalist is McConachie’s first book. Here, he describes the logistics and ethical quandaries of not only profiling a murderer, but giving him a microphone by printing his letters. Guardian Australia: Were there doubts you had to put aside to write this book? Campbell McConachie: Yes – a concern for the victims’ surviving family members. I really can’t imagine the enduring grief from losing a loved one to violent murder. A homicide victims’ support organisation told me that most people would prefer to be left alone and not reminded of their grief. They contacted one survivor on my behalf and, quite understandably, that person declined to be interviewed. So here I am giving Lindsey a voice – a voice he uses to set out the shortcomings of two of those victims who he believes ‘deserved it’ – when those murdered people have none. Halfway through the writing it struck me, as Janet Malcolm put it [in her book about ethics in reporting, The Journalist and the Murderer], that perhaps what I was doing was morally indefensible. To carry on, I convinced myself that my intentions at least were good – that some helpful insight may arise from understanding how someone can turn into a violent murderer. What were your first impressions of Lindsey Rose, as a bloke down the pub? He was gregarious, energetic and exuded self-confidence. I was still a teenager when I first met him so in my eyes he was like the popular boy in school. It’s not unusual for killers to possess charm and charisma. What research did you do to prepare yourself? I did a lot of reading on criminal psychology and psychopathy, including Robert Hare’s book Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us – and his psychopathy checklist. I know what you mean about the charm and charisma – the other seminal work on psychopathy is called The Mask of Sanity for that very reason. The outward persona exuding confidence and charisma can be a mask hiding the damaged person behind. That’s not to say that Lindsey is necessarily a psychopath though, and in the book I explore this uncertainty a little further. Was it tempting to pathologise Rose? As a layperson I was only prepared to – and able to – go so far. Lindsey was a paramedic so he has some clinical foundation, and he is quite self-aware. He wrote letters to me with quite startling insights into the transformation of his attitude to the world, and I’ve included some of those letters in the book. Did you let him read as you went along? I sent him a few chapters to review along the way – mostly the stories about his upbringing and time in the ambulance service. There were certain logistical sensitivities with a lot of the other material – so much of the book he still hasn’t read. He had a childhood of neglect, violence and injustice, feeling impotent, which seemed to lead to a motivation of gaining revenge and respect. Could you empathise with any of his story? Well, that’s certainly part of his internal narrative: that he stood up to bullies, thought he was making the world a better place. I can see how he came to that world view, but I wouldn’t say I empathise with it. I’ve been careful not to editorialise – the reader is left to make up their own mind about what to feel about him. Do you consider Rose to be a reliable narrator? He isn’t the narrator in the book – but I know what you mean. It’s a good question because it was important to me to have that doubt – that perhaps all is not quite as he has said – so I’ve left hints in the narrative so the reader can make up their own mind what to believe. Having said that, I think he was generally truthful, but there’s that whole thing about the limitations of human memory and unconscious bias … I think we have a tendency to parse our memories through our established self-narratives rather than the other way around. Why do you think he let you write this story? His stated reason is: “The cops, the judiciary and the media all got it wrong. I thought if anyone could tell it right it would be you.” Part of the context here is that he believes he was portrayed as a hitman, whereas the reality is more complicated than that. One imagines he has other motivations. How is your relationship with him now? We are still on good terms. I visited him recently and we discussed the pending book launch. “I’ve included your point of view,” I told him, “but I have to warn you, it does not reflect well on you.” “Fair enough,” he shrugged, “I did kill five people.” • The Fatalist, by Campbell McConachie, is out now through Hachette"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/31/derryn-hinch-to-ask-to-be-referred-to-high-court-citizenship-case-on-monday","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T05:44:57Z","webTitle":"Derryn Hinch to ask to be referred to high court citizenship case on Monday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/derryn-hinch-to-ask-to-be-referred-to-high-court-citizenship-case-on-monday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/derryn-hinch-to-ask-to-be-referred-to-high-court-citizenship-case-on-monday","fields":{"headline":"Derryn Hinch to ask to be referred to high court citizenship case on Monday","bodyText":"Derryn Hinch says he will ask the Senate to refer him to the high court when federal parliament resumes on Monday, following questions about his eligibility. Speaking to reporters in Cairns, the Victorian senator suggested the referral would be his first order of business next week, even though his legal advice suggested he had no case to answer. “Yeah it will be,” Hinch said. But while Hinch is moving to have his day in court, the Turnbull government is yet to decide whether or not to support the referral, and senior government players are looking at the proposition with some scepticism. On Wednesday evening Hinch revealed he was seeking legal advice because he has an American social security number from his time working in New York as a journalist in the 1960s and early 70s. Hinch said he did not believe he had accepted the rights and privileges of a foreign power by having a US social security number. He said he had never been a US citizen, or held a green card. He flagged an intention to seek an opinion from the solicitor general, and refer himself to the court in the event he had a case to answer. On Thursday, Hinch told reporters: “I think I will have to refer myself to the high court.” He said he had sought advice overnight from a couple of constitutional lawyers about whether his social security number was an issue that could render him ineligible to sit in the parliament, and “they think I’m in good shape”. Despite being advised he didn’t have a case to answer, Hinch said it was best to proceed, otherwise he might be accused of hiding something. In saying he wanted to be transparent, he also referenced a concern about wasting the high court’s time. Asked on Thursday whether or not Hinch had a case to answer, the prime minister dead-batted. Malcolm Turnbull told reporters in western Sydney the senator needed “to get some advice on that and form his own judgment as to what he should do”. The government is yet to determine a position on whether to refer his case to the court. It is understood that the crossbencher will write to the attorney general, George Brandis, signalling his intentions, then Brandis will seek advice from the solicitor general. Labor is likely to support whatever position the government takes. If Hinch proceeds he will be the eighth parliamentarian to face the high court since the citizenship imbroglio began with the resignation of two Greens senators, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam. Three government ministers – Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash and Matt Canavan – the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts, and Nick Xenophon, the leader of the NXT, will also have their eligibility examined by the high court. The first batch of cases will be heard in October. Questions have also been raised this week about whether the Labor senator, Katy Gallagher, could have obtained Ecuadorian citizenship by descent, because her mother was born in the country. Gallagher has denied she has any issue, but the Labor party is understood to be in the process of making further checks. The constitutional law expert George Williams predicted on Wednesday that all the parliamentarians currently before the high court were in trouble. Williams, who is the dean of law at University of New South Wales, told the National Press Club that “on the current law it is difficult to see … that any of the seven parliamentarians who will face the high court are likely to survive that challenge”. But Turnbull shrugged off the expert warning on Thursday. “Based on the advice we have from the solicitor general, we are confident that the three ministers … will be found to be qualified to sit in the parliament”. Turnbull said he also expected the court to validate Xenophon, and well as the government MPs. “So that’s the advice we have and we’re very confident in that position.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/31/great-barrier-reef-plan-to-improve-water-quality-ignores-scientific-advice","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T04:00:10Z","webTitle":"Great Barrier Reef: plan to improve water quality ignores scientific advice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/31/great-barrier-reef-plan-to-improve-water-quality-ignores-scientific-advice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/31/great-barrier-reef-plan-to-improve-water-quality-ignores-scientific-advice","fields":{"headline":"Great Barrier Reef: plan to improve water quality ignores scientific advice","bodyText":"Australia’s draft plan to improve water quality on the Great Barrier Reef has ignored official government scientific advice, which was published by the Queensland and federal governments alongside the new plan this week. The draft Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan is an update to the plan released in 2013, and provides new water quality targets for specific parts of the reef but has very few other concrete changes overall. That is despite the plan itself acknowledging that “current initiatives will not meet water quality targets”, noting the “urgently needed” acceleration of efforts and explicitly stating that “a step change is needed”. The plan repeatedly says it is “based on the best available independent scientific advice, as provided by scientific consensus statement 2017”. But that statement, published alongside the plan, is highly critical of the approach taken in the plan. “Current initiatives will not meet the water quality targets,” the consensus statement says, calling for increased support and resources, as well as regulation to reduce agricultural runoff – a recommendation also made by a Queensland government taskforce. In line with every other piece of scientific advice, the consensus statement concludes the reef is in poor and deteriorating quality, and lays the blame for much of the situation on water quality. Scientists say that in the face of climate change and increased frequency and severity of bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, improved water quality is urgently needed to relieve some of the pressures and to make the reef more “resilient”. The plan points to $2bn being spent over 10 years by the Queensland and federal governments to protect the reef. But roughly half of that is being spent on water quality. That is about one-tenth of what a Queensland government taskforce concluded was needed, a figure they said would still not allow the targets to be met. One member of the Reef Water Quality Independent Science Panel that wrote the consensus statement, Jon Brodie from James Cook University, said the governments were not listening to their own expert advice. “In the end, the plan is not taking up the recommendations of the consensus statement at all,” Brodie said. Asked whether the money being spent on initiatives not in line with expert advice meant the governments were wasting $1bn, Brodie said: “That was asked recently by people from the government … I think spending it as we are now … is a bit silly.” Brodie said it was too late to spread the money across the entire reef and it was time to focus in on bits of the reef that might be able to be saved. “The issue we have now is the coral is in terminal condition and the best we can hope for is to protect some parts of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef,” Brodie said. “We’re still spending a lot of money but we’re not achieving enough to provide resilience to the whole Great Barrier Reef, perhaps we could better spend it on providing resilience for just some of the coral.” The world heritage committee flagged its concern over reef water quality at its annual meeting in July, saying “the plan will need to accelerate to ensure that the intermediate and long-term targets of 2050 LTSP are being met, in particular regarding water quality”. Sean Hoobin from WWF-Australia said the governments were ignoring those concerns. “There is no meaningful detail on the actions and investment needed to deliver promised cuts to reef pollution,” he said. The minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg said in a statement: “By focusing our efforts on improving water quality, we are giving the reef the best chance to adapt and recover from the impacts of coral bleaching. “This new plan has an expanded scope and addresses all land-based sources of water pollution including run-off from urban, industrial and public lands, as well as from agricultural activities.” The Queensland minister for the environment, Steven Miles, said the plan recognised the importance of people in creating change and included social, cultural and economic values for the first time. “The new plan sets water quality targets for each of the 35 catchments flowing to the reef using scientific modelling and other technical information to work out the pollution reduction targets based on what the Reef needs to be healthy,” Miles said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/31/john-howard-says-religious-freedom-should-be-protected-before-marriage-equality-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T03:36:19Z","webTitle":"John Howard says religious freedom should be protected before marriage equality survey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/john-howard-says-religious-freedom-should-be-protected-before-marriage-equality-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/john-howard-says-religious-freedom-should-be-protected-before-marriage-equality-survey","fields":{"headline":"John Howard says religious freedom should be protected before marriage equality survey","bodyText":"John Howard has called on the Turnbull government to deal with the issue of protections for religious freedom before the same-sex marriage postal survey, adding his voice to a growing Coalition infight on the issue. On Thursday Howard told ABC AM it was “quite necessary” to deal with the question now and it was “not good enough” to wait until after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reports the results of the survey on 15 November. The Turnbull government has refused to nominate which bill will be put forward in parliament if the postal survey approves of a change in the law to allow same-sex couples to marry and the extent of any religious exemptions to discrimination law. The Coalition has been engaged in a rolling infight over religious freedom, with moderates including attorney general, George Brandis, Christopher Pyne and Simon Birmingham arguing the survey concerns marriage only, while conservatives including Tony Abbott, Peter Dutton, Zed Seselja and Matthew Canavan argue religious freedom is at stake. Conservatives are concerned that Brandis and Liberal senator Dean Smith’s bills do not provide exemptions to discrimination law for religious people – including bakers, florists and photographers – to refuse to serve gay weddings. So far, only the Liberal senator James Paterson has called for the issue to be dealt with before the postal survey, as conservatives seek to stoke fears to increase the no vote and moderates refuse to engage in the debate on their opponent’s terms. Howard said the questions about “assurances of religious freedom” aired in the debate were “perfectly legitimate”, adding “and I think it would be a good thing if we get to have more specificity on that before we vote”. “In fact, I think it’s quite necessary.” The former prime minister said the current bills “only related to the putative marriage ceremony [and] there’s a lot more to it than that”. Howard called on the government to provide more detail, specificity and assurances including defining “what steps it will take to ensure that state governments don’t withdraw exemptions in discrimination acts, for example, for religious schools”. “I don’t think it’s good enough, as some have said, that ‘well, we’ll deal with that issue after the vote’ – they have got to deal with that issue before the vote.” At a doorstop in Sydney’s west, Malcolm Turnbull was asked if the government would change the Marriage Act if the high court struck down the postal plebiscite. He replied: “Sorry, I won’t get into hypotheticals. We are confident the challenge to the postal vote on marriage ... will not be successful, so we’re very confident the postal vote will go ahead.” In response to the same question Turnbull has previously said the government’s policy is “very clear” – that it will not facilitate the introduction of a marriage bill unless the Australian people have given their support through a yes vote in a national vote. On Thursday Turnbull said he was pleased that a large number of people have enrolled, and that he and his wife Lucy will vote yes. “And if the nation votes yes, then we will facilitate a private member’s bill to make same-sex marriage legal before the end of the year,” he said. On Wednesday the Australian Electoral Commission updated its figures on enrolment to reveal that of 933,592 enrolment transactions processed before the 24 August deadline, more than 98,000 were people added to the roll. Of those, 65,000 of people added to the roll were electors aged 18 to 24, a boost for the yes campaign given young people are more likely to support marriage equality. Canavan told Radio National on Thursday that marriage equality advocates had a “strong argument” that “marriage is about love”, but argued that “it’s more than that”. “It is a lifelong commitment, people fall in and out of love all the time, but it is meant to be there, so you’re there forever for your children created by that relationship,” he said. After the Coalition for Marriage launched an ad linking marriage equality to gender education, Canavan suggested legalising same-sex marriage would be a first step to changes in education programs. “We have seen in other countries that this is the next step and to think that we can just change a fundamental institution in our society and not have any other consequences to how we think about things, how things are taught to our children, I think is naive, and that’s why we should think twice about changing things like this that have stood the test of time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/31/bushfire-conditions-at-near-record-levels-following-dry-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T04:25:38Z","webTitle":"Bushfire conditions in Australia's east at ‘near record’ levels following dry winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/bushfire-conditions-at-near-record-levels-following-dry-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/bushfire-conditions-at-near-record-levels-following-dry-winter","fields":{"headline":"Bushfire conditions in Australia's east at ‘near record’ levels following dry winter","bodyText":"Bushfire conditions in eastern Australia will be at “near record values” this spring following what appears to be the driest winter since 2002, the Bureau of Meteorology has said. The dry winter in 2002 was followed by a very damaging bushfire season, including the devastating Canberra bushfires that culminated in a suburban firestorm on 18 January, 2003, and a series of bushfires in the Victorian alps that ran for 59 days and burned 5% of the state. However, while the hot and dry weather conditions of 2002/2003 were caused by an El Niño event, the bureau’s manager of climate prediction, Andrew Watkins, said the warm and dry conditions in 2017 were part of a longer drying trend. “This winter we haven’t had an El Niño, we also haven’t had a similar pattern called the Indian Ocean Dipole … so neither the Pacific nor the Indian Ocean have been pushing us toward drier conditions,” senior forecaster of extreme weather Scott Williams said. He made the comments following the release of the seasonal outlook for spring, which promised warmer than average daytime temperatures and particularly warm overnight minimums throughout south-eastern, eastern, and northern Australia. “There have been other years where we have had drier conditions without an El Niño but what we’ve been seeing more recently is a trend toward drier starts to winter, or rather the late autumn/early winter conditions, and certainly that’s been the long-term trend,” Watkins said. “Through south-eastern Australia we’ve certainly seen a shortening of our winters.” One of the results of this trend is an earlier start to the bushfire season. Warm, dry and windy conditions could cause problems in New South Wales as early as Monday, Williams said. “Fingers crossed that this period of danger with strong westerlies bringing warmth and winds will be short-lived,” he said. “If it goes into October, I think NSW will be in trouble.” NSW experienced deadly bushfires in October 2013, sparking concern from climate scientists and a claim from then prime minister, Tony Abbott, that the link between climate change and more frequent or more severe bushfires was “hogswash”. The bureau will release its official summer bushfire outlook on Tuesday but Watkins said parts of southern Queensland and northern NSW were expected to show “near record values for winter in terms of fire potential”. He said the fire potential in Victoria was also “above average”. Despite biting winter conditions in southern Victoria in recent weeks, and a forecast of more cold weather, potentially damaging winds and snow down to 500 metres early next week, Watkins said 2017 was on track to be the warmest winter since 2009. June 2017 was the third-hottest June on record globally, beaten only by temperatures in 2015 and 2016, and the second-hottest on record for Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/aug/31/finding-hidden-treasures-in-op-shops-is-easy-and-good-for-the-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T03:17:16Z","webTitle":"Finding hidden treasures in op-shops is easy – and good for the planet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/31/finding-hidden-treasures-in-op-shops-is-easy-and-good-for-the-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/31/finding-hidden-treasures-in-op-shops-is-easy-and-good-for-the-planet","fields":{"headline":"Finding hidden treasures in op-shops is easy – and good for the planet","bodyText":"Walking into an op-shop in search of something to wear can seem daunting. All those racks and racks of stretched T-shirts, trashy jewellery and cheap dresses can be an overwhelming jumble. Not so for Clare Press, fashion journalist, author of Wardrobe Crisis and sustainable style advocate. Press is one of those people who, with a few flicks through the racks in a Vinnies or Salvos store, can find glamorous and unique items. Her own beloved treasures include a pair of vintage-style black strappy sandals which she bought for $2 and wore to countless upmarket functions and a red Chinese silk robe she scored in a Red Cross shop. So it makes sense that she’s on board for this week’s national op-shop week and will present Salvos Curated, a lineup of goods for sale which she and others have found in the last fortnight among the discarded items. In her rummaging, she’s found two pairs of Christian Louboutin heels, a Ralph Lauren trouser suit and a Prada bag. Australians have a serious problem with fashion waste: we’re the world’s second-largest consumers of textiles, and each year we buy on average 27kg of new clothing and other textiles – but we dump six tonnes of textiles into landfill every 10 minutes. As it stands, only 15% of donated clothes are actually sold in charity shops, with huge amounts sent to landfill or on-sold to rag merchants in developing countries. It would have a significant impact on the environment if more Australians got into op-shopping. As Press puts it: “If you have a guilt complex about consumption – which I do – this is a great way to assuage it. You can make a pretty good case to yourself that you are doing good, because what you are doing is going towards a charitable cause [and] you are saving stuff from landfill.” After years of trawling through op-shops, market stalls and vintage stores, Press has an eye for spotting the good stuff, but she insists that with practise, pretty much anyone can do it. “If you spend a lot of time looking at clothes, of course you know the difference between clothes at a glance. However that is not a prerequisite for buying stuff in op-shops.” So on a recent Melbourne expedition, we went trawling the Sacred Heart on Brunswick Road and the Salvos op-shop on Chapel Street in Windsor, while Press shared her top tips for successful op-shopping. “Look for quality because donations could be anything. Volunteers who sort things look for things with the labels, things that are clean, things that look as new as possible [and] that’s not necessarily a mark of quality. So what I’m looking for is quality, the most expensive leather, the nicest old tweed jacket,”, she says. Generally she avoids polyester and goes for natural fabrics like wool, silk and cotton. If you prefer new items, you can find plenty of barely worn items in op-shops, says Press, holding up a leather boot with unmarked soles as an example. “Often when I’m op-shopping, I’ll find brand new things, sometimes with the tag still on, which is to me quite astonishing, when you think about our fashion waste problem. People buy things and get rid of them without even cutting the tags off, they’ve never worn them.” Don’t discount old items though, even those that smell a bit off. “I don’t care if things smell of mothballs,” says Press. “Grotty dirty things don’t worry me because some of the oldest things, like 50s things are grotty and dirty, but they just need cleaning. A really lovely vintage thing, to me if it needs dry cleaning or hand-washing or mending, so what? Go shopping in the right outfit. “When I go to the markets, I wear a tight singlet under something I can take off, and tights or some skinny jeans so that you can whip off your top layer, put on the dress in the street at the market or if there’s nowhere to [change]. Don’t go op-shopping in a fussy blouse or a frilly something that’s going to not be try on-able.” She adds: “Try everything on, because there is no such thing as knowing your size in an op-shop”. Do look at the item carefully, as there are some things that can’t be saved. Press holds up an unfortunate coat that’s stained, stretched and the fabric has pilled. “You have to look for things, to check what’s wrong with it. [This is] a bit snagged – if you don’t care, you don’t care. But … you’ve got to check – in a new shop, you wouldn’t be checking for faults.” Many things can be fixed, altered or refashioned. Press confesses she has a sewing pile that’s never finished, but she does repair items herself. “Hard things I take to someone.” Beware of labels, which can often be cheap knock-offs. While in the store, Press spotted what looked like chocolate brown Balenciaga court shoes. On closer inspection, they turn out to be fake, made of PVC, rather than leather. Brides-to-be can often get wedding dresses for a steal in op-shops, says Press, who got married in a 60s-era preloved dress. “Wedding dresses end up in op-shops all the time, because people wear them one time and they think they are doing a good thing – which they are – to give them to charity. So you can buy incredible wedding dresses in charity shops for $60.” “Don’t ever buy a new pair of jeans again,” says Press, “Op-shops are full of jeans.” Australians are obsessed with denim. According to Roy Morgan, in any given four-week period, more than 1.7 million Australians over the age of 14 buy at least one pair of women’s and/or men’s denim jeans. And they are frequently dumped in charity shops: the store we visit has a bulging rack with labels like Mavi and Hudson alongside the Target and Kmart jeans. Op-shops can differ wildly, depending on how the store is managed, according to Press, and stocks change daily, so it’s worth visiting your favourite stores regularly. “A rule of thumb which is generally true but not always, is that in posh areas, some better quality clothes get dumped.” There’s more to charity shops than clothing and books, as they frequently carry furniture, homewares and artworks. The store we visited had a 53-piece vintage china set for $80, an old-fashioned pram and a full-size pool table for $300 – complete with all the balls and cues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/31/paedophile-priest-gerald-ridsdale-sentenced-to-11-more-years-in-jail","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T01:42:15Z","webTitle":"Paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale sentenced to 11 more years in jail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/paedophile-priest-gerald-ridsdale-sentenced-to-11-more-years-in-jail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/paedophile-priest-gerald-ridsdale-sentenced-to-11-more-years-in-jail","fields":{"headline":"Paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale sentenced to 11 more years in jail","bodyText":"Australia’s most notorious paedophile, Gerald Ridsdale, will wait an additional three years before being eligible for parole, with Justice Irene Lawson finding his age and frailty did not mean he no longer posed a risk to the community. Ridsdale, 83, has already served 23 years in a Victorian prison after being jailed in 1994 for sexually abusing nine boys. While he was given a sentence of 12 months at the time, dozens of other victims have since come forward. By 2006 he had pleaded guilty to abusing 54 children over four separate court cases. These additional charges meant he would not be eligible for parole until April 2019. However, a fifth batch of 23 additional charges were brought against Ridsdale, which he plead guilty to earlier in 2017, bringing his number of victims to 65. Survivors groups say Ridsdale’s victims are likely to be in the hundreds and Ridsdale himself has admitted as much in interviews. His latest charges include multiple counts of rape and indecent assault against children as young as six. On Thursday Lawson added an additional 11 years to Ridsdale’s sentence, which means he will not be eligible for parole until 2022. Lawson described how, after being ordained at St Patrick’s Cathedral in the regional Victorian town of Ballarat 1961, Ridsdale had used his position of power and trust in the Catholic church to access and sexually assault children. Ridsdale sat at the back of the county court, head in his hands, flanked by police. Lawson described Ridsdale’s offending as occuring on a “more or less continuous basis” over 27 years, occurring largely in Ballarat and surrounding regions and parishes. She detailed the offences committed by Ridsdale against the latest group of 12 victims, which included altar boys training under Ridsdale and a six year-old boy who Ridsdale began abusing after the child’s mother was killed in a car accident. She also described how a girl abused between the ages of eight and 10 by Ridsdale had a father who was complicit in her abuse, bringing her to Ridsdale numerous times so that he could abuse her. On one occasion, her father took her to a confessional booth, removed her clothes and allowed Ridsdale to then molest her. “In addition to immediate physical and mental harm, you have caused very serious consequences to each individual victim,” Lawson said. She said his offending had caused his victims to experience trust issues, low self-esteem, low confidence, suicidality, post-traumatic stress disorder, gambling, alcohol and other drug use, antisocial behaviour, depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, relationship breakdowns including the destruction of marriages, an inability to maintain normal relationships, depression, anxiety, self-harm and difficulty engaging in a normal work and social life. “Their childhoods have been blighted,” she told him. “They have lived with anger, guilt, denial and shame all their life. Many of the complainants have had their faith and teachings in the church destroyed.” She said the harm caused had extended into their families and communities. Lawson said while Ridsdale had completed offender programs in jail, she had not been provided with any reports on his attitude to reoffending. “Given your age and frailty I accept your risk for reoffending is reduced but I am unable to accept there is no risk, and there is still a need to protect the community,” she said. As the case unfolded over the past few months, the details of Ridsdale’s offending and the impact of his crimes on his victims at one point brought Lawson to tears. On Thursday she described how the victims were “all completely faultless”. Ridsdale’s legal council, Tim Marsh from Victorian Legal Aid, had told Lawson that Ridsdale should not have his sentence extended because, if the additional charges had been known earlier and accounted for during his previous court cases, his sentence would have likely been the same. But Lawson said although she was required to consider the crimes with some concurrency, just punishment would requires a greater sentence than that already imposed. “Yours was unprecedented offending,” she told Ridsdale. “The overall offending is grave and protracted, spanning almost 27 years and involving 65 victims.” She added that his offending was of the “worst category”. Australia’s royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse has also revealed disturbing details about Ridsdale’s offending and the response of the Catholic church to it. In 2015, before the Ballarat town hall, the commission heard evidence that suggested Australia’s most senior Catholic, Cardinal George Pell, was involved in the decision to move Ridsdale between parishes once the abuse came to light, including parishes in Mildura, Swan Hill, Warrnambool, Apollo Bay, Ballarat and Mortlake. Pell has always denied any knowledge of children being abused in Ballarat. The commission heard Catholic priests involved in the sexual abuse of young children were repeatedly moved to different parishes in Victoria and sent on “treatment” trips to the US and Italy rather than being expelled from the church and reported to police. Pell supported Ridsdale during his first court appearance for child sex offences in 1993, accompanying him to court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/01/eu-irish-border-stance-paves-way-northern-ireland-special-status-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T12:27:05Z","webTitle":"EU's border stance paves way for Northern Ireland to get special status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/01/eu-irish-border-stance-paves-way-northern-ireland-special-status-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/01/eu-irish-border-stance-paves-way-northern-ireland-special-status-brexit","fields":{"headline":"EU's border stance paves way for Northern Ireland to get special status","bodyText":"The EU believes that there will have to be a “standalone” deal on Northern Ireland’s border with the Republic of Ireland, paving the way for a special status for the province after Brexit. Senior sources at the European commission said a tailor-made solution that works for Ireland must be found. When the third round of Brexit talks ended on Wednesday, officials made it clear that the British proposal for a customs waiver on the border was a non-starter. It said the plan was predicated on the EU suspending the application of its laws, namely checks on goods from the UK coming into Ireland, which will remain a member state. Dublin believes the best solution for Northern Ireland is for the UK to remain in the customs union. Sinn Féin, which represents the nationalist community in Northern Ireland, has called for Northern Ireland to be granted special status, but this stance is opposed by the Democratic Unionist party. It was also made clear in Brussels that talks on the Northern Ireland border have been kicked into the second phase of discussions, because the EU is not prepared to allow it to be a proxy for Britain’s negotiations on its future trading relationship with the EU. One senior commission source described the British position paper on the matter as an attempt to make Ireland a “hostage” in the talks. There was agreement, however, on the desire to continue with the common travel area after Brexit. It allows passport-free travel between the islands and has existed since Ireland gained independence in 1922. It is understood that the UK also moved on its position that after Brexit, the travel area would only apply to British and Irish passport holders, paving the way for mandatory passport controls for other EU citizens travelling between the two countries. One source said the UK had given guarantees that it would not change the operation of the common travel area “to the detriment of EU citizens”, suggesting the border would remain open. While ostensibly there is broad political will to maintain the travel area in Europe as well as Britain and Ireland, legal experts have warned that it will not secure the rights of Irish citizens settled in Britain. Irish citizens are deemed to have separate status to other EU citizens because of the historical and cultural ties between the two countries. Theresa May has said Irish nationals will not have to apply for the new immigration category of “settled status” that will apply to EU citizens. The British position on Irish citizens is that employment and social rights will flow from existing agreements under the common travel area arrangements, the 1971 Immigration Act and the 1949 Ireland Act, which ended Ireland’s status as a British dominion and stated that it would not be treated as a foreign country. Bernard Ryan, a law professor, said there was no legal basis for that position. “There needs to be a special provision in immigration law that says Irish citizens are exempt or for them to be equated to British citizens for the purposes of immigration law, essentially treated the same as British,” said Ryan, who has acted as an expert on the issue for several parliamentary committees. Such legislation already exists in Ireland, equating British nationals to Irish. Following the Good Friday agreement in 1998, Ireland’s 1935 Aliens Act was amended by the then taoiseach Bertie Ahern to exempt “every person who is a citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” from the laws that apply to immigrants. The British position on EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, outlined by Theresa May in June, exempts Irish people from having to apply for a new immigration status, but Ryan said this needed to be codified in law. He said the Ireland Act states that Ireland is “not a foreign country” for the purpose of “any law in force in any part of the United Kingdom”. Ryan said the concept of “foreign” was outdated legally, with immigration categories defined as EU or non-EU, and therefore the concept was anachronistic. “My issue is not what is going to happen in practice, it is the lack of legal foundation [for rights],” he said. Ryan said legal clarification was also needed for Irish passport holders living in Britain; for when they enter from other countries outside the common travel area, for example after a holiday. His position was supported by other experts including David Phinnemore, a professor of European politics at Queen’s University Belfast. Phinnemore said the fact that the travel area was included as a discussion point in the British position paper on Northern Ireland and Ireland suggested “there are issues there”. “People have assumed there’s a whole set of agreements which have legal force, but if we want to have the [common travel area] continue after Brexit, it would be good to have some clarity and legal underpinning,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/aug/31/marvel-the-inhumans-the-tv-disaster-of-year","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:19:17Z","webTitle":"Marvel's The Inhumans: destined to be the TV disaster of the year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/31/marvel-the-inhumans-the-tv-disaster-of-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/31/marvel-the-inhumans-the-tv-disaster-of-year","fields":{"headline":"Marvel's The Inhumans: destined to be the TV disaster of the year","bodyText":"All caught up with events in Westeros? Then you’re probably hankering for another violent tale in which ruling clans scheme and scuffle in a bloody battle for sovereignty. It should be good news, then, that Marvel are poised to launch their latest TV project, The Inhumans – about a royal family of mutants jostling for dominance over their secret kingdom on the moon – in unprecedented big-screen style. The Inhumans arrives on Friday in 1,000 Imax screens across the US and UK, with its first two episodes reformatted as a 75-minute would-be blockbuster. Imax is an investor in the show, and according to CEO Richard Gelfond, the decision to launch it on their global network of mega-screens is a way of “eventicising” TV. Those towering (and likely deafening) presentations will be a shock-and-awe introduction to the Inhuman universe, before the series arrives on significantly smaller screens at the end of September. Debuting a new show in cinemas, particularly one about whose characters there is zero brand awareness, might seem a hubristic move. But it does echo the origins of the project. The Inhumans was initially announced as part of Marvel’s expanding cinematic universe in 2014, before a corporate reshuffle saw it reclassified as TV in 2016. Now, weirdly, it gets to be both. The first casting announcement suggested that at least one executive spotted the Game of Thrones parallels between the Inhumans’s lunar kingdom of Attilan and the lethal political machinations of King’s Landing. Iwan Rheon, the Misfits star turned sausage-waggling sadist Ramsay Bolton in HBO’s megahit, plays the revolutionary Maximus, a non-superpowered Inhuman looking to upend the status quo. As Ramsay, Rheon proved himself a big talker, which is just as well as Maximus’s brother and main opponent Black Bolt – the king of Attilan, embodied by Hell on Wheels cowpoke Anson Mount – is essentially mute, since a mere whisper from his lips unleashes overwhelming destructive power. The rest of the superpowered Inhumans family hews closely to the cosmically strange 1960s characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby: element-controlling ingenue Crystal, amphibious infiltrator Triton and beastly palace guard enforcer Gorgon, who can trigger earthquakes with a clop of his mighty hooves. Black Bolt’s queen is the most wigged-out of all: Medusa (played by Serinda Swan) is a regal redhead whose long flowing hair also functions as an extra set of limbs she can use to restrain foes. Earthquake-triggering hooves and sentient hair might sound exciting, but the Inhumans has so far struggled to generate any positive buzz. The unfamiliarity with the characters and the neither fish-nor-fowl Imax/TV rollout has muddied the message, to the extent that there is a growing and almost gleeful expectation that it will be Marvel’s biggest critical flameout since the thumbs-down reaction to Netflix’s Iron Fist. It does all seem faintly ridiculous. The interiors of Attilan look bland, bare and brutalistic, while the costuming and production design manage neither grandeur or grit. The reveal that Black Bolt and his followers will get kicked out of Attilan and end up on Earth also recalls the 1987 Masters of the Universe movie, whose producers, tasked with staging a sweeping war epic beyond the stars, chucked He-Man through a cosmic portal to New Jersey so they could shoot on contemporary streets. It feels like the Inhumans might be a victim of Marvel’s post-success scramble, now that the company has found itself custodian of the biggest movie franchise in the world and a constantly expanding portfolio of TV shows. If there is one beacon of hope, it’s that the Inhumans includes one of the most beloved characters in the entire Marvel mythos. Lockjaw is a gigantic, slobbering bulldog with a tuning fork on his head and the power to teleport wherever he wants. If the Inhumans survives and thrives beyond its rocky origin story, it will likely be down to that very good boy. • The Inhumans screens in Imax cinemas in the US and UK from 1 September. The TV series begins on 29 September in the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/01/daily-telegraph-readers-redesign-the-weekly-beast","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T22:08:52Z","webTitle":"Daily Telegraph to readers: Are you able to specifically describe 'crap'? | The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/01/daily-telegraph-readers-redesign-the-weekly-beast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/01/daily-telegraph-readers-redesign-the-weekly-beast","fields":{"headline":"Daily Telegraph to readers: Are you able to specifically describe 'crap'?","bodyText":"It has been something of a tough week for the Holt Street troops. The Daily Telegraph relaunched its website only to see it plagued by teething problems and heavily criticised by readers. The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph have been “reimagined, re-engineered and redesigned”, the digital editor, Peter Brown, announced on Wednesday. “DailyTelegraph.com.au’s new desktop, tablet and mobile responsive website features a bold and modern new look but most importantly our commitment to agenda-setting, exclusive and breaking news journalism remains at the heart of what we do,” he said. “The look of the site has changed but our passion and dedication to advocate for you and a better NSW has not.” But most readers who left comments weren’t having a bar of it. Brown was admirably patient, calmly answering every single criticism. Michael: “This new website is absolutely awful, how do I go back to the old pages. This is hard to look at.” Brown: “I appreciate the feedback. The old site no longer exists as we have moved to our new responsive website for desktop, tablet and mobile. It would be great if you can describe what you do not like – and do like – so we can include your specific feedback in our ongoing work to make the site better.” Terry: “It’s crap!” Brown: “Thanks for the feedback Terry. Are you able to specifically describe ‘crap’?” Wilkinson’s Sunday shift Lisa Wilkinson likes to have a finger in a lot of pies. As the co-host of the Today show on Nine, she hosts live television from Monday through Friday for almost 20 hours. She is also the editor-at-large for the Huffington Post Australia and she recently become the “national face of NutraLife”, a women’s health supplement. And this week the Today show has been flogging a new role for Wilkinson: she will edit the news pages of the Sunday Telegraph on 3 September along with the Today show team who are also “guest editing” News Corp papers on the weekend. Co-host Karl Stefanovic will lend a hand with Rupert Murdoch’s Sunday Mail in Queensland and Sylvia Jeffries will look after the Body &amp; Soul section. With Huffington Post Australia being a joint-venture with Fairfax Media, a few eyebrows have been raised as to why Wilkinson is promoting News Corp’s stable of papers. Channel Nine tells us the deal is a mutual PR exercise with News Corp and is not a commercial partnership. “It is the Today Show that is involved in the initiative – not Lisa alone,” a spokeswoman for Huffington Post told Weekly Beast. “Lisa’s involvement is in her capacity as a Today Show host. It has no bearing on her continuing role as HuffPost Australia’s editor-at-large.” Ahmed’s back to Aunty Dr Tanveer Ahmed, a psychiatrist and media commentator, has pretty much worn out his welcome at credible media outlets after being labelled a serial plagiarist and publicly exposed three times in the past five years. So it was quite a surprise to see the ABC promoting the western Sydney medic as an expert commentator this week, even plugging his book Fragile Nation, Vulnerability, Resilience and Victimhood across radio and online. Five years ago his columns in the Sydney Morning Herald were exposed by Media Watch as being heavily lifted from other sources without attribution and he lost his gig. Then the Australian picked him up and he did it again, only to be sacked by then editor Clive Mathieson. Ahmed was already the subject of a heated debate about domestic violence because his Oz piece argued that male disempowerment was partly to blame for domestic violence, and he cut ties with White Ribbon because of it. You’d think he would stick to doctoring after that, but no, he started writing for conservative journal the Spectator, and was revealed in July to have borrowed heavily from an article by bioethicist Carl Elliott published in 2000 about transgenderism and gender fluidity. ABC Online published a lengthy opinion piece in which he argued drug testing of welfare recipients wasn’t all bad. Then he was invited on to Radio National’s Drive program with Patricia Karvelas to expand on his theme that addiction wasn’t just a medical problem. “The ABC chose to publish and broadcast Dr Tanveer Ahmed’s views as a psychiatrist who is involved in the federal government’s drug-test trial of welfare recipients in Sydney’s Bankstown,” an ABC spokesman said. “The ABC is aware of previous plagiarism accusations surrounding Dr Ahmed, but did not consider them relevant in this instance, given he was being asked for his expert clinical opinion on the program in question.” Jones moans 2GB broadcaster Alan Jones is very annoyed that his colleagues at Fairfax Media don’t give him the respect he deserves because they are all employed by Fairfax Media after all. When Jones didn’t like the way Fairfax reported his program’s ratings results he lashed out on radio, saying the journalists “do nothing but bag this station” while calling themselves the “home of journalistic integrity”. Just because 2GB is not part of the “lunatic left”, Jones said, they never reported his ratings fairly. Addressing the Fairfax board directly, Jones asked if they supported an editorial policy of bagging “one of the few outfits that are successful”. Later on Thursday Jones sparked another negative story in the Fairfax press, this time for a tasteless tweet against a favourite target, Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore. Despite a widespread interpretation that his tweet was an invitation to string Clover Moore up high over Sydney, Jones said he did nothing wrong. Switzer signs off After a stint of less than a year, conservative commentator Tom Switzer, an adjunct fellow of the Institute of Public Affairs, has quit as host of Sunday Extra on Radio National. Switzer replaced longtime host Jonathan Green on RN’s live Sunday morning broadcast of Ockham’s Razor and Background Briefing this year and not everyone was happy about it. The former opinion editor of the Australian will still host his other RN show Between the Lines. “Tom decided to depart Sunday Extra as host due to his increasing workload outside the ABC,” a spokesman said. “The ABC is delighted that Tom will continue to be part of the RN lineup, hosting his Wednesday evening program Between the Lines, which he has done since 2015.” Fox shunting We told you last week that Sky News reached just 3% of the metropolitan population each week, but there is a news channel that attracts an even smaller audience for Foxtel: the US Fox News. Earlier this week Rupert Murdoch took Fox News off the air in the UK after 15 years because it was no longer commercially viable – it only attracted 2,000 viewers a day. “We have concluded that it is not in our commercial interest to continue providing Fox News in the UK,” 21st Century Fox said. “Fox News is focused on the US market and designed for a US audience and, accordingly, it averages only a few thousand viewers across the day in the UK.” We asked Foxtel if there were any plans to do the same in Australia but it declined to comment. Industry sources say Fox News viewing figures are so low in Australia they are not even separately measured."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/02/marriage-equality-lots-of-support-but-little-funding-from-corporate-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality: lots of support but little funding from corporate Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/02/marriage-equality-lots-of-support-but-little-funding-from-corporate-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/02/marriage-equality-lots-of-support-but-little-funding-from-corporate-australia","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality: lots of support but little funding from corporate Australia","bodyText":"Despite boasting support from 600 corporations, the Equality Campaign has not received any big donations from Australian companies to prosecute the yes case in the same-sex marriage postal survey. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, has promised to make a significant personal donation and some companies, such as Airbnb, have run their own campaigns to promote marriage equality but neither the Equality Campaign nor Australian Marriage Equality has received any big corporate donations over the last two years. Even major partners of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, such as ANZ, Ansell, Holden and Medibank, reiterated support for marriage equality when contacted by Guardian Australia but conceded they had not made a donation. The Equality Campaign insists it has no complaint that corporate Australia has kept its purse strings tight because it plans to run a people-powered campaign. However, opponents have been quick to paint same-sex marriage as an elitist issue, in part, because of the extent of corporate support. The Australian Marriage Equality co-chair Alex Greenwich said: “We will be massively outspent by the unlimited buckets of cash that opponents of equality have access to.” Greenwich said that if the postal surveywent ahead, the Equality Campaign “needs to fundraise and [is] grateful for the support we have received from grass-roots supporters, community groups, local councils, and LGBTI employee networks”. The 600 corporate supporters of Australian Marriage Equality have signed an open letter in support of same-sex marriage. “We support the right for all our employees to have equal opportunities in life. We therefore support marriage equality,” the statement says. It also makes the argument that marriage equality is “a sound economic option” contributing to a happy, productive workforce and attracting global talent to Australia. “Equality in the workplace works; Discrimination does not.” A spokesman for Holden said: “Holden’s support for equality in all its forms is well known. While not financially active in this particular campaign, Holden has been a public supporter of marriage equality for some time now. “It’s important that Australians have the opportunity to have their say on this issue.” A spokesman for ANZ said the bank “continues to support marriage equality and has always been an advocate of diversity and inclusion”. “We are encouraging employees to have their say and to do so in a thoughtful way. How they vote is a personal matter for them,” he said. A spokeswoman for Medibank said the health insurer “believes that every person should enjoy equal rights, and that includes marriage”. “Medibank has not made a corporate donation to the Equality Campaign.” She said Medibank would match donations made by employees to “any registered charity”, including those supporting the marriage equality campaign. However, charities on the no side – such as the Australian Christian Lobby – also qualify. A spokesman for Ansell said it supported marriage equality and its sexual wellness unit, which has campaigned encouraging enrolment, would decide whether to issue a further statement after a high court challenge to the postal survey is heard. The country manager of Airbnb in Australia, Sam McDonagh, said it “strongly believes that everyone should have the right to marry the person they love”. “At Airbnb we champion diversity, inclusion and the need for equality in many forms right around the world. In Australia, one of the most important examples is the support we are throwing behind the issue of marriage equality,” he said. McDonagh labelled the postal survey “an unnecessary, lengthy and costly path to achieving equality in Australia” but said the company had thrown its “full support behind Australian Marriage Equality and the yes campaign”. “We’ve been thrilled by the overwhelming response from Australians to the Until We All Belong movement, with more than 150,000 people proudly wearing acceptance rings and pledging their support on behalf of friends, family members or loved ones with strong support even coming from within the corridors of parliament.” Last Friday, Joyce said he would “personally donate a significant amount of money to the campaign”. “I will spend as much time as the campaign wants me to speak about this,” he said. Joyce, who was attacked with a pie in May by a Perth man because of his outspoken support for same-sex marriage, has been an advocate of companies taking a public stance on social issues in the same way they do for policy issues such as company tax, industrial relations and trade. On Tuesday, the Coalition for Marriage launched its campaign with a TV ad linking same-sex marriage to gender education. In similar comments to Radio National on Thursday, the Nationals senator Matt Canavan told Radio National Australians should listen to “mums and dads who are concerned about what their kids are taught in the classroom” rather than “ministers, big businesses, [and] big unions”. The Marriage Alliance spokeswoman Sophie York, in an email calling on supporters for donations, said the no campaign “may not have the resources of our opponents, or the support of much of the mainstream media”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/aug/31/the-trump-administration-wants-to-bail-out-failed-contrarian-climate-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T10:00:00Z","webTitle":"The Trump administration wants to bail out failed contrarian climate scientists | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/aug/31/the-trump-administration-wants-to-bail-out-failed-contrarian-climate-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/aug/31/the-trump-administration-wants-to-bail-out-failed-contrarian-climate-scientists","fields":{"headline":"The Trump administration wants to bail out failed contrarian climate scientists","bodyText":"Climate contrarians, like Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, don’t understand how scientific research works. They are basically asking for a government handout to scientists to do what scientists are should already be doing. They are also requesting handouts for scientists who have been less successful in research and publications – a move antithetical to the survival of the fitness approach that has formed the scientific community for decades. The helping handout would be through a proposed exercise called a “red team/blue team” effort. It is a proposal that would reportedly find groups of scientists on both “sides” of the climate issue (whatever that means), and have them try to poke holes in each others’ positions. I will explain why this is a handout but first let’s talk about the plan and how it interferes with the scientific process. I say that Pruitt and Perry don’t understand how science works because we are already doing “red team/blue team” exercises everyday in our normal line of business. Science works by challenging each other and our ideas. If we think that a colleague has made an error, we tend to be merciless and tenacious to correct the errors. This is part of the premise of the concept of peer review – where we send studies and manuscripts to journals to have other experts objectively review them for errors. So back to the basic premise of a red team/blue team exercise – basically the “red team” would critique some conclusion of a “blue team.” The blue team would be able to respond, and there would be this back and forth exchange. On its face it sounds pretty straightforward even though scientists are already doing that in the scientific literature. But how would this work in practice? First, how would the red team and blue team members be selected? Would they be picked by Pruitt and Perry who have already demonstrated a commitment to unbridled fossil fuel usage? The red team would almost certainly be selected from the very small but vocal group of contrarian scientists and non-scientists who have failed in the scientific arena. The fact is, there are no credible scientists who doubt that human emissions of greenhouse gases cause global warming. They just don’t exist. There are some “lukewarmist” scientists who think the problem won’t be that bad, but these “lukewarmers” have failed to provide compelling evidence in the scientific literature. In many instances, their work has been shown to be wrong, the mainstream scientists have evaluated their claims and found them lacking or faulty. And this is why 97% of the world’s top climate scientists agree with each other on climate change. So forming a red team would basically amount to a governmental helping hand to scientists who have not succeeded in the scientific arena. Since they cannot compete in the cut-throat area of scientific research, they would be given a free pass by the government to circumvent the normal peer review process. Let’s be clear, the red team cannot make the case in the scientific arena so they would be given a free pass to make their claims in the political arena. What would the exercise look like? Well that isn’t clear. Some ideas have been floated such as a live debate. Perhaps a red team response to a summary article such as the National Climate Report made public recently by the New York Times? Would it be special earmarked funding for contrarians to perform research? Would it be an “official” U.S. government report that is written by the contrarians? We just don’t know. But regardless of its manifestation, the result would be that contrarian scientists – who have already failed to make their case – would have their voices elevated to an inappropriate position of equality with those scientists whose work has survived scrutiny. The public would simply see two groups of “scientists” opposing each other, making it difficult for non-experts to discern who is correct. Finally, it would promote political ideology over scientific quality. Science works by being competitive; the best ideas and the best scientists are rewarded. The failed scientists and scientific ideas are discarded. By giving a free handout to failure, it would create an environment where you don’t have to be good at your job; you just have to have the right politics. Conservatives generally view handouts and bailouts as an anathema. When they realize that what underlies the red team effort is really just a bailout to failed ideas, they will not be supportive. What I would suggest the so-called red team do is start competing in the trade of our profession. Complete studies and publish papers which support your hypothesis. Subject your ideas to criticisms, see if your ideas survive scrutiny. If your ideas are failures, don’t go looking to Uncle Sam for a handout. Try again, think deeper, work harder. That is what real scientists do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/08/manchester-city-liverpool-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T14:14:14Z","webTitle":"Manchester City v Liverpool: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/08/manchester-city-liverpool-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/08/manchester-city-liverpool-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City v Liverpool: match preview","bodyText":"This should be a feast of attacking play as Pep Guardiola’s possession-based tactics take on Jürgen Klopp’s aggressive forward line.

Despite increased transparency among the 55% of nations who trade in small arms, the $6bn (£4.5bn) market remains a murky industry in which weapons find their way into the hands of terrorists or are used by states to carry out human rights abuses, according to the Small Arms Survey Trade Update 2017. Where nations are secretive, evidence is garnered from reports of weapons seizures, including huge hauls from North Korea and Iran. In August last year a North Korean vessel was intercepted in Egypt. On board, hidden beneath 2,300 tonnes of iron ore, were 30,000 PG-7 rocket-propelled grenades and their sub components. Suspected North Korean exports of small arms worth $18m and destined for Iran were also intercepted on a plane in Thailand in 2009. “Such seizures … coupled with other documented small arms trade activities, are sufficient to justify North Korea’s status as a major small arms exporter,” the report said. “Although Iran, North Korea, and the UAE rarely, if ever, recorded small arms exports worth $10m or more ... survey research indicates that they are major small arms exporters. It is more difficult to determine the status of Saudi Arabia, which appears to be a significant re-exporter of small arms.” Tens of thousands of rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and more than 350 million rounds of ammunition were exported by eight central and south-east European states to Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2015, the report said. Such shipments were sent to military bases in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE and then re-exported to non-Saudi forces in Yemen and Syria. “Such information indicates that Saudi Arabia also re-exports significant quantities of small arms to armed forces and non-state actors in the Middle East,” the report says. Irene Pavesi, researcher on the Small Arms Survey, said: “The concealed nature of the small arms trade increases the chances that the transferred weapons will end up in the wrong hands, and help fuel conflict, insecurity and instability around the world.” Analysis of the flow of deadly weaponry across the globe by the experts based in Geneva also shows: Brazil has for the first time emerged as among the top five exporters of machine guns, rockets mortars, and other small arms, along with the US, Germany, South Korea and Italy. The UK is among the top importers of small arms, its trade increased by 18% between 2013 and 2014 to reach $109m, mostly for the civilian market. Weapons exported or re-exported from North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia and UAE are getting into the hands of armed militant groups in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. Iraq was among the top 10 importers of small arms in 2014 in a trade worth $139m, up from $10m in 2013. The US remains the world’s largest exporter of small arms, with exports worth $1.1bn in 2014. Even nations which aim to be transparent and above board can see weapons fall into the wrong hands. A UN report earlier this year revealed Brazilian weapons makers shipped handguns which were supposed to be destined for Djibouti to a Yemeni arms dealer three months after the imposition of an arms embargo. In 2015 – the year of the Bataclan, Bardo museum and Charlie Hebdo attacks – there were more terrorist attacks carried out with Kalashnikovs than any other weaponry, raising huge concerns about how the legal weapons can end up on the illicit market and in the hands of terrorists. Paul Holtom, of the Small Arms Survey said there was still a lack of transparency in the industry. “We know that complete transparency is not possible, but as a public watchdog our role is to make sure the trade in small arms is not supplying weapons that are going to end up in the hands of terrorists. At the moment we cannot say that.” In July campaigners against the arms trade lost a case in the UK high court calling for Britain to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of concerns over the civilian toll of its two-year bombing campaign in Yemen. Half of the evidence was heard in secret on national security grounds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/12/why-hurricanes-harvey-irma-otherworldly-omens-human-trangression","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T07:00:28Z","webTitle":"Why do we see hurricanes like Harvey and Irma as otherworldly omens? | Philip Hoare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/12/why-hurricanes-harvey-irma-otherworldly-omens-human-trangression","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/12/why-hurricanes-harvey-irma-otherworldly-omens-human-trangression","fields":{"headline":"Why do we see hurricanes like Harvey and Irma as otherworldly omens?","bodyText":"The strange and terrible news from our meteorological world seems to collide ominously in our unsettling times. Last week a scientific report was published, indicating that the remarkable and tragic stranding of 29 sperm whales on North Sea coasts last January may have been caused by solar storms that confused the animals’ geomagnetic navigation – and drove them on to shallow beaches to die. Meanwhile, the second apocalyptic weather event in as many weeks struck the Caribbean and the southern US. Even in our supposedly rational world, it is hard not to see these natural disasters as omens. Great whales dying because of the same solar activity that has sparked the beautiful but eerie curtains of northern lights in our skies. From creation myths to The Tempest, storms and sacrifices and signs go hand in hand with the way we try to understand our chaotic world. They wreak havoc – with lives, with political careers (witness George W Bush’s inept response to Hurricane Katrina). The modern expression “weather bomb” takes on an awful meaning. In his recent book Sea of Storms, the US academic Stuart B Schwartz observes that the uber-storms of the 21st century have a new power over us. “In a way, the hurricanes and how societies deal with them have become symbolic of competing world views.” East and west, north and south: the new world order encompassed by compass points. We account for disaster not in our own culpability as drivers of climate change and instigators of the Anthropocene, but in dreams and myths and faith. It is the sense of the unseen and the unpredictable that disturbs us. In the storms of 2014 that raked the soft southern coast of England – vulnerable shores lacking the rocky bulwarks of Cornwall, Wales or Scotland – we seemed to have been taken by surprise. Used to experiencing the world through the manipulable screens in our hands, those swirling patterns graphically represented in the nightly weather forecast had become vividly, dangerously alive. At least the sea is visible in its rage; the wind is an unseen monster. You do not hear the wind; you hear what it leaves in its wake. Its sound is defined by the shape of everything else – trees, buildings, waves; by what gets in its way. Perhaps that’s why it preys on our imagination so disturbingly. It is the sound of the world’s motion, as if the invisible spinning of the globe had suddenly become tangible; a world blown out of kilter. For what sins are we being punished? What have we done wrong? In Caribbean hurricanes during the 17th century, Spanish priests would toss crucifixes into the waves or hold the Host up into the wind, for fear that the transgressions of their flocks were responsible for God’s displeasure. The contemporary equivalent is the virally popular social media call from Ryon Edwards for his fellow Floridians to shoot at Irma - “LET’S SHOW IRMA THAT WE SHOOT FIRST” - despite warnings that their bullets would fall to earth, with fatal results. Sometimes it seems we have not moved far from such superstitious gestures at the elemental. In 1520 the German artist Albrecht Dürer travelled to the half-land, half-sea coast of Zeeland in the Netherlands, in search of a stranded whale. It had disappeared by the time he reached the location, but instead he caught a fever that would eventually take his life. That whale, whose demise we might now scientifically ascribe to astronomical forces, became aligned in Dürer’s mind with the omens he saw in the skies: comets and other phenomena that echoed or even predicted European fortunes, good or bad. The genderless angel in his celebrated engraving Melencolia I, looks up at just such a comet. Dürer sought to rationalise, even as he aestheticised, the natural world. Yet we still anthropomorphise the elements. We name “weather events” – storm Doris, hurricane Irma – as if to bring them into our dominion. Donald Trump creates a supposedly reassuring narrative by expressing his awe – “Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!” – as if a 140 character tweet will magically extend his power over the storm, like the Wizard of Oz, even as he denies our responsibility for it. His gesture is no more effective, perhaps even less so, than those Caribbean priests holding up their Hosts against the wind, or the call to shoot at Irma.

And in 2017 – in his latest critically acclaimed, award-winning incarnation as chief creative officer at Calvin Klein – Raf Simons has become one of the influential six. Simons presented his second collection for the American megabrand on Thursday night in New York, and there was a sense of menace in the air from the outset. Guests sat beneath a set created by his long-term collaborator, the artist Sterling Ruby. The venue’s ceiling was covered in pom-poms in Sesame Street colours – bright Big Bird yellow, Cookie Monster blue, Elmo red – with axes hanging from them, their blades hovering over the front row’s heads. Simons’ take on Calvin Klein is a world away from Marky Mark looking buff in his underpants in the 1990s. References to American horror films came thick and fast on the catwalk, in blood-splattered white leather bags and silk off-the-shoulder dresses covered in recurring red splodges, and white high-heeled shoes punctuated with little round holes that looked a lot like Jason’s hockey mask from Friday the 13th. Some of the most affecting imagery came through another American cultural touchstone: the work of Andy Warhol, with images from his Death and Disaster series, as well as a portrait of Dennis Hopper, star of the ultimate road movie gone wrong, Easy Rider, deployed as prints on jeans and vests. It was all pretty chilling, but there was an air of nostalgia and Hollywood romance, too. There were silk cowboy shirts, and cowboy boots in rich earthy colours, and 1950s fit-and-flare prom-style dresses refashioned in polyester. A silhouette of a Hitchcock heroine – pencil skirt and close-fitting, tucked-in top – was remade in marigold yellow rubber, and paired with opera-length pink rubber gloves. Many of the models held bags inspired by cheerleader pom-poms, which became bigger and bigger until they consumed the models entirely, becoming full-length pom-pom dresses with tentacles that swept along the floor. Backstage, Simons explained that the collection was about “American nightmares and American dreams. Where there is beauty there is always the opposite, where there is horror there is always the opposite. The two cannot exist without each other.” There was nostalgia, too, in the show’s carefully curated guest list. Original Calvin Klein muse Brooke Shields sat on the front row, so too did Twin Peaks’ Kyle MacLachlan, and Millie Bobby Brown – the star of TV nostalgia-fest Stranger Things. Even when they weren’t there in person, celebrities of the 80s and 90s were represented by their offspring: Kaia Gerber, the daughter of original Calvin Klein model Cindy Crawford, made her catwalk debut; the brand’s new face, Paris Jackson, daughter of Michael, was also in attendance. Conceptually, this nostalgia-fuelled exploration of the temporary, and controllable, fright engendered by scary movies felt apt in an age in which one needs only to switch on the news to see a real American horror story. And on a practical level, if you soon find yourself craving a pair of cowboy boots for the first time since the noughties, you know who to blame."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/08/tory-fallacy-migrants-british-jobs-wages-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T12:25:56Z","webTitle":"The Tory fallacy: that migrants are taking British jobs and driving down wages | Vince Cable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/tory-fallacy-migrants-british-jobs-wages-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/tory-fallacy-migrants-british-jobs-wages-brexit","fields":{"headline":"The Tory fallacy: that migrants are taking British jobs and driving down wages","bodyText":"The leaked proposals on post-Brexit immigration give us a useful insight into the government’s thought processes. The desire seems largely to be about addressing “public concern” over pressure on public services, depression of wages and displacement of UK workers: that is, issues of perception, whether or not they are real. That policy is driven by an obsession with meeting the net immigration target of “tens of thousands”: despite it being continually exceeded since the Conservative pledge was made seven years ago; despite its dependence on levels of emigration over which the government has absolutely no control; and despite the inclusion of overseas students in the net immigration numbers whose contribution we now know to be massively overstated. The document makes much of the distinction between skilled and unskilled labour and between “hard” and “soft” skills. Bankers, engineers and footballers are welcome, but not hotel receptionists, care workers, chefs or cleaners. By implication, unskilled jobs should be reserved for British workers. But it isn’t clear where, with record levels of employment, the reserve army of unemployed, unskilled Britons is currently billeted. At the heart of the politics of immigration is the belief, repeated by Theresa May as a fact, that immigrants, especially unskilled immigrants, depress wages. At first sight the argument seems plausible – and undeniably there is low-wage competition in some places. But there is no evidence that this is a general problem. When the coalition embarked on its review of EU competences in 2013, I commissioned a range of reviews and studies to establish the facts. They showed that the impact on wages was very small (and only in recession conditions). By and large, immigrants were doing jobs that British people didn’t want to do (or highly skilled jobs that helped to generate work for others). This research was inconvenient to the Home Office, which vetoed the publication of its results. I have now written to the prime minister to ask her to publish them as part of the current public debate. In support of the conclusions, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration’s latest report – Brexit: Beyond the Highly Skilled – the Needs of Other Economic Stakeholders – highlighted several startling cases. For example, one evidence-giver recalled that they recently hired 53 individuals, of whom 11 were UK nationals and 42 EEA nationals. Of the 11 UK nationals, eight left on their first day, saying the work was not for them, as it was too repetitive and the environment was too cold. All 42 EEA migrants were still there at the time of the report’s publication. Stories such as this are repeated up and down the country. Moreover, there is no single definition of a low-skilled worker. The Office for National Statistics uses a skills classification formula that is based on the time necessary for someone to learn how to perform the task required of them, whether through formal qualifications or on-the-job experience. This approach disregards the “soft” skills that for some jobs are crucial, as in health and care. An immigration policy based on ministers’ distaste for people with low skills is going to end badly. Indeed, one of the ironies of the immigration debate is that the Conservatives, who normally take refuge in the wisdom of markets, have an almost Soviet enthusiasm for centralised government direction and the wisdom of bureaucracy when it comes to migration. All this is not to deny that immigration brings costs as well as economic benefits. The most obvious, if least discussed, is the impact of rising numbers of people on the housing market, where supply is constrained. House prices and rents are bound to rise. Yet the critics of immigration rarely raise this issue, perhaps because the beneficiaries are generally older owner-occupiers (who tend collectively towards Brexit) and the losers are younger people in cities such as London (who tend collectively towards remain). Here, as elsewhere, it is perception that is driving immigration policy; not reality. Nor is it satisfactory simply to ignore the perceived or real problems around immigration; the political class has lost respect and authority by doing just that. There clearly is need to take investment in skills training and continuing education for British workers much more seriously. The frustrations over public and private sector pay are real, even if immigrants are not the main reason for wage stagnation. The anecdotes about immigrants in doctors’ surgeries reflect a wider problem of stress in primary health care. And immigration has compounded an underlying failure in housing supply. The political temptation to play to the gallery rather than address these underlying problems is, sadly, all too real. • Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats and former secretary of state for business"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/08/n-ireland-police-officer-held-over-alleged-sectarian-sexist-and-racist-tweets","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T13:52:25Z","webTitle":"N Ireland police officer held over alleged sectarian, sexist and racist tweets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/08/n-ireland-police-officer-held-over-alleged-sectarian-sexist-and-racist-tweets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/08/n-ireland-police-officer-held-over-alleged-sectarian-sexist-and-racist-tweets","fields":{"headline":"N Ireland police officer held over alleged sectarian, sexist and racist tweets","bodyText":"A serving police officer in Northern Ireland has been arrested over allegedly using Twitter to distribute sectarian, sexist and racist remarks. The police ombudsman’s office in Belfast confirmed on Friday the officer was arrested by the policing watchdog. The officer’s detention follows the police ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, initiating the investigation after receiving allegations this summer. The ombudsman’s office is understood to be dealing with a number of complaints from members of the public in relation to the alleged misuse of Twitter. They include concerns over abusive messages and also the leaking of confidential material. Last month the Guardian revealed that around half a dozen police officers and support staff were under investigation in Northern Ireland over allegations that they had posted racist, sexist and sectarian messages on Twitter and had potentially prejudiced criminal inquiries. The group is also being investigated for allegedly tweeting pictures of bottles of urine from inside a police vehicle and showing their private parts beside guns. The PSNI confirmed at the time that the police were looking into the claims that those behind the tweets were serving officers. They are under investigation from the PSNI’s professional standards department. It is understood the six PSNI officers or civilian support staff under investigation are all based in the greater Belfast area. The tweets include wholly unfounded fake rumours of a sex tape involving a Northern Irish journalist. In another tweet, one of those alleged to have sent the messages brands the Catholic Lower Falls-Divis district of West Belfast as a place where “thieves operate ... like fucking rabbits”. Beneath the message is a map of the district with a red circle drawn around it. Another post relating to the same district includes a photograph of a man alleged to have mugged a foreign tourist earlier this year. Security sources in Northern Ireland said that this tweet was sent out before any arrest was made in connection with the crime. In tweeting the suspect’s face, those responsible were in danger of prejudicing any upcoming trial in connection with the mugging, the sources said. There is also concern in security circles that those allegedly engaging with women online for sexual encounters could fall for “honey traps” set by armed republican dissident groups determined to kill PSNI members. Some of those behind the messages even engage in Twitter exchanges with Saoradh – the new political party that supports prisoners belonging to the New IRA terror group. The republican dissidents are taunted and told in one message that “my colleagues sit in on your meetings &amp; private chats anyway. They fill me in.” The tweet ends with the hashtag #C3, which is a reference to the PSNI’s anti-terrorist branch. A security force veteran based in Northern Ireland, who brought the tweets to the attention of the Guardian, said those behind this particular message had openly admitted to the republican dissidents that they were being monitored via electronic surveillance. Photographs of the interiors of heavily-fortified PSNI stations, including a CCTV monitoring station in Belfast, have also been tweeted in the stream being investigated. Other pictures of alleged crime suspects and convicted criminals sent include a message urging a prisoner to “put the rope up” and “hang yourself”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/08/premier-league-transfer-window-close-early-rest-of-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T12:44:54Z","webTitle":"Premier League transfer window to close early – but will rest of Europe follow suit?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/08/premier-league-transfer-window-close-early-rest-of-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/08/premier-league-transfer-window-close-early-rest-of-europe","fields":{"headline":"Premier League transfer window to close early – but will rest of Europe follow suit?","bodyText":"The Premier League clubs this week voted to close the transfer window early from before the 2018-19 season but how do the other major leagues in Europe feel about the decision and are they likely to follow suit? Spain The comments of Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, repeatedly underline his intense concern about the strength of competition from England. France’s ability to take the Brazil forward Neymar from Barcelona adds another dimension but it is the Premier League that the Spanish clubs seek to emulate; above all, it is the Premier League they must keep at bay and challenge for the best players. Any advantage must be sought, and a window that allows Spanish clubs, including the big two of Barcelona and Real Madrid, an additional two weeks to sign players is an attractive proposition. This season Spain had an extra day. There was little advantage gained but an extra two weeks would be a different matter and is another reason why La Liga is unlikely to follow suit. Sid Lowe Italy The Juventus CEO, Beppe Marotta, was quick to offer his club’s approval for the Premier League decision. He was joined in doing so by directors from a host of other influential Italian clubs – including Roma, Milan and Inter – and suggested that Serie A teams may bring a similar proposal to the Italian Football Federation in the near future. More significantly still, the Juventus chairman, Andrea Agnelli, has just been appointed to the same position on the board of the European Club Association. “These decisions are autonomous for each of the individual federations,” said Marotta, “but I believe that there needs to be a homogenous conversation at least between the most important leagues in Europe.” Paolo Bandini Germany There was a lot of praise in Germany for the Premier League’s decision on Thursday. Jens Todt, the sporting director of Hamburg, said he would be prepared “to support any movement” towards making it happen in the Bundesliga too. “I welcome the developments in England, I am absolutely in favour of the window closing earlier,” he told Sky Germany. Borussia Dortmund’s CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke, added: “I would assume we would have a majority to get that through in Germany too. And even if the Spanish, Italian and French leagues don’t do the same, the situation would be much calmer when Germany and England agree [to close the window early].” The issue was discussed at a meeting between Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga clubs on Thursday and the newly founded DFL (Deutsche Fussball Liga) Football Commission will gather information and report back to the clubs. It is then likely to be put to a vote. The feeling is that it is currently 50-50 whether a proposal to close the window early would succeed. Marcus Christenson France Within 24 hours of the Premier League voting to close the summer transfer window before the first ball of the 2018-19 season is kicked, high-ranking figures in French football called for the change to be adopted in Ligue 1. Monaco’s vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev, called the move “a great decision”and Lyon’s owner, Jean-Michel Aulas, furthered this sentiment on Canal+, saying that “the transfer window must close before the season starts”. The league’s governing body, the LFP, confirmed late on Thursday that it would begin discussions immediately. The early tide in France is clearly with a move towards a shortened summer window. Adam White, Get French Football News Portugal Portugal is coming out of a transfer window that lasted the best part of a week longer than the one in England, Germany and Spain, and the lack of rush – a constant theme, especially when it comes to match scheduling – is intrinsic in the country’s footballing administrative fabric. Still, there has been understanding for the Premier League’s move to shut up shop earlier with Benfica’s coach, Rui Vitória, giving it his approval on Thursday. “If it closes earlier, we’ll have the same problems and unrest,” he said, “but much earlier? For coaches and for teams, we’d have a completely different stability. I think most coaches will feel the same.” Vitória also said it was likely to shift Europe’s boundaries as a whole, with the Premier League as market leader. Portugal’s incoming transfer business is reactive, moving to replace players sold elsewhere – with England the ideal market – so fewer sales would mean fewer purchases. Imports from South America, which will remain a large part of the football economy, tend to be planned months in advance and are unlikely to be affected.

Carolann Gallon, 22, brought a 13-year-old who had run away from foster care to a Tyneside flat knowing she was likely to be the victim of a sexual offence. Two of her victims were in care when she brought them to be abused, Newcastle crown court heard. When she was arrested, she told police: “It’s self-inflicted; I’ve got no sympathy.” Her prison sentence came at the end of a week in which 16 other members of the 18-strong Newcastle grooming gang were handed lengthy jail terms for offences including drugging, trafficking and sexually exploiting their young victims. The gang were brought to trial following an unprecedented and strongly criticised police investigation in which a convicted rapist was paid £10,000 to inform on the gang. One further member of the gang remains to be sentenced on Monday. Newcastle crown court heard that the victims, aged between 13 and 25, some of whom were in care, were plied with alcohol and drugs before being sexually abused at “sessions” in the west end of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. One girl, who was 13 years old and in care when she was first attacked in 2012, told the court through her mental health worker: “I was harmed beyond imagination, physically, emotionally and psychologically.” The next year Gallon took the same girl to a series of addresses in Newcastle’s west end, where she was given alcohol and drugs and raped, she told police later. Gallon, the only woman charged in connection with Operation Shelter, was jailed on Friday for six years and three months after admitting three counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation. The 22-year-old defendant, who was 17 when the offences began, told police after she was arrested: “[The victims] shouldn’t have too much to drink. If they want to go with them, they have got their own mind to go with people. “They are not some kid, they are 15 or 16. If they’re mortal [drunk] they are going to do something, why get mortal in the first place? It’s self-inflicted, I’ve got no sympathy.” Gallon’s barrister, Uzma Khan, said Gallon was herself a victim. The defendant had been neglected by her parents, Khan claimed, and described her case as “a classic example of the abused becoming the abuser and the groomed becoming the groomer”. However, that argument was rejected by the judge, Penny Moreland, who said that while Gallon’s childhood was tough, she had not complained to police about any abuse. The judge said: “You were described yourself as being a victim. There have been ample opportunities for you to make complaints about these matters. You have never chosen to do so. The result is your complaints have never been tested in court.” At the end of the sentencing hearing, Gallon’s father shouted: “Can I just say, how cruel a judge can be? How cruel can anybody get?” Gallon called out “Dad, I love you” as she was led away. Outside court, a senior detective said the abusers had underestimated their victims’ desire for justice. Det Supt Steve Barron said: “These offenders targeted these women because of their vulnerabilities. They hugely underestimated their strength and determination to seek justice, they thought no one would believe them. We believed them, as did the jury.” Barron said he wanted to ensure there was a “repugnant stigma” attached to sexual exploitation in all communities and “in particular against individuals who think this treatment of women and girls is in any way acceptable”. The 17 defendants received sentences totalling more than 180 years in prison, including two men for 29 years each for a string of offences including rape, conspiracy to incite prostitution and drugs offences. The 18th and final member of the grooming gang will be sentenced on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2017/sep/14/how-universities-solve-creative-arts-crisis-higher-education-graduates","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T06:30:35Z","webTitle":"How can universities help solve the creative arts crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/sep/14/how-universities-solve-creative-arts-crisis-higher-education-graduates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/sep/14/how-universities-solve-creative-arts-crisis-higher-education-graduates","fields":{"headline":"How can universities help solve the creative arts crisis?","bodyText":"The creative arts are in crisis in the UK. At school level, arts A-levels, including creative writing, are being dropped, while the new Ebacc prioritises Stem subjects. For universities, the increasing focus on graduate salaries as a measure of success is undermining courses in the creative arts. However, it is crucial that we protect creative education – it provides the skills our knowledge economy will need in a future where jobs will be increasingly automated. These points were all highlighted in a recent Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) paper on the crisis in creative arts in the UK. It warns that fewer pupils studying arts subjects translates to fewer options for creative subjects at university level. The problem is exacerbated by the disincentives for universities to offer creative arts courses: low graduate salaries in the creative industries harm their performance in the teaching excellence framework and in new longitudinal data on educational outcomes. HEPI’s arguments chime with my own experience. Over the last four years, I have been investigating this area – first as a course leader at Central Saint Martins, and more recently as co-director of Art School, a new organisation set up to improve arts education. To address this situation, we need to rethink how we approach arts education at all levels to improve graduate outcomes. So what can universities do? Collaborate more closely with the arts industry This is difficult, since the two sectors work at different paces, with universities typically lagging behind. Partnering is important, however, as it gives students the confidence that they can be a part of the industry.There are some good examples. Orange Tree theatre’s new MA in directing is run in partnership with St Mary’s University, and Manchester University’s MA in screenwriting has been developed with film producer Tanya Seghatchian, who has credits on the Harry Potter films. On the MA in dramatic writing I run at Central Saint Martins, the course is taught with 11 industry experts including John Yorke, who created the BBC Writers Academy; Kate Rowland, founder of the BBC’s new writing department; and Ola Animashawun, who developed the Royal Court Theatre’s young writers programme. Make the most of the university’s role as a thought leader Universities can act as incubators for creative ideas through artistic residencies, which can in turn generate exciting new work that feeds into their courses. Warwick University is a great example of a university supporting companies, such as China Plate theatre studio, to develop ideas. Similarly, at Central Saint Martins, there is a fashion partnership with LVMH and, on the dramatic writing course, we have created a lab to allow companies to explore new ideas in partnership with students, providing space and resources for exploration and experimentation. In the US, Pig Iron theatre company was in residence at Yale School of Drama, trying out new ideas and developing work with students, to the benefit of both sides. Improve the transition from studying to working in the arts There’s a need for targeted schemes which ease the transition from a course into the arts industry. One good example is the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, which has recently launched a directing workshop aimed at supporting entry into the industry for directors who are female, BME or have disabilities. There’s a particular problem in this area for women, since some studies suggest that far fewer work in the arts than study them. Over 70% of students at the University of the Arts London – Europe’s largest arts university – are female, but only around 30% of artists with solo shows in major London galleries were female in 2016. There are similar statistics for female playwrights and directors. Run festivals Collaborating on festivals can help students make useful contacts and gain experience. Two good examples are Winchester University, which runs the Winchester Writers’ festival, and Birmingham University, which holds the National Writers’ Conference with Writing West Midlands. At Central Saint Martins, students work on London Writers’ Week as part of their writer as producer module and, in return, get to attend the week’s events for free. Work on campaigns With their combined weight, universities and the industry can work together to shape government policy on the arts and improve the profession – such as calling for tax breaks for artists. They can also run outreach campaigns. At Central Saint Martins, we have recently launched the Student Guide to Writing series, which is aimed at widening access to professional guidance on playwriting.

He also acknowledges his side cannot afford another limp display against their local rivals Leicesteron Saturday having shipped nine tries in their opener against Saracens. Under Mallinder, Saints were crowned champions in 2014 but finished seventh last season, losing four of their last five league games, and were hammered 55-24 by Saracens at Twickenham last weekend. Supporters are growing impatient and another defeat to the Tigers, who lost at home to Bath on the opening weekend, would scarcely improve the mood. “There are various issues and fans are not happy but that is the sport we live in,” said Mallinder, who has been in charge at Franklin’s Gardens for a decade. “I won’t deny last Saturday’s game did not worry me – I would be stupid to say that – but I think we have got a good squad which can get into that top four and win silverware. “It has been a difficult week. It should be after a performance like that. We were terrible. It is hard to put your finger on it. Preparation went well and we played some really good rugby in our pre-season games. The week leading up to it went well – then suddenly we were hit and we came off a poor second. “Professional rugby is all about winning and if you are not winning then the pressure comes on you. We are aware of that but that is why we are all involved. We like that challenge. There is a bit of madness in it. It does stop you sleeping at night … but if I didn’t like that challenge I would have stayed being a teacher.” Mallinder has responded by making five changes, with the Australia centre Rob Horne making his debut and George North and Teimana Harrison returning. “I will be so disappointed if the players don’t react,” said Mallinder. “Leicester focuses your mind without a doubt but we need, and we will see, a reaction. “I have been involved in 20-odd derbies and you never get a dull game. I am really looking forward to it. I can’t worry about what the fans are thinking. We know it is going to be difficult and there are no guarantees. “You do look back and think: ‘Why were we successful [in 2014]? Why are we not doing quite as well at the moment?’ Looking at our squad, and the new people we have brought in, we have got that firepower.” The flanker Tom Wood is out with a shoulder problem but has called on Saints to show some “blood and guts” and respond forcefully to their Saracens disappointment. “There’s got to be some of that because I think we lacked that last weekend,” he said. “There does have to be some blood and guts about it. There always is with Leicester derbies so hopefully we won’t be found wanting there. It’s got to be a concerted team effort, everybody can’t just go crazy and start beating their chests. “Defence has been a big focus this week because our defence was woeful. Leicester will be wounded as well. If an east Midlands derby needed any extra edge it’s going to have it this weekend, I’d imagine. It is painful to be where we are now knowing what the good times feel like. We’ve had no choice but to have a hard look at ourselves, look each other in the eye and say: ‘That’s the last time that happens.’”. Saracens have included the Wales and Lions back Liam Williams on the bench for their game at Bath on Saturday while Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony, makes a first league start for Wasps at Worcester on Sunday in place of Christian Wade, who has a hamstring injury. Newcastle snatch win with late penalty try A late penalty try earned Newcastle a dramatic 13-12 triumph over Sale at the AJ Bell Stadium on Friday night as the Falcons made it two successive Premiership victories. Steve Diamond’s men played the better rugby in the opening period but a combination of the visitors’ stubborn resistance and their own frailties at the lineout meant Sale went into the break with only a 3-0 advantage courtesy of fly-half AJ MacGinty’s penalty. Sonatane Takulua hit back for Newcastle at the start of the second half, and MacGinty and Takulua then traded three-pointers. Sale soon moved into a 12-6 lead via the boot of their stand-off, but there was a late sting in the tail when referee Andrew Jackson awarded Newcastle a penalty try. Captain Will Addison was the early spark, sprinting fully 60 metres before offloading to Byron McGuigan to scurry clear. Although the wing was brought to ground, several phases later McGuigan picked up the ball again and appeared to have touched down, only for the television match official to rule otherwise. Sale continued to create chances and have the majority of possession but, with the inexperienced Cameron Neild at hooker and lock Bryn Evans out through injury, the hosts’ lineout went to pieces. They failed to capitalise on their territorial dominance, despite MacGinty’s penalty at the end of the first quarter, and were forced to settle for just a three-point buffer at the interval. Newcastle set out with far more intent in the second period and were rewarded by Takulua’s penalty. MacGinty responded almost immediately but the Newcastle scrum-half once again levelled proceedings after Tom Curry infringed at the ruck. However, Diamond’s men upped the intensity once again and their pivot added two more from the tee to take their advantage out to six. Unperturbed, the visitors went in search of the winning score, putting an already struggling set piece under further duress, and they were awarded a penalty try when Marc Jones illegally collapsed the maul. Jones was sent to the sin bin and, despite a late yellow card for Alex Tait, Newcastle held on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/08/network-national-theatre-foodwork-bryan-cranston-ivo-van-hove","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T15:37:45Z","webTitle":"The food Network: play starring Bryan Cranston becomes immersive dining experience","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/08/network-national-theatre-foodwork-bryan-cranston-ivo-van-hove","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/08/network-national-theatre-foodwork-bryan-cranston-ivo-van-hove","fields":{"headline":"The food Network: play starring Bryan Cranston becomes immersive dining experience","bodyText":"Its intense plot may be enough to give anyone indigestion, but a new production of Network at the National Theatre is inviting audiences to watch the ferocious media satire while having a three-course meal on its vast Lyttelton stage. A limited number of tickets will be available through a ballot system for theatregoers to have an “immersive dining experience” as they watch the play, which will star Breaking Bad’s Bryan Cranston as the desperate TV news anchor Howard Beale. The show will have its own onstage restaurant, entitled Foodwork, where theatregoers will be seated by a maitre d’ after arriving through a secret entrance. Dishes on Foodwork’s two menus include portland crab cocktail, short rib and ox cheek bourguignon, and gin and tonic sorbet. Audiences may either dine at tables or at an onstage bar. There are 42 places on stage at each performance. Tickets for a table seat are £95; a place at the bar is £75. The restaurant is sure to be stylish: it is designed by Jan Versweyveld, who regularly creates sleek, minimal sets for the play’s director, Ivo van Hove. The pair previously collaborated on the Young Vic’s A View from the Bridge, the David Bowie musical Lazarus, and Obsession, starring Jude Law, one of their many stage projects adapted from films. Network follows the topsy-turvy fortunes of Beale, who announces that he will kill himself during a live broadcast because his show is getting poor ratings. He instantly becomes a folk hero and leads the nation’s viewers in a rallying cry: “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not gonna take this any more.” Beale was memorably portrayed by Peter Finch in Sidney Lumet’s 1976 film – the performance saw Finch become the first actor to be posthumously awarded an Oscar. Paddy Chayevsky’s screenplay has been adapted by Lee Hall for the National’s production. Network, which co-stars Downton Abbey’s Michelle Dockery, will open on 4 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/across-the-universe/2017/sep/08/watch-out-for-the-northern-lights-tonight-uk-could-be-in-for-a-big-display-aurora","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T14:07:17Z","webTitle":"Watch out for the northern lights tonight – UK could be in for a big display","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2017/sep/08/watch-out-for-the-northern-lights-tonight-uk-could-be-in-for-a-big-display-aurora","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/across-the-universe/2017/sep/08/watch-out-for-the-northern-lights-tonight-uk-could-be-in-for-a-big-display-aurora","fields":{"headline":"Watch out for the northern lights tonight – UK could be in for a big display","bodyText":"The particle ‘debris’ created by a monstrously large solar flare reached Earth at around 00:00 BST last night. It sparked displays of the northern lights that were seen as far south as Edinburgh in Scotland and Arkansas in the US. At 00:12 BST, Lancaster University’s Aurorawatch issued an amber alert, meaning that aurora is likely across Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland. A dozen minutes later, they upgraded to red alert, saying “It is likely that aurora will be visible by eye and camera from anywhere in the UK.” Experts say that the storm is still raging around our planet today and could continue or even intensify into this evening. This makes it possible – though not guaranteed –that another spectacular display of aurora could be seen tonight. To see the aurora requires clear, dark skies, usually well away from streetlamps and other light pollution. Look north, because the phenomenon creeps down from the polar regions. Faint aurora can appear as misty patches of grey light that can change their shape and configuration. Stronger displays that trigger the colour receptors in our eyes can be green or red in colour. They can appear as filaments or shifting ‘curtains’ across the sky. The aurora is caused when charged particles (smashed up atoms) from the Sun collide with atoms in our atmosphere, giving off light. As of this morning, spaceweather.com was reporting that they were still blowing a gale past Earth, with solar wind speeds of around 700 kilometres per second. (The windspeeds in Hurricane Irma peak at around 240 kilometres per hour.) At the time of writing, aurora-service.eu shows that most of Scandinavia is engulfed (although the lights are not visible because it is day time). The northern top of Scotland also falls just under the auroral oval. The particles that spark the aurora originate in solar flares. The energy released in these explosions can be more than a billion times the energy of an atomic weapon, and blow away a chunk of the Sun’s outer atmosphere. Known as a coronal mass ejection, this ‘magnetic cannonball’ contains the charged particles that spark the aurora if they happen to hit the Earth. This particular solar storm began on Wednesday when the largest solar flare for more than a decade exploded on the Sun. In general, the Sun is winding down in its activity in preparation for a regular lull known as solar minimum. Yet, large flares are known to happen in this declining stage. This was the case in 1859 when the Carrington event, the largest solar storm on records, struck our planet. It sparked aurora in two thirds of the skies across the globe and its electrical interference temporarily rendered telegraph stations and compasses useless. Today, spacecraft, telecommunications and power generators can be at risk from solar storms. Indeed, Wednesday’s flare instantly caused a temporary short-wave radio blackout over Europe, Africa and the Atlantic Ocean. This is why astronomers are investing a lot of effort is studying the Sun to warn of incoming blasts. For most of us, however, the aurora is just a spectacular natural light show.

Have you stopped having a laugh, gone off sex and no longer care if they seem unhappy? Before you reach for a counsellor or lawyer, check how much sleep you are getting. While research has consistently linked lack of sleep with increased risks of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity and premature death, it is now finding that it is also corrosive to relationships. Since more than a third of us get only six hours a night (less than the recommended seven to nine), we shouldn’t be surprised if our love lives are suffering. The solution A study of 43 couples by Ohio State University found that those who slept less than seven hours a night were more likely to argue in a hostile, negative way. However, even if just one partner had had enough sleep, the rows were more likely to be constructive and end with conciliation. The researchers invited the couples into a lab and videoed them arguing about known problems in their relationships (money, in-laws, communication). They also measured the levels of markers such as the proteins IL-6 and TNF-alpha. A rise in these can trigger inflammation in the body and encourage the onset of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The study found that while lack of sleep alone did not raise the level of inflammatory markers, it did make for more toxic rows – and it was the stress of a nasty exchange that led to an increase in markers. Previous studies show that men are more likely to fight with their partners after one night of disturbed sleep, and that couples have more rows after two weeks of less than seven hours sleep. The Ohio research took things further. “This is the first study to show the synergistic effects of short sleep and conflict for inflammation,” said lead author, Dr Stephanie J Wilson. Of course, instinctively we know that sleep deprivation makes us short-tempered and unable to concentrate, make decisions or empathise. A sense of humour, badly needed in any relationship, is the first casualty of sleep deprivation. So while more sleep may not solve the world’s marital discord, it could lubricate many of our relationships. The study looked solely at heterosexual couples, but the findings are likely to apply more widely. Sleep affects the parts of the brain that solve problems. Without that ability, it is hard to have a “good” row, which requires active listening, good humour and self disclosure. The study showed that good rows did not raise levels of inflammatory proteins, however little sleep people had. It is also no coincidence that the dive in relationship satisfaction in the first year after having a baby comes during a long stretch of sleep deprivation. It is hard enough to do anything on not much sleep. Why shouldn’t that include having a good relationship?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/11/brexit-dark-age-prejudices-1970s-immigration-home-office-leaked-documents","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"Will Brexit mean a return to the dark-age prejudices of 1970s immigration policies? | Claude Moraes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/brexit-dark-age-prejudices-1970s-immigration-home-office-leaked-documents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/brexit-dark-age-prejudices-1970s-immigration-home-office-leaked-documents","fields":{"headline":"Will Brexit mean a return to the dark-age prejudices of 1970s immigration policies?","bodyText":"The Guardian newspaper has good campaigning form in exposing the Home Office when it creates injustice on immigration. In the 1970s the Guardian exposed some of the worst and most discriminatory Commonwealth immigration practices used by the UK to target non-white British Commonwealth citizens – which, in the words of the newspaper at the time, “reflected the dark-age prejudices” of 1970s Britain. In the last couple of days the Guardian Home Office leaks have created a dramatic reaction. The leaks have revealed the first official thinking on how Theresa May really views the contribution of EU migrants and their futures. It shows that the Home Office will take the opportunity given by the removal of key European court of justice (ECJ) judgments to tighten the definition of “family reunification”. Further, impositions would come through restrictive income thresholds described as “particularly harsh but legal”, possible fingerprint requirements for biometric permits and an attempt to create an advantage for highly skilled EU migrants over lower-waged EU migrants without any hint of a managed and strategic approach. The leaked document rightly drew fire, given its obviously clumsy and dog-whistle tone. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, immediately understood that the document was not a post-Brexit solution for managed migration but “read like a blueprint on how to strangle [the capital’s] economy” that also “risks thousands of families being split up”. As the only British MEP on the Brexit steering committee of the European parliament, I can see how this approach, which ignored the reciprocal position of UK citizens in the EU, could only worsen the position of UK workers and residents in other EU countries in the Brexit negotiations. In the last couple of days, I have seen real anger here in the European parliament at the UK’s attempt to move to a hardcore domestic immigration policy with no thought for its own UK citizens in the rest of the EU, and with an unrealistic understanding of its medium- and long-term migration needs. It has been widely seen as politically inept and largely playing to the hard right and the tabloid press. It ignores the needs of communities, business, the economy and the potential success of the Brexit negotiations themselves. But in all the commentary over the leaked Home Office documents, a much deeper and darker truth emerges. It lies in the way that the government unusually quotes three ECJ cases by name. One of those cases, Surinder Singh, is a case I remember very well. Singh was a British citizen and in 1992, having married an Indian citizen, he sought to be reunited with his wife. He was prohibited from doing so as a result of the subjective UK primary purpose immigration law. The ECJ case ruling enabled Singh to reunite with his wife under EU free movement law. This came against a backdrop of a hated British immigration law, the primary purpose rule, which routinely divided couples at the whim of subjective decisions by immigration officials. The Surinder Singh case draws attention to an important watershed in British immigration law, because five years after the case, the (by then Labour) government bowed to the huge opposition to the unfair practice, combined with great disquiet over unfairness generally in the UK immigration system with its brutal delays, visitor refusals and family division mostly targeted at the non-white British Commonwealth-descended community in the UK. In 1997, the primary purpose rule was abolished, with the Surinder Singh case having driven a coach and horses through its very existence. The Home Office document deliberately cites the Surinder Singh case because it anticipates a time in which we can move back to a period when subjective and more arbitrary immigration rules can be reintroduced. The wording in the Home Office leaked document is extraordinary. It talks about there being “virtually no limit on the extended family that an EU migrant can bring to Britain”. This is simply not true, and in the words of one leading EU law professor is “highly inflammatory”. This characterises the document and indicates to me a desire for the UK to return to the pre-ECJ landscape of a deterrent immigrant policy that caused so much agony for large sections of UK society. This has nothing to do with the EU and everything to do with bringing back a meaner and more bleak and isolationist immigration policy at a time when Britain is supposedly becoming a global and outward-looking nation following Brexit. Such a policy to overturn ECJ rulings (a derogation from normal rules) indicates a desire by the Home Office to ignore opinion from around the world, which will see the UK in a deeply negative light. Countries that we hope to work with post-Brexit, such as the Brics nations and many developing countries, will view the immigration policies as regressive and insulting to their nationals. It is already the way in which countries such as India are beginning to view how their students are being treated in the UK immigration system. This is very damaging, given that the UK has a major international asset in its higher education institutions. Those who have praised this Home Office blueprint, and those such as the current home secretary, who has distanced herself from it, are aware that this is not just about EU citizens but a profound statement on post-Brexit immigration and the kind of country the UK is going to become. A deeper reading of this leaked document suggests that it is not only EU citizens in the UK who should be concerned about the kind of society the UK government and Home Office are planning. Wider UK society should pay close attention to this document and what it means for them. • Claude Moraes MEP was director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) in the 1990s"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/10/jessie-ware-assembly-hall-london-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Jessie Ware review – a super-smooth soul finally opens up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/10/jessie-ware-assembly-hall-london-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/10/jessie-ware-assembly-hall-london-review","fields":{"headline":"Jessie Ware review – a super-smooth soul finally opens up","bodyText":"The current trend for nightwear as evening wear has all sorts of upsides. “I’m in my pyjamas,” quips Jessie Ware, just a handful of songs into her set, “so I can go straight to bed.” As the crow flies, we are not all that far from her east London home. Wrapped in elegant satin and shod in checked stilettos, a beaming Ware is surrounded by five band members and a lush, verdant stage setting lit by large, sunflower-like lamps. It’s as redolent of a fashion shoot as it is of electrified music performance. Since her first album, 2012’s Devotion, Ware’s visual signature has been as recherche as her sound. Both exude a sleek, grown-up classicism derived from soul and the age of 80s video-pop: Sade and billowing white curtains, are, metaphorically, never far away. Hearing Ware again after a two-year absence, however, it’s striking how strong her good songs remain, and also how much just-so filler she has been responsible for. Seemingly insubstantial, Tough Love – the title track of her last album – gets ecstatic, deserved whoops from the crowd on its first notes. It pins Ware as a gossamer 80s stylist, one whose minimalism and vocal restraint add up to a very high-end product. By contrast, an early-set run of songs like Running and No to Love tend towards muzak this evening. Her maternity leave has also resulted in a brand new album, the forthcoming Glasshouse. A striking new track, Midnight, starts off as a breathless come-hither, then resolves into a 70s soul vamp, injecting a little more oomph into Ware’s glistening catalogue. Its fellow, Selfish Love, is equally striking, a bossa nova confection that recalls the Cardigans’ 90s hit Lovefool, but not damagingly so. The two songs have been released with a pair of intriguing, linked videos – enigmatic films noir in which Ware slays a boyfriend. (For my money, Midnight is her love song to the housekeeper in the films’ story, with whom Ware might be secretly knocking boots.) Both bode well for Glasshouse. Although Ware is chatty, the first half of tonight’s performance is uneventful. You always find yourself wishing that all artists would play their entire sets like they play their encores; so few do. In addition, Ware’s inbuilt sophistication has always carried with it the threat of too much maturity – a problem shared with her fellow south London warbler, Adele – and you can’t help but feel that as album three rolls around, Ware might be tipping over into complacency. Wipe-clean songs, delivered elegantly, with just a little shuffling around the mic stand: job done. By the second half, however, the veneer peels back. Ware wonders aloud whether she can do something “in bad taste”. The mind boggles; GG Allin, a punk performer who used to do unspeakable things with bodily substances, springs to mind. In the end, Ware just asks the crowd to put their phones down, and demands her band play her set opener, Midnight, again. This small outbreak of spontaneity results in an even slinkier version; you suspect Ware is actually proud of that song. Soon after, Ware asks the crowd for a hairband to put up her long hair, “sopping” with sweat. In the effort, one of her stilettos falls off. Instead of fighting to put it back on, Ware kicks off the other one and pads about the front of the stage, barefoot, before sitting on a monitor. She really does look ready for bed, but the result is a charged intimacy for the final pair of very different songs. Wildest Moments is vintage Ware: she is gutsy and bittersweet, trying to find the stable ground in an extreme relationship. The final song is a new one and “important to her”. It’s a love song to several people: Ware’s partner, Sam, after whom it is named, their baby girl and her own mother. Ed Sheeran’s co-writing credit is audible in the song’s stripped-down sensibility, a marked divergence from all the monochrome synthetics that have held sway for two albums. Whereas before, Ware’s songs tended to be generalised paeans to tortured love, now, Sam finds her wondering what sort of a mother she will be. There’s admiration for her own mother’s bravery, and a line that casts her own father in a dim light. It’s a paradigm shift that gets a standing ovation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/10/new-silence-grassroots-local-news-fades","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T06:00:29Z","webTitle":"A new silence at the grassroots as local news fades | Peter Preston","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/10/new-silence-grassroots-local-news-fades","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/10/new-silence-grassroots-local-news-fades","fields":{"headline":"A new silence at the grassroots as local newspapers fade away","bodyText":"And so, over the past few days and weeks, we say goodbye to the Oldham Evening Chronicle, to the Canterbury Times, the Enfield Advertiser and Gazette, the Barnet Press, the Newmarket News, the Kensington and Chelsea News. Plus numerous other editions and titles serving Britain from Saddleworth to Whitstable, from the Wirral to Cleethorpes. Count the number of journalists working on local news: it’s halved over the last 10 years. Count the number of titles gone: 300, heading for 400 fast. Almost a score gone this summer. There was a wan cry that “something must be done” after the Grenfell Tower blaze. There were flimsy promises of help in the last Tory manifesto. But let’s not kid ourselves. Local newspapers as we know them are folding away. Local newsrooms with the critical mass to investigate, to turn over stones, are shrinking. Local journalism as one prop of democracy grows weaker year by year. And that matters: to communities – and to journalists themselves. After the Enfield Gazette was unceremoniously dumped this summer, one of its old reporters wrote poignantly to me. “It is so devastating what is happening to local news – the reporters and photographers on that patch knew the area like the back of their hands … You lose so much local knowledge when papers like these close – to lose entire coverage of outer north London in one fell swoop is a huge loss.” Now, to write in these terms is, of course, to risk an online chorus of derision. Not all local papers – and their websites – are founts of industry or wisdom. Some have already shrivelled ignominiously. Freesheets are high on the closure count as print advertising drops. Is this another business wrecked by the internet? Up to a point. But it is also a business crippled by the debts of big chains that bought family newspapers when the going was good and then found the foundations of that highly profitable game crumbling – a business in hock to its share price. And, like many other businesses, the gloom is not universal. Some areas, some papers, some digital expansions, are doing well enough. But there is a national problem, the problem of a new silence at the grassroots – and, very surprisingly, America may have the beginning of an answer here. Patch, owned by AOL, was a visionary disaster only three years ago: a network of 900 local news sites in 23 states sinking under the weight of grandiose costs and hopeless losses. Patch has a new owner now, the investment firm Hale Global, who treat grandiose ambition like a bad dream. They began slashing headcounts by four-fifths, down to only a few souls over a 100. They expanded the number of Patch websites to 1,030. They revolutionised ad strategies. They also began to make a profit from 2016 on. Patch today is still building from the ground up. But its unique visitor figures have climbed to 26 million a month, and it is hiring rather than firing – 32 new reporters so far this year. Better yet, there’s cooperation rather than competition. Patch has easy access to Apple News and Facebook. It links with local publishers and – as Digiday reports – invites them to migrate to their sites: a technical friend and facilitator. But it is also increasingly ubiquitous from community to community. It is becoming truly national in a mild, under-the-radar way: building blocks for a more consistent future. Too little, too slow? The lesson of Patch itself is that great dreams crush initiative in a world losing its local bearings.

I am one of many who find this usage as absurd as “communist child” or “neo-Keynesian child”. If freedom of conscience is to mean anything, there are only the children of such parents. The DfE’s stance on the purpose of religious education in schools is that it includes supporting children in finding their own spiritual path and should therefore adopt a level-playing-field model of presentation of world views, both religious and secular. If we accept this, we must assent to the view that religion, to borrow a phrase, is something that should be practised only in private, between consenting adults. How this directive is to be reconciled with the current enthusiastic expansion of the “faith school” sector remains mysterious. Charles Baily Bedford I am writing this letter as a foster parent and academic researcher in the area of child protection. I appreciate your support for foster carers and consider it important that this area of work is properly understood and recognised (“Tower Hamlets case has shone a light on how we fail foster carers”, Comment). However, I am concerned that, in the commentary on the placement of a child of Christian origin with a Muslim family, some vital issues have remained unaddressed. In particular, there has been a lack of discussion about the reasons behind the rise in demand for care placements over the last decade. We urgently need to discuss the links between government austerity policies, deprivation and the growth in the numbers of children becoming looked after. The failure on the part of government to discuss such links is perhaps understandable, but why have the media so often ignored the increasingly robust evidence in this area? Recent research, for example, has found that, in England, children in the most deprived 10% of small neighbourhoods were more than 10 times more likely to be looked after than children in the least deprived 10%. Such findings need to be understood and integrated with those on mortality rates and educational outcomes in order that we can appreciate the inequalities between our citizens in relation to raising their children safely in their own homes and communities. Professor Brigid Featherstone University of Huddersfield Kenan Malik is right to say that there is no equivalence between the reporting of the Rotherham child abuse case and the fostering of a “Christian” child with Muslim carers . In the Rotherham case, the fault was with the investigation, rather than the subsequent reporting of the crime. In the fostering example, as the facts have shown, the fault lies in the sensationalist coverage rather than in the original decision, which was made with the best interests of the child in mind. The Daily Mail is under investigation by Ipso for its coverage of the case, which, according to the Guardian, included the digital alteration of a picture to add a veil to the face of a Muslim woman, one assumes with the end of emphasising her “otherness”. Further, it cannot be true, as stated, that the foster parents did not speak English, as the ability to speak it is a precondition of the job. This reporting is both morally wrong and irresponsible and the offending papers must be held to account.

What if students helped decide how much they should pay? What if they were involved in determining academic salaries too? This happens at Mondragon University, a non-profit co-operative in northern Spain, and it is now inspiring plans for a new kind of higher education institution in the UK. The Co-operative College, a charity with a 100-year pedigree in promoting co-operative values, has formed a working group of teachers, students and others interested in alternative education to look into developing a co-operative university. The group is due to report to the college board next month. The college will hold a conference in Manchester in November to discuss its findings. Co-operative principles appear to be a long way from the increasingly marketised system of higher education promoted by recent government policy, but the impetus for the new institution comes from changes introduced by April’s Higher Education and Research Act. In an attempt to encourage competition leading to innovation, the act makes it easier for new groups interested in providing degree-level education to gain degree-awarding powers. Cilla Ross, vice-principal at the Co-operative College, says she had some concerns about it (“on the one hand it’s complete mayhem”), but recognises it could offer an opportunity. At the same time, associates of the college were interested in finding solutions to what they saw as growing dissatisfaction with the university system – experienced academics unable to find permanent contracts, others keen to try innovative ways of teaching but not supported by their institutions, management emphasis on financial rather than pedagogical values. “Partly it’s to do with discontent over the traditional model of a university,” says Ross. “All the stuff with vice-chancellors’ pay is not going down well.” Eduardo Ramos Arroyo, who has been drawing up a report for the working group as part of his MBA at UCL Institute of Education, says: “Many people have in mind big corporations, such as Google and Apple entering higher education. But how about something really challenging, like higher education institutions based on co-operative principles?” The plans could gain impetus from a report to be launched this week by the Higher Education Commission, an independent body made up of leaders from business, education and the three main political parties. It will suggest that, so far, rather than promote innovation, recent higher education policies – particularly changes to funding – have helped entrench the traditional model. The report will say the funding system presents “serious risks to the diversity of the higher education system” and many “challenger institutions” championed by government, far from challenging the standard three-year degree, aspire to it. Meanwhile, outside the established funding system, interest in new ways to offer higher education is growing. The Free University Brighton, which started four years ago offering ad hoc courses and lectures, now runs two undergraduate degrees – philosophy, and social sciences and humanities – taught by volunteer academics, with no tuition fees and delivered, usually in the evenings and weekends, in community spaces; this year teaching will take place in a portable building at a Brighton bin depot. Students cannot achieve an official degree, but receive a “freegree” certificate if they attend 75% of lectures and submit assignments. Ali Ghanimi, who founded FUB, says student demand is huge. “We limit it to people who live in the Brighton and Hove area but we get emails from all over the country from people prepared to travel, or even relocate,” she says. Brian Berwick, 70, retired from his job in the betting industry three years ago and is about to start his third year of a social sciences and humanities degree with FUB. He says he has enjoyed sampling student life and making friends with people of all backgrounds. “They are doing something wonderful and I’m proud to be a part of it,” he says. Other similar initiatives include the Ragged University in Edinburgh, which organises free learning events, and the Social Science Centre, which has provided free co-operative higher education in Lincoln since 2011. Mike Neary, professor of sociology at the University of Lincoln and a founding member of SSC, says he is interested in the idea of a cooperative university as a way of making the kind of education his centre offers financially sustainable “so staff and students can make a good living and live a good life”. But he is also interested in it as a political project promoting the values of the co-operative movement above those of capitalism. He says the Co-operative College’s working group, of which he is a member, has been inspired by the Mondragon University model, which involves students and staff in decision-making, including agreeing not only academic salaries but what fees to pay. Students would also be involved in developing their own learning – something he has long championed through the student as producer project at his university. The working group is looking into two main models for a co-operative university: one is trying to gain degree-awarding powers itself; the other is forming a federation of higher education co-operatives. Another possibility is that different departments and services at existing universities – student accommodation, say, or even a philosophy department – develop into co-operatives under an overall university banner. Examples of co-operatives that could join a federation include two recently set up by staff whose courses were closing because of funding pressures. Fenella Porter, one of several people recently made redundant from the trade union studies department at Ruskin College, Oxford, who are setting up a learning co-operative, says the model offers a practical way to continue to run courses. Tutors being made redundant from the Vaughan Centre for Lifelong Learning at Leicester University are also planning to set up a co-operative this autumn. The centre is due to close in 2020 because, the university says, it requires “an unsustainable level of subsidy”. Ramos Arroyo agrees a co-operative university should help counter increasing disengagement by both academics and by students. “Students will understand from day one that they have to be responsible for their own education,” he says. “That they are not just buying a degree.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/sep/08/lab-notes-theres-a-hole-near-my-heart-that-can-only-be-filled-by-this-weeks-science","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T15:17:18Z","webTitle":"Lab notes: there's a hole (near) my heart that can only be filled by ... this week's science!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/08/lab-notes-theres-a-hole-near-my-heart-that-can-only-be-filled-by-this-weeks-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/sep/08/lab-notes-theres-a-hole-near-my-heart-that-can-only-be-filled-by-this-weeks-science","fields":{"headline":"Lab notes: there's a hole (near) my heart that can only be filled by ... this week's science!","bodyText":"This week’s biggest stories The most exciting story this week is kind of about nothing ... but a very big nothing.

Despite being a rather obscure protein to most of us, MUC7 is actually quite important – it helps get rid of bacteria and other junk in our oral tracts. One of the most interesting features of the gene that encodes MUC7 is that it contains a series of repeated DNA sequences (called the “PTS repeat region” for the amino acids these sequences encode: proline, threonine, and serine). Repeated structural elements are a fairly common feature of the genome, and these regions tend to be where many interesting evolutionary events occur.

Add in the fact the 29-year-old effectively did so with a broken collarbone and it becomes not only a remarkable feat but also easy to see why Eddie Jones has been in contact. It was a surprise, therefore, to see Rhodes on the bench rather than starting against Northampton last Saturday. That is until he explains how, in the European Cup final in May, he suffered a recurrence of an injury first sustained four years ago, underwent surgery to remove a piece of hip bone and attach it to the collarbone, spent three-and-a-half months in a sling and began pre-season training just a few days before that match. It then becomes astonishing he was on the bench at all. “I injured my shoulder in Cape Town four years ago and it was misdiagnosed when I broke the collarbone. I injured it again when we played Clermont,” the 6ft 6in flanker said. “They had to cut a piece of bone out of my hip and replace a piece of bone in my collarbone with a plate and a couple of things. It ended up being something that could have been prevented four years ago but as it is, it has come right now. The plate is still in. It will remain in there unless it becomes a problem – pain or something like that.” Rhodes gives the impression that is a sensation he is yet to experience but it soon becomes clear he had been playing through pain for some time. “The tip of my collarbone, about an inch from the end, broke off,” he said. “After it was misdiagnosed, cartilage formed in that break so basically formed a new joint. I played with that discomfort and with rehabbing and strengthening the muscles around it. I managed to play for four years and the joint that formed; I re-broke that against Clermont. I went for scans and it turned out it was broken, not a dislocation as they thought.” Despite carrying the injury, the South Africa-born blindside flanker appeared in all but one of Saracens 23 Premiership matches, often turning out in the second row, where the team were blighted by injuries. He was ever present throughout their European campaign which culminated with their successful title defence and while six team-mates were picked in the initial Lions touring party, it was Rhodes who was named as the player of the season by his peers. Having arrived at Saracens in the summer of 2015, Rhodes does not become eligible for England until next summer – and he will not quite do so in time to tour South Africa – but he has made his choice and Jones can pick him next autumn, regardless of the fact World Rugby voted in May to extend the residency period to five years. So how did the conversation with Jones go? “Just a brief phone call. He just said: ‘Keep up the good work, I’ve got my eye on you,’ and I think it was just a complimentary call. He’s focusing on the players he’s got. I don’t really expect too much communication until I qualify.” Continuing Saracens’ imperious start to the season is more of a priority and Rhodes starts against Bath on Saturday, having come on with 20 minutes to go at Twickenham and with eight tries already on the scoreboard. Maro Itoje again starts, this time in the second row, while Mako Vunipola, Owen Farrell and Liam Williams are set for their first appearances of the season from the bench. There is still no place for Billy Vunipola, while Anthony Perenise starts at tighthead in Bath’s only change. In Rhodes’ case, ring rust would be an obvious concern considering how little training he managed over the summer but he clearly relishes the heat of battle. “You’ve just got to get through it, get a bit of game hardness and get back into it,” he said. “Training, you can sometimes be a bit tentative in contact. I’m sure there will be times in the next couple of games when it’s a bit sore but that’s just part of coming back. The game is the best place to test it out, get stuck in, get your mind on other things and go balls to the wall.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2017/sep/11/charity-shop-best-buys-send-us-your-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T06:10:00Z","webTitle":"Charity shop best buys - send us your pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/sep/11/charity-shop-best-buys-send-us-your-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/sep/11/charity-shop-best-buys-send-us-your-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Charity shop best buys - send us your pictures","bodyText":"Charity shops: love ‘em or hate ‘em, they are now a staple feature of high streets around the UK. A report by thinktank Demos, supported by the Charity Retail Association, shows that charity shops bring in a cool £270m for their parent charities every year and provide a vital support for many volunteers, helping them as a bridge into paid employment. But most of us still see a plethora of charity shops as a sign of decline in our high streets - only 6% of those who haven’t bought anything recently from a charity shop want to see more charity shops in our towns. However, there is hope. Demos chief executive Claudia Wood points out that people who shop regularly at charity stores are more likely to want to see more, rather than fewer, charity shops in their area. “One of the interesting findings from the research is that young people like the fact that charity shops are ethical and cheap places to shop,” she says. The report wants to see more men, too, in charity shops, recommending more specialist pop-up shops for men, including male formal wear.

The picture shows repair work under way in the arena’s City Room, one of the three main entrances to the venue, which was heavily damaged by the blast at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. It was released by a charity supporting victims of the attack with the aim of preparing concertgoers for the arena’s reopening on Saturday night, 111 days after the deadliest attack on UK soil in more than a decade. Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds will share a stage with the Courteeners, Blossoms, Rick Astley and others at the benefit concert, We Are Manchester, to raise money for a permanent memorial dedicated to the victims of the atrocity. The first glimpse inside the arena came after more than 500 people who were directly affected by the bomb – including bereaved families, those who suffered life-changing injuries and many witnesses – were given a private visit to the City Room on Thursday. The controlled visit was supported by Greater Manchester police and the Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Peace Foundation, a charity that supports victims of terrorist atrocities founded after the IRA bombing in Warrington in 1993. Nick Taylor, the charity’s chief executive, said the victims showed “resilience, solidarity as well as emotional outpouring” when taken inside the arena for the first time since the blast: “What we’ve found is people found it difficult but overall found it positive and helpful.” The charity will have an emotional response team on duty on Saturday night, as well as a suite where people can talk to mental health professionals and trauma experts. “It will be difficult for some people to return and there will be a lot of attention on this event but the artists are giving their time for free,” Taylor said. “There’s going to be much-changed security in place … Security is being put first. “For many people walking into that arena, and walking out at the end, it’s going to be a difficult experience. But the event’s sold out and the message we’re giving is that we’ve got to come together and stand together and send a strong message of support to those people affected, but also send a strong message out that this is our way of life and it’s going to continue.” Concertgoers have been told to expect tight security. All entrants willbe screened on arrival and bags larger than 35cm x 40cm x 19cm are banned. The City Room, which is still undergoing repair work, will open to ticket-holders at 5pm on Saturday. Councillor Sue Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester city council, said: “Those who perpetrate terrorist attacks want to divide us and stifle our freedoms. No one will ever forget the terrible events of 22 May but Manchester has reacted with love, solidarity and a determination to continue doing the things which make this such a vibrant city. “We welcome the re-opening of the arena, a major venue which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors, as a powerful symbol of this defiant and resilient spirit. It is entirely fitting that the re-opening event should be a memorial fundraiser. Plans for the form and location of any permanent commemorations will be determined in liaison with the families of victims and others affected by the attack.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/04/runners-v-pedestrians-who-should-give-way-to-whom","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"Runners v pedestrians: who should give way to whom?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/04/runners-v-pedestrians-who-should-give-way-to-whom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/04/runners-v-pedestrians-who-should-give-way-to-whom","fields":{"headline":"Runners v pedestrians: who should give way to whom?","bodyText":"Only about 20% of runners use an athletics track. Most of us run in spaces that were not really designed for it, in streets, parks and other shared space. Some have argued that running in such spaces is even transgressive; it steps out of the territorial confines of the athletics track, going against the norms of modern “achievement sport” and attempts to fit runners into a landscape designed for the car and for the (slower) pedestrian. From this perspective, running can even be viewed as a way to reclaim the street for other forms of human locomotion – a way to re-inhabit urban spaces. But, whatever your opinion, the shared public spaces of cities are definitely not designed for running. They are not the monoculture of the athletics track and, rather than setting runners apart from everyday life, entangle us within it. There is no neutralisation or predictability here – we must negotiate everything public spaces throw at us. Dogs, children on scooters, uneven paving slabs, lamp-posts, bus shelters queues and bikes must all be encountered without any rule books or lane markings to guide us. One of the most common interactions runners face is with pedestrians. Every run is punctuated by a need to negotiate space with them. These encounters are so mundane that we rarely pay them much attention, apart from when somebody shocks the entire world by pushing someone in front of a bus or runs into the prime minister. But there is much at stake within these momentary meetings. They offer an important window into the profound everyday processes that establish social order on the street. Any given meeting of runner and pedestrian will require one (or both) to change their course or halt their movement. The result of such meetings can act to legitimise or delegitimise a person’s claim to space and help produce the hierarchy found on the street. While such encounters and their impacts have been well-discussed about other mobile forms – such as those between cyclists and drivers – encounters between runners and pedestrians have not been explored in similar depth. But with the growing popularity of running, its importance for public health initiatives and the growing use of running as a form of transport, it is important to understand these encounters and how runners fit into our shared public spaces. This is what I and colleagues from Plymouth University were interested in finding out in a project that partly sought to understand these encounters. We interviewed runners in two different ways, to understand how they thought encounters with pedestrians should be negotiated – and how they actually were. The first group were joined on their run and interviewed on the go about their experiences, including that of passing pedestrians. The second group were given a head camera to wear during a run and then were interviewed afterwards while watching the footage. Doing so revealed an interesting “value-action gap” – the discrepancy between how somebody says they act in a given situation and how they actually do. While some runners in our study suggested that responsibility should lie with them to ensure that encounters with pedestrians are negotiated successfully (due to their higher speed and minority status) and others placed the obligation on pedestrians (thanks to their superior ability to stop or change direction), the majority of runners adopted a diplomatic stance, arguing that the task is a shared one. In professing joint responsibility, most runners position ourselves as having an equal claim to use public spaces as pedestrians. These different views about who should assume responsibility raises the question of how encounters between runners and pedestrians actually happen. Our research has demonstrated that a number of approaches are used by runners when encountering pedestrians, but they essentially come down to three approaches – choosing a side, stepping down and slaloming. Each approach involves the use of the running body to different extents, places different degrees of responsibility upon runners, and will undoubtedly be familiar to any runners reading this. Taken together, they reveal the value-action gap mentioned earlier. The tactic of choosing a side assumes that both runners and pedestrians share some responsibility in negotiating their encounters and are therefore equals in the mobility hierarchy. Here, runners use bodily movements to signify their intention, but rely on pedestrians to respond appropriately. In essence, they move to one side of the pavement, creating a space they hope the pedestrian will move into as they pass. Ostensibly, this is a straightforward scenario. But many encounters are not – often space is limited, there are crowds, runners are approaching from behind and there are other objects in the space that must also be navigated. When situations are more complex, runners frequently find the reliance for ensuring that encounters are successfully negotiated is placed more heavily upon them. It is here when two further tactics – stepping down and slaloming – tend to be employed. Stepping down refers to when a runner steps off the pavement and chooses to run in the road to avoid pedestrians. To some, this is unfathomable given the risks involved. Yet to others, the movements of cars is more predictable and easier to negotiate than those of pedestrians. Finally, the slalom involves runners weaving their body around and past other people and objects, often in response to unexpected obstacles or movements made by others. As with stepping down, slaloming requires runners to take full responsibility for creating their own route. Although it is the most difficult means of negotiating encounters, there are occasions when it may be a preferred option – when the situation can be most effectively navigated by the runner ducking and diving around others in the street. Decisions about whether to choose a side, step down or slalom in any encounter have to be made in an instant. This does not necessarily mean they are random or that they are straightforwardly habitual or mindless. Rather, runners become adept at making quick and calculated judgments to inform them about which tactic would be the best, most appropriate and plausible in any given encounter. Such an attunement also brings to light the value-action gap apparent in the encounters between runners and pedestrians. While most runners suggest some shared responsibility with pedestrians, the burden of negotiating such encounters generally falls solely upon the runners. Runners feel that they belong in public space, claiming an equal right to those of pedestrians and agreeing that the negotiation of space should be a shared task. Despite this, the physical movements of both runners and pedestrians would suggest that walkers top the hierarchy, with runners most often breaking their passage, changing their route and conceding their space. So where do runners fit into our towns and cities then? In many ways, anywhere they like, as long as they are willing to give up that space whenever an encounter with pedestrians may occur. While undoubtedly a popular and important activity, for individuals, communities and society, taking running off the athletics track takes away with it claims of territory or primacy of use for runners. These claims then need to be remade in the course of a run and are often ceded to the claims of others. Yes, these are mostly forgettable instances, which occur thousands of times of our running lives. But the space we have to run in is important – and perhaps there is a need to start design running into our public spaces. Simon Cook is a runner, geographer and running geographer.

But such weather systems are far from a rarity. Hurricanes are a type of storm known as a tropical cyclone, which build from warm, moist air over the oceans. Water evaporates, leaving behind a region of low pressure, which is then filled by surrounding air, explains Adrian Champion, an expert in climate systems from the University of Exeter. This causes more “new” warm air to rise into the cyclone, he explains. As this warm, moist air cools, it forms clouds, releasing energy back into the cyclone, helping it to develop. Such systems form in the tropics as the water is warmer than elsewhere, therefore more easily evaporated. The “spin” of the hurricane is down to the rotation of the Earth affecting the movement of the air: since Irma formed north of the equator, it spins anticlockwise. Many different factors can cause the system to build. “What causes it to intensify [beyond a standard cyclone] is either that the ocean is unusually warm or there is further instability [such as strong winds] in the atmosphere,” said Champion. Depending on where these systems strike, they are given different names. “If they hit the Americas then they are called hurricanes, if they hit Asia they are called typhoons and if they hit Africa and Australia they are called cyclones,” said Champion. But it is when these severe storms head towards land that interest generally gathers pace – a factor that has led to hurricanes and other tropical cyclones being given specific monikers to avoid confusion and help the public and the media to share information. The names themselves are allocated based on a system devised by the World Meteorological Organization – if a tropical cyclone is particularly deadly, as in the case of Hurricane Katrina, its handle will not be used again. The strength of a hurricane is marked by its category on what is known as the Saffir-Simpson scale, which reflects the wind speeds – and hence the level of damage expected once the cyclone strikes land. While category 1 hurricanes are serious, expected to damage rooftops and bring down trees with wind speeds between 74 and 95mph, Hurricane Irma was initially at the top end of the scale, meeting criteria for a category 5 hurricane: winds of 157mph or more, catastrophic damage, power outages that could last for many weeks, and areas of land rendered uninhabitable for months. But drastic though Irma is, one thing is for sure: the storm will pass. “The big thing is [hurricanes] only have this energy supply when they are over the oceans,” said Champion. “When they hit landfall they weaken and die away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/11/strike-the-silkworm-review-necrophilia-cannibalism-and-literary-london","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Strike: The Silkworm review – necrophilia, cannibalism and literary London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/11/strike-the-silkworm-review-necrophilia-cannibalism-and-literary-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/11/strike-the-silkworm-review-necrophilia-cannibalism-and-literary-london","fields":{"headline":"Strike: The Silkworm review – necrophilia, cannibalism and literary London","bodyText":"An unhappy-looking woman reads a magazine at the kitchen table. She pauses, looks up, deep in thought, then she gets up to go and fetch a pair of scissors from a drawer. Oh God, she’s not going to do something awful, is she? No, she’s just cutting out an article from the mag. It seems to have affected her deeply. But then she does do something awful: with a big safety pin, she pins the cutting to her chest, actually through the flesh. And it gets worse still, as she heads over to the oven ... A very literary suicide, and the start of Strike: The Silkworm (BBC1), the second adaptation of the detective novels by Robert Galbraith (AKA JK Rowling). Cormoran Strike – the first fictional detective whose name sounds like the cause of a plane crash, a low-flying plane, over the sea … Anyway, the lugubrious gumshoe has become a feature of Sunday evenings. A welcome one and very compelling, too, as played by Tom Burke. After Strike’s success in the first series, The Cuckoo’s Calling, things are looking up at his Denmark Street offices. People are actually turning up, wanting his services. Holliday Grainger’s character, Robin Venetia Ellacott, PA/PI-in-training, has been retained. Clients can even be turned away; they take on only the cases that interest them, such as that of Leonora Quine. (Leonora is played – brilliantly, as ever – by Monica Dolan. I don’t know why Dolan isn’t more of a household name; maybe it’s because she’s too good, her range so great, she’s such a human chameleon, that people simply don’t realise it’s her.) Anyway, Leonora’s husband, Owen Quine, a novelist who never lived up to the potential of his first book, has disappeared. This has happened at the same time as a manuscript for his latest work, Bombyx Mori, a thinly disguised and savage attack on everyone Owen sees as being responsible for the downward spiral of his career, lands like a turd on the well-tended lawn of literary London. A turd that stinks of bitterness and vengeance, splat. Still, Leonora would like her husband found, even if he does serially cheat on her. Strike does find him, though sadly dead. Horribly so, too – tied up, gutted, laid out to be eaten, an exact reenactment of a scene from Bombyx Mori, as it happens. Yes, it’s also that kind of book – full of sadomasochism, necrophilia, cannibalism, as well as slander. Nasty. Still, that narrows down the fields of suspects a bit. And No 1 is Leonora. What! Why would she go to a detective if she dunnit herself? To which you shout: did you not see The Cuckoo’s Calling, in which exactly that happened, rather unsatisfactorily? (It’s better in the book to be fair, why the brother went to Strike, it was to do with framing someone else, but that was lost in the adaptation.) I like this one better. The scene, the people, publishers and agents, rivalry, snarky literary feuds, all ring so true. And the bitter writer, once the next big thing, now increasingly forgotten, he could be so many people. It’s almost a shame there isn’t the opposite, a book that is rejected by lots – 12, say – publishing houses, before going on to be quite a successful series ... although that could look like gloating. Cormoran and Robin’s relationship gets more interesting, professionally and personally. She’s still with the dullest man on the planet, Matthew, they have a date set for the wedding, only eight weeks away. Don’t do it, you’re (I’m) shouting. Hey, and if you married Strike, took his name (I know, not cool) and continued up the ladder professionally, you could be the second detective whose name could be the cause of a plane crash – a small plane, flying around a garden … For now, though, Robin gets to show off her driving skills rather thrillingly, across a west country field. Fiat could extract that section, as is, and put it out as an advert for the Panda. I know about these things, I used to be a renowned motoring journalist, you might remember. You don’t? Oh well, next I’ll be found tied up and disemboweled. The sad lady at the beginning? Another writer, the wife of Owen Quine’s great rival, whose career has been going rather better than his. And the piece she read, before pinning it to herself and heading to the oven? A cruel parody of her own novel, possibly written by her own husband.

Barrie Rutter, shortly to bid farewell to Northern Broadsides, directs and stars in this Yorkshire-based version of the riotous comedy about a man who is clever with finance but a clot with women. • The Viaduct, Dean Clough, Halifax (box office: 01422 255266), from 15 September. Then touring. We’re Still Here Six years after they staged their glorious production The Passion with Michael Sheen on the streets of Port Talbot, National Theatre Wales return to the town for a site-specific piece that gives voice to the community. When its steelworks was faced with closure in 2015, the people of Port Talbot came together to speak out. Based on interviews with those who live and work in the region, this co-production with the always invigorating Common Wealth company is a show about making your own future. • Byass Works, Port Talbot, 15-30 September. King Lear Ian McKellen first played Lear for the RSC in 2007. Now he has another crack at the role in the kind of intimate setting that often proves ideal for Shakespearean tragedy. Jonathan Munby directs, Kirsty Bushell, Dervla Kirwan and Tamara Lawrance are Lear’s daughters and, following the cross-gender pattern in the recent Globe production, Kent is played by Sinéad Cusack. • Minerva, Chichester (box office: 01243 781312), from 22 September. Pink Sari Revolution Purva Naresh adapts Amana Fontanella-Khan’s book about India’s all-female, 400,000-strong Gulabi Gang, led by the charismatic Sampat Pal Devi, who came together to fight injustice and stop the abuse of women. A story about using hot pink saris to fight for freedom and discovering the truth when the odds are stacked against you. • Curve, Leicester, 27 September-7 October, then touring. The Tin Drum Kneehigh bring to the stage Günter Grass’s sprawling masterpiece about Oskar, a boy who decides never to grow up and takes on the world with his tin drum. Mike Shepherd directs Carl Grose’s gleeful adaptation that promises all the verbal fireworks and rotten nastiness of the original, which was written in the long shadow of fascism. • Liverpool Everyman, 28 September-14 October. Then touring. Bravado When the performance artist Scottee was young, masculinity meant drunkenness and aggression, and the local boys grew up into violent men. Part memoir and part examination of what it really means to be a man, his solo show sets out on a tour of male-dominated spaces throughout the UK, including social and lap-dancing clubs. An evening that should offer blood, sweat and tears. • The Briton’s Protection, Manchester, 28-30 September. Then touring. Labour of Love With plays such as This House and Ink, James Graham has shown an extraordinary gift for recreating momentous public events. Now he has taken on the turbulent recent history of the Labour party from Neil Kinnock to Jeremy Corbyn. Martin Freeman plays an MP and Tamsin Greig his principled constituency agent in a play, directed by Jeremy Herrin, that gets outside the Westminster bubble to look at Labour’s northern strongholds. • Noël Coward theatre, London (box office: 0844 482 5140), from 3 October. Heisenberg: The Uncertainty Principle Marianne Elliott and Chris Harper launch their newly formed production company with a Simon Stephens play, first seen off-Broadway, about a chance encounter that radically changes two people’s lives. More screwball comedy than physics lecture, the play stars Anne-Marie Duff and Kenneth Cranham and reunites many of the team behind the massively successful The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time. • Wyndhams, London (box office: 0844 482 5120), from 3 October. Victory Condition Vicky Featherstone directs Jonjo O’Neill and Sharon Duncan-Brewster in a new play by Chris Thorpe who had a big hit with Confirmation, about how confirmation bias influences our worldview. This one is billed as an attempt to “get to grips with the fact that everything happens at once” and looks at the disconnections we experience in a hyper-connected world. • Royal Court, London (box office: 020-7565 5000), 5-21 October. Cockpit Bridget Boland’s lost 1947 classic gets a rare outing. The Lyceum stage is turned into a provincial German theatre used as a makeshift transit camp for displaced persons facing forcible postwar repatriation. Wils Wilson’s production promises to be an immersive experience and is bound to raise important questions at a time when Europe faces a contemporary refugee crisis. • Lyceum, Edinburgh (box office: 0131 248 4848), from 6 October. Albion Given that title, and with Mike Bartlett of King Charles III fame as author, it is clear that we are in for a state-of-the-nation play. Further clues are provided by the fact that the setting is the ruins of a garden in rural England that suggests a mix of Shaw’s Heartbreak House and Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard. Victoria Hamilton, as a woman searching for the seeds of hope, heads a cast that includes Helen Schlesinger and Margot Leicester. Rupert Goold directs. • Almeida, London (box office: 020 7359 4404), from 10 October. Fire Below (A War of Words) Owen McCafferty’s 2012 play Quietly was a superbly restrained yet emotionally explosive look at violence and reconciliation. This piece returns to the subject through the prism of two neighbouring couples enjoying a drink together 20 years on from the peace agreement. But who knows when a grenade might be lobbed into the conversation? • Lyric, Belfast (box office: 028-9038 1081), 12-29 October. Then at the Abbey, Dublin. The Cherry Orchard Writer Gary Owen and director Rachel O’Riordan have proved themselves a formidable partnership with Iphigenia in Splott and Killology. Now they take on Chekhov with a production that relocates the original to Pembrokeshire in 1982 as Thatcher’s government sweeps away the old certainties and those trees come crashing down. • Sherman, Cardiff (box office: 029-2064 6900), 13-28 October. Young Marx This comedy by Richard Bean and Clive Coleman launches a new, 900-seat commercial theatre: the first to be built in London for 80 years. Situated near Tower Bridge, it is the brainchild of Nicholas Hytner and Nick Starr and holds enormous potential. One hopes the building doesn’t overshadow a play in which Rory Kinnear plays the young Karl who, broke, horny and bubbling with revolutionary ideas, is hiding away in Soho. • Bridge theatre, London, (box office: 0843 208 1846), from 18 October. The Last Testament of Lillian Bilocca Maxine Peake tells the story of Hull’s forgotten heroine who took on the power of the trawler owners at the end of the 1960s and fought for better safety conditions for the fishermen. A salty, site-specific tale, steered by Sarah Frankcom, and played out in Hull’s historic Guildhall with folk music contributions from the Unthanks. • Guildhall, Hull, 3-18 November. Network Paddy Chayefsky’s Oscar-winning 1976 movie about a news anchorman who goes berserk on screen and turns into a populist prophet has been dramatised by Lee Hall. Its vision of a world where opinion trumps fact sounds eerily topical and what ups the stakes is that it is directed by the ubiquitous Ivo van Hove and stars Bryan Cranston who, even before his phenomenal performance in Breaking Bad, was a highly accomplished stage actor. • Olivier, London, (box office: 020-7452 3000), from 4 November. Jubilee Derek Jarman’s chaotic and giddily incendiary punk classic is reimagined and updated for the stage by Chris Goode, 40 years after it first appeared in cinemas. One of the original cast members, Toyah Willcox, returns, this time taking on the role of a time-travelling Elizabeth I who finds herself in a contemporary London where girl gangs rampage across the streets and order has given way to violence. • Royal Exchange, Manchester (box office: 0161-833 9833), 2-18 November. Imperium The RSC’s Roman season comes to an epic climax with Mike Poulton’s two-part adaptation of Robert Harris’s sequence of novels about Cicero. The story takes Cicero from his election as consul and the conspiracy to destroy him up to his determination to save the Republic from a military dictatorship under Mark Antony. Poulton’s skill in adapting Hilary Mantel’s Thomas Cromwell novels, and the fact that Greg Doran directs, suggests the omens are favourable. • The Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon (box office: 01789 403493), from 16 November. Roller All-female roller derby is a thrilling spectacle and one of the fastest growing sports in the world. Fresh from the superb Our Carnal Hearts, Rachel Mars teams up with Nat Tarrab to bring all the visual spectacle of a skate-fast, hit-hard sport to the theatre. A show about women’s bodies, competitiveness and breaking through the pack. • The Pit, London (box office: 020-7638 8891), 23 November-2 December. Hamilton This is the big one. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hip-hop musical swept all before it on Broadway winning a record-breaking 11 Tony awards, becoming a box-office smash and even provoking the ire of President Trump. Inspired by a biography by Ron Chernow, it tells the story of one of America’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton, and signally shows his white colleagues played by racially diverse actors. It will be fascinating to see if it makes as big an impact in London. • Victoria Palace, London, (box office: 0844 482 5138), from 6 December. Comedy Objectively Funny There are comedy festivals all around the UK this autumn – in Belfast, Nottingham, Greenwich and elsewhere – but for a trip to the art form’s cutting edge, look no further than this intense shot of up-and-coming standups in a West End pub. Over a few days only, there are hits including Evelyn Mok’s Hymen Manoeuvre, about the anxieties the Chinese-Swedish comic experienced around losing her virginity, Jordan Brookes’ convention shredding Body of Work, and Fin Taylor’s polemic about the failings of the left. Lucy Pearman’s endearingly strange Maid of Cabbage and Tez Ilyas’s latest compendium of tales of life as a fun-loving British Muslim also feature. • The Albany on Great Portland Street, London, 16-26 September. Natalie Palamides One of the most talked about shows at this summer’s Edinburgh fringe, this compelling oddity from American actor Palamides won her the Best Newcomer comedy award. Directed by cult silent comic Doctor Brown, Laid is a theatre-comedy hybrid that splays anxieties about fertility and parenting across a surreal clown show, as egg-turned-woman Palamides births, smashes, eats and finally rears her own eggs in an increasingly neurotic cycle. It’s hysterical, and weirdly profound. • Soho theatre, London, 6-18 November. Greg Davies It’s a first tour in four years for the Man Down and Cuckoo star, a late comedy developer who’s made himself near ubiquitous since his break on The Inbetweeners. His 2012 show The Back of My Mum’s Head was his best yet, an uproarious celebration of his own idiocy. Expect more ridiculous autobiographical comedy in its follow-up You Magnificent Beast – the poster for which was banned for contravening Amazon’s “no-nipple policy”. • Margate Winter Gardens, 15-16 September; Southend Cliffs Pavilion, 19-20 September; then touring. Mae Martin You’ve got a right to expect well-honed standup from 30-year-old Mae Martin, given that – as she recounts in this new show, Dope – she’s been doing it since she was an awkward 13-year-old in her native Toronto. The show (shortlisted for this year’s Edinburgh Comedy award) explores Martin’s obsessive behaviour, from a Bette Midler fixation via her adolescent addiction to comedy to a destructive drugs habit in her late teens. Throughout, it’s intimate, thoughtful and highly entertaining. • Soho theatre, London, 18-30 September; Glee Club, Oxford, 10 October; then touring. Simon Amstell “Deeply personal and horribly revealing,” is how Simon Amstell describes his new touring show What Is This? – which means it will slot neatly into his canon of deeply personal and revealing standup shows. Now in a happy relationship and with less present-day misery to draw on, Amstell promises plenty of retrospective neurosis as he ranges across a lifetime of identity crises, confused sexuality and existential angst. His restless soul search should, as ever, be our delight. • Leicester Square theatre, London, 22-23, 27-28 September; Oxford Playhouse, 24 September; then touring. Dance Rambert on tour The always superb dancers of Rambert test themselves against two new works. Symbiosis is a full-tilt dance by Greek choreographer Andonis Foniadakis, while Goat is a company debut from the maverick dance theatre-maker Ben Duke (whose comically hubristic work Paradise Lost was a one-man adaptation of Milton’s poem). Duke takes the music of Nina Simone to anatomise the extremes of pleasures and pain experienced by performers on stage with a selection of her most popular songs, sung live by Nia Lynn. • Symbiosis, the Lowry, Salford, 28-30 September, then touring; Goat, Festival theatre, Edinburgh, 26-28 October, then touring. Dance Umbrella London’s oldest but still most vital festival of contemporary dance returns with a programme that searches out the city’s hidden stages, from Battersea power station to a derelict part of Silvertown and Trinity Buoy Wharf. Standout shows include Fallen from Heaven, a sublime and raunchy investigation of what it means to be a woman by the fiercely individual flamenco dancer Rocío Molina, and Lyon Opera Ballet’s epic, choreographic investigation of Beethoven’s Grosse Fuge, which is interpreted in three works by Lucinda Childs, Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker and Maguy Marin. • Venues across London, 11-28 October. Company Wayne McGregor: Autobiography It’s typical of Wayne McGregor that, when he decided to choreograph his own life story, he put science at the heart of his narrative. The driving force of Autobiography is his discovery of his personal genome, as sequenced for him by leading geneticists and then refracted through the prisms of his own dance imagination. Music is by the electronic sound artist Jlin and lighting as always is by the magically inventive Lucy Carter. • Sadler’s Wells, London, 4-7 October. Kenneth MacMillan celebrations Kenneth MacMillan brought new possibilities of risk, intensity and sophistication to the ballet stage and, 25 years after his death, companies around the UK are celebrating the choreographer’s work. Northern Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet have their own programmes and are also taking part in a historic collaborative season at the Royal Opera House, joining the Royal Ballet, English National Ballet and Scottish Ballet to present six one-act ballets, including the little-performed Le Baiser de la Fee. • Birmingham Royal Ballet, Birmingham Hippodrome, 27-30 September; Northern Ballet, Alhambra Theatre, Bradford, 5-7 October; Royal Opera House season, 18-27 October. Royal Ballet: The Illustrated ‘Farewell’ / The Wind / Untouchable The dazzlingly, unpredictably imaginative Arthur Pita creates his first work for the Royal, mining depths of obsession and fear in choreography inspired by the haunted silent movie classic The Wind. In the same programme is a revival of Hofesh Shechter’s Untouchable and a new commission from Twyla Tharp, in which she revisits and expands her seminal work As Time Goes By, shaping it around the brilliant partnership of Sarah Lamb and Steven MacRae. • Royal Opera House, London, 6-17 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/autumn-hurricanes-irma-harvey-first-take-bim-adewunmi","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T04:59:07Z","webTitle":"While some of us prepare for autumn, others face far more devastating weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/autumn-hurricanes-irma-harvey-first-take-bim-adewunmi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/autumn-hurricanes-irma-harvey-first-take-bim-adewunmi","fields":{"headline":"While some of us prepare for autumn, others face far more devastating weather","bodyText":"I always knew it was a sartorial crime to wear white after Labor Day. A certain genre of American literature is obsessed with things like that, and I read too many of those books: to wear white after this calendar Rubicon was to be utterly gauche and unsophisticated. Now, having just experienced my second Labor Day since moving to America, I sort of get it. Like all fashion rules, it’s totally arbitrary, but there is an inherent logic to it. Labor Day, the first Monday of September, marks the unofficial end of summer: beach days come to an end, temperatures start to cool and the kids begin the trudge back to school. It’s basically their equivalent of the August bank holiday, aka The Last One Until Christmas. And really, who wears white in the final quarter of the year? The key thing, of course, is that most of America has four distinct seasons, a phenomenon with which I, a Brit, am largely unfamiliar. A fine midsummer’s day in England might include rain, after all, and I’ve been known to be sans jacket on Christmas Eve. Here, though, the end of summer is a real event; a final hurrah, with parades and barbecues and loud music and a sort of bacchanalian feeling of gay abandon. Winter is coming, those exceedingly popular fantasy books and TV show told us, and here, people know that. Of course, there’s another weather phenomenon we don’t often get back home. The havoc being wrought by a quartet of devastating hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, Jose and Katia) is a different sort of weather horror, and their effects will be felt for years to come.

Set in London’s theatreland in 1947, the wardrobe mistress of the title is newly widowed Joan Grice. Her husband, Charlie – “Gricey” – had been a famous actor, and their psychologically fragile daughter, Vera, is following in his footsteps. What begins as a novel about grief manifesting itself in paranormal fantasies takes on a more sinister edge when Joan uncovers Gricey’s political past, leading the novel into explorations of fascism, antisemitism and how a fractured nation endeavours to rebuild itself from the rubble of war. McGrath has a reputation for gothic fiction and there are elements of that here too, not least Joan’s terrifying experiences inside her husband’s wardrobe, which, for a time, she believes holds Gricey’s spirit: “She heard a different noise now. The clothes on the rail were shaking as the hangers, all wooden, began clanking against each other, and she was aware too of the rustle of agitated fabric. She turned, bewildered.” Part of the skill in The Wardrobe Mistress comes from the omniscient narration in the form of a Greek chorus, at turns scathing and gossipy, confiding and judgmental: “We saw her in the pub around this time. We thought we should take her out, cheer her up. There were a few of us she knew, old friends… We knew what she was thinking about, it was Gricey, of course, who all that time had had a secret, and herself practically the only one who didn’t know it because nobody wanted to be the one to tell her. Well, why would we?” McGrath’s dexterity in maintaining the authenticity of the narrative voice allows a satisfying and intimate immersion in the novel. Joan is a marvellous creation, both haughty and vulnerable, proud and lonely. “We’ve heard Joan Grice called a beautiful woman. A striking-looking woman, certainly, and a formidable one. Her hair was black and without a thread of silver. She wore it pulled back with some severity from her face, the better, it was said, to come at the world like a scythe.” Joan’s grief prompts a reliance on “Uncle Alcohol”, the bottle she keeps stashed on top of a kitchen cupboard that gradually finds a home closer to the kitchen table in scenes that exude a quiet poignancy. But it is not until the revelation of Gricey’s secret halfway through the novel that McGrath pulls the reader’s sympathies firmly in Joan’s direction. McGrath writes with stylistic precision: “They sat close together gazing at the flickering coals, while about them the dim bulb crackled in its stiff linen shade all veined in black, and hanging from a twisted cord, as the clock ticked.” Descriptions of theatrical life are beautifully evoked; scenes of political and personal confrontation are visceral and affecting. The Wardrobe Mistress is vivid and multi-layered: as a gothic story, it is replete with suspense and an unnerving sense of the macabre; as a study of the insidious nature of political ideologies it is chilling and apposite; and as a story about the effects of grief, it is perceptive, probing deeply into the human psyche to reveal it in all its serpentine complexity. • The Wardrobe Mistress by Patrick McGrath is published by Hutchinson (£14.99).

The first man to win the Tour de France five times – in 1957 and from 1961 to 1964 – seemed to have been manufactured in the same factory as the machines he rode, every ounce of superfluous weight pared away, streamlined to perfection and running on frictionless bearings. Frozen in motion by the still camera, he revealed an aesthetic perfection that would have brought a light to any sculptor’s eye. On the first page of his slender memoir of devotion, Paul Fournel captures his subject’s essence: “Anquetil pedalled blond, with supple ankles; he pedalled on points, back bent, arms at right angles, head straining forwards … He was made to be seen alone on the road, silhouetted against the blue sky; nothing about him suggested the peloton, the crowd and the strength of being united. He was cycling beauty out on its own.” He was also unloved by a large percentage of his own public. Grudgingly, they admired his pale, ultra-modern efficiency and contemporary sense of style, but they gave their hearts to Raymond Poulidor, the representative of a more bucolic France, whose failure to conquer Anquetil year after year gave him a nickname – the Eternal Second – that would, in other circumstances, have seemed unenviable. Anquetil’s nicknames were Maître Jacques and Monsieur Chrono: the first reflected his seeming invincibility, the second his specific mastery of the time trial, the race in which the rider pedals alone and the enemy is the stopwatch. The first great achievement of his career, when he was 22 and doing his year’s military service in the army, was to break Fausto Coppi’s longstanding record for the distance covered in one hour on the banked boards of a velodrome. He appeared bloodless and calculating. Fournel tells the story of a time trial in Switzerland that Anquetil won six times in a row. The organisers, fearing the stifling effect of a seventh victory, offered to pay him not to turn up. He accepted the deal. A few months later, thinking of their advance ticket sales, they thought better of it and offered him another fee, plus a third fee on top if he allowed someone else to win. He asked to be paid up front. Before the start of the race he approached the Italian champion Ercole Baldini, the best of his rivals, with a proposition: if you give me your fee, Anquetil said, I’ll let you win. Baldini gratefully accepted the offer, and paid up. But the story was not over. “As the weather was fine, the route beautiful and the prize money substantial,” Fournel writes, “he won anyway. And Baldini understood that perfectly, because he knows how champions function.” Anquetil, the acknowledged patron of the peloton, exploited its unique protocols with expert subtlety. He gave his winning bonuses to his team mates, granting them the occasional victory in order to secure the loyalty of the men who would work for him on the most gruelling days of a three-week stage race. Fournel: “When Anquetil gives, it is because he has received, or he is counting on receiving, something in return.” Anquetil: “I told my team mates that Johnny Hallyday pays his orchestra and they play for him. My team mates are my musicians.” In an era when all the top professionals doped, Anquetil (below) believed it would be hypocritical to pretend otherwise. “You can’t ride the Tour de France on mineral water,” he said. In 1966, towards the end of his career, when dope tests were just being introduced, he was deprived of what would have been his only victory in Liège-Bastogne-Liège, one of the great classics, when he refused to give the required urine sample – as did the riders who finished second and third. At the time, it seemed like an affront to their metier. “We are men, not horses,” he said. He used his winnings to buy big American cars and a grand house in his native Normandy. Sponsors proudly exploited his image in their advertisements. But, paradoxically, it was he who turned out to be the bucolic one. At the Château des Elfes he looked after his farm, raised cattle, tended crops, drove his beloved tractor. Nor, to say the least, was his life lacking in emotion. His wife, the glamorous blond Janine, brought a son and a daughter, Alain and Annie, from her previous marriage. Some years later, when she had proved unable to have further children, Anquetil fathered a daughter with the 18-year-old Annie, at her mother’s suggestion and with her cheerful consent. Jacques would later have another child, this time with Alain’s wife. Despite the occasional outbreak of jealousy, he remained the nexus of the family’s affections. He retired in 1969. “The bike isn’t and never has been my greatest concern,” he had said. “I really think that I don’t, have never, and will never love the bike.” Nevertheless he would leave his farm to manage the French team and became a perceptive commentator on the Tour de France for television, radio and sports newspaper L’Équipe before his death from stomach cancer in 1987, aged 53. Fournel is a student of Raymond Queneau, a leading light of the Oulipo literary workshop and a prize-winner in 1989 for Les Athlètes dans Leurs Tête. Unlike two previous English-language biographies – Richard Yates’s Master Jacques (2001) and Paul Howard’s excruciatingly titled Sex, Lies and Handlebar Tape (2008) – the elegantly produced Anquetil, Alone makes no claim to a detailed career analysis. Instead it offers a loving evocation not just of its protagonist but of the author’s own childhood infatuation. Despite a handful of unimportant errors – the French firm Pivo made handlebar stems, not crossbars, and Vin, not Victor, Denson was Anquetil’s English team-mate – Fournel leaves no doubt that he understands the complexity of his subject. With this little masterpiece, the coolest and most enigmatic of champions is given the biography he deserves. • Anquetil, Alone is published by Pursuit.

And now, at the start of the new one, they’re having a baby, already. Oh, it’s a dream sequence. But it appears to mean that Adam is getting broody. At his age, he’s morphing into Mick bloody Jagger. And Spanish Ramona, who showed up again at the end last time out, is still around. Ramona remains. Ironic, really, that her name has come to be a (kinda) homophone for someone who’s unhappy about the result of last year’s referendum, and she might end up having to go back to the EU herself. For now, though, she’s answering the phone for Karen at her publisher. Answering it very badly – you’d think her English would have improved after all this time. She’s basically the female Manuel. ¿Qué? Jen’s jealous of Karen’s friendship with Tina, because no one ever really grows up, the playground just continues throughout life. Pete’s black dog isn’t around, at least for now. He’s swapped the taxiing for chauffeuring, and gets David an introduction to the Cheshire set. Wags and the like – they look like they might be fun. There are some good touches; I like the children interviewing Adam for a job at a hipster startup that matches consumers with designers. There are some less good ones – like Adam and Tina’s I love u... nicorns mix-up. And there are some old ones (sometimes the best ones), like the car going through a big puddle (it’s Manchester, don’t forget), soaking Adam in his smart suit. Best location: an empty Victorian swimming pool, venue for the launch of the first book Karen is publishing. Best tune: Protection by Massive Attack. Again, it’s like a university reunion. Last year was the first; you hadn’t seen them for years, and though you’d had your reservations about it, it was surprisingly fun, reminding you why you liked these people in the first place. Now, just one year on, they’re doing it all over again. And you’re wondering whether it’s such a good idea. I mean, you still like them, but perhaps you have less in common now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/09/walking-cairngorms-scottish-highlands-scotland-worlds-most-beautiful-country","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Homage to the Scottish Highlands: walking in the Cairngorms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/09/walking-cairngorms-scottish-highlands-scotland-worlds-most-beautiful-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/09/walking-cairngorms-scottish-highlands-scotland-worlds-most-beautiful-country","fields":{"headline":"Homage to the Scottish Highlands: walking in the Cairngorms","bodyText":"You don’t need to visit a place to fall in love with it. As a small boy, growing up on the edge of London, I was captivated by the romance of the Highlands. The wild beauty of the glens and mountains offered a thrilling alternative to the tidy world of suburbia. That the Nicholsons had Scottish ancestors, and that I was half-Scottish by blood, persuaded me into the belief that I had a deep connection to the mountains. I toyed with the possibility that some colossal mistake had occurred: I should have been living in Scotland. When I was seven or eight, we started going there on summer holidays. We parked our caravan somewhere – usually somewhere beset by midges – and set off for the hills. To say that those walks were exhilarating would be an understatement; the power implicit in the landscape affected me in a profound way. I was quickly frightened. I still remember the utter terror that overwhelmed me as we scrambled through dark fog up the vertiginous, scree-laden side of one mountain, unable to see the precipice ahead. On another summer’s day, we visited Glen Feshie, which skirts the western edge of the Cairngorms. Part of Scotland’s magic lay in its place names – Killiecrankie, Rannoch, Crianlarich, Ardnamurchan – and I loved the musical sound of Feshie – like fishy; the river Feshie full of sleek silver fishes. A long, single-track lane leads from Loch Insh and Feshiebridge into the glen. On a windy summer’s day, the bracken under the young birch trees shivers with green light. At Achlean, there is a small car park. Time to lace up your boots. Among Scottish glens, Feshie is unusual for being both broad and well-wooded, and the obvious option now is to walk up the glen and explore the old pinewoods by the river. Queen Victoria rode here in the autumn of 1861: “Magnificent fir woods,” she noted in her journal. In recent years, deer have been extensively culled in order to improve the chances of young trees. There are now many saplings, not only of Scots pine but also birch, willow and alder, and wildlife has benefited. Treecreepers give high calls as they hunt for insects on the trunks of the pines, while flocks of tits – among them one of those specialist Highland species, the crested tit – flit through the higher branches. Capercaillie have been recorded, and pine marten are also in residence, though I’ve never been so lucky as to see one. Not all the change, at least to my mind, has been for the good. Long stretches of the path through the glen have been over-improved, which makes the process of walking – that subtle negotiation of uneven ground, that sense of physical intimacy with the land – less interesting. Sometimes the wildness feels in short supply. For that reason, not far after Achlean, I leave the glen on a path that climbs towards the mountain plateau. After a wearying haul of more than an hour, it nears a green hollow called Ciste Mhearad, or Margaret’s Coffin, where snow often survives as late as midsummer. One old story tells of a Glen Feshie maiden whose lover was sentenced to death for some unknown crime. When the laird refused to spare his life, she came up here and killed herself; the snow is her pall. Curiously, seven miles away on the other side of the Cairngorms massif, there is a second Ciste Mhearad, where snow lies even later into the summer. The plateau then appears, and with such suddenness that it’s hard not to be surprised. A different world opens up, a vast expanse of browns and ochres that stretches invitingly into the distance. A shortish walk over rough grass and springy ground brings you to the cliffs cradling the dark waters of Loch Einich, while a much longer one heads for the bare summit of Braeriach, at 1,296 metres Britain’s third-highest mountain. To be here on a fine summer’s day is a heady experience. Not today. I reach the plateau to be met by a ferocious 50mph gale. The blast is straight in my face, and so strong and gusty that it’s hard to even stand upright. I reel along for a while, buffeted this way and that, then give up. I don’t mind; in fact, I love the uncertainty of walking up here. It’s the reverse of ordinary tourism – where, by and large, you know what you’re going to get. High in the Scottish mountains the weather is so variable and the terrain so tough that you’re always challenged. That sets the mind on edge. For thinking about the difficult things in life, this is the place to be. So I beat a retreat. Back to Glen Feshie, where there are plenty of quiet, magical spots to shelter from any storm. I follow a lively burn down to an ancient pinewood. The slope is steep, and the burn leaps headlong in an irregular series of cascades flanked by dark rocks that seem simultaneously pink and gold. Birch trees jut out of rock crevices and lean over the falls. Each cascade powers into a deep pool of fizzing, faintly green water. I sit on the bank, sorting old thoughts, and watching patterns of water and sunlight. The endless movement of the falling water is counterpointed by the stillness of the great pines rising above me. We were here when you were a boy, remember? We haven’t gone anywhere. Whether I ever came to this exact spot I am not sure, but certainly the trees must have been here, and the burn, and the rocks. Taking off boots and socks, I dabble my feet in the cool of the water. A few buttercups, lodged on the mossy side of a fallen branch, shine like bright yellow stars. A pine cone plops into the pool, circles in an eddy of bubbles and, entering the swish of current, rushes downhill. • Among the Summer Snows by Christopher Nicholson (September Publishing, £14.99) is out now.

The Bank swatted aside a dispute last week with low-paid staff that had become so toxic inside Threadneedle Street that even the pink-jacketed, top-hatted front-of-house greeters had joined their colleagues in the maintenance section and other blue-collar roles by downing tools. Carney had offered a 1% pay rise in line with the public sector pay cap. He took a tough line, even though the Bank is not seen as part of the public sector. And he held the line with only a few minor concessions. A little extra money was promised to a handful of the very lowest paid, a little extra holiday entitlement was also part of the modest package, and there was a pledge to include the union in future pay talks from the start. The 1% pay cap remains in place. And why wouldn’t it when fewer than 100 of the Bank’s 4,000 employees felt aggrieved enough to go on strike? They were angry enough to protest for three days before the dispute ran out of steam. A longer strike was never on the cards; it is a sad fact that workers have such little power in Britain today. The railway workers might use their muscle should they embark on a winter of disputes over driverless trains, but elsewhere workers face draconian employment laws that make them among the most flexible in the world when it comes to how and when they work. That’s not how the Bank reads the broader economy. It disregards the dispute under its nose and believes that 3%-plus pay growth is around the corner. Listening to the speeches of some policymakers, anyone would think that with unemployment at a 40-year low of 4.4% in June, the workers would have taken their dispute to the wire and, without a more generous offer, quit for a better job elsewhere. The Bank’s argument is that full employment, if not already here, is just around the corner. Take a look at London, which is supposedly in the grip of a skills shortage exacerbated by the departure of European migrants heading home. Employers are crying out for people and are poised to rip up their pay rates in favour of more generous salaries to secure the staff they need. With inflation expected to rise towards 3%, from 2.6% in July, workers need to see their pay packets following suit. In this scenario, a combination of few available workers and price rises in the shops will put huge pressure on employers to pay higher wages or risk unfilled vacancies. It is a message the monetary policy committee (MPC) is likely to repeat on Thursday when it makes its next judgment on the economy. The committee will most likely hold the base interest rate at 0.25% with the strong hint that a rise is imminent now that the labour market is tight and vacancies are rising. The Bank is not alone. Several City economists conclude that wages are about to jump now that the high level of vacancies is out of sync with the low level of unemployment. Kalum Pickering at Berenberg bank said: “We expect that by the end of the year, and certainly by the beginning of 2018, providing sterling doesn’t take another major leg down, real wages will be rising again.” To back up his point, wages across the economy have already started to rise from 1.6% per year at the beginning of the year to 2.1% in the latest figures. It will take a surge in wage rates to get past 3% to meet Pickering’s forecast of inflation-busting pay rises, but as he points out, three months of improving pay growth shows it is going in the right direction. Yet, given the Bank of England strike’s outcome, the central bank and its supporters in the City, at least as far as its analysis is concerned, seem completely out of touch. They seem to ignore the fact that the job market is stratified and regional and the answer to a chronic labour shortage is not necessarily higher pay. In the construction industry a shortage of specialist staff, which cannot be met by the current pool of skilled workers, has forced building firms to delay projects. Anecdotal evidence is that employers are not willing to take a cut in margins and customers are unwilling to pay more, so projects are mothballed. The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, which regularly talks to human resources directors across the private and public sectors, says the bottom end of the labour market continues to have a plentiful supply of workers. Its last survey showed there were an average of 24 applications for each low-skilled job, 19 candidates for every medium-skilled vacancy and eight for each high-skilled post. One factor was the continued influx of EU workers. It said: “EU net migration levels remain well above post-enlargement average levels due to a continued strong supply of EU15 and Bulgarian and Romanian nationals. Initial fears that Brexit would have a material impact on employers’ ability to fill vacancies therefore seem to be somewhat premature.” Then there is the government’s continuation of austerity, which will have the effect of making low income households even more desperate for a job, and when they have one, ask for longer hours just to make ends meet. Maybe Bank officials comfort themselves with the news that McDonald’s workers have also struck for higher pay along with their own low-paid staff. But again it was just a smattering of staff who felt able to confront the restaurant chain – in line with the real trend, and not the Bank’s fantasy projections, McDonald’s has so far felt little anxiety about workers quitting for higher pay elsewhere. So the flexible market for labour remains firmly in place and pay increases are a pipe dream for most. It’s why the archbishop of Canterbury joined the IPPR thinktank’s commission on economic justice to say, among other things, that trade unions needed more support. “We are failing those who will grow up into a world where the gap between the richest and poorest parts of the country is significant and destabilising,” Justin Welby said. The Bank, to maintain the obvious respect it still commands with Britons, could more helpfully give a more accurate picture of the economy. For this to happen, Carney and his fellow committee members need to get out more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/08/solar-industry-says-eu-tariffs-chinese-imports-will-raise-panel-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T11:16:04Z","webTitle":"Solar industry says EU tariffs on Chinese imports will raise panel prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/08/solar-industry-says-eu-tariffs-chinese-imports-will-raise-panel-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/08/solar-industry-says-eu-tariffs-chinese-imports-will-raise-panel-prices","fields":{"headline":"Solar industry says EU tariffs on Chinese imports will raise panel prices","bodyText":"Europe’s solar industry has condemned an EU vote to impose another round of duties on Chinese imports, just weeks before a US trade panel is due to rule on similar tariffs. A Brussels committee yesterday agreed to set minimum import duties for Chinese solar modules and cells that could price them up to 30% above market levels with “huge negative effects” for the industry, according to trade groups. There is also a “99% probability” that Trump will announce tariffs on Chinese solar imports before the end of January, according to one source who has held talks with senior US government officials. European commission sources insist the EU’s anti-dumping measure will slowly reduce existing tariffs and “gradually lead to a convergence of the world market price and the EU import price”. But with world market prices falling, SolarPower Europe said this would still add at least €500 (£458) to the cost of a household installation – and up to €1m to a one-megawatt industry revamp. James Watson, the group’s CEO, said: “Some investors and asset managers will now wait at least 12 months before they start building as they know they are guaranteed a price reduction. Businesses are already telling us this. “When you put in a minimum price, you also get a magnet effect where all modules gravitate to the new level. It increases the cost of solar, and will ultimately harm its overall deployment.” The EU first imposed solar tariffs in 2013 over concerns that Chinese solar goods – which make up about a third of EU sales – were retailing at below production costs. A renewable energy boom has helped China meet its solar power targets for 2020 three years early, and its solar industry to dominate the global market. The knock-on effect for European manufacturers has been devastating, according to the German firm SolarWorld AG, which first petitioned the EU to act. Milan Nitzschke, the firm’s vice-president, described the commission’s phased reduction of tariffs as “a slap in the face for manufacturing industry”. “What is shocking is that the commission proposed to set the minimum import prices at levels far below the cost of production. That makes them senseless. We believe that this is illegal and not in line with anti-dumping regulations.” Solarworld are considering an appeal to the European court but the issue is likely to come to a head first in the US, where the International Trade Commission will rule on a case filed by Solarworld and Sunniva on 22 September. Leaks of an Oval Office meeting at which Trump told aides “I want tariffs” against China have stoked fears in the US solar industry that tens of thousands of jobs could be lost in any trade spat. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a source with knowledge of the issue told the Guardian: “There is a 99% probability that Trump will impose measures, although they will not be as high as requested.” An attempt by Trump to cut a deal with China with North Korea could obstruct tariffs, the source added, “but from the political agenda it seems clear that the administration will impose measures. It is a no-brainer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/08/la-liga-overseas-fixtures-usa-china-javier-tebas","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T09:45:31Z","webTitle":"La Liga hopes to stage league fixtures abroad as soon as next season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/08/la-liga-overseas-fixtures-usa-china-javier-tebas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/08/la-liga-overseas-fixtures-usa-china-javier-tebas","fields":{"headline":"La Liga hopes to stage league fixtures abroad as soon as next season","bodyText":"Football authorities in Spain are considering plans to stage La Liga matches overseas, with the proposal set to be discussed by the league’s 20 clubs. The La Liga president, Javier Tebas, has confirmed that discussions are ongoing as the Spanish top division seeks greater financial revenues from international audiences, including broadcasting and sponsorship deals. “La Liga is global entertainment and we want to grow [the league’s] international appeal,” Tebas told the Financial Times. “As part of that effort we are discussing the option of playing some of the league matches outside of Spain.” Regular season La Liga matches could potentially be held abroad, most likely in the USA or China, as soon as next year. Relevent Sports, a US-based promoter who founded the International Champions Cup (ICC) pre-season competition four years ago, is thought to have pitched the idea of overseas league games to several football leagues. ICC matches were held in the USA, Singapore and China this summer, with Barcelona and Real Madrid meeting in Miami for an overseas clásico fixture. Speaking at this week’s Soccerex event in Manchester, the Relevent chairman, Charlie Stillitano, said “the future is to do official [league] games in the US, China and other places”. “There are leagues that are talking to us about potentially doing something in the future,” he added. The proposals are reminiscent of the Premier League’s controversial “39th game” initiative, which were shelved in 2008 after widespread opposition. Speaking in July, the Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, said no plans were currently in place to stage league matches abroad. “There is no [current] plan to do it,” Scudamore said. “The clubs would like to do it but we are also realistic that says until the reaction is any more warm, it won’t happen,” he added. “If it did, it wouldn’t be a 39th game ... but there is no prospect of it happening any time soon. We have no time set for it but I am a man of belief. I thought it was the right thing to do, I still do.” Playing regular season games abroad has proved a success for the NFL, with 16 games held at Wembley Stadium since 2007 and five more scheduled to be played overseas in 2017 – at Wembley, Twickenham and Mexico City’s Estadio Azteca. The NBA have held games at London’s O2 Arena, with Major League Baseball keen to follow suit.

We have a good life; we have shared and continue to share a lot. So how do I “kill” my sex drive and find peace? You cannot “kill” your sex life and you shouldn’t try. I sense that you are trying hard to take this in your stride, but adjusting to it will not be easy. In fact, it will take you some time and considerable effort. Since there has been such a profound change in your relationship, you should consider talking to her about sexual options for each of you that would help get your individual needs met. It would be entirely reasonable, for example, to begin having conversations about possible changes, such as supporting each other’s search for extramarital sexual partners. This may seem radical, but if you care about each other and want to stay married, then being open to a more flexible arrangement might be sensible. There are many styles of unconventional private relationships that work perfectly well for certain couples. If you value good sex as something that could enhance your quality of life, then denying it to yourself and each other may lead only to profound misery. • Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. • If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/08/conservative-plan-to-change-makeup-of-commons-committees-condemned","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T10:22:15Z","webTitle":"Opposition condemns government's Commons committee 'power grab'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/08/conservative-plan-to-change-makeup-of-commons-committees-condemned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/08/conservative-plan-to-change-makeup-of-commons-committees-condemned","fields":{"headline":"Opposition condemns government's Commons committee 'power grab'","bodyText":"Labour and the Liberal Democrats have accused ministers of seeking to subvert democracy by proposing a rule change that would guarantee the government a majority on crucial committees that scrutinise legislation. Jeremy Corbyn said the proposal, published on Friday and to be voted on next week, amounted to an “unprecedented power grab” by the government. The plan, detailed in a motion by Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, seeks to change the rules on membership of public bill committees, often referred to by their former name, standing committees. As part of the progress of a bill through the Commons, a committee is set up to scrutinise it in detail. This is often the period when the most amendments are made and potential problems addressed. The party makeup of such committees is based on the composition of the Commons, meaning that since the election in June, when Theresa May lost her majority, newly formed committees would seek a political balance. However, Leadsom’s motion, to be considered on Tuesday, says that while parity should be sought on other types of committee, this would not happen on public bill committees. The rules should be interpreted, it reads, such that “where a committee has an odd number of members the government shall have a majority, and where a committee has an even number of members the number of government and opposition members shall be equal; but this instruction shall not apply to the nomination of any public bill committee”. Corbyn tweeted: “An unprecedented attempt to rig parliament and grab power by a Conservative government with no majority and no mandate.” The Liberal Democrats said the plan would skewer attempts to change Brexit plans as the government would have a majority on the committee scrutinising the EU withdrawal bill. The party’s chief whip, Alistair Carmichael, said it was “an affront to democracy”. He said: “We will fight tooth and nail to ensure parliamentary committees reflect the will of the electorate and do not simply rubber-stamp government decisions.” The Lib Dems said they would table an amendment to Leadsom’s motion to seek to prevent the change. However, May’s spokeswoman said the change was vital to avoid long delays to bills through large numbers of amendments being made “by a handful of opposition MPs at committee stage” that would need to be reversed via multiple votes back in the Commons. “The government has a majority on the floor of the house, therefore it’s perfectly legitimate that it puts to to the house, and thereby MPs, that it should also have a majority in committees,” the spokeswoman said. “These proposals will make sure that detailed, technical and secondary legislation can be dealt with in committee as usual, rather than everything having to be done on the floor of the house, which would significantly restrict the amount of business parliament could consider at this crucial time.” The government does not have a majority in the Commons, but is supported through a loose alliance with the Democratic Unionists (DUP). May’s spokeswoman said she did not know whether DUP MPs would be treated as members of the government when it came to filling the committees. She rejected the charge that it was undemocratic: “These are common sense proposals. We want a system which allows the opposition to conduct effective scrutiny while giving government a realistic prospect of getting its business through the house in a timely fashion.” The motion was published on the Commons order paper on Friday, but was seen on Thursday by the Huffington Post. The shadow leader of the Commons, Valerie Vaz, told the website ministers were “rigging the committee system so that they are guaranteed a majority they didn’t secure at the ballot box”. She said: “The British people will not understand how, having voted to deny the Conservatives a majority, the Tories can alter the rules of parliament to ensure they have one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2017/sep/05/gentrification-walford-albert-square-eastenders-craft-beer-and-riots","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T13:58:21Z","webTitle":"Gentrification comes to Walford, with craft beer, Nimbys – and riots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2017/sep/05/gentrification-walford-albert-square-eastenders-craft-beer-and-riots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2017/sep/05/gentrification-walford-albert-square-eastenders-craft-beer-and-riots","fields":{"headline":"Gentrification comes to Walford, with craft beer, Nimbys – and riots","bodyText":"Soapland is known for pushing the limits of credibility, but this week, EastEnders is finally taking steps to address its biggest plot hole: gentrification, or hitherto lack of it. For years, Walford has been morphing into a strange parallel universe where market traders and bar staff can still afford to live in a prime real estate town house. According to Rightmove’s current figures, a terrace in Tower Hamlets would set you back north of half a million. Dot Branning would likely have been priced out years ago. Seeds of community unrest were sown last month, when Shirley Carter was seen giving a tongue-lashing to a group of Nimbyish protesters livid at the effect a proposed halfway house would have on the square. “Do we really want violent criminals living right in the middle of a residential community?” a gormless man in pastel-check had asked Phil Mitchell earlier that day. “Well, speaking as a violent criminal myself and living here already as I do,” growled Phil, “I don’t think I’m your target audience, mate.” “You almost had me there,” the man quipped, clutching his petition. By lunchtime, Phil had “had” him in a different way entirely – and Shirley was left to turf the interloper out of her pub with a venom that would have made Peggy proud. “People like you make me sick!” she spat, after a lengthy monologue on social justice. Meanwhile, the raison d’etre of the show’s current villain, Fi Browning, has been to restock the Queen Vic with craft beer, breaking poor Mick Carter’s heart as the cockney lifeblood is drained out of his beloved boozer. Walford’s yuppies have evidently been living in plain sight all along. The show has been making moves to better reflect east London for a few years. It now boasts a bar that serves cocktails in jam jars and is decorated with decapitated Barbie dolls. There was a minor fuss a while back at reports that a planned expansion of the Elstree set was to include a mosque. Denise Fox has been seen visiting the food bank, and the longest-running storyline of this year has involved a dispute with the council over bin collections (it has hardly been a vintage year). Of course, a golden rule of British soap is that the middle classes shall, without exception, always be evil. True to form, this week the march of gentrification ended in catastrophe. With residents gathering for the Walford in Bloom celebrations, the festival was targeted by a group protesting the chattering classes. Inevitably, it descended into a riot, all but ruining Jane Beale’s petunias, causing a gas explosion to rip through the square and setting the scene for a week of death, destruction and mayhem. That’s soap karma in action right there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/05/planning-dispute-over-somerset-path-resolved-after-nearly-60-years","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T13:10:46Z","webTitle":"Planning dispute over Somerset path resolved after nearly 60 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/05/planning-dispute-over-somerset-path-resolved-after-nearly-60-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/05/planning-dispute-over-somerset-path-resolved-after-nearly-60-years","fields":{"headline":"Planning dispute over Somerset path resolved after nearly 60 years","bodyText":"A planning dispute going back almost 60 years over a rutted country lane deep in Somerset has finally been resolved. After a battle believed to be one of the longest in British legal history, the lane outside a cottage once occupied by siblings Archie and Ivy Peppard will be removed as a right of way from the official map. Sadly the Peppards, who launched the fight in 1959 when they claimed they were besieged by walkers traipsing past their front door, did not live long enough to witness the victory. The dispute went all the way to the high court before a planning inspector agreed that the lane in High Ham was not historically a public right of way. Marlene Masters, 80, a neighbour who took up the dispute after the siblings’ deaths, said it had been a David and Goliath fight. She said: “There is nothing scenic about it, it is a muddy track with a high hedge on one side and woods on the other.” The cottage was built in 1840 by a forefather of the Peppards. In 1959 the path was listed as a public right of way. They began officially contesting the footpath in 1973. At one point Archie Peppard built a gate to keep walkers out but was taken to county court and told to remove it. Finally a planning inspector, Alan Beckett, ruled in favour of the footpath being removed from the official maps. He said 18th-century documents did “not provide evidence of the reputation of the route as a public right of way”. As well as farming the land, Archie Peppard was a keen horseman and kept hounds, which would drink from a duck pond in the middle of the path. He was often hired for wedding parties to drive the married couple around the village in a horsedrawn cart. Ivy Peppard’s son, Rodney, 56, works as a farmer and still keeps a smallholding on the land, as well as grazing animals on the Somerset Levels. A spokesman for Somerset county council said: “The order to delete the public footpath from the definitive map and statement has now been confirmed by the secretary of state, and we will be publishing formal notice of this in the local press shortly. “We will be updating our records in the coming days to show that the route is no longer recorded as a right of way. The Ordnance Survey will also be informed of the change in order that they can update their mapping.” A definitive map is a legal document that must be produced and kept up to date by every county council or unitary authority in England and Wales (except the inner London boroughs). It should show every right of way in an authority’s area and the nature of the rights over the paths shown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/05/i-assumed-it-was-all-my-fault-the-adults-dealing-with-undiagnosed-adhd","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T16:23:58Z","webTitle":"‘I assumed it was all my fault’: the adults dealing with undiagnosed ADHD","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/05/i-assumed-it-was-all-my-fault-the-adults-dealing-with-undiagnosed-adhd","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/05/i-assumed-it-was-all-my-fault-the-adults-dealing-with-undiagnosed-adhd","fields":{"headline":"‘I assumed it was all my fault’: the adults dealing with undiagnosed ADHD","bodyText":"Michelle Beckett, a 44-year-old entrepreneur from Harrogate, always knew she was different. But, like many women who suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), she did not fit the stereotypical profile of a child with the condition. Beckett’s difficulties would come later in life, when she failed to live up to her academic potential, experienced two failed marriages and had mental health problems. At 36, Beckett decided to seek help. A neuroscientist in York told her that the results of an EEG – a recording of brain activity – suggested she had ADHD. “I dismissed his diagnosis as rubbish,” she says. “How could I have ADHD? I was just [being] crap and needed to sort myself out.” Beckett’s problems escalated from there. She experienced mood swings so dramatic that any criticism could cause her to go from feeling happy to contemplating suicide. After a failed business venture, she ended up in the care of a local mental health crisis team, believing that her “family and the world would be far better off without me”. It was then that ADHD was mentioned again by a psychiatrist, and, at the age of 44, she decided to seek a private diagnosis; one that not only transformed her life but saved it: “Everything fell into place. I wasn’t crap because I found VAT returns painful, blurted out stuff and was messy. I wasn’t crap at all. I have a neuro difference, which gives me many advantages.” Beckett is just one of many people who slipped through the diagnostic net as children and were left to cope with their ADHD into adulthood. It’s now 30 years since the American Psychiatric Association agreed that ADHD was the best term to describe this condition. It has long been viewed as something that predominantly affects children – mostly young boys – but increasing numbers of adults are now being diagnosed. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, ADHD is indeed more common in boys than in girls – surveys of children between the ages of five and 15 years have found that 3.62% of boys and 0.85% of girls had ADHD. As many people get older, however, the condition improves and around 1% of adults continue to have the condition, with about 2-4% showing partial symptoms. ADHD in adults has come under the spotlight this year with new advances in clinical research. A BBC Horizon programme featured comedian Rory Bremner’s personal journey to understand the science behind the condition. And the thinktank Demos has started a research project exploring the social and financial impact of undiagnosed ADHD in adults. It is due to be completed this year. Even though ADHD is viewed as a modern condition, it was being discussed as early as the Edwardian period, probably as a result of the advent of compulsory schooling in Britain. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was six. I doubt my psychiatrist felt much ambivalence when he was diagnosing me. During one of the assessments, instead of focusing on arranging a series of pictures into chronological order, I thought it would be more productive to climb to the top of the bookshelves in his office. I was easy to diagnose, but many children with ADHD aren’t bouncing off the walls or scaling bookshelves and are therefore much less likely to receive a diagnosis in childhood. This is especially true for women, whose ADHD tends to manifest in less overt ways than it does in boys. Dr Ashok Roy, head of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ intellectual disability faculty, says the core symptoms are the same in men and women, but that “female patients’ inattention problems often are combined with daydreaming, whereas men have more hyperactivity and behavioural problems, which are more noticeable during childhood”. Roy has also observed that women with ADHD also tend to suffer from other disorders that can affect their mood and behaviour. Arielle, a 27-year-old writer from Boston, was diagnosed with ADHD when she was 19. She remembers always being a quiet child: “I didn’t show the classic signs people think of when they hear about hyperactivity. Instead of bouncing off the walls, I simply fidget constantly. I slept through most of school, but, if I was awake, I never was an attentive listener,” she says. Arielle says her grades suffered throughout school because she was unable to focus on her homework. Her teachers told her that if she just did her homework, stayed awake in class and became organised, she could be a straight-A student. “Over the years, I started to assume I was just lazy. Instead of thinking there might be something wrong biologically, I assumed it was all my fault. And, every time I’d resolve to be better at being attentive in class, or neat or diligent about homework, I’d inevitably fail.” Arielle feels that going undiagnosed until adulthood was “pretty harmful” for her, and sometimes tells herself that if she really had ADHD, someone would have noticed it sooner: “I still frequently doubt that I have ADHD and sometimes believe I’m just fooling everyone in an attempt to excuse my forgetfulness, messy nature, issues with planning ahead and problems completing projects.” It’s not surprising that Arielle feels this way, as there is a prevailing scepticism about the condition, even among psychiatrists. The most frequent criticism levelled at the diagnosis of ADHD is that it pathologises normal behaviours. The neurologist Dr Richard Saul promoted this idea in his 2014 book, ADHD Does Not Exist. At the same time, in an article for Time magazine, Saul expressed concern over the stimulants used to treat ADHD – most commonly methylphenidate – and argued that, under the criteria employed to diagnose the condition, “the entire US population could potentially qualify. We have all had these moments and, in moderate amounts, they’re a normal part of the human condition.” These arguments tend to come as a reaction to the recent explosion of ADHD diagnoses in children, particularly in the US. However, Roy argues that “untreated populations fare worse on academic, social and occupational outcomes as well as contact with the law”. He argues that practitioners should “guard against overdiagnosis by the use of systematic assessments using internationally agreed criteria”. In April this year, the Lancet published a report that suggests the condition is a valid pathology. Researchers from nine countries scanned the brains of people aged between four and 63 years old, 1,713 with ADHD and 1,529 without. The report found small differences in brain size between those with the condition and those without it. These differences were more pronounced in children, and the differences were still apparent in unmedicated subjects. If we accept that ADHD is real, then we might want to address the lack of awareness that exists within our society, as undiagnosed adults are often left to live dysfunctional lives. According to Roy, part of the problem when diagnosing adults is that they are more likely to “internalise their inner restlessness rather than act it out as children do”. Roy adds: “This may manifest as mood swings, difficulty getting along with others, problems holding down a job, substance-abuse problems, and a pattern of being irresponsible and making poor decisions. These behaviours may be incorrectly attributed to personality problems, anxiety or depression rather than ADHD.” Indeed, the most common story I hear from those I speak to with ADHD is that they were diagnosed with conditions such as depression and anxiety before they discovered they had it. This is something I can attest to. I stopped receiving treatment for ADHD in my teens. This was partly because I moved around so much but also because I was resistant to the label; I didn’t want to believe there was something wrong with me. In my early 20s, I sought treatment again only because my life was falling apart. I didn’t receive the support I felt I needed and was given antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication instead. Victoria Jones is a very amiable student from Lancashire who begins talking to me a mile a minute in a way that would defeat the deftest shorthand practitioner. Like many people with undiagnosed ADHD, she had been treated for anxiety and depression for 10 years prior to her diagnosis. Before being diagnosed, Jones led a chaotic life, experienced many failed relationships, flitted from one job to the other, and eventually ended up owing £25,000 through impulse spending and her inability to manage her debts. Since being diagnosed with ADHD at age 34, she has been on “a rollercoaster” of emotions and learning: “Having been one of those people who thought it was an excuse for boys’ ‘naughty’ behaviour, it has been a revelation to learn about and understand it.” She is involved in an ADHD support group in Lancashire and wants to raise awareness about the condition: “I wish more than anything that the media, schools and other agencies were educated better on the topic and it became as understood and supported as autism. I think this would give families, friends and the rest of society the means to assist in and improve the lives of those who have it.” John, 30, from the home counties, says he has struggled with insomnia since childhood and has experienced problems in his personal and professional life due to his forgetfulness: “My relationships always suffer – I have lost count of the number of friends from my teens and early 20s I no longer speak to due to being useless at keeping in touch, forgetting to respond to messages or simply not remembering that they exist.” John adds that this applies to everything in his life: “If it’s beyond my very narrow, immediate focus, it gets ignored, even consciously put to one side. I will step over piles of urgent laundry to complete my pointless DIY project. I will pay late fees on bills I can easily afford just because it seems that paying them will take me several hours, and I really want to do something else.” John was finally diagnosed quite recently and, like many adults with ADHD, he became aware of the condition through his own research. He was assessed and diagnosed relatively quickly, but has mixed feelings about the treatment he has received: “I’ve been on methylphenidate since being diagnosed a few months ago. Initially, I thought it was a gamechanger – I could sit down and complete something without getting distracted.” But more recently John has begun to have doubts: “I notice I can be a little too focused, energetic and positive, and if I am doing something pointless when my meds kick in, that can be a whole day wasted.” Andrew Kavanagh, 44, an animator from Dublin, didn’t receive a diagnosis until he was 43. “I often wondered why I had so many challenges in achieving what others found relatively easy to do,” he says. He only suspected he might have the condition when he met the neuroscientist Áine Behan, who, as CEO of Cortechs, was developing gaming technology to help children with ADHD improve their focus. “I knew little about the condition at the time, but as my research into the area deepened, I recognised many of my own traits in the symptoms attributed to ADHD sufferers.” Kavanagh describes himself as fidgety, often impatient, a poor sleeper and someone who struggles to complete tasks. “I often feel like when I start something, I should be able to do it immediately rather than having to go through a learning process. I’ve always been impatient for results and often start a lot of different things and quickly become overwhelmed.” Roy says that many adults remain undiagnosed because psychiatrists do not receive enough training. He believes the government needs to invest more in this. Labour’s shadow minister for mental health, Barbara Keeley, agrees. “Adults with ADHD who are undiagnosed and untreated in childhood are at greater risk of low self-esteem, substance abuse, anxiety and depression,” she says. “Investing in children’s mental health services and in early intervention is key to preventing this spiral.” She adds that it is “deeply worrying” that Health Education England is cutting back on training courses for GPs and trainees. The Department of Health describes Keeley’s comments as “completely misleading” and adds that since 2005 the government has made an additional £250m available each year for children’s mental health services, and that by the end of 2017 it intends to publish a green paper setting out plans to improve access and the provision of services. It’s not clear if ADHD should be considered an illness. It really describes a different type of brain, and may be partially responsible for the achievements of many successful people, including Albert Einstein and Katherine Ellison. Despite the serious problems that adults with undiagnosed ADHD face, many living with the condition say it has had a positive impact on their lives too. As well as being inattentive, their ADHD allows them to hyper-focus, and their impulsivity can inspire creativity. Beckett says she wouldn’t change her ADHD. “I can be quick-thinking, creative, adaptable, warm, enthusiastic, authentic, honest, spontaneous, ambitious, driven to change the world, feisty and outspoken. I am interested in many different types of people, many different issues and many concepts and ideas. I strongly believe I wouldn’t have these traits if I didn’t have ADHD.” Kavanagh has a similar outlook and likens ADHD to a “clockwork toy wound up and set loose in a labyrinth without a map. You run in to a lot of walls, but occasionally you break through some of them.” He, too, says he wouldn’t change his condition: “Despite all the hard knocks I have encountered getting to where I am, I wouldn’t trade ADHD for anything. It’s part of what makes me who I am, and I embrace that.” Some names have been changed. The charity Addiss offers help and advice for people who wish to find out more about ADHD."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/10/gabrielle-deydier-fat-in-france-abuse-grossophobia-book-women","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Gabrielle Deydier: what it’s like to be fat in France","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/10/gabrielle-deydier-fat-in-france-abuse-grossophobia-book-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/10/gabrielle-deydier-fat-in-france-abuse-grossophobia-book-women","fields":{"headline":"Gabrielle Deydier: what it’s like to be fat in France","bodyText":"In August 2015, 37-year-old Gabrielle Deydier went for a job interview which she passed with flying colours. The job was for a position as a teaching assistant at a Parisian special needs school and the interview panel, including the school’s headmaster, had been so impressed with Gabrielle that they even told her they were worried in case she left for a better-paid job. There had been only one uncomfortable moment: it came at the end, as Gabrielle was walking out the door. The headmaster said: “The teacher you’ll be working under can be rather difficult.” Gabrielle barely heard him, she was so delighted about her new job. It wasn’t long before she realised that “difficult” was a colossal understatement. “You’re Gabrielle Deydier,” was the first thing the teacher in question said when they met. “I don’t work with fat people.” Gabrielle tried to laugh it off, but the difficult teacher wasn’t smiling. “It wasn’t a joke,” she said. Gabrielle has two degrees, a pleasant and open manner and weighs 150kg, or 23½ stone. She also has the misfortune of both being French and living in France, which means that her physical appearance counts for everything, including her employability. In France, she says (and all the facts of her experience seem to bear this out), being fat is considered to be a grotesque self-inflicted disability. At any given time, 80% of Frenchwomen are thought to be on a diet. In the south of the country, there’s a lively gastric-band industry (50,000 operations a year). There’s currently a vegan craze sweeping the land – a way for some people to cover up eating disorders. “Frenchwomen,” says Gabrielle, “pride themselves as being the most feminine in Europe. There is this feeling that women have to be perfect in every way.” Is it surprising then that the publication of Gabrielle’s book, You’re Not Born Fat, last month has attracted keen interest – a combination of both admiration and moral panic? For Gabrielle the past 12 months have been like waking up from a nightmare, if nightmares were real and lasted two decades. At one point in our meeting she’s tearful – but they are tears of happy disbelief. Suddenly, at 38, Gabrielle, who’s been told her entire adult life that she wasn’t fit for work, is being called an intellectual break-out hero. She’s been profiled in Le Monde, Figaro, the political news magazine Le Point, and appeared on France’s most serious TV shows. The day before I meet her a councillor under Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, called Gabrielle to ask whether she would consider organising the capital’s first anti-grossophobia (sizeism) day. Deals to write a film script and a novel have been made. Italian Vanity Fair wrote about her, and an Italian publisher snapped up the book. The English-language rights have not yet been sold. What it means to be fat in France is for the first time up for discussion in France. “I decided to write the book,” she says, “because I no longer want to apologise for existing. Yes obesity has doubled in the past 10 years, that’s much too much. But it does not mean we discriminate against the obese in telling them they can’t work and insulting them.” Gabrielle, who couldn’t even look at a picture of herself until six months ago, has prepared herself for this moment. “My publisher said: ‘You will be on TV and it will be hard.’ So, with a friend, we started doing pictures of me in a swimming pool so I could accept how I looked in a swimsuit.” (On France’s beaches, disgusted passers-by have told her to “Please cover up.”) “Because I was doing it for a purpose, it had meaning.” We’ve arranged to meet downstairs in the restaurant of a youth hostel in Paris, where she’s lived since she lost the teaching job (and her income) on the grounds that she lacked commitment because she failed to lose weight. It’s startling to find a woman of her age, likability, intelligence – and now moderate fame – living in temporary accommodation because she can’t afford to rent a room in a Paris apartment. It’s a contradiction but she’s a small figure, despite her size, winkled into a banquette. The previous week she had received an email: “Dear Gabrielle, after university I went to work at Dior where I am now very high up. I despised women like you all my life; my mother has always been fat. But now she’s in hospital, dying. She gave me your book and it’s the first time I have understood how it must have felt for her. Thank you.” Gabrielle sits there looking very sad and a little bit helpless. “I find that crazy, that people need to read a book to accept the overweight. I’m really, really sorry to get messages like that.” There are many equally bizarre episodes in her life story. Returning to the teaching job, this is how it ended: discrimination on grounds of physical appearance is illegal in France, a law that seems not to have filtered through to employers. Following the awkward introduction, the “difficult” teacher introduced Gabrielle to the class of six autistic children as: “The seventh handicapped person in the room.” She accused Gabrielle of sweating too much. The headmaster told Gabrielle: “If she has a problem with you, then so do I.” “He said it was unfair on the children because they were now being doubly stigmatised – for their disabilities and because they’d be bullied for having a fat teacher.” Gabrielle was asked to “have a think” about her future. “We’re going to give you 30 days to prove you are motivated.” Motivated? “Motivated to lose weight. To show you’re committed to this job.” “It was never the children,” says Gabrielle. “They were wonderful. But I was finding it difficult and complicated to deal with.” It was noted that: “You were seen out of breath after climbing the stairs to the third floor.” Why didn’t she take the school to court? “I was afraid I wouldn’t be believed,” she says. It’s not an unlikely scenario. She’d experienced many similar events. The gynaecologist who grumbled: “There’s so much blubber here, I can’t see”; the male colleague who denied he’d sexually harassed her on the grounds that his wife was much better looking: “Why would I try to rape a fat woman?” “The police were very good, but said: ‘You have a right to make a complaint, but we advise against it because a tribunal won’t be on your side.’” Strangely, nothing similar had happened to her at Montpellier University, where she’d blossomed. “I was very happy,” she remembers. “I had lots of friends and went out a lot. There were people who made fun of me, but it wasn’t too bad, it wasn’t really discrimination. They were idiots, but it wasn’t the system. It was when I started looking for a job.” Becoming obese can happen to anyone and it began happening to Gabrielle at 17. As a teenager she was sporty and muscular, a bit overweight (at 65kg, by a stone) – “plump”. Her mother decided her daughter needed to take emergency steps after Gabrielle came home from a shopping trip with a new pair of trousers in size 14, instead of her usual 12. “She was very depressed about it: ‘You can’t have put on weight – you spent money for no reason.’ But even then my weight wasn’t such a big deal.” That changed when she went to a doctor. The doctor considered Gabrielle’s weight gain to be a very big deal indeed and started her on hormone treatment. “I began having problems like very bad skin all over my body and hair growing everywhere. And I put on a lot of weight: 30kg in three months.” More hormone treatments were prescribed, combined with a strict diet of boiled vegetables and meat. The weight piled on. “It changed the way I thought about food. And I found myself eating things I’d never eaten before, hiding food, stealing money from my parents to buy food. All sorts of nonsense.” She now weighed 120kg. “I wanted to die. Every day. I thought of myself as deformed.” Her parents weren’t happy either. “It was a very, very difficult time.” She failed her baccalaureate twice, then passed. University meant freedom. What happened after she graduated? Gabrielle grows smaller in her banquette. “I saw all my friends getting work experience and I wasn’t, and I didn’t understand it. There was no logical reason for it. People were giving me admin or underpaid jobs. I was doing factory work.” Halfway through a job interview, a recruitment consultant spelled it out: ‘You’re not compatible with the image we want to portray of the company.’ I said: “Well, I’m not an idiot.” And he said: “It’s well known that IQ is inversely proportional to body weight.” Gabrielle knew there was something specifically French about her experience. She’d spent a year in Spain as part of her degree. “In Spain it just wasn’t an issue. If someone commented on how I looked it was only to give a compliment. In France I’d be a couple of minutes into a conversation and it would be: ‘But why are you fat? Was that a choice? Is it an illness?’” The visit to the doctor when Gabrielle was 17 is mirrored by its opposite, exactly 20 years later, the second time in her life when her world was turned upside down: but this time from terrible to a waking dream. Last June, she remembers: “My depression was serious. I hadn’t talked to my family for a year. I was even worried I was going to be homeless. I put on 30kg. I was going into decline and frightened. I thought of shooting myself or leaving for somewhere far away, but didn’t know where to go. And on one of those horrible days my friends forced me to come to a book launch. I didn’t want to go, got completely drunk and ended up talking to some writers about an investigative project where one was working undercover in an abattoir. “I said: ‘Do you know what grossophobia is?’ and nobody knew what I was talking about. So I described all the things I’d experienced. They told me to get it down on paper and email it to them as soon as possible.” If Gabrielle hadn’t still had alcohol in her bloodstream the next morning she doesn’t think she’d have had the courage to put it into words, six pages. Wincing, she pressed “Send”. There was a publisher on the phone the same day. A fortnight later, a book deal. She’s welling up: “It saved my life.” The book is most revelatory about France in the reactions it has triggered – especially in the readers’ letters Gabrielle now gets every day (hardly any of them from people who are overweight). “One woman told me she had been bulimic for 20 years because she was scared if she put on weight she would lose her husband and job.” A more layered response came from a man: “He said, ‘Your book has made me realise I’m a total shit. For five years I worked with young people. If they were overweight, I humiliated them.’ He asked me to forgive him, as if I was a priest in a confessional.” That’s not her job, she says. Still, the letters confirm one thing: it’s France’s turn now to feel as Gabrielle did: ashamed and questioning herself. All because of a single book. Her story is fascinating, heroic, ongoing.

Peter Madsen, 46, who denies killing Wall, told a pre-trial custody hearing in the Danish capital on Tuesday that the journalist, who had boarded his self-built submarine for an interview, died when a heavy hatch cover fell on her. He said he had climbed out ahead of Wall and was standing on top of the surfaced submarine holding the 70kg hatch cover open, but lost his footing and it hit her head. He said he heard a thud as she fell to the floor bleeding from a fractured skull. “It was a terrible accident, a disaster, no doctor could have done anything,” he told the court. “Kim was severely injured. There was a pool of blood where she landed. I touched her neck, but she had no pulse.” After hearing defence and prosecution arguments, the judge Anette Burkø ordered Madsen to be detained for four more weeks. “I find there is reasonable suspicion that the detainee is guilty of murder,” the judge said. Madsen, who has been in custody since 12 August on the lesser charge of negligent manslaughter, will appeal against the decision and has declined to submit to a voluntary psychiatric examination, his lawyer said. The court heard statements about Madsen’s alleged taste for violent pornography and sadomasochistic sex, including claims that he had had sex with several women on board the submarine. Madsen told the court he felt “suicidal” after Wall’s death. He said he had wanted to bury her at sea, attaching a metal weight around her waist so her body would sink, and planned to sink his submarine, taking his own life. “In my shock I thought it was the right thing to do,” he said. “I didn’t want a dead body in my submarine. I put a rope around her feet to drag her out. I thought a fitting end for Peter Madsen would be on board the Nautilus. I decided I couldn’t continue the life I had been living.” He had no explanation for Wall’s severed head and limbs, saying she was “in one piece” when he last saw her body. Asked by the prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen whether he had ever carried a saw on the vessel, he said he had, but there was none on board on the day he took Wall for their short sea voyage. Wall, 30, a respected freelance journalist based in New York and China who had written for the Guardian, the New York Times and others, was last seen alive on the Nautilus on 10 August. Her boyfriend reported her missing that evening. Police and coastguard located the 60ft (18 metre) UC3 Nautilus – the largest self-built submarine ever made when it was launched in 2008 – in Køge Bay, about 30 miles south of Copenhagen, the following morning. Madsen, a self-taught engineer with cult status in Denmark, was rescued by a private boat soon afterwards, just before the submarine sank. He initially told his rescuers he had got into difficulties trying to repair a problem with the ballast tank. Investigators have said traces of Wall’s blood, DNA-matched against her hairbrush and toothbrush, were found inside the refloated submarine. Buch-Jepsen told the court a pair of women’s underpants and tights were found in the engine room. After first telling police he had dropped Wall off on dry land on the city outskirts once the interview was over, Madsen said 24 hours later she had died in an accident. He told the court her clothing had come off when he threw her body overboard. The charge against him was extended on 21 August to include “improper interference with a corpse” after Wall’s torso – identified by further DNA tests – was found washed up on the coast of Copenhagen’s Amager island. Police have said the body had been stabbed multiple times, apparently in an attempt to ensure a buildup of air would not lead to it floating to the surface, and that metal piping had been attached to it to make it sink. An entrepreneur, artist, submarine builder and aerospace engineer, Madsen has also successfully launched rockets in the hope of developing private space travel. In 2015 he sent a text message to two volunteer members of his team saying there was a curse on Nautilus. “That curse is me,” the message said. “There will never be peace on Nautilus as long as I exist.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/10/lunice-ccclx-review-solo-debut-solo-album-le1f","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"Lunice: CCCLX CD review – doesn’t quite add up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/10/lunice-ccclx-review-solo-debut-solo-album-le1f","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/10/lunice-ccclx-review-solo-debut-solo-album-le1f","fields":{"headline":"Lunice: CCCLX CD review – doesn’t quite add up","bodyText":"In the five years since electronic duo TNGHT – Hudson Mohawke and Canadian producer Lunice – released their self-titled EP before announcing an indefinite hiatus, Mohawke has worked with artists such as Kanye West; Lunice has taken a more low-key route.

The storms usually fire up at this time, when the sun has had all day to warm the earth. Then the cumulonimbus towers burst up through the atmosphere and all hell breaks loose. In chasing terms, it had been an easy day – we’d covered maybe 400 miles to get on to this line of storms in the far west of Kansas. We knew there was little chance of tornadoes, but our guide, my friend Roger Hill – a stormchasing veteran of at least 30 years – thought there was a good chance of some big hail and maybe even some landspout activity [where a tornado forms from the ground up]. We stopped downwind and waited for the developing storm to advance. As I set up, the storm turned into a monster: an almost-solid curtain of rain in the background. Then in the foreground, an unusually large landspout whipped up. The scene was surreal, almost abstract – low-contrast, back-lit, the storm creeping towards us. But all the while there were really strong outflow winds reminding you it was all too real ... and just a wall of precipitation edging toward us. And this was huge for a landspout. Just for scale, if you look carefully to the right of the spout, you can just make out an electricity tower. Landspouts are usually less powerful than regular tornadoes – this was such a rare occurrence that Roger had to confirm with the National Weather Service that it was just a landspout, But you can see it has the classic cylinder shape, rather than a tornado’s typical cone or wedge. In eight years of chasing, I’ve never seen another storm like this one. I guess I must’ve put around 140,000 miles behind me chasing storms – about five-and-a-half times round the world. But I love travelling through America. Many years ago, as a greenhorn fresh out of Long Island, I didn’t even know Kansas was next to Colorado. But these experiences really opened up my eyes to how these landscapes interact – how the cool, dry air coming off the Rockies spreads over the Plains and collides with all that warm, moist air from the Gulf. And then when you see the effect that can have as they explode ... I was hooked. Storms are nature’s way of restoring balance to the atmosphere. They behave almost like living beings, and I sometimes feel as if what I’m documenting has a personality – like seeing King Kong in the flesh! Each storm has a different life cycle. Some are wild, live fast and die young in a deluge of hail and rain. Others age and change and weaken, fighting to stay alive. Each one deserves to be recorded because they will never happen again in the same way. You never know what sort of window of opportunity you’ll have. In some cases the storm is moving slowly or predictably enough that you can take half an hour as it passes. Other times, you can see the rotating wall cloud approaching fast, the inflow winds get up and you’re straight back in the van. When baseball-sized hail starts falling you don’t even bother setting up - baseballs and cameras don’t mix. My teenage son once asked me to take him with me, not expecting much – “maybe you can take a photo of me in front of a tornado,” he was joking. But I wanted to give him an experience with his father that he’d remember for the rest of his life, so in 2014 I took him on a chase near Pilger, Nebraska. That name is now infamous: my son watched amazed as two giant twin wedges dropped out of the sky. He got his photo, but he was kinda keen to get out of there. The inflow winds were insane. I just managed to get the photo before my glasses blew off. I’ve always photographed in black and white. Modern cameras are calibrated to adjust for how humans see colour, but the sensors can actually see much more than that. So I modify my camera to record what the sensors are capable of seeing rather than what the manufacturer thinks you want to see. Other than that there’s no trickery. I have a few screw-on filters, depending on the light and the environment. I’m pretty sure I took Landspout without any filtration, though.

In fact, they are a demonstration of incoherence (has the Treasury really signed up to the wider fiscal consequences?) and previous dogmatism on the part of the government. For the latter, the editor of the Evening Standard and former chancellor George Osborne carries the can. Either he failed to understand the effects of a blanket restriction on pay or he was carrying through an ideological assault on the state. It is significant that the government now realises what its austerity has accomplished. Here is a chance to address the recruitment crisis in the NHS. Nurses may be persuaded to hold off on their threatened action. If the FDA union is right and a third of civil servants are poised to leave their posts, perhaps a Whitehall implosion will be averted. Warm words from the prime minister about public sector people are doubtless welcome, echoing the attempt her former adviser Nick Timothy seemed to have made in the election manifesto to scope a new Tory philosophy. However, there are two big, big caveats. The first is money. Maybe the Treasury has been persuaded to slit the sides of the pay envelope, but you can bet the quid pro quo must be staff numbers. Agencies and departments may be accorded pay flexibility but only within a controlled, still eye-wateringly tight, budget. Better pay for some, translates as fewer staff in aggregate. If that’s not what the Treasury is agreeing to, the alternative is incredible. Is Philip Hammond really junking the Osborne spending trajectory and admitting the state has grown dysfunctionally too small? Is the Treasury going to expand borrowing or (even more unlikely in present political circumstances) raise taxes in order to pay for the extra pay costs? The second doubt takes us into a huge empty space – the Tory approach to government and public services. Under Margaret Thatcher and to a lesser extent John Major, the Tories were the party of cuts, but also the party of public management innovation with a keen interest in new ideas. Since 2010, however, it has been impossible to detect any clear threads in how Tory ministers go about their custodianship of the state, beyond their determination to shrink it and push contracting and privatisation. It’s not just flexibility on pay that’s needed, but fresh and joined-up thinking about the values and operations of the public sector. The Department for Exiting the European Union, like the Department for Transport, for example, or like NHS trusts, don’t just need to be able to offer excellent people salaries commensurate with their training and potential – they need to be able to assure them that public purpose is uppermost and that their ethos goes beyond the selfish priorities of today’s ministers. Sadly, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, like the Tories, gave the concept of public sector reform an unpleasant taste. Yet the public sector still needs reform, like it needs more money. Among measures – to be negotiated with the unions – are additional payments in areas of staff shortage, temporary bonuses and golden handcuffs. However, such steps would only make sense if the government were sincerely committed to collective service and its notion of reform embraced expansion and refurbishment of the public realm.

But this autumn, supernatural vibrations are being felt by a new generation, as witches cast their spell over everything from fashion to politics. “I’ve always loved witches,” says designer Edward Meadham, as he explains his inspirations for his latest collection. “In my work I have always tried to distort the perceived meanings of the visual female archetypes, including witches,” he says. “For me, they are the primary example of the feared and maligned women.” Fashion fans will know Meadham from cult label Meadham Kirchhoff, which is now closed. His new label, which marries street style with gothic romance, is called Blue Roses, though he had toyed with the idea of calling it Witches. The collection, which featured witches on T-shirts and hoodies, alongside graffiti-style illustration, pearls, and frills, immediately sold out when it went on sale at Dover Street Market last month. Meadham is not the only designer flirting with witch style this season. Rising womenswear designer Clio Peppiatt will be presenting her upcoming collection at London fashion week in September, and witches will feature heavily. Themed around Anna Biller’s 2016 film The Love Witch, the 30-piece collection will feature detailed embroidery and embellishment taken from Peppiatt’s own illustrations. The Love Witch’s lurid style owes much to the campy horror movies of the 60s and 70s. “I loved the obsessive attention to detail throughout the film,” Peppiatt explains. “The colours, the set, the costume and the production; the way everything hangs together is so gorgeous. But, while aesthetically everything is beautiful, the core is very macabre.” For her upcoming collection, Peppiatt illustrated her own tarot cards – inspired by the original Rider Waite deck—and worked from the designs. “The initial imagery is so rich and detailed,” she says. Witchcraft also has a rich visual legacy in the music industry. Stevie Nicks and Kate Bush were early pioneers: from a dove-carrying Nicks explaining that her song Rhiannon is about “an old Welsh witch”, to Bush’s Waking the Witch, from her Hounds of Love album. And Courtney Love sang about the “witches inside us” in 1993’s 20 Years In The Dakota. Love’s grungy 90s aesthetic was a reference point for Meadham in particular. “The witch symbol I used on a hoodie for the last Blue Roses collection was stolen from the inside cover of Hole’s Live Through This, and it is a symbol I’ve used before in my work,” he explains. “I love the idea of my clothes being a uniform for a coven of disruptive girls.” Certainly, the new witch aesthetic owes much more to 90s fashion—think The Craft or Sabrina The Teenage Witch. In particular, The Craft has a lot to answer for when it comes to our current trends: small, coloured sunglasses, chokers, dark lipstick, and kilts all feature prominently in the cult 1996 film about a coven of teen witches. Expect more of the same when the much-awaited remake, currently in development, finally hits our screens. But why has the fashion world embraced witchcraft? In part, designers like Peppiatt and Meadham have glommed on to it as a fashionable aesthetic due to the influence of teen girl internet culture, specifically platforms like Tumblr and Instagram. Today’s modern witch is as likely to cast a binding spell on Donald Trump or espouse the virtues of motherwort as she is to celebrate the vernal equinox or mercury retrograde finally ending. Modern witches are fashionable, sexually liberated, young, and often actively engaged in political activism. In the hyper-masculine age of Trump, tarot, astrology, crystal healing and witchcraft are firmly in vogue. Dazed Digital has just appointed a self-proclaimed witch Lauren Bowker, who runs a mystical magic laboratory THEUNSEEN, and will be science editor-at-large for the site. American Vogue has hopped on the broomstick, recently curating a “Witchy Week” featuring tips on how to have a moon ceremony and which potions to include in your beauty regime. And influencers like The Hoodwitch and Fay Nowitz position themselves at the vanguard of modern witchcraft, with an Instagram-friendly aesthetic and huge followings. “The world is in such a crazy state right now,” says Peppiatt, “I wonder if people are looking for something greater to believe in.” To help them find their way, Elisabeth Krohn launched Sabat in 2016, as a magazine that fuses feminism and witchcraft. “The modern witch offers us another path, one that is mystical and nature-orientated, where we come into our feminine power as women and witches,” she says. “For the girls that grow up today, this world is dominated by patriarchy and consumerism. Can we really be and do whatever we like? Do we have powers?” But how best to channel your inner witch? “I feel there is a witchy look for every mood or occasion,” Krohn says. “We can claim belonging to tribes of thought and practice, dress for protest like the guerrilla feminists of activist group W.I.T.C.H. or cling on to personal talismans to feel strong or safe. And we can choose alternative and perhaps more ethical ways to consume and create fashion as an art of every day that also honour broader values like caring for the earth and other creatures.” And if you can’t find a rowdy, raucous coven to join, why not create your own?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/09/queens-just-look-out-of-windows-how-childrens-books-are-failing-to-show-gender-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T05:30:02Z","webTitle":"‘Queens just look out of windows’: how children’s books are failing to show gender equality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/09/queens-just-look-out-of-windows-how-childrens-books-are-failing-to-show-gender-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/09/queens-just-look-out-of-windows-how-childrens-books-are-failing-to-show-gender-equality","fields":{"headline":"‘Queens just look out of windows’: how children’s books are failing to show gender equality","bodyText":"My pre-school son and I were snuggled up, reading, when it happened for the third time. I had mentioned that our new book was written by the same author as one of his old favourites. The author was a woman and my son frowned: “But that’s not usual, is it?” he asked. “I mean, for a woman to write books?” I was disconcerted. I had been prepared for all sorts of strange new opinions when he started reception, but this was the third time he had come out with sexist guff. How had he absorbed these sorts of ideas in his cosseted, pre-school world? More to the point, girls now outperform boys in school and further education. If my son was going to start his school life with a tendency to underestimate girls, might that extend to him putting down their willingness to work hard? Might he also learn to despise the abilities traditionally considered to be feminine, such as cooperation, empathy and diligence, which are increasingly valued in the modern-day workplace – and which feature heavily in those jobs thought to be safest from the advance of automation? Before having children, I assumed it was daughters, rather than sons, who required help to avoid the elephant traps of gender-based partiality and prejudice that the world would strew in their path. It wasn’t until I had first a boy and then a girl, that I realised reality is more complex. I still twitch with horror at the proliferation of girls dressed permanently in billowing pink princess dresses – my daughter almost exclusively wears her brother’s castoffs – but the truth is that despite their crinolines and sparkly tiaras, these princess-wannabes rampage over bouncy castles and hurtle down the steepest slides in the playgrounds just as enthusiastically as their male peers. As a friend of mine said recently, gazing out over a back garden strewn with saccharine playthings. “I’ve given up the fight against pink. I’ve decided it doesn’t matter: my daughters are still going to be lawyers and doctors, they’re just going to collect their degrees wearing pink dresses.” Boys, though, are another story. The gap in attainment between boys and girls in the UK is stark and starts young. At key stage 2, the gap is six percentage points. For GCSEs, the gap for five A*-C grades, including English and maths, is nine percentage points in England, and more than seven in the other three home nations. The impact of this underachievement by boys is direct. Annually, 30,000 fewer young men than young women become apprentices and 60,000 fewer go to university – 460,000 fewer over the past decade – an underachievement that has been called a national scandal. More young men than women are not in education, employment or training. Fewer men are entering nearly all of the professions, and between the ages of 22 and 29, young men earn less an hour on average than women, in both full-time and part-time roles. There are, of course, a multitude of ways in which parents can try to prevent their sons sliding into this slipstream. But all too soon, our influence is first diluted, then trumped by our children’s peers. Nevertheless, I’m a strong believer in the power of books to nuzzle deep into children’s heads in a way that parents and peers cannot, providing the blueprint for what is right and wrong, what is beautiful and ugly, what is attainable and what is out of bounds. Books bestow a neutral and absolute authority as to the way life is, can be and should be lived. I have bought books to prepare my son for everything significant he has ever experienced, from his first visit to the dentist to the arrival of his baby sister. I bought creepy-monster books to satisfy his craving to be scared – and nice-monster books when that plan proved a bit too successful. I’ve bought culturally diverse books to go some way to ameliorating the predominantly white circles he moves in. So I had already tried – and failed – to find age-appropriate, literary ripostes to the first of his earlier two sexist pronouncements: “Queens aren’t powerful,” he announced, when we were reading about the Tudors. “They just look out of windows.” Annoyingly, according to the fictional world of literature for the very young, I found this is true: at their best, queens despair over their messy princesses but, mostly, they play a silent and usually fretful, second fiddle to the king. My son’s second declaration, however, totally blindsided me. When reading a book that featured a girl winning a running race, he protested that it wasn’t true. “Girls can’t run fast,” he insisted. Coming as it did just after a sports day at his nursery in which he had been beaten by virtually every girl in his class – and from a child whose mother is more physically boisterous than his father – this was quite an exercise in prejudice trumping reality. I determined to stock up on books that would counter his “alternative facts”: books that showed cool-yet-ambitious boys who worked hard to achieve their dream – whether that be dragon-catching, alien-befriending or pirate-thwarting – alongside strong, courageous, funny, clever peers who just happened to be girls. This proved harder than I expected. According to a study co-authored by Professor Janice McCabe, from Florida State University, a quarter of children’s books have no female characters. While of Time Magazine’s 100 Best Children’s Books of All Time, 53 featured female characters who didn’t even speak. It is not limited to books: across children’s media, only 19.5% of female characters have jobs or career aspirations compared with 80.5% of male characters. Nevertheless, with a bit of effort, I found a rich seam of fantastic books featuring girl protagonists who were courageous and scrappy, ingenious and fallible. As great as these books are, however, their central character almost always has her adventures on her own or with other girls. What has been surprisingly difficult to find are books where the genders play together, without the boys dominating, outnumbering or otherwise overshadowing the girls. Referring to her study on the dearth of female protagonists in children’s books, McCabe said: “Such findings are significant. It is a trend of symbolic annihilation of females in children’s literature, which has implications for children’s understandings of gender.” McCabe was talking in the context of girls when she said this, and their incipient feelings of gender-based inferiority. But what about the impact on boys who read exclusively about worlds where girls are “annihilated” or dominated? As Gloria Steinem says, “I’m glad we’ve begun to raise our daughters more like our sons, but it will never work until we raise our sons more like our daughters.” If we want to create an equitable society in which everyone can thrive, we need to give boys more choices. Letting them develop a sense of gender-dictated birthright that will be whisked away from under their noses by high-achieving girls, as surely as the tortoise triumphed over the hare, is a recipe for resentment between the sexes. Nan Froman is a senior editor at Groundwood Books, an independent children’s publisher committed to publishing books that are difficult or potentially controversial. She thinks “gender equality in children’s books is very much on people’s radars” but acknowledges an issue with demand. “Parents of daughters may more actively seek out books that encourage female empowerment [rather than gender equality] and perhaps that is just a reflection of where we have come from as a society,” she says. Groundwood Books is tackling the issue head on. It will shortly publish a picture book – Me and You and the Red Canoe by Jean E Pendziwol – featuring two siblings who can be “read” as being of any gender the reader wishes to attribute to them. Also on Groundwood’s list is Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress, about a little boy who likes to wear the dress in the dressing-up box at school. But Froman admits, “Social justice is one of the touchstones at Groundwood, so the kinds of authors we attract and the manuscripts we are drawn to probably tend to be conscious of gender equality. This is something we are aware of in the editing and illustrating process.” But the larger publishing houses, sadly, are a different matter. A senior editor at one, who preferred not to be identified, said, “Parents of daughters buy books that encourage female empowerment but neither they, nor the parents of boys think it’s a priority to buy books that focus on gender equality.” She also suggests there is an assumption among some publishers that it is harder work to get boys reading. Their solution, she said, is to commission and prioritise books aimed at boys that focus on simple, white-knuckle activity and excitement, rather than risk losing their audiences for the sake of a few mildly challenging characters and friendships. But the biggest reason for the dearth in books showing girls and boys as equal is that there is no money in it. “Publishers need a clear financial incentive to change their juggernaut-like direction of travel,” she says. “Until there’s a loud and clear call for books that encourage boys to think it’s cool to interact with their hardworking, high-achieving female peers – like there was a call for books featuring strong female protagonists – I’m afraid they’re not going to happen.” Build a non-sexist library for your kids Out of the Blue by Alison Jay A book that eschews words for imagination-stimulating pictures: a storm-wrecked, seashore adventure between a girl and a boy. Outdoor Opposites by Brenda Williams An ebullient book in which children revel in opposites as they jump in a pond, enjoy a picnic or run with a kite, all with a rollicking band of animals in tow. Ladybug Girl and Bumblebee Boy &amp; Ladybug Girl and the Bug Squad by David Soman and Jacky Davis These books show a boy playing with not just one girl as an equal, but having a great time by mucking in with a group of them. The Boy Who Grew Flowers by Jen Wojtowicz A friendship between a quiet boy – shunned by schoolmates on account of his family, which includes rattlesnake tamers and shape-shifters – and a girl, which celebrates difference and kindness. Where the Bugaboo Lives by Sean Taylor An interactive adventure in which readers choose what happens every few pages. It features a big sister ingeniously and bravely guiding her little brother through a ghoul-strewn valley. The Penderwicks: A Summer Tale of Four Sisters, Two Rabbits and a Very Interesting Boy by Jeanne Birdsall Motherless sisters romp through an old-fashioned summer holiday, befriending a local boy whom they decide to save from being sent to military school.

As parliament goes back to work, the reality that we’re still lumbered with damaging Conservative rule, except now a more blundering version, is going to sink in, hard. So while this government limps on, botching Brexit, out of touch and out of ideas, what can Labour do to hasten its rivals’ demise? The party keeps rising in the polls. In the week following Theresa May’s assertion that she’d lead her party into the next election, Labour steamed ahead to 43% in one poll against 38% for the Conservatives. It seems that if there were a vote any time soon, Britain would boot the Tories out of office. In this context, Labour being in permanent campaign mode has a certain logic. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn still packs out rallies, as we saw in his cross-country summer tour culminating in Scotland. Momentum, the grassroots organisation of Corbyn supporters, is campaigning in the newly marginal seats of Conservative frontbenchers. Its rollout of campaign-skills training aims to increase canvassing numbers and make this a regular, rather than an election-only, occurrence. Such grassroots, door-to-door connection would keep reminding people both of Labour’s popular policies and of a viable, hope-filled alternative to the current hot mess of a government. Still, the worry is that in the face of five years of Tory rule, public enthusiasm for Labour will dissipate into resignation. That’s the default mode for many, after years of political exclusion and disillusionment. Which is why the opposition should now take every opportunity to exploit this government’s weakness. It isn’t just about thwarting bad policy – it’s a chance, each time, to get Labour’s left alternative back into public discussion. During the election campaign, the party broke Britain free of a political stranglehold, bringing popular leftwing policies back into circulation. One illustrative example that sticks in my mind is when Labour’s manifesto leaked and LBC radio presenter James O’Brien had a phone-in on renationalisation, saying that the depiction of this policy as a dirty word had long been an unchallenged narrative – one he’d routinely nodded along to, but which was now upturned. This sort of sea change happened across multiple issues – scrapping tuition fees, raising corporation tax, the provision of free school meals – policies that are hardly radical but that had been exiled from our political conversation. Now, Labour needs to get this fledgling political shift locked down, so all those dirty-word progressive policies are re-established as reasonable and urgently required. Luckily, the Conservatives are likely to help Labour here. Interest rates on student tuition fees are set to rise this autumn, while big chunks of the finance bill were shelved for this new parliamentary term – giving Labour a chance to strike from a position of policy strength over issues such as tax avoidance. Brexit is obviously another policy on which to nail Conservative mismanagement. Labour’s recent intervention on a transition deal for leaving the EU was a good start, providing a reasonable, credible alternative to the government’s hollow posturing, while offering Labour’s remain supporters hope there won’t be a disastrous Brexit, and reassuring leavers of a commitment to honour the referendum result. There’s more to come with the EU withdrawal bill, which Labour will likely try to vote down unless proposed amendments on the concentration of executive power, devolution and guaranteed rights and protections for citizens are incorporated. This may even gain traction among Conservative remain MPs, already furious with May for a multitude of reasons, including the suggestion that democratic scrutiny of this bill would be “treacherous”. It couldn’t hurt, in this context, if Labour continues to cement solid ties with European parties, or keeps meeting with EU officials, as Corbyn did so cordially with chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in July. Taken together, this could all work to convince the public that a Labour government would make more progress and secure better terms with the EU – something all but the most reckless Brexiteers want to see. As ever, Labour unity is key. There’s potential for a powerful alignment here, combining the parliamentary knowledge and skills of established MPs with the political credibility and currency of a newer left intake and a leadership that, after years spent agitating from the backbenches, knows how to be a thorn in the side of government. Together, such a formidable force could expose the failures of an imploding Tory government forensically and relentlessly, to the extent that this ailing party might start to wish it had lost the election after all. Which, as the latest polling suggests, would put the Conservatives in touch with the public mood on one issue, at least. • Rachel Shabi is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/10/neil-young-hitchhiker-lost-album-1976-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"Neil Young: Hitchhiker CD review – intimate return to a lost night in 1976","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/10/neil-young-hitchhiker-lost-album-1976-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/10/neil-young-hitchhiker-lost-album-1976-review","fields":{"headline":"Neil Young: Hitchhiker CD review – intimate return to a lost night in 1976","bodyText":"Recorded one evening in August 1976, Hitchhiker is one of Neil Young’s “lost” albums, capturing the Canadian at his most intimate – just him, slightly stoned, his acoustic guitar and the odd burst of harmonica.

Bus fares are not included. While some may not consider that to be an irresistible offer, the demand for tickets to the immersive theatre company Punchdrunk’s new production is expected to far outstrip the limited supply. Punchdrunk announced on Tuesday details of a “theatrical adventure”, a production it says is inspired by the remaining fragments of Aeschylus’s lost play Kabeiroi. There will be just 864 tickets in total – about 300 fewer than the Olivier theatre at the National can accommodate for a single performance. For anyone who does want a place, it will be pot luck. Punchdrunk said tickets would be available via a ballot, which opened at noon on Tuesday and will close on Sunday 10 September. They will cost £55 and come with a string of conditions. Applicants must have a companion as it is “a two-person experience” and would be unable to “participate in the experience” on their own. As well as lasting six hours and requiring audiences to stay on their feet for most of that time, Kabeiroi will start early in the afternoon and finish by 10pm, with ticketholders directed to multiple locations across London. Audience members are expected to bring a contactless payment card or a topped-up Oyster card to get from place to place. The show is for adults only and not suitable for women at any stage of pregnancy, people who are claustrophobic, or anyone of “a nervous disposition”. Details of what audiences can expect are being kept under wraps although the company has not been afraid to scare the living daylights out of people in previous productions. Its show It Felt Like a Kiss in 2009 had people running for their lives pursued by a masked maniac clutching a chainsaw. “The cant critical word for this kind of thing is ‘scary’,” wrote the Guardian’s Michael Billington at the time. “But what is the point of simply making people jump out of their skins?” Professional critics like Billington are not invited to Punchdrunk’s latest “as spaces are extremely limited”, although journalists of course will be able to enter the ballot. That resonates with the current three-week run of Tom Hiddleston’s Hamlet, a production which also allocated tickets after a lottery and chose not to invite critics. The show is raising money for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Mark Shenton, The Stage’s associate editor and chair of the Critics’ Circle, said he personally would not be shelling out £110 on a six-hour experience by a company which long ago “delighted me enough”. With the snubbing of critics appearing to become a trend, Shenton asked: “But where will it end? Will theatres like the Donmar, Almeida or National follow suit and expect critics to pay for shows that are certain to sell out anyway? “A new critical future beckons, but once this disruption takes hold, there’ll be no turning back. Critics are in imminent danger of becoming a thing of the past for the theatre of the future.” The show and its cloak and dagger nature will be music to the ears of Punchdrunk’s loyal fans, who have been waiting for a new production for some time. The company’s last big show was The Drowned Man: a Hollywood Fable in 2013, staged in a vast former sorting office in Paddington, London. Punchdrunk said it was “committed to developing new ways to engage with culture” – hence the two-person, six-hour, multiple location experience. The show, it said, was based on Aeschylus’s ancient Greek tragedy about the women of Lemnos, written between 499 and 456BC. The only inkling of what to expect is a quote: “But I do not treat you as an omen of my journey.” It has also sent journalists a photograph of the British Museum taken, apparently, through the bars of a fence. All successful ticket bidders will be informed on 13 September and invited to book a time slot on a first come, first served basis. • Kabeiroi runs in London from 26 September-5 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/10/boots-the-morning-after-pill-apology-bpas-price-women-contraception-lawyers","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T05:00:28Z","webTitle":"It's best to leave contraception to those who need it | Eva Wiseman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/10/boots-the-morning-after-pill-apology-bpas-price-women-contraception-lawyers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/10/boots-the-morning-after-pill-apology-bpas-price-women-contraception-lawyers","fields":{"headline":"Why it's best to leave contraception to those who need it","bodyText":"I am reeling, reeling, at this week’s extreme version of the soulless apology, where the other person, their chin held up awfully proudly, says: “I’m so sorry,” but then, “…if you were upset.” A crapology, if you will. That poisonous “if”. It stays bitter, fizzes on your tongue like last week’s hummus. The story began in July, when BPAS (the British Pregnancy Advisory Service) pointed out that after its successful campaign to reduce the vastly inflated price of the morning-after pill, of all the major high street chemists, Boots was the only one that refused to budge. While Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Superdrug dropped the price of Levonelle to £13.50, Boots kept it at £28.25, saying: “We would not want to be accused of incentivising inappropriate use, and provoking complaints, by significantly reducing the price of this product.” It had to be expensive it appeared to say, or, like a fly in soup, everyone would want one. So a collective “Woah there, Boots” echoed through the sex-havers, sex-wanters, sex-curious, through the people who until then had happily purchased a meal deal from their local paracetamol and crisps shop blind to the knowledge that it thought women didn’t have the capacity to control their own fertility. “Inappropriate use”? It slightly makes you wonder if every single person who works upstairs at Boots is a virgin. And not just in that old romantic “waiting for love” way. In the greasy defensive way. Like a person who was insulted by a crush at the age of 13 and who nurtured that insult, feeding it protein shakes, so it grew like armour over their body and meant they never trusted another person enough to open their top button let alone their heart, instead recasting everybody who was not them as an enemy to be defeated through YouTube comments and bitterness on buses. The issue, though, was that Boots was scared of “provoking complaints”, presumably from people who thought that if you can’t afford £28.25 then, girl, you deserve to get pregnant. So BPAS set up a widget thing on its website, where you could register your request for Boots to reconsider. For four days it included an email template with the names of five senior executives at Boots, and thousands of people used it. This seemed to work and Boots issued a formal apology for offending people with its moralising, and agreed to look into sourcing cheaper emergency contraception. In October it is expected to roll out an emergency hormonal contraception for £15.99. But, twist. At the beginning of August, it has emerged, BPAS received a legal letter from the law firm Schillings. Its client Boots claims the campaign has led to a “torrent of personal abuse” on social media, and wants its employees’ names removed. BPAS, it says, was responsible for the “facilitation and tacit encouragement of personal abuse” that “caused immense personal distress” to senior Boots staff. A GP explained, in one of the emails that BPAS published, that the increasing pressure on doctors meant it was “more important than ever that women and girls should have timely access to postcoital contraception… and your pricing strategy is a barrier to this.” Another woman described borrowing money for the morning-after pill at 17, saying the high cost is “extremely damaging, especially to victims of rape”, and another mused on how different her life would look today had she been unable to afford emergency contraception. That bitter taste. Over the table, a conciliatory handshake, down by the carpet a sharp kick to the shins. Should we ever expect a corporation, even one that markets tampons, to be anything but bullyish? It responded to its customers with what looked like dignity, seeing, perhaps, the threat of sales dropping as everyone went two doors down to Superdrug for their mascara. And yet, this final snarl seems to reveal a gracelessness that highlights the reality of these continuing battles. Instructing lawyers to complain about an independent charity that has been caring for women considering abortions for more than 50 years, a charity working at a time when women’s healthcare is being slashed and dismissed, is sort of (to use the legal terminology) a dick move.

The fallout saw Labour MP Darren Jones resign from an advisory board at the University of Bath over revelations about its vice-chancellor’s 11% pay rise. Last week, it culminated in a speech from Alistair Jarvis, the new chief executive of Universities UK, the representative body for vice-chancellors, in which he denounced critics of universities as people pushing “misinformation, muddled argument and even a little malicious intent”. With a fresh academic year looming, we sought expert advice for university leaders preparing to tackle whatever the new term throws at them. From facing media scrutiny to ensuring your institution isn’t funding climate change, here’s what the professionals recommend. How to deal with the press: ‘be ready for media scrutiny’ Media expert Sarah Dickinson, author and founder of media training consultancy Electric Airwaves Vice-chancellors are really in the hot seat at the moment, mainly because there’s been controversy about what they earn, so all vice-chancellors need to be as ready as they can for what I believe to be legitimate media scrutiny. When you come face-to-face with a journalist your brain forgets all the positive things you’ve been doing and the negative things come to the forefront. Always carry a mental suitcase of the positive things you have initiated at your university. For instance, it might be that through your work and that of your colleagues you have been able to establish a fund to build a new technology wing. Have the confidence to use the personal pronoun. It has much more resonance if anyone in a position of authority can say: “If you want to know personally what I think…”. That way, your arguments will come across much more passionately. Make sure you constantly update your views on current controversial issues, from why the finances of the Universities Superannuation Scheme have deteriorated, to historic statues such as Cecil Rhodes, to LGBT rights. As long as you follow these very basic rules, you should always be able to treat interviews as an opportunity, not a threat. How to dress well without costing the earth: ‘spend on bespoke’ Eco-fashion expert, journalist and TV presenter Lucy Siegle When people become conscious of being singled out as over-paid, the danger is they virtue signal by wearing low-cost fast fashion. I see this a lot with celebrities trying to say “I’m one of you”. It succeeds only in bolstering the false idea that fast fashion is in someway democratic. It’s not. It’s a destroyer of the environment and creates obscene wealth in terms of fast fashion moguls. The best thing well-remunerated people can do is spend outside of this system and make it count. I’m a big fan of bespoke garments, especially suiting in good fabrics – you can find out a lot about mills and production these days. We have a really healthy sustainable fashion ecosystem in the UK right now. For occasion wear, I think Kitty Ferreira is unbeatable. We also have a mainstream ethical hit on our hand through longstanding eco-shoe brand Po-Zu. I think the People Tree ethical collection with the V&amp;A is a winner for female vice-chancellors. Not everyone will feel comfortable increasing their fashion budget, but there are brands that address part of the puzzle. Ex-teacher Sarah Jerath established her own brand, Two For Joy, where you can find out exactly where the cost of the clothes is being distributed. Increasingly we are seeing a lot of UK students doing practical fashion courses and learning to cut and sew. Wouldn’t it be great if vice-chancellors could wear students’ creations? How to invest wisely: ‘use your power to avoid climate change’ Divestment expert Chris Saltmarsh, fossil free campaigns coordinator at People &amp; Planet Higher education institutions have committed to remove more than £80bn of investments out of oil, coal and gas companies globally. The UK higher education sector is leading the way, with institutions accounting for nearly half of over 100 universities worldwide that have made pledges. To date, a third of universities have made a fossil fuel divestment pledge of some kind. As the academic year resumes and vice-chancellors mull over how they can use their significant power to contribute to the challenge of avoiding catastrophic climate change, they can draw inspiration from this ever-growing divestment movement. For divestment to be effective, vice-chancellors must ensure three things. Firstly, their commitments must be made public to help build the movement against fossil fuel companies. Secondly, their commitments must be full – the divestment must encompass all fossil fuels and fossil fuel companies. Finally, their commitments must be time-bound so students and staff know when they plan to move their money by – usually within one to three years – and can hold them accountable. If a university has already made a divestment commitment, there is still a lot to be done. People &amp; Planet’s Divest Barclays campaign, for example, encourages universities to boycott Barclays until the bank stops financing fossil fuel projects, this could be by removing a Barclays branch from campus, switching the university’s bank account provider or excluding them from careers and recruitment fairs. How to nurture innovative thinking: ‘involve everybody’ Tech and education expert Anne-Marie Imafidon MBE, CEO of Stemettes, a social enterprise working to inspire young women into Stem roles Universities are typically set up along faculty or department lines. Students in those groups are kept within those groups. It’s important to create environments where people are able to talk across departments and disciplines in a way that leaves them rewarded for contributing to a higher-level discussion. When I was at university there were physical spaces for people to come together to work, enabling that cross-pollination of ideas. Even if they’re not permanent spaces, the action of bringing people together to share thoughts and ideas can be invaluable. Innovation comes from environments where groupthink is not allowed to flourish. Industry is a great driver for innovative thinking on campus. There’s talk among some of the university departments I’m involved with around tech hubs opening in or near universities, where you’re able to connect people – whether it’s PhD students or researchers – with industry, allowing those working at universities to experiment with their ideas. It’s important to involve everybody. Innovative ideas and new perspectives can come from anywhere. Universities must not fall into old habits of following traditional academic hierarchies. Whether it’s new academic staff or new students coming in, getting them involved can be invaluable because there will be things they are able to look at with fresh eyes.

Holidays are the stuff of illusion: the sun’s going to shine, but not too fiercely; everyone’s going to be kind and helpful and you won’t get cornered by the most boring woman on the tour who thinks you will be her closest buddy. Oh well: don’t worry – soon you’ll be back at home. The young My eldest granddaughter is about to begin a course studying in London, and she may come to stay with me. I didn’t know much when I was her age, but it didn’t matter then, as I was boarding with a family who had two handsome sons with whom I could fall harmlessly in love with, without ever a touch being exchanged. When I went to college, we girls were just young maidens straight from school, but all the men had done national service, many in the war, and they knew a thing or two which they were anxious to teach us. So, what might my experience from all those decades ago offer the younger generation? What can I tell girls of today, deluged by sex at every turn? It would be the same simple advice I was given: don’t have sex for the sake of it, hold out for something really exciting and important. What do you think?

But if you’re looking for resilient, easycare species just a bit more exciting than the boring old aspidistra or sansevieria, here are a few super-quirky alternatives. Ant plants are a group of bizarre species from southeast Asia that have adapted to grow on the branches of trees, baked by sun and lashed by monsoon winds. Beneath a neat crown of emerald leaves lies a massively swollen, bulb-like stem, covered in spikes in many species, like something straight out of The Flintstones. They get their name as in the wild their curious swollen stem, full of a honeycomb of winding passages and air pockets, provides a home for tropical fire ants. It’s a miraculous evolutionary strategy to help enlist an army of insect defenders to ward off pests – but don’t worry, UK ants won’t be tempted to set up home in them. All the plants need is a bright windowsill protected from freezing draughts and to dry out a little between waterings. Treat them like a cactus or succulent. Hydnophytum ‘Treasure’ and Myrmecodia ‘Adventure’ are varieties which perform well in indoor conditions in temperate climes. On the subject of succulents, Mother of Thousands, aka Kalanchoe daigremontiana, is real show-stopper. This prehistoric-looking plant from the deserts of Madagascar produces fleshy, grey-green, triangle-shaped leaves, splashed with tiger-like striations. A real beaut. But what makes it so fascinating to me are the rows of tiny baby plants that are produced by the hundreds, quite literally, along the edges of its leaves. These have evolved to fall off eventually, acting like self-sowing cuttings – meaning you will always have plenty to give away to your mates. The variety ‘Pink Butterflies’ produces little bright pink babies like lace around its silvery leaves and even rosy flowers in winter, just when you need them most. If your home isn’t all that sunny, the miracle of nature that is Biophytum sensitivum is a must have. Like a bonsai coconut palm just 10-15cm high, its canopy of ferny leaves held up on little pencil-thick trunks will close each night and even when touched, much like the sensitive, spectacular Mimosa pudica. They prefer filtered light and moist, yet well-drained conditions, similar to ferns. In tropical greenhouses these cute mini “palms” are so easy to grow they often become weeds, self-seeding everywhere. I grow mine in a dish filled with moss and gravel to make a tabletop “palm island”. I sourced all of these through the cool, houseplant-focused N1 Garden Centre in London, but you can also buy them online.

Age: 59. Appearance: No-nonsense. Who is she? She sounds sensible. Is she sorting out Brexit? Trump? North Korea? The plot of Top of the Lake: China Girl? None of these, alas. She is the vice-chancellor of Oxford University who made headlines for earning £410,000 a year (including pension, not including term-time rent-free accommodation in a Victorian villa owned by the university). Is that not what vice-chancellors of Oxford University should be earning? Well, this is very much the question. The salaries of senior academics are becoming increasingly controversial. Because there’s so little money left in the world unless you are one of the 10 billionaires who have it all? Sort of. Answer, on not more than two sides of A4. Read the question thoroughly before you begin. The professor has made the latest headlines by claiming that the controversy has been manufactured by the “mendacious media” and “tawdry politicians”, who reckon that senior pay has gone up since tuition fees came in. And has it? According to a pay survey by the University and College Union, the average VC’s pay is 6.5 times greater than their average staff member, and the former has increased in percentage terms far more than the latter over the past few years. What does the prof say? She says tuition fees have all gone to make up the shortfall in public subsidy for higher education. The UCU says much of them has. But not all? Not all. Is VC pay at all related to performance? I could fathom paying a premium for brilliance that sets his/her institution apart and attracts the best in all disciplines and so on. This was and is very much the concern of universities ministers Lord Adonis and Jo Johnson. But the professor points out that VCs range across a global marketplace and that she is not paid very much compared with what a position in the US would offer her. I am not overly moved by this argument. Then you probably won’t be thoroughly persuaded by her follow-up contention that although her pay was high compared with that of less senior staff, “compared to a footballer or a banker, it looks very different”. I am emphatically not. No, me neither. Do say: “Lay not up for yourself treasures upon earth.” Don’t say: “That’s so not Oxford’s motto.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/11/turks-detained-encrypted-bylock-messaging-app-human-rights-breached","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T11:40:31Z","webTitle":"Turks detained for using encrypted app 'had human rights breached'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/turks-detained-encrypted-bylock-messaging-app-human-rights-breached","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/11/turks-detained-encrypted-bylock-messaging-app-human-rights-breached","fields":{"headline":"Turks detained for using encrypted app 'had human rights breached'","bodyText":"Tens of thousands of Turkish citizens detained or dismissed from their jobs on the basis of downloading an encrypted messaging app have had their human rights breached, a legal opinion published in London has found.The study, commissioned by opponents of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, argues that the arrest of 75,000 suspects primarily because they downloaded the ByLock app is arbitrary and illegal. It reflects growing concern about the legality of the Turkish government’s crackdown in the aftermath of last year’s failed coup. The government says those detained or dismissed have links to a movement led by the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the US and has been accused of orchestrating the attempted uprising. Gülen has denied any involvement. The legal opinion was commissioned by a pro-Gülen organisation based in Europe. The two British lawyers involved, William Clegg QC and Simon Baker, are experienced barristers. The report examines transcripts of recent trials of alleged Gülenists in Turkey as well as Turkish intelligence reports on ByLock. It concludes that the cases presented so far breach the European convention on human rights, which Turkey is signed up to. “The evidence that the [ByLock] app was used exclusively by those who were members or supporters of the Gülen movement [is] utterly unconvincing and unsupported by any evidence,” the two barristers say. “There is a great deal of evidence ... which demonstrates that the app was widely available and used in many different countries, some of which had no links to Turkey.” The detention of people on this basis is “arbitrary and in breach of article 5” of the European convention on human rights, which guarantees the right to liberty, the report says. The opinion says ByLock was available to everyone, it had been downloaded around the world and was in the top 500 apps in 41 separate countries. Other “compelling evidence” is required to justify the mass arrests, it said. In a separate commissioned report, Thomas Moore, a British computer forensics expert, says ByLock was available to download free of charge on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. “It was downloaded over 600,000 times between April 2014 and April 2016 by users all over the world,” Moore says. “It is, in my opinion, therefore nonsensical to suggest that its availability was restricted to a particular group of people.” Moore draws attention to a report by MIT, the Turkish intelligence service that had gained access to ByLock communications. “There is no suggestion in the MIT report that downloads were restricted to a territory or jurisdiction.” Other secure communication services, such as Telegram, have been exploited because of their secure encryptions. “There is compelling evidence to show that Telegram has been used by Isis as a secure communication tool and yet there is no move by law enforcement authorities to detain every user of the service,” Moore says. None of the cases tried in Turkey have yet been appealed to the European court of human rights, but some are expected to reach Strasbourg eventually. Those detained have included lawyers, civil servants, judges, army officers, journalists and authors. Taner Kiliç, the head of Amnesty International in Turkey, was charged in June with membership of a terrorist organisation and remanded in custody. Amnesty said of his detention: “The only claim presented by the authorities purportedly linking Taner Kiliç to the Gülen movement is that Bylock, a secure mobile messaging application that the authorities say was used by members of the ‘Fethullahist terrorist organisation’, was discovered to have been on his phone in August 2014. “No evidence has been presented to substantiate this claim, and Taner Kiliç denies ever having downloaded or used Bylock, or even having heard of it, until its alleged use was widely publicised in connection with recent detentions and prosecutions.” The Turkish embassy in London did not give a response to requests for comment on the legal opinion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/05/deerhoof-review-village-underground-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T12:44:21Z","webTitle":"Deerhoof review – playtime insurrection by powerpop punks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/05/deerhoof-review-village-underground-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/05/deerhoof-review-village-underground-london","fields":{"headline":"Deerhoof review – playtime insurrection by powerpop punks","bodyText":"Had you heard nothing of Deerhoof but their lovely new album, you might struggle to recognise the band who recorded it as the one on this stage. Mountain Moves is an opalescent thing, a series of delicately formed avant-pop soap bubbles, more than half of which feature guest vocalists – Juana Molina and Laetitia Sadier among them. It is quite unlike its predecessors. But then you could say the same of many of those 13 earlier records, too. Back to their core quartet, and with all vocals returned to the care of bassist Satomi Matsuzaki – who joined the band within days of arriving in San Francisco from Japan in 1995 – Deerhoof are their more familiar, unruly selves. Their origins lie in punkish experimentalism; live, they veer closer to powerpop, with its chunky riffs and sugary tunes. But it’s a Heath Robinson kind of powerpop; most of their music is so irregularly constructed that any resemblance to existing genres may be accidental. Deerhoof look the way they sound: improbable, and charming. Guitarist John Dieterich and drummer Greg Saunier (the originator of intermittent, elliptical and very funny monologues) make indie-rock bookends for the tiny Matsuzaki, who when freed from her bass, dances with the instinctive, elementary verve of an unobserved child; and on quasi-lead guitar, the towering Ed Rodriguez is an aquamarine rock’n’roll Jesus in translucent tasselled sleeves. They clatter, scrawl and squiggle through their back catalogue as if racing one another to the end of each number. I recognise only three of the new songs, and each one is a joy. Con Sordino kicks in like a cover of the Police’s Roxanne and turns out to be far more refreshing than that. I Will Spite Survive fizzes and sparkles; Come Down Here and Say That is transformed from its dreamy studio version into scratchy, choppy funk-rock. Their concision is what separates them from, say, Primus. They are fun and they are frustrating. Nothing discordant lasts long enough to get tiresome, which it otherwise might. Melodies, for which they have a flair, scuttle past like mice making a break for the skirting board past outstretched claws. Playfulness is a conscious, insurrectionist act for them, the way it was for the dadaists or Paul Klee. They combine an absolute refusal to be serious about what they do with absolute commitment and sincerity in the doing of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/05/cryptocurrency-boom-stalls-as-regulators-focus-on-icos","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T11:21:40Z","webTitle":"Cryptocurrency boom stalls as regulators focus on ICOs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/05/cryptocurrency-boom-stalls-as-regulators-focus-on-icos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/05/cryptocurrency-boom-stalls-as-regulators-focus-on-icos","fields":{"headline":"Cryptocurrency boom stalls as regulators focus on ICOs","bodyText":"The latest cryptocurrency boom is beginning to stall as regulators worldwide turn their attention to the “initial coin offerings”, which have driven a precipitous rise in the sector’s market value reaching a high of $177bn (£136bn). The total value of the hundreds of tracked cryptocurrencies has fallen by more than 18% to $145bn since Friday’s high, according to analytics site CoinMarketCap. The collapse seems to have been triggered by a ruling from the Chinese central bank that declared it illegal to raise money through launching new cryptocurrencies. An initial coin offering (ICO) is a relatively recent innovation for cryptocurrency developers, and involves selling a number of cryptographic tokens to investors at the launch of the project. These tokens can represent almost anything, from another attempt to make a Bitcoin analogue to exclusive access to an app or service. They have been responsible for some big funding rounds: adblocking browser Braveraised $35m for its ICO, while an ICO for service designed to help ICOs raised more than $150m. ICOs have even become popular enough for celebrities including Floyd Mayweather and Paris Hilton to jump on board. The hotel heiress has actually been involved in the area for more than a year, having met with the COO of prominent blockchain firm Ethereum in 2016. Since the concept was first mooted, however, there have been concerns over its legality, with experts warning that selling a cryptographic token which entitles the holder to a share of profits in a business could be a violation of financial regulations. Now, the People’s Bank of China has confirmed just that. Individuals and organisations that have completed ICO fund raising should make arrangements to return funds, according to a joint statement from the bank, China’s securities and banking regulators, and several other government departments. Some experts still think the sector has hope. Zennon Kapron, director of the Shanghai-based financial technology consultancy Kapronasia, said he suspected regulators were putting the brakes on ICOs in order to better understand the phenomenon, but could ease off in the future. “Regulators globally are struggling to understand what ICOs are, what the risks are, and how to ring-fence and regulate them,” he said. “China, in many ways, is no different than the US or Singapore in saying: ‘OK, we need to push back on these for now until we figure out how to deal with them’. I think it will be slightly a temporary measure.” The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued its own ruling in July. While not as wide-ranging as the Chinese statement, it leaned in the same direction. The agency said: “Depending on the facts and circumstances, the offering may involve the offer and sale of securities. “If that is the case, the offer and sale of virtual coins or tokens must itself be registered with the SEC, or be performed pursuant to an exemption from registration.” The SEC’s statement was prompted by the conclusion of its investigation into the biggest ICO failure to date, a 2016 experiment called the DAO which ended up losing millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies due to a bug in its software. The SEC’s stance has also had a chilling effect on the creation of new ICOs in the US. At least two planned offerings have been put on hold as a result of the document. One, Harbour, said it was a pre-emptive action based on the project’s conclusion “that there is just too much uncertainty within our current model to forge ahead without some careful assessment and perhaps revision”. Another, Protostarr, was cancelled after its chief executive was investigated by the SEC. Those in the cryptocurrency sector believe a short period of overregulation will eventually be reversed as the merits of the technology become clear. “The initial coin offering is a new business model leveraging blockchain technology and it will remain,” said Oliver Bussman, of the Switzerland-based Crypto Valley Association. “This is not the end of the ICO – absolutely not.” While some ICOs are unambiguously analogous to stocks and shares, many, such as those which offer resellable access to an application to the holders, are more novel, and may survive regulation unscathed.

It’s the highlight of my week,” says 89-year-old Fay Garcia, while bouncing baby Sasha on her knee. “It’s like being reborn.” Garcia never had children but is one of the regulars at the baby and toddler group. It’s been running since January in preparation for the new nursery, which opened this week. The Apples and Honey Nightingale nursery, run by founder Judith Ish-Horowicz, is the first of its kind in the UK. The concept of intergenerational care began in 1976 when a nursery school and a care home were combined in Tokyo. Since then, there have been successful schemes across Europe, Australia and the US. In Singapore, the government has committed £1.7bn to initiatives to improve ageing in the country, including 10 new intergenerational housing developments. The UK is still catching up with the idea, says Stephen Burke, director of United for All Ages. For seven years, the development agency has worked with a range of organisations – including local authorities, housing providers, care homes and community centres – to encourage them to think more broadly about opportunities for combining care. Interest is growing. Burke expects the UK’s first housing development for students and older residents (as seen in the Netherlands) to launch soon, and representatives from Torbay council in Devon will travel to the US this autumn to see examples of best practice. Nurseries are run near to care homes in cities such as Chichester and Edinburgh, but Apples and Honey is the first to run a nursery within a care home itself, with daily joint activities for the children and residents including exercising, reading, cooking and eating meals. “[It’s] about bringing people together,” says Burke. “By getting people talking to each other, you break down some of the barriers and challenge some of the stereotypes [particularly around ageism, dementia and other conditions affecting older people]. We see this having benefits for all generations.” Ish-Horowicz came up with the idea many years ago after bringing children from her first nursery in Wimbledon to visit Nightingale House each term. The new nursery, housed in the care home’s refurbished maintenance block, has 30 places for two- to four-year-olds and a number of spots reserved for the children of care home staff. “Everyone I’ve spoken to loves the idea,” says Ish-Horowicz. The Ofsted registration process went smoothly, although there were issues finding insurance: “We had to explain to them that we weren’t going to leave the children in the care of the residents (or the other way around), and they didn’t all need to be DBS checked,” she says. Ish-Horowicz’s proposal came when the home was reassessing its own approach to care, says Simon Pedzisi, director of care services at Nightingale House, who had consulted students of medicine, occupational therapy and nursing for new ideas. “Our average age on admission is 90, so we have to think in an innovative way about activities,” says Pedzisi. “[Care] has to be more meaningful, deeper and measurable. It’s about social interaction because that’s what older people really [need].” When care for older people faces staff shortages, funding cuts and estimates that another 71,000 care home places will be needed by 2025, it’s understandable that innovation is in short supply. But Pedzisi insists that any extra money needed to support the nursery will be well spent. There can be economic benefits for care homes considering sharing their sites, says Burke, including gaining additional rent and sharing administrative, ground maintenance and catering costs. Co-location can also improve recruitment and retention of staff, who take advantage of flexible on-site childcare or find satisfaction in the increased variety in their roles. The health benefits of alleviating residents’ social isolation may also lead to savings elsewhere. “If people are well stimulated and live meaningful lives, they’re going to eat well. They’re then at less risk of dehydration and falling, therefore you’ll lower the risk of hospital admission,” says Pedzisi. Increased social interaction is linked to a reduced risk of disease in elderly people, which was recently highlighted in Channel 4’s Old People’s Homes for 4 Year Olds documentary. Eleven residents of Bristol-based St Monica Trust were found to have improved moods, mobility and memory after spending six weeks with children. The trust has since committed to adding a full-time nursery to one of its residential care homes, playgrounds at a number of other sites, and is developing a new retirement village. “We’ve always done intergenerational activities, but we wanted evidence so we could roll out wider programmes,” says David Williams, the trust’s chief executive. “It has created a buzz and a feeling that we can do things differently. It’s also had an impact on our staff. If you’re working in an organisation you feel is [making a difference], you want to be part of that innovation.” As Apples and Honey Nightingale welcomes its first class of nursery children, Ish-Horowicz is optimistic for the future of intergenerational care. “There’s such a positive feel around this; you know it’s going to work,” she says. “It’s about learning through generations and caring about each other. This kind of thing can change society and the community.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities direct to your inbox.

But, after one look at the garish mess of the Nova building in London, they might be more likely to turn around and get straight back on the train. The £380m complex, which lurches outside the station in its bright red costume like a drunken member of the Queen’s Guard, has been crowned winner of the Carbuncle Cup for the UK’s ugliest building by Building Design magazine. It beat some strong competition, from the new entrance to Preston station, student housing in Portsmouth and the first phase of Battersea power station’s residential development, among other lurid crimes against the built environment. Described by judges as “one of the worst office developments central London has ever seen”, and one that “sets a new benchmark for dystopian dysfunction”, the Nova building was especially criticised for “the bright red prows that adorn various points of the exterior like the inflamed protruding breasts of demented preening cockerels”. Designed by serial offenders PLP Architecture, which are building the biggest (and quite possibly ugliest) office tower the City of London has ever seen at 22 Bishopsgate, it is certainly a worthy winner. Conceived in the mid-2000s, it follows what was then the vogue for faceted glass office buildings modelled as faintly “crystalline” objects, a trend which has seen London scattered with many stunted offspring of the Shard. Nova’s developer, Land Securities, already built one of these angular lumps at the other end of Victoria Street in 2013; now it has a matching bookend, only cranked up several notches on the look-at-me scale. Emerging from Victoria station, visitors are now greeted with a sheer cliff face of blood red glass plunging down 18 storeys from a pointed peak, crisscrossed with aluminium bracing, giving it the look of a particularly obnoxious 90-metre argyle sweater. A screen of aluminium fins runs around the side of this great red wedge and across the neighbouring blocks, cut with rippled profiles to reveal another shimmering argyle pattern as you approach. The red colour, said PLP president Lee Polisano, “is a reference to Victoria being an important transport interchange, so we chose a colour that’s synonymous with transport in London”. The facets and the cross-bracing, meanwhile, are a vain attempt to soften the impact of the great hulk. “Because the building is quite so big, you’re always faced with the enormous scale of these surfaces you have to deal with,” said Polisano. “We added these patterns to lighten the effect on your eye, to break up the surfaces and create more of a decorative experience.” The triangular theme continues at ground level, where the aluminium fins form a series of serrated openings, like the fearsome gnashers of a cartoon animal trap, waiting to chomp all who enter. One of the blocks is home to the National Cyber Security Centre, so the defensive feeling is at least fitting. The origins of this mangled red mountain can be found in the tortured planning history, which reads as an all-too familiar tale of the developer applying with a vastly oversized scheme, then chopping it down in a battle of attrition with the planners until a wretched compromise is reached. When the project was granted approval in 2009, it was the biggest consent that Westminster council had ever awarded – but it started off even bigger. Two years earlier, Land Securities had proposed a scheme of three towers of up to 40 storeys, which would have loomed over views of Buckingham Palace and was duly refused by the council. The ambition was cut down (and with it went the “viability” of a plan to overhaul the transport interchange) and the facets, tilts and inclined planes appeared, in the go-to architectural shorthand for paying lip service to protected views. Cabe, a former national design watchdog, warned that the narrow canyons formed by the gaps between the blocks would result in “spaces that are unpleasant to live and work in”, which has indeed turned out to be the case. To the immediate west of the two PLP-designed blocks stands an equally hefty residential tanker of 170 luxury flats, designed by Scottish modernists Benson &amp; Forsyth, as an overwrought version of Le Corbusier’s Unité d’habitation. It bristles with white stone fins and panels in all manner of different proportions, apparently derived from a close reading of the neighbouring Belgravia context. But the result is as much of an eyeful as the cross-gartered red monster next door. “Our building has to speak two languages,” said Gordon Benson. “Latin towards Belgravia, and Samuel Beckett to the other side.” He sounded sincere and, unlike Polisano, has some understanding of the complex context. But the result is the mangled gobbledygook you might expect of a Latin-Beckett fusion, as if far too many influences have been at play. Studio flats start at £720,000, three-beds are £7.2m, while the small “affordable” housing component has been provided off-site. The Carbuncle Cup was started by Building Design in 2006 as a way to draw attention to the bad architecture that blights our towns and cities. Past winners have included Liverpool’s ferry terminal, the renovation of the Cutty Sark and an apartment block incorporating a Tesco’s in Woolwich, south-east London. LandSec, as the developer has now been rebranded, appeared sanguine about winning this year’s prize. “It’s a matter of taste,” said retail director David Atcherley-Symes. “And the weirdness of living in a space looking straight into an office building seems to be OK with buyers.” A better answer might have been that the ignoble gong actually adds value. The so-called Walkie Talkie – also a product of LandSec’s bloated stable and winner of the cup in 2015 – was recently sold for the record-breaking price of £1.3bn, making a 167% profit. • This article was amended on 6 September 2017 to remove a reference to the build quality of the Nova"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/05/django-bates-saluting-sgt-pepper-review-beatles-ronnie-scotts","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T15:04:52Z","webTitle":"Django Bates: Saluting Sgt Pepper review – jazz maverick's winning Beatles tribute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/05/django-bates-saluting-sgt-pepper-review-beatles-ronnie-scotts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/05/django-bates-saluting-sgt-pepper-review-beatles-ronnie-scotts","fields":{"headline":"Django Bates: Saluting Sgt Pepper review – jazz maverick's winning Beatles tribute","bodyText":"Django Bates doesn’t play other people’s music often, but when he does, resemblances to the originals can be opaque. The unruly fiftysomething jazz composer has battered New York, New York into a free-jazz thrash, for instance, and interpreted Billie Holiday’s classic Solitude on a pub piano with two spoons and a bunch of keys hanging under the lid. But remaking the quixotic 1967 Beatles classic Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band has turned him almost respectful, to judge by his Saluting Sgt Pepper album, and the first of 12 shows he and a crack German band are performing at Ronnie Scott’s this week. Bates’ Sgt Pepper tribute with the Frankfurt Radio Big Band features skilful Copenhagen vocal trio Eggs Laid By Tigers closely mimicking Beatles’ harmonies, even if terse saxophone improv and huffing trombones constantly swoop and squall around them. A tough score and a short rehearsal made the band tentative at first, and balancing the creative tension between the faithfulness of the vocals and the typical dissonances of Bates’ harmonies was elusive early on. Perhaps mindful of the late show to come, the leader also pushed quickly through the opening songs when the band might usefully have been able to stretch out more – but the groove settled down and lead vocalist Martin Ullits Dahl grew in confidence on a vivid account of Fixing a Hole, pursued by seesawing sax and brass hooks and Stuart Hall’s penetrating guitar lines. Dahl and the backing singers coaxed an evocative warmth from She’s Leaving Home, and the versatile Hall’s microtonal sound on violin, the disembodied sonorities of the vocals over a tabla throb and a squirming postbop soprano sax break brought a powerful reimagining of the ethereal Within You Without You. Bates set a New Orleans trad-jam loose around When I’m 64, and an exhilaratingly hard-rocking band riff took off under Lovely Rita – letting an extended rhythm-stretching vamp run free in a loose-limbed manner that’s likely to surface a lot more as the week runs on. By the closing title-song reprise, the band was flying and Bates grinning and gesticulating at the keyboards. A long Beatles-celebrating coda that took in Penny Lane (with a perfectly nailed account of the original’s piccolo trumpet solo), Strawberry Fields and an audience-chanting All You Need Is Love proclaimed pretty loudly that the maverick music-lover from Beckenham has another quirky winner on his hands. • At Ronnie Scott’s, London, until 9 September.

All told, Australia lost 7-for-124. It never looked like happening when Warner and Handscomb kept on keeping on, but they they got bogged down when Warner reached 99, the pressure more than anything else bringing Handscomb’s run out on 82. Nevertheless, Warner kept doing as he does. 20 Tests in 66 matches - no big deal. But the second new ball was enough to prompt an error from him on 123, parrying Mustafizur around the corner, well taken by Imrul. From 298-for-3, a collapse of 5-for-66 either side of tea was very familiar. Cartwright dazzled for 18, but edged on the cusp of tea. Wade missed one coming back into his pads, reviewing poorly. Maxwell, who battled, did likewise when inside edging on 38. Cummins was also lbw, a wonderful review from Bangladesh when he shouldered arms to a ball ptching well outside the off-stump. Agar showed suitably resistance, but was the last to fall on the day, bowled through the gate by Shakib, who was also responsible for the aforementioned Handscomb run out. And with that bad luck stopped play with O’Keefe and Lyon left. In short, in a truncated day this game has been turned on its head. Thanks for your company on the OBO throughout the course of it. We’ll be back tomorrow with Sam Perry on the tools for the morning session. Until then, bye for now from Chittagong. Long consultation between the umpires before the new over, and they decide to take the players off. With 13 overs notionally remaining, very likely this will be followed by an official call to pull stumps. Will stand by for that. 118th over: Australia 377-9 (O’Keefe 8, Lyon 0) Interesting to see how they approach this. Lyon by far the more aggressive of the two, and swept really well in Dhakja in the fourth innings chase. A case for letting him at it? They’ll be bowling tonight one way or another. O’Keefe does the bulk of the work this over though, taking Mehedi down the ground for one to the fifth ball. Lyon pushes the final ball to midwicket for no run, so O’Keefe it’ll be again. “Evening Adam.” Hi Phil Withall. “Is this the moment that the Maxwell/Wade era finally comes to an end? They seem to have been given more chances than there are in a monopoly set. I know it’s a radical idea but maybe the selectors might try and cast their net a little wider and not stick with the friends of friends policy they seem to have been using of late.” I think it is fair to assume that both had a lot to play for today, and both are now in bigger trouble than when the innings began. Some big calls to make before Brisbane for selectors, no matter how they frame up their market. Shakib through the gate! The one spinners dream of. Superb bowling to end the over, clipping the top of middle stump. Fully earned after doing him with the first ball as well, Soumya dropping another catch at first slip. But it doesn’t matter in the end. A brilliant day for the home side. One to get. 117th over: Australia 376-9 (O’Keefe 7, Lyon 0) 116th over: Australia 372-8 (Agar 21, O’Keefe 4) Taijul back into the attack from the southern end, which seems a sensible call with Mustafizur putting in a decent shift today. Agar pops him down to long-on early in the over, O’Keefe doing the rest. Has to use his feet a bit more this time. 115th over: Australia 371-8 (Agar 20, O’Keefe 4) First look Agar has had a Mehedi, I think. He’s watching until he sees a fuller one, plucking a single down the ground. O’Keefe does enough to ensure it’ll be Agar keeping the strike. “Got enough now surely?” tweets Charlie Reynolds at me. It is a reference to Shane Warne always encouraging teams on commentary to declare prematurely. The man really doesn’t like working five days. “Get em in and have a bowl,” he adds. Well, if they are nine down with half an hour to go you might see Smudger get ~funky~ and let Cummins at them for a couple. 114th over: Australia 370-8 (Agar 19, O’Keefe 4) Mustafizur gets his wish when Agar grabs a single when mid-off misfields. O’Keefe plays and misses first up. That’ll get the fast bowler excited. He keeps on keeping on though, pumping a ball down the ground for a boundary. Way to ruin my strike-rate talking point, SOK. At one stage in India it got down to 14, which is the lowest on record. Noting that balls faced in Tests were only kept properly and thoroughly since 1980. Still, nice to have a record to your name. Carl Rackemann was right up there (down there?) in that list as well, for his Brisbane Ashes vigil in 1990-91. 113th over: Australia 365-8 (Agar 18, O’Keefe 0) O’Keefe taking Mehedi. And doing it fine, forward reflexively. Another maiden. SOK’s strike rate is less than 19 in Tests, so we’re getting what you should expect.Lights are on here. 112th over: Australia 365-8 (Agar 18, O’Keefe 0) Mustafizur can’t get a look at O’Keefe as Agar is doing a good enough job keeping him out. Won’t have many more in him, the humidity as it is. Still getting a decent amount of movement back into Agar. Shakes it up by going around the wicket to finish, but met with a straight bat at the other end. Really good batting from the West Australian. This is the best, by the way. Nasir Hossain’s antics when the Cummins decision was overturned. He’s definitely going to get whacked for it, and fined, but doesn’t seem the sort to care on the available evidence of, well, this. 111th over: Australia 365-8 (Agar 18, O’Keefe 0) Another long drinks break. Humid out there. Mehedi giving O’Keefe his first look. To think it was only this time last week that he was on the plane here. Nothing wrong with the approach here, getting forward throughout the over. Maiden. 110th over: Australia 365-8 (Agar 18, O’Keefe 0) Mustafizur given another go. But I suspect this is in order to have him get a go at SOK rather than Agar, who is handling him easily so far. Straight bat this time around, until the bouncer comes, which he ducks. Wide signalled. They’ll take whatever they can get at this point, the wind very much at Bangladesh’s back. Still 22 overs left today (including this one), so we’re going to be using the extra half an hour. Agar back to defending, then leaving. And it is drinks. Huge hour for Bangladesh, who ripped three more wickets out in a hurry. They have 6-for-111 today. But need to finish the job. All going wrong for Australia in the third umpire booth. Cummins has shouldered arms to a ball that pitched a long, long way outside off-stump. But keeping a fraction lower, and turning an awful lot, DRS shows it is crashing into off-stump! Hossain has stood next to Umpire Llong to immitate the ‘change of decision/out’ signals. Quite amusing really, but I suspect he’ll be having his match fee docked. Australia in strife. 109th over: Australia 364-8 (Agar 18, O’Keefe 0) HAS CUMMINS BEEN DONE LBW? Another review! From Bangladesh this time. Shouldering arms. 108th over: Australia 359-7 (Agar 17, Cummins 0) Agar not bothered by the pressure, pulling with ease through mid-on. Back to back fours for him to get going. I neglected to mention in the previous post that Agar is also, indeed, loveable. These are the golden children (as it were) of this Australian side. Just as it was in Dhaka, they have ample to do with their secondary discipline here. Boom! He goes again when Mustafizur drops short, crunching through cover. And four more (!) when the quick misses his yorker, the left-hander getting down to it in time for a nicely tickled boundary. Three boundaries in the over, Agar racing to 17, retaining the strike with another little flick. Australia move beuond 350 and the lead 50 as well through the course of the very productive set. 107th over: Australia 346-7 (Agar 4, Cummins 0) Pat Cummins, the big loveable lad, to the middle. He’s leaving and defending the second half of Mehedi’s over. A bit of confusion up here (without television at this stage) whether that was a straightforward batsman review or if Gould sent it upstairs himself to see if it carried. If the former, it is a shocker, as that was a big inside edge from Maxwell. No doubt about that one, big inside edge onto the bad, goes behind Maxwell but the ‘keeper remains balanced and comes forward to complete the low catch. Just at the stage of his 98-ball stay that the Australian no. 5 looked in some control as well. Two wickets, no runs. The lead still 41. Game on. IS MAXWELL CAUGHT IN CLOSE? Review to find out! 106th over: Australia 346-6 (Maxwell 38, Agar 4) Credit again to Mushfiqur. The third time he’s made a chance in this innings that has immediately brought a wicket. Some questionable decision making from the skipper later yesterday, but he’s on the ball here. Agar the new man. He gets off the mark to the final ball, lovely way to do it to with a drive through cover. First time I’ll mention this: Australia lead by 41. No inside edge, three red lights, he’s gone! The most assured Wade has looked at the crease on tour, but the innings is over before it really gets going. Mustafizur is the man, brought back into the attack with his left arm seam and able to bring one back from over the wicket, beating the Australian on the inside edge. Not overstating it to say that could very well be his final Test innings. That’s a long trudge off. Poor fella. IS WADE LBW THIS TIME? Mustafizur thinks so! Umpire Gould agrees. Wade reviews. Big moment in the context of his career. 105th over: Australia 341-5 (Maxwell 37, Wade 8) Maxwell again off strike first ball. A sound plan. Through cover this time. Wade in good shape defending. He’s not done a lot, if anything, wrong since his arrival. I share Todd’s below view. 104th over: Australia 340-5 (Maxwell 36, Wade 8) Shakib to the Show. He’s able to work him for one to begin, to the onside. Wade does likewise after coming down the track. Maxwell picks out the cover sweeper later in the set. Accumulating nicely. 103rd over: Australia 337-5 (Maxwell 34, Wade 7) Before the touch-and-go call from upstairs, Wade played a beautiful cut shot from the balls of his feet past point, to break up the couple of maidens. Keen to see if that reviewed delivery was going to hit the stumps, but yet to see on the telly. Certainly hit in line. Might have done too much. Speaking of umpiring... NOT OUT! But not before Umpire Llong made everyone in the stadium think he was when reaching for his hat! Ball-tracker is irrelevant after it shows Wade is more than three metres down the track when contact was made. Saved by dancing. Not a bad name for a nightclub. IS WADE LEG BEFORE? Review to find out! 102nd over: Australia 333-5 (Maxwell 34, Wade 3) A lot of enthusiasm in the crowd, but hard to tell what for? Not exactly the ‘get boozed / to the Mexican Wave’ types in this part of the world. Maxwell looking the part on the front foot now, and then able to get back quickly enough when the quicker one arrives from Shakib. Back to back maidens from the frontline spinners. 101st over: Australia 333-5 (Maxwell 34, Wade 3) Mehedi has won his accuracy back either side of tea, Wade brought forward time and again. He’s up to the task. Maiden. 100th over: Australia 333-5 (Maxwell 34, Wade 3) Such an important period for Bangladesh. They won the first session, but they really need to win both in order to apply maximum pressure on Australia at the back end of this Test. Can’t allow themselves to be 100+ in the hole. Maxwell again looking sturdy before taking Shakib down the ground. Wade sweeps one to keep the strike. 99th over: Australia 331-5 (Maxwell 33, Wade 2) Maxwell relaxed defending Mehedi throughout, sweeping one to finish it, keeping the strike. 98th over: Australia 330-5 (Maxwell 32, Wade 2) The Nossain attempt lasts an over, Shakib straight back into it. But he gives away a run to begin in identical fashion to yesterday, attempting to knock a ball back onto the non-striker stumps. Not sure it has quite come to that for the hosts. Wade looking to score from the outset here, one to midwicket. Nearly a mix-up between the wickets, but Maxwell gets back to his ground before any risk of damage. He gets the desired run next ball, into midwicket. 97th over: Australia 327-5 (Maxwell 30, Wade 1) Mehedi took the wicket on the cusp of tea, and continues from the northern end. Wade the man who is on strike. It’s a big day for Maxwell, but bigger for the gloveman. He did almost everything right when ‘keeping, but that’ll be forgotten quickly if he can’t make badly needed runs here. He’s away with a single to midwicket. Maxwell, sticking with the baggy green, into the 30s with a tuck behind the umpire. Nice straight bat from Wade to end the over. 96th over: Australia 325-5 (Maxwell 29, Wade 0) Hossain first over after the break. He was handy with the old ball, pinning Warner down on 99 for a lot longer than was comfortable. He’s right on the money with his off-breaks to Maxwell. Oh, typed too soon: long-hop that Maxwell could hit anywhere he wants. Decides on the rope at extra cover. From the Smith/Warner batting coach, Trent Woodhill. Warner spoke a lot about this after his Dhaka ton. Defending by attacking. Last ball before tea! Mehedi gets the outside edge of Cartwright who was looking so good, and lands safely in the hands of Soumya. Not much more to it than that, he was lunging forward and it didn’t spin back towards end. And that is that. Tea it is as well. The 130 minute session brought three wickets for Bangladesh, Australia adding only 68. So the hosts will take that, even if they are going to also carry with them a first innings deficit. They do have a chance to get in at Australia’s fragile lower order, though. Big moments for Matthew Wade as he prepares to walk out. Earlier, Handscomb was the first to go. He was on 82 when backing up too far in order to get Warner from 99 to 100, caught short by Shakib with a blistering collect-and-throw from midwicket. Warner spent 15 balls one short of his 20th run, but got there with a cover drive. A fantastic innings for the patience required, by far his slowest in the baggy green, taking 209 balls. He went up a gear of two after that, but fell not long after the second new ball was taken, parrying a Mustafizur short ball around the corner, taken on the juggle by Imrul Kayes. Plenty more to be said about that hand later, his second hundred on the trot coming in over six hours at the crease. Maxwell is still at tea but for a host of reasons he’s lucky to be. No direct chances, but playing with fire throughout. Even if he did slowly find his way towards the break. Cartwright looked assured from the get go, his aforementioned dismissal completely against the flow of play. To tea, with Australia 16 ahead and five wickets in hand. Back with you after I’ve had a quick drink myself. Speak shortly. 94th over: Australia 318-4 (Maxwell 24, Cartwright 16) Bec goes BOOM! His first six in Test cricket, and I suspect the first of many. It’s a wonderful strike, coming down to Taijul who is over the wicket, gets just short of the pitch and goes through with the shot, lofting over midwicket going all the way! Wow. What timing. Hitting hard again later in the over, into the man at short leg. He’s absolutely smashed it too. Mominul cops it in the hip. Tough cookie, giving it a rub and getting up. 93rd over: Australia 312-4 (Maxwell 24, Cartwright 10) It remains hard graft for Maxwell, but he’s just doing enough to keep it all in check. Just. Nearly through his gate to finish, admittedly. A couple overs left for him to see out to reach tea, which wouldn’t be for nothing. Not often he bats ugly, or has to. There’s a skill to that as well. 92nd over: Australia 310-4 (Maxwell 22, Cartwright 10) The new bowler Taijul launched into by Cartwright, thumped through cover with a minimum of fuss. Gee, looks good, doesn’t he? Second lovely boundary since his arrival. Defends just as confidently thereafter. Patrick on the email is weighing into nickname for Bec. I mean, Hilton. “Sorry showing my age here but Hilton’s nickname for me has always been George, as in George Costanza. See the Chinese Restaurant episode; “Who’s Cartwright?”, “I’m Cartwright!” One to youtube it at the interval. Ten minutes from now, in case you were wondering. I see they’ve backed in Paris at WLW. 91st over: Australia 305-4 (Maxwell 21, Cartwright 4) Mehedi is back, bouncing away from us here at the southern end. He misses first up to Cartwright, who takes a couple. But then it gets busy, beating Cartwright with a beaut. Holds its line. Then: a dropped catch! Back to the bowler, who has had a terrible time of it in the field. In his follow through, straight through the hands and into his chest on the left-hand side. He’s down for the count as well - we have a delay while he is assessed by the physio. All going down while the scores are level on 305. He is not getting up with the staff now considering taking him off. Watching a couple of replays, it has hit a thumb on the way through to the chest. Has he broken a rib? Standing up now. Why isn’t he going off? Maxwell has! Off for a trip to the gents while this is all playing out. Must have lost the better part of ten minutes there. I like it better when the sightscreen doesn’t work. Finally we’re back for the final ball. Defended. 90th over: Australia 303-4 (Maxwell 21, Cartwright 4) Mustafizur’s birthday as well today, turning 22. Just 22! What were you doing when you were 22? Weren’t opening the bowling for your country, were you? Warner’s wicket a nice gift for him. It was Jason Gillespie’s birthday when he brought up a double century at this ground 11 years ago. This is a good over too, mixing it up to Maxwell who is still very much finding his way despite being there now for the better part of 90 minutes. A quick bouncer part of the combination in this over. He’s definitely has a yard in him. 89th over: Australia 303-4 (Maxwell 21, Cartwright 4) The Maxwell Interrogation continues from the southern end. But he’s the man down the other end to the first ball now, stroking calmly to mid-off. Cartwright’s turn. Excuse me as I rotate through the various nicknames we will be using for him here on the OBO. There was a consensus around Bec on day one’s blog. That’s my preference. But Paris will also do. He can call him whatever he tells us to though if he plays shots like this with any regularity, driving Taijul down the ground in classic style. Looked a bit like Watto in the pose. That’s the highest praise I can give another human. Australia beyond 300 with the stroke. 88th over: Australia 298-4 (Maxwell 20, Cartwright 0) Hilton Cartwright into the middle for his second Test innings. Made 861 First Class runs in the Shield, winning his spot in the national squad through those runs. Made 37 against Pakistan in January and looked pretty good in that first stay. Defends Mustafizur confidently from the crease to see out the over. A reminder that we’re back with the county cricket blog as well. Pop open another tab and join Will Macpherson to see how they’re getting on around the shires. 👇 The quick gets Warner! What a catch at short-backward square! The left-hander tried to take the short delivery off his chest around the corner, but Imrul does well to keep his cool and juggle the catch. A wonderful hand from Warner comes to an end with Australia not quite into the black. But he ensured that they will enjoy a healthy first innings lead. Unless something goes horribly wrong. 87th over: Australia 291-3 (Warner 123, Maxwell 19) Taijul in no hurry here. I like that. They aren’t going to have an over-rate problem with three spinners. Warner flicks one to begin - once again to the first ball of the over - putting Maxwell into the hot seat. How will he respond? These are the days that make/break careers. One to cover punched. Better. Warner dropped! Maybe that’s being harsh to Soumya, it is four to third man from a full-blooded cut shot that caught the edge. The TV shows that he was never a chance. BJ points out on the commentary that he never moved back when the cut shot was clear. And I’ll note again, as we did time and again at Dhaka, that he just stands waaaay too close there at first. Give yourself a complete of yards, man! 86th over: Australia 291-3 (Warner 118, Maxwell 18) Warner diligently counts all the fielders before Mustafizur stats his new over, but none are required when a bouncer clears the batsmen and the ‘keeper! Nothing he could have done. He had a crack at a pull/hook too. It was quick. The eventful start extends to Maxwell when he gets his chance, driving off the edge through the cordon for four more! Not in control of that shot at all. Would have landed somewhere around fourth slip, in the unlikely event that one would be in. He’s looking rough. Two more to extra cover, out to the sweeper there, are at least along the ground. “As things are panning out, I see no reason for changing my opinion of early yesterday: massive win on the cards here for Australia, possibly batting only once,” says David Langlois, coming to us from spain. “And full credit to them for the bounce-back. On what seems to be a benigner pitch their batsmen have found a way to counter the spin menace, while the Aussie trio, especially Lyon, have rabbit-headlighted the Bangladesh batsmen into disastrous, LBW-pleading back-foot prods. I was going to go on to talk about England’s Ashes chances (hopeless) but Bangladesh’s cricketers now deserve to be spoken of in their own right rather than as hors d’oeuvres for more serious feasts.” I agree with the last point, if this series has proven anything it is that Bangladesh will be spoken off in isolation rather than as an add-on. Less bolshie about the Ashes, but each to their own. Thanks for dropping me a line. 85th over: Australia 278-3 (Warner 115, Maxwell 12) My favourite of the spinners, Taijul, getting his first go today. Struck with his first ball yesterday. Not so much this time, Warner going down the track and timing a boundary. It’s an aggressive advance, not far from the mid-on. Maybe he’s going to have a pop now the ton has been reached? I hope not. Would enjoy seeing the result of Warner still there batting tomorrow lunchtime, or something like that. Now I’ve said that, he’ll be out next over. I have that gift. 84th over: Australia 273-3 (Warner 110, Maxwell 12) Drop! Oh dear. Mehedi at gully has put Maxwell down. Off the face of the bat, it was more or less catching practice. Not a good man to put down. A pull for two more without much control. Maxwell has been skittish at best since his arrival. He’s made it to drinks now, but will have to find a better way to go about it if he’s still to be there at tea. 83rd over: Australia 271-3 (Warner 110, Maxwell 10) Warner scoring from the first ball of the over again. A feature of this innings throughout. Just a turn to fine leg, nothing special. Another feature of it. Maxwell hits the cover fielder out deep to keep the strike. Meanwhile, very good from Dizzy. Loved this ground 11 years ago. 82nd over: Australia 269-3 (Warner 109, Maxwell 9) Apologies for the delay. We’re usually good for one proper wifi drop out a day in the press boxes here, and we just had it. Nice clip off Mustafizur’s first ball of the fresh spell with the new ball. 81st over: Australia 266-3 (Warner 106, Maxwell 9) They do take the second new one at the first available opportunity. Presumably Mustafizur wants to go again from the southern end as he did yesterday, so Shakib gets first use of it. Mixing up his lengths trying to get one to skid on, Maxwell does what he needs to keep it out, but misses the shorter deliver that required punishment. Important innings for the Victorian. This is in no small part what he is there for, to punish a bowling side when they are behind in the game. 80th over: Australia 264-3 (Warner 105, Maxwell 8) Hossain has been quite useful in this cameo at the bowling crease. This is the final over before the second new ball, so it’ll probably be the last we see of him for now. Maxwell then Warner both forced to play with nice, straight bats throughout. Warner’s long-term batting coach, Trent Woodhill, has enjoyed what he has seen from his pupil. 79th over: Australia 263-3 (Warner 105, Maxwell 7) Maxwell a chance to calm down a bit here, perhaps unnerved a bit coming in after the run out when Warner was 99. Forward to Shakib throughout, as he should be. A better drive - one along the ground - ends the set. Keeping the strike with that single. 78th over: Australia 261-3 (Warner 104, Maxwell 6) His slowest ton by a mile, his previous 154 balls. Quite significant how he had to stitch that together. Smith got to the same mark of 20 centuries 12 Tests quicker, but from memory he was the second or third fastest ever. Warner will be right up there on that list as well. Feel free to jump onto one of the stats websites and ping it through to me just where he ranks! Otherwise, I’ll find it at tea. At last! Stuck on 99 for 15 deliveries, and nearly ran out on 99 when looking for a quick single, but reaches the milestone with a cover drive to the rope. Only his fifth boundary of the innings, the slowest of his career taking 209 balls. Back to back hunreds in Asia after coming into the tour under such scrutiny. 20 tons for so long a mark of greatness, and the Australian vice-captain has got there in just 66 Tests. Gives the baggy green a big kiss. What a player. 77th over: Australia 256-3 (Warner 99, Maxwell 6) Boom! Maxwell off the mark clearing mid-on. Doesn’t get all of it. In fact, it isn’t clean at all. Has another go! Doesn’t clear mid-off by far! “If he got out like that he wouldn’t even go back into the rooms, he would walk straight to the bus,” the view of Brendon Julian on the telly. Not wrong. Chill out. 76th over: Australia 250-3 (Warner 99, Maxwell 0) Good craic this, Hossain rolling a second consecutive maiden to Warner on 99. Nothing overly concerning about the deliveries, but Warner taking absolutely no chances here. Plenty of tension. Good stuff. 75th over: Australia 250-3 (Warner 99, Maxwell 0) Glenn Maxwell the new man, Shakib bowling with confidence after executing that handy run out in the previous over. One movement for the pick up and throw, as they say. Maxwell very happy to watch before playing his shots, defending each delivery from the front foot. Maiden it is. Back to Warner on 99 up the other end. 74th over: Australia 250-3 (Warner 99, Maxwell 0) Well, Nasir Hossain’s introduction has got Bangladesh the wicket. Who woulda thought? Sure, it was a run out. But surely the opener was playing with extreme caution given the part-time nature of the spin. He’s had a poor time of it in the field, Mushfiqur, but that’s the second time he’s snuffed out a wicket soon as he has made a chance. So credit to him there. What a mess! Handscomb a long way down backing up with Warner on 99, but when Warner declines the quick single to midwicket Shakib is there to throw down the stumps at the Victorian end. He dives, but it isn’t enough, caught comfortably short. The end of a wonderful innings in such an unecessary way. Deserved a ton. Warner still on 99. IS HANDSCOMB RUN OUT? Direct hit at the non-strikers’ end. Looks grim! 73rd over: Australia 250-2 (Warner 99, Handscomb 82) Shakib beats Warner with one that goes under his bat! Very low. He’s well outside the line, missing off-stump comfortably. Then to 99 with another single to cover. Easy work there. The 250 up with the run. Shakib around the wicket floating up to Handscomb, who isn’t tempted. Warner to face with one needed for a fine ton. 72nd over: Australia 249-2 (Warner 98, Handscomb 82) Mehedi gets another go. Warner waits for the fuller deliver, takes a single to cover. The 150 partnership when Handscomb also gets one, to mid-off. Had to run hard, but got there easy in the end. Warner moves to 98 with a push to point, keeping the strike as well. 71st over: Australia 246-2 (Warner 95, Handscomb 81) Warner easy around the corner, within a nicely struck drive of a ton now. No rush. An inside edge won from Handscomb here, the only time the ball hasn’t hit the middle of his bat today so far. But no issues, spilling around the corner. He really is at ease, the Victorian. In 70th over: Australia 245-2 (Warner 95, Handscomb 81) Handscomb into the 80s with a lovely stroke through cover off the back foot. Made room for himself but never lost balance. He clips well to the last ball, but straight to a fielder. No concerns for either batsman against the teenage offie. 69th over: Australia 240-2 (Warner 93, Handscomb 78) The brilliant Brian Murgatroyd on the telly tells us that Warner has made 19 tons but only out once in the 90s. That was last November in Perth, nicking off for 97. He pulls a simple risk-free single to the midwicket sweeper to give Handscomb the strike. He’s committing to using his feet to defend, then just as comfortable going back to finish it off. 68th over: Australia 239-2 (Warner 92, Handscomb 78) Mehedi offering a four-ball an over. Not always converted, but the line and length that he hit so consistently in the Dhaka first innings has left him a bit here. He’s still dangerous when he gets it right, Handscomb deep in the crease when one shot through and nearly beat his defence. But sure enough, the long hop wasn’t far away, the right hander smacking it to midwicket boundary. 67th over: Australia 235-2 (Warner 92, Handscomb 74) Some session times have flashed up on screen. Tea till be at 1530 local time, the final session running through to 1800. I’m delighted that my earlier sums were right. Warner in his flashy new baggy (or tight, see yesterday’s OBO) getting nicely forward to defend Shakib, then back to strike a couple through cover point. His most productive scoring area. Only four boundaries in his hand so far, giving a sense of just how much the field was spread to him. Questionably strategy, if you ask me. Using his feet to defend the rest. 66th over: Australia 233-2 (Warner 90, Handscomb 74) Mehedi from the southern end. He wasn’t very good yesterday, aside from when he won the stumping chance off Warner, fluffed by Mushfiqur. The Australians continue where they left off in response to his opening over here, Handscomb hitting a well-timed two out to midwicket. Deflects nicely for two more off the back foot past point. Another single to midwicket. Warner then does likewise. Four scoring shots and Warner into the 90s. 65th over: Australia 227-2 (Warner 89, Handscomb 69) Past the outside edge first ball! Warner tries to cut, but misses. He’s more studious, clipping only a single in the over. Shakib misses his one delivery to Handscomb, who kicks away a leg bye to retain the strike. The players are walking out! 67 overs to be bowled. So doing the maths on that, with a 20 minute break in there for tea, that means four-and-a-half hours. Scheduled close should be roughly 6pm. With, presumably, half hour up the sleeve for slow over rates. Shakib has the ball, Warner on strike, the crowd are chanting. PLAY! The best naan in South Asia, you say? Graham Crouch on the email. “Adam I’m assuming you are staying at the new Radisson but I hope you have had a chance to sneak next door to the Chittagong club (dress code: no thongs) for a slice of life and a chat with the locals about all things cricket. They do a mean chicken tikka and the best naan in South Asia.” I’m actually not at the Raddy. My colleagues are, but I’m doing it a slightly different way (i.e. on the cheap, let’s be honest) staying in town and outside the security tent. Wonderful experience, especially during Eid over the weekend. Won’t be forgetting that in a hurry. As for the Chittagong Club, due to Eid it wasn’t open when I had a crack the other night. It was also spoken of very highly by English colleagues who toured here last year. But with this timely reminder, I will try again later tonight. With thanks. Great news, just flashing up on the scoreboard here. Per my earlier post, haven’t a clue how many overs or when tea will be taken, but we’ll be told pretty soon and I’ll relay when I have it to hand. Cricket! Yeah! Some good stuff from this morning. On radio RSN927’s breakfast show, John Hastings talking about the Steve O’Keefe vs Jon Holland debate. The main bit: “I really feel for Dutchy (Holland). Steve O’Keefe was best man at my wedding, so I am rapt for him. But by all rights he probably doesn’t deserve to be there. He’s suspended by NSW Cricket and he’s over playing for Australia. So it is an interesting. But I don’t think Jon Holland can do any more than he has done over the last few years.” I’ve just realised... This is going to be a really long afternoon and evening we have together. But how long, exactly? Now, I cover cricket for a living. I played plenty in England too. In our sport it rains a lot. So you would think that we would have a clue about added time and the like. Right? But who can say with certainty how long can and will be plonked on the end tonight beyond the 5pm scheduled close of play? What about the extra half-hour on top of the spare hour? For all those details and more (i.e. start times, breaks, etc)... I’ve asked the Australian team manager to find out for me. Hessian off, stumps in. Peter Handscomb in the middle having a little shadow bat. The covers being given a good shake out beyond the boundary in case they are required again. I was told by my Bangladeshi colleague this ground has the best drainage in the country, and on the available evidence that looks true. Amazing how heavy that rain was only a couple of hours ago. Looks good to go pretty soon. Not just that it’s your old mate Adam Collins here to bring you the rest of the OBO. No, the good news is that the covers are coming off. I can see it with my very eyes from the northern end of Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong. And get this: the sun is nearly breaking through. Get in, my friends. Get in. Thank you Kate for steering the ship through the rain. Never an easy gig. Despite the super soppers doing their best, it’ll still be a while before we’re up and about. So we better chat, right? Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com in the old money, @collinsadam the new. This OBO will accept both. Handing over Well, that was one of my more exhilarating live blogging sessions. Certainly the pacing was a little different to Sportwatch. For those AFL fans reading this, I’ll be back on Friday night for the blockbuster game between the Cats and Tigers, and then again on Saturday night for the Port v West Coast clash. Looking forward to it - and hope that plenty of you will join me then. I’m now handing over to Adam Collins, who is at the soggy scene in Chittagong. He’s advised that he’s currently being fed some thick daal and vegetables (jealous), and will be back shortly to take you through a variety of youtube hits while we pass some more rain-soaked time. Should PNG play in Australian one-day competition? Jason Gillespie, current coach of the Papua New Guinea Barramundis (great name, right?) wants his team included in Australia’s domestic one-day competition. Gillespie also coaches the Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League, and says that Australia ought to do more for its developing neighbour - and used Bangladesh as an example of what can happen when a nation is given its opportunity on the world stage. Australia has of course included an international side in its one-day competition before, in New Zealand. Weather update from Chittagong This from the Bureau of Adam Collins, and it’s not good news cricket fans. “Sorry to report that it has started raining again. Not anywhere near the strength of downpour as earlier, but back to legitimate rain, as opposed to that drizzle or mizzle we had for a while there. Can anyone distinguish between those, by the way? Maybe we’ll try that when I take the baton form Kate. Anyway, bad news from Chittagong. Catch you soon.” Jimmy Anderson For those of you hankering for some other cricketing news, here’s a nice little piece from today about Jimmy Anderson chasing 500 test wickets. ‘When Glenn McGrath brought up his 500th Test wicket at Lord’s in 2005 by teasing an edge to third slip off Marcus Trescothick, the great Australian fast bowler had a pair of gold-stitched bowling boots run on to the field by the 12th man to mark the occasion,’ writes Ali Martin. ‘Jimmy Anderson, sitting three away from becoming just the third seamer to the milestone after McGrath and Courtney Walsh, has no such plans.’ The Test series is currently drawn at 1-1, with West Indies coach Stuart Law bullish about his side’s prospects. Women’s Ashes series Speaking of the upcoming Ashes test, here are some highlights from the last time England and Australia met in the Ashes - with some bowling brilliance from Ellyse Perry who took 32-6 in the final innings, and nine wickets in total. She’s pretty handy with the bat too - currently averaging 51.17 in ODIs and 31.28 in Tests. Update from the ground As I mentioned Adam is at the ground and has provided this pic from the roof. Good news that it’s just drizzling, but who knows how long it will take for the water to clear. I still doubt we’ll have any play this session. Monsoon season So why exactly is this Test being played in monsoon season anyway? After all, the last two Tests that were attempted in Bangladesh at this time of year were abandoned (i.e. the South Africa washouts a couple of years ago). This series has been effectively tailed onto the Indian one-day internationals, and according to Adam’s sources, the Australians suspected these tests would be washed out also (apparently they didn’t seem to mind so much). It’s in fact rather lucky that we haven’t had more rain to date, since it has rained non-stop between the two tests. Adam Collins’ update Our man Adam Collins (who is taking over for me at ‘lunch’ aka when lunch was meant to be) is at the ground and is sending through some updates on the state of play (or non-play) currently: “It hasn’t stopped. I don’t want to get carried away. But it isn’t anywhere near as hard as it was half an hour ago. That was rain as hard as I’ve ever experienced. I know my colleagues and I have written a lot about monsoonal rain only for it to be 40 every day and Petey Handscomb to nearly collapse by stumps yesterday. But here it is. Encouragingly, the pooling water on one the of the covers at our northern end of the ground seems to have drained already. We’re told that it drains well here. But isn’t that the way with every cricket ground? Ever heard of a ground NOT draining well? Anyway, I’ll leave you with that. Hopefully better news in an hour or so.” Women’s Ashes series Don’t forget our Southern Stars are playing their Ashes series a couple of months from now. I’m excited! Anyone keen to tweet or email me with their favourite moments in Aussie women’s cricket history? Review of yesterday’s play While I’m researching, and we’re waiting, our very own Adam Collins is featured in this video with Mohammad Isam discussing yesterday’s play - and Peter Handscomb’s heroics. Back with you shortly Alright, it’s not looking good here - so I think I’ll step back for a while and do some investigation on the permutations for the Australians should they lose a session or two. Don’t forget you can always tweet or email me if there’s something on your mind or there’s a conversation you think we ought to have here. First session may be off Doesn’t look like much will be happening this session - with water pooling off the covers. And now it’s flooding This isn’t looking good for the Aussies. Courtney Walsh Courtney Walsh (West Indies cricketing legend) is the Bangladeshi bowling coach - and he’s live now arguing that Bangladesh’s bowlers need more exposure on the international stage. He says the talent and quality is there, but they need more match practice against the world’s best. Loved watching him and Curtly Ambrose in my youth - he shared an incredible 421 Test wickets with Ambrose in 49 matches. Of course he also held the record for the most Test wickets prior to being overtaken by Shane Warne. Bangladesh’s historic victory Did you miss Bangladesh’s victory against Australia in the first Test? Here’s some video highlights to give you a sense of just how much the team (and Prime Minister) enjoyed it. Thunder and lightning... OK, so it’s not just raining. There’s actually a thunderstorm - all of which came on with around 25 mins before what was supposed to be the start of play. It’s raining... Not a great sign for today’s play - with rain teeming down at Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. Covers are on and a lengthy delay looks likely. Peter Handscomb Peter Handscomb lost an incredible 4.5kg during his stint in the oppressive heat yesterday. Will be interesting to see how he goes today - doesn’t look like conditions have changed all that much - it’s 31 degrees currently, with 76% humidity and rain - more on that in a moment! Hi everyone, and welcome to this crucial third day of the Bangladesh v Australia test match. Yesterday’s action ended with Australia on 225-2 (from 65 overs), trailing by 80 runs. David Warner is unbeaten on 88, while Peter Handscomb’s 69 not out was lauded as ‘gutsy’ by Australian coach Darren Lehmann, after he overcame heat exhaustion to steer Australia’s gritty batting resistance. Handscomb was attended to by medical staff on 64 not out late in the day, after a batting stint of almost two hours in over 30 degree heat and extreme humidity. It brought to mind the heroics of fellow-Victorian Dean Jones in the 1986 test against India in Madras, when he too battled heat-induced illness to score an incredible 210. Warner, meanwhile, showed a more subdued and patient side to his batting repertoire, with only four boundaries for his 88 (off 170 balls). He’ll be especially relieved not to have been stumped by Mushfiqur Rahim 40 minutes out from the end of play, in what was a howler by the captain and wicketkeeper. Together, Warner and Handscomb added 127 runs for the third wicket in a potentially game-changing partnership. Apart from Handscomb, Australia’s hero for the day was undoubtedly Nathan Lyon, who claimed 7-94 - his second-best Test career figures (and his fourth seven-wicket haul). It was a particularly impressive feat given the wicket has largely played into the hands of the batsmen, turning far less than in the first test in Dhaka. It looks like a more traditional subcontinental wicket this time around, which should turn more as the game progresses. Lyon’s feat took him to a Test wicket tally of 77 in Asia, which means he now overtakes Glenn McGrath and sits second behind Shane Warne for overall best wicket-takers in the region. Not bad considering Lehmann’s criticism of Lyon after the debacle that was the Sri Lankan series last year. Should be a fascinating day. If you’re interested in a live replay of yesterday’s action, please do follow the great work of Sam Perry and Adam Collins. Feel free to tweet me @kate_ohalloran or email me at kate.ohalloran.freelance@guardian.co.uk during today’s action. Play commences at 2pm AEST. Kate will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s a reminder of how things panned out on day two:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/05/bell-pottinger-investor-south-africa-chime-pr","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T19:28:36Z","webTitle":"Bell Pottinger investor walks away as South Africa row deepens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/05/bell-pottinger-investor-south-africa-chime-pr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/05/bell-pottinger-investor-south-africa-chime-pr","fields":{"headline":"Bell Pottinger investor walks away as South Africa row deepens","bodyText":"Bell Pottinger’s second-largest shareholder has walked away from the business by writing off its investment and handing back the stake to the struggling PR firm. Chime, co-owned by US investment firm Providence Equity Partners and Sir Martin Sorrell’s WPP group, has given up trying to sell its 27% holding after a scandal over a Bell Pottinger campaign in South Africa severely damaged the agency. On Monday, the British PR trade body expelled Bell Pottinger from its ranks after the firm orchestrated a campaign to stir up anger about “white monopoly capital” and “economic apartheid” for one of South Africa’s wealthiest and most controversial families. “We no longer have a stake in Bell Pottinger,” confirmed a spokesman for Chime. As Chime is a minority shareholder in the PR agency, its stake, which is thought to have been valued at about £5m, will be written down as a non-cash charge on its balance sheet. HSBC said on Tuesday it would no longer use Bell Pottinger following the South Africa furore. Britain’s biggest bank, which has weathered its own public relations disaster after its Swiss arm helped clients evade tax, is the fourth business to distance itself from the PR firm. “We have used Bell Pottinger for specific projects in the past but will not be doing so in the future,” the bank said in a statement. TalkTalk, one of the UK’s biggest broadband operators, had a contract with Bell Pottinger which ended earlier this year. The company is set to put out a tender for a new corporate PR and public affairs contract and it is understood that Bell Pottinger will not be asked to submit a bid. Waitrose, which prides itself on its ethical stance and uses Bell Pottinger, would not say whether it will continue to employ the embattled agency. “We don’t comment on specific supplier relationships,” said a spokeswoman, who refused to elaborate further. Bell Pottinger has already lost at least five clients over the furore: Richemont, the Swiss luxury company headed by South African businessman Johann Rupert; Investec, the South African investment group; and Acacia, which owns gold mines in Tanzania; Clydesdale Bank; and construction firm Carillion. Further uncertainty over Bell Pottinger’s future was fuelled when its largest shareholder, James Henderson, resigned as chief executive on Sunday. Lord Bell, who resigned last summer from the company he co-founded, told Newsnight he thought it was “almost certain” Bell Pottinger would not survive the scandal involving the firm’s work for the Gupta family. “I think that it is probably getting near the end, I mean you can try and rescue it but it won’t be very successful,” he said. Lord Bell agreed a £20m deal to buy the Bell Pottinger branded PR businesses from Chime, its publicly listed parent company, in 2012. Chime was taken private by Providence, which owns a majority stake, and WPP in a £374m deal in 2015. Chime took part in Bell’s management buyout by taking a 27% stake that helped support the launch of the independent Bell Pottinger business. Bell Pottinger is known to have appointed City advisers up to 18 months ago to explore strategic options, including a sale of the business, but this fizzled out last year. Bell Pottinger, which is ranked as the 13th biggest PR consultancy in the UK, employing an estimated 190 staff, made about £4m in profits and £42m in revenues in 2015, according to the most recent publicly available financial data at Companies House. It is thought the business has maintained roughly this level of revenues and profits since then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/22/the-wigmore-london-w1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T13:00:48Z","webTitle":"The Wigmore, London W1: ‘Silly?

A bit. Delicious? Oh yes’ – restaurant review","bodyText":"What even is a pub, anyway? I recently wrote elsewhere about my dislike of the classic, old-geezer, sticky-carpeted boozer, and as a result got lambasted by many old geezers who live in the internet: pleasingly ironic, as the thrust of the piece was “each to their own”. Being the reasonable chap that I mostly am, I determined to celebrate the species, to find one I could write about with unalloyed positivity. Which brings me to The Wigmore, a new “pub” attached to the supremely swish Langham Hotel. But is it actually a pub? It is, as the definition goes, “an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages including beer (such as ale) and cider”. Its list includes pumps and bottles, its own Wigmore Saison served in tankers, and beers both traditional and arcane. There are also creative cocktails in their own weeny tankards and wines on tap. Basically, all the alcoholic beverages any heart could desire. Does it serve pub grub? Sure, it pays lip-service to the traditions of the genre, with pies and roasts and toasties. But reimagined by angels – in the guise of consultant, Michel Roux Jr. Or, in the case of the cheese toastie – a behemoth of a thing anchored by a heavy, cast-iron bacon press and oozing excellent aged cheddar, red onion, mustard and cornichons in the most lascivious way – by Satan himself. It’s designed to be shared, apparently. Excuse my small, shamefaced laugh. There are scotch eggs subjected to many a twist: “masala” quail’s egg porcupined with threads of sev over the sausagemeat, lolling in sauces of fiercely spiced dahl and raita. Silly? A bit. Delicious? Oh yes. And I love the idea of serving crabmeat on minuscule crumpets with slivers of nori: if pubs did blinis… And then a prince among pies: proper, with sides and a bottom, not just a pie dish with titfer of crust. It’s crisp on top, slumpy where it needs to be, stuffed with chicken that appears to be solely the bird’s “oysters”, that recherché, flavourful nugget the French call le sot l’y laisse (rough translation: the fool leaves it there) bound in cream and stock and loads of leeks. Mash is of the kind we critics must always refer to as Robuchon-style: preternaturally smooth, as much good butter as potato. Chips come dusted with “bloody mary salt”, which is basically everything that makes that cocktail such a joy powdered and scattered over real chips, crisp and fluffy and evil. There’s a cast-iron casserole containing whole “white” chicken, roasted with sherry, potatoes and small white onions, and served on a thick crouton to soak up the mellow juices: shades of the La Petite Maison’s legendary blackleg chicken, but at a fraction of its £105 price tag: this one costs £34 and easily serves three. Glitches: roast red peppers (served with pickled golden raisins and creme fraiche) should have been peeled; tomato salad is viciously over-vinegared; mussels in cider and cream feature too much raw alcohol. And “ox tongue potatoes”, like an etiolated version of the stellar confit jobs at The Quality Chop House with bits of jerky-like tongue adhering to them, seem designed more for social media than palates. (Great anchoïade, though.) Apologies for the restaurant name-dropping, but the menu can come across a bit “greatest hits”. As, I suppose, befits a pub, only with tuna plancha niçoise and spiced cauliflower kedgeree instead of lasagne and Thai green curry. The place is beautiful, too, painted in a high-gloss sage green that brings to mind Victorian gin palaces; there’s intricate parquetry underfoot; and the bar appears to be lined with endpaper from ancient, precious books. From the soaring, domed ceiling cascades a striking chandelier – indoor fireworks. It’s the work of designer Martin Brudnizki (The Ivy, er, Sexy Fish) with Robbie Bargh of The Gorgeous Group (full disclosure: someone I have met and admire). No sticky carpets as far as the eye can see. If The Wigmore says it’s a pub, then it must be so. There are as many drinkers as diners, plenty of the requisite men with pints. But it is as far removed from Wetherspoons as it’s possible to be while sharing the same atmosphere. (It’s a bit like comparing me to Charlize Theron because we’re both women.) And I know absolutely where I’d rather be. Don’t bother @ing me. • The Wigmore 15 Langham Place, London W1, 020-7965 0198. Open Mon-Sat, 11am-midnight (1am Thurs-Sat).

The food comes from its own farm. The beer is brewed in the same village. And now punters have only to stumble over the road to bed. The pub’s owners recently bought the cottage opposite and have turned it into rooms. The 18th-century two-up two-down now comprises four tasteful bedrooms. Ours was on the ground floor, and we were a little taken aback by the large windows giving directly on to the pavement – it’s not exactly private. Accidental exhibitionism aside, it is a lovely room: painted in shades of grey, with a sturdy sisal carpet and soft sheepskin rugs. A rough-hewn plank wardrobe and basket-weave lampshades add a rustic touch. Two little paintings of a cocker spaniel and a staffie echo the pub’s motif of a pointer dog (although actually the pub is named after the Pointer family that once owned it). The super-kingsize bed looked impressive, but was two singles pushed together – great if you want twin beds; annoying if you don’t. The bathroom has a huge rain shower, slipper bath and dual sinks, and a view over the courtyard garden. The toiletries deserve special mention: fragrant Somerset brand Bramley, containing lavender, geranium and rosemary essential oils. We nipped out for a pre-dinner pint at the Pheasant, the pub at the other end of the ridiculously pretty hilltop village (JRR Tolkien based the village of Bree on Brill). We were surprised by the rowdy atmosphere on a Wednesday night, and the preponderance of people in hats and wigs … turns out we were gatecrashing a wake. The deceased, clearly a much-loved character, was apparently a big fan of fancy headwear. Things were more sedate back at the Pointer, but encouragingly busy. The bar, which dates from the 1700s, has nooks for lounging around the fire and stove, serves beer from Brill’s Vale and Long Crendon’s XT brewery, and has snacks such as mini scotch eggs (£5) and meat platters (£15). There are signs offering “pints for produce” – free beer in return for “homegrown or shot” food. The leafy beer garden backs on to the 12th-century village church. The restaurant is in a converted barn past the open kitchen, with a vaulted ceiling, garlanded beams and exposed stone. The menu is short – three snacks, four starters, four mains – but almost impossible to choose from: everything sounds utterly delicious. The special threw us into further turmoil; could we turn down a 700g Longhorn rump steak for two? A paper bag of sourdough with beef-dripping butter (posh Marmite) was an extremely welcome surprise, as was the pre-starter of radishes with walnuts and sherry. We finally plumped for monkfish scampi with “saffron emulsion” from the snacks, and pork terrine from the starters (both £8). Our only quibbles were the size of the tiny “beer muffin” served with the big slab of pork, and the advertised crackling, which was more like piggy popcorn. We resisted the giant rump in favour of a marginally less greedy rib-eye (£30), which left us room to try the lamb: neck and shoulder with baby aubergine, ratatouille vegetables and goat’s curd (£28). Again, it was tough to find anything to criticise – the triple-cooked chips were a bit dry, but dunking them in the marrow gravy took care of that. Cheese (£11) was served with excellent caraway and fennel-seed flatbreads, and treacle tart (£8) was reminiscent of school-dinner cornflake pie, in a really good way. OK, it’s not cheap. There is a more affordable set “farm menu” (£22.50 for three courses), but it comprises much simpler dishes – pea soup and sausage and mash. The chef uses about 70 ingredients from the Pointer farm and kitchen garden, supplemented by other local producers and game estates, and fish from Brixham. In fact, owners Fiona and David Howden bought the pub in 2011 specifically to sell their farm’s produce. We tried more of it at breakfast, including middle white sausages, bacon and black pudding. There is a table of cold items, too, such as creamy milk and yoghurt, homemade bread and jams, and bloody mary mix. Dining is not the only way to sample the wares: the outbuilding next to the pub was recently converted into a butcher’s shop selling meat, charcuterie, eggs and drinks (open Wednesday to Friday afternoons and Saturday morning; though the kitchen still gets first dibs). And there is a farmers’ market outside the pub on Saturdays, where villagers sell tomatoes, chutneys and cakes alongside the Pointer farm fare. It could just be the perfect local. • Food and accommodation were provided by The Pointer (doubles from £130 B&amp;B). Train travel from London was provided by Bicester Village (bicestervillage.com) Ask a local Beccy Roberts, the Pheasant Inn, Brill • Visit The Brill Windmill dates from the 1680s and is one of the oldest in the country. It was beautifully restored in 2009, has views for miles around and is open on Sunday afternoons between Easter and the end of September (adult £2, child 50p). • Walk The Bernwood Jubilee Way is a 61-mile trail within the ancient royal hunting forest of Bernwood. It is a wonderful way to explore the beautiful countryside on the Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire border. • Eat The Hundred of Ashendon is a wonderful pub in a neighbouring village. The chef/owner is Matt Gill, who previously worked at St John in London and the Hand and Flowers in Marlow. • Explore The beautiful house, wine cellars and gardens of Waddesdon Manor are just a few miles away. This eccentric house, designed in the style of a Loire Valley chateau, was built for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild in the 1870s, and is now owned and run by the National Trust. • Shop Bicester Village, with all its luxury designer outlets, is seven miles from Brill.

I’m the second youngest, and to make your space in that group of people is really hard. At school I had the space to be funny.” Her school suggested she use up her excess energy by joining theatre groups. It’s easy to see why. When we first meet, she makes the story of the “ugly jumper” she’s wearing, a cross between festive knitwear and something in a Swedish crime thriller, into a highly entertaining mini-saga. Wokoma, 29, has had an astonishingly busy few years since graduating from drama school in 2010. As well as a stage career that took her to New York with the Donmar’s all-female Julius Caesar and Henry IV, she’s appeared on TV in Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s pre-Fleabag comedy Crashing and was the lead in witty supernatural teen drama Crazyhead. She also played devout, Ludo-loving Cynthia in Michaela Coel’s Chewing Gum, which took her to some eye-opening places: meticulously planning to lose her virginity to a stranger who then robs her house, for example, or using olive oil as a lubricant while preemptively breaking her own hymen. “Some of the things I had to do in that show, I’m like, wow,” she grins. “Wow!” Chewing Gum took off both in the UK and the US, where it became a cult hit through Netflix: “Ms Wokoma steals every scene she’s in,” declared the New York Times. But Coel recently announced she was not planning to write a third series any time soon. “I had a feeling,” admits Wokoma, who says she had so many opportunities as a result of the show that she can’t begin to imagine what it has been like for Coel. “Women need to create lots of stuff and get our work out there because the door shuts firmly on us a lot quicker. It’s a shame, but Chewing Gum exists, and I’m really proud of that.” When she was younger, Wokoma was always watching comedies, in particular sketch shows such as Goodness Gracious Me, The Real McCoy, Smack the Pony and 3 Non-Blondes. The last of these, particularly, had a big impact. “That was the point where I was like, ‘Oh my god, black women being funny.’” She talks about one scene in Chewing Gum, which offered roles to four black women. “My black actress friends only meet each other socially. We never meet on a job, because it’s always going to be just one of us. So we looked around and thought, oh god, we’re all here, playing friends.” Is the situation changing, or is casting stuck in a rut? “A lot of people have knocked down doors. But there still seems to be a club policy: one in, one out.” She mentions Raquel, the demon-hunter she played in Crazyhead. “A lot of black women would tweet me and say, ‘Raquel was the character we wanted in Buffy, and now she’s gone and we won’t get her for another 10 years.’ And I was like: ‘You’re so right’. Which is why so many people are writing, including myself.” Wokoma isn’t planning on slowing down. She’s about to star in a new hospital-based sitcom, Porters, as the eye-rolling Frankie, who thinks everyone around her is an idiot (it also stars Rutger Hauer and Kelsey Grammer). And she’s working on a TV pilot loosely based on meeting her Nigerian half-sister for the first time. “We met around the time my dad passed away. She came over for the funeral, and she thought, this is bullshit. All of you are depressed, it rains, the men aren’t hot, you don’t own your house, and that’s weird. You have poverty, yet you have free education …” She’s slapping her hands on the table, laughing. “Hearing that for the first time, I thought … yeah!” If the script is anything like the anecdotes she tells – there’s one about finding herself half-naked in the presence of Meryl Streep, another about growing up in a Nigerian household with multiple teenagers on the verge of puberty – it should be a hit. Right now she’s rehearsing for her first ever West End role, in James Graham’s new political comedy Labour of Love. Wokoma plays Margot, a constituent who eventually becomes a Labour councillor, alongside Martin Freeman as a Labour MP. “What has been interesting is looking back at the cycle of the Labour party and realising the infighting about identity has happened again and again.” She voted Labour, and has friends who are vehemently pro-Corbyn, and others who are as strongly against. “But rather than pushing a political view, it’s more about having a forensic look at the Labour party. It spans 27 years, so there’s a lot to fit in.” It’s no surprise she’s ended up in another comedy, even though that was never exactly the plan. “When I first did Chewing Gum, I thought, oh, you’ll play weird, strange, sexually repressed characters for ever. Then, very quickly, I was like, I’ve got to do other things. The more I can do, the more comfortable I am. You can pick me up and drop me into anything.” Labour of Love is at the Noël Coward theatre, London, from 27 September to 2 December. Porters begins on Dave on 20 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/31/consumers-betrayed-over-sustainability-of-worlds-biggest-tuna-fishery","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Consumers 'betrayed' over sustainability of world’s biggest tuna fishery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/31/consumers-betrayed-over-sustainability-of-worlds-biggest-tuna-fishery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/31/consumers-betrayed-over-sustainability-of-worlds-biggest-tuna-fishery","fields":{"headline":"Consumers 'betrayed' over sustainability of world’s biggest tuna fishery","bodyText":"Consumers of tuna from the world’s biggest fishery are are being “betrayed” over its sustainability, according to a coalition of scientists, retailers, politicians and campaigners, including Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. The vast Western and Central Pacific fishery provides about half of the world’s skipjack tuna, the type most commonly found in cans on supermarket shelves. Some is certified as sustainably caught by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and carries the group’s “blue tick” logo. But the same boats can also use, at other times, unsustainable methods to catch uncertified fish, a contradiction seen as unacceptable by the new On The Hook coalition. “MSC are betraying the trust of consumers and duping them into purchasing what they believe is truly sustainable tuna,” said Prof Callum Roberts, a leading fisheries expert at the University of York and part of the coalition. Polling by the group showed that 77% of UK consumers who were aware of the MSC believe that vessels that caught MSC labelled products should meet MSC requirements at all times. Roberts praised the MSC’s past work on tackling overfishing but likened the tuna issue to rewarding a criminal for the days on which he does not commit a burglary: “The situation is intolerable. The MSC has lost its moral compass.” Fearnley-Whittingstall said: “I rely on the MSC to provide sustainable fish for my restaurants, and so do my customers, and if I am not convinced their certification is reliable I will have to reconsider. It’s time to see some real reform.” Another coalition member and a former UK fisheries minister, Richard Benyon MP, said: “Like many, I have long held the MSC in very high regard. That reputation has been hard won around the world but it is squandered quickly. The MSC must urgently review their standard to prevent MSC-certified products being caught alongside unsustainable methods of fishing.” The Western and Central Pacific fishery covers the waters of eight island nations, including Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands. The use of nets to catch free swimming tuna in the region was certified sustainable by the MSC in 2011 and is set to be renewed this year, according to an independent technical report. But the same vessels can also at other times use fish aggregating devices (FADs) – floating mats that attract life in the open ocean. The MSC’s website says: “It’s an easy way to fish, but it’s largely a wasteful and destructive one, as many young tuna are caught before they can reproduce, with other species ending up as bycatch.” Roberts said: “These things are a magnet for all kinds of things, so there is a whole community of animals [including turtles and sharks] and all of these get caught when the net goes around it.” Claire Nouvian, president of ocean conservation NGO, Bloom, said: “It is clear that MSC, by certifying certain parts of a fishery are creating an illusion of sustainability.” The MSC said a strict chain of custody requirements ensures that certified and non-certified catch are clearly segregated. On the issue of whether fisheries should be allowed to catch both certified and non-certified fish, the MSC will launch a formal consultation on Friday, with a recommendation going to the MSC board in January. However, standard practice means that fisheries are normally given three years to adapt to new standards, meaning the Western and Central Pacific tuna fishery is very likely to have a new five-year certification before any changes can be made. “As a global not-for-profit, we remain committed to our vision for the world’s oceans to be teeming with life, and seafood supplies safeguarded for this and future generations,” said David Agnew, MSC science and standards director. “The MSC works tirelessly to understand and unite a complex set of often differing views among our stakeholders – fisheries, retailers, brands, NGOs, scientists, and of course consumers – and galvanise them all in pursuit of a shared goal that all can benefit from, regardless of their differences.” Pacifical, the marketing company for the Western and Central Pacific tuna fishery tuna, defended its operation in a letter to the MSC on 29 August, in which it said managed FAD fishing could be sustainable and that it aimed aim to get MSC certification for this within five years. Princes, a major tuna brand, sources MSC-certified tuna from the Western and Central Pacific fishery and a spokesman said: “MSC is widely recognised as the world’s most robust standard for sustainable fishing. As such, Princes fully supports the MSC and its certification programme.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/03/mans-anderfelt-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T10:47:20Z","webTitle":"Måns Anderfelt obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/03/mans-anderfelt-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/03/mans-anderfelt-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Måns Anderfelt obituary","bodyText":"My husband, Måns Anderfelt, who has died aged 73, had a passion for learning. He worked as a stockbroker and private banker, and later trained as a mediator. In retirement he became involved in projects supporting young people. He was born in Stockholm to Ebba (nee Janzon), known as Bibi, and Lars Anderfelt, who had met in London, working at the Swedish Chamber of Commerce. Lars went on to become an executive in the frozen foods industry. Måns obtained his international baccalaureate at a boarding school, the Sigtunaskolan Humanistiska Läroverket, in Sigtuna, north of Stockholm. He also attended Gordonstoun school in Scotland as part of a student exchange scheme. He graduated in economics from the University of Geneva in 1968, followed by a master’s in international relations from the city’s Institute of Development Studies in 1970. His first job was in Amsterdam with the wealth management firm Merrill Lynch; he stayed with them for three years before moving to Paris, where he worked in banking. He was then headhunted by Crosby Management Training and worked in Britain, teaching the “total quality management” ethos, which encourages a climate of continuous improvement in a company. He next moved to Boston, where he completed several managerial professional development courses at Harvard, then returned to London with the financial services firm Prudential Bache. A restructuring of the company offered him the opportunity to take early retirement at the age of 63, which he did, in order to train as a mediator at Regent’s University in London. He subsequently worked as a volunteer mediator with the borough of Southwark, helping to resolve disputes between neighbours. We had met in November 1999 at an art event at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and married in 2004. When Måns retired in 2007 we began to work together supporting the charity A Portrait of a Country for Peace, which supports emerging young artists by holding exhibitions to introduce their work. We also held annual tennis competitions in Colombia for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds with the purpose of offering them opportunities to develop careers as tennis coaches in the community. We lived together in Ashtead, Surrey, for the last three years of Måns’s life.

According to Vanity Fair, America’s first family are furious about their giggling new nickname for the president’s fashion-forward daughter, Ivanka Trump. Behind her back, she is called the Princess Royal. That is, of course, a jab about her alleged air of entitlement. But is there anything so wrong about being compared to our Princess Anne, who is in fact the current official holder of the Princess Royal title, which traditionally goes to the monarch’s eldest daughter? (Tiffany Trump, Donald’s 24-year-old younger daughter, is therefore not entitled to this nickname, no matter how grand she gets.) Our Princess Royal is the unpretentious, roll-your-sleeves-up working royal who is really keen on horses. Granted, she once told reporters to “naff orf!” – and “naff” might not have been the word she used – and was once fined because her bull terrier Dotty attacked two children. Yet historically the Princesses Royal have been an unexceptionable lot. Before Anne, the Princess Royal was the now forgotten Princess Mary, daughter of George V, whose husband, the Earl of Harewood, proposed to her after losing a bet at his club. She reportedly refused to attend the 1947 wedding of Princess Elizabeth to Philip Mountbatten in protest because her brother, the disgraced Duke Of Windsor, was not invited. I don’t think Ivanka quite suits the title Princess Royal. Donald, however, could be renamed George III. A forch in the road Like a man cramming his spilling waistline into a pair of crisply laundered blue jeans, I was this week paralysed by a sudden age-inappropriate, everything-inappropriate desire to use the millennial word “unforch” in a text. This is a term that should only be used by 15-year-old Instagram influencers with 2 million followers and a six-figure promotional deal with Tom Ford. But unforch, I had the urge to say “unforch” when “sadly” would have been less offensive and would have conveyed entirely the same thing with two fewer letters. Anyway, I thought that I was rather elegantly conveying a little bit of self-aware humour in using this word. But unforch, no. I looked like Dirk Bogarde at the end of Death in Venice, being carried dead off the beach, the pathetic black hair-dye streaming down his face. Later I took to Twitter for guidance on the age cutoff for saying “unforch”. Pointless star Richard Osman told me that one should stop around 65, when one becomes a “pench”. Giles Coren said that it is, in fact, a class cutoff: Tatler girls only, aged between 18 and 55. However, perhaps rashly, I intend to keep saying it. With enough chutzpah I’m sure I can carry it off. Forch favours the bold. That went down well The world of canoeing in Italy has been startled by proposals for an unsinkable kayak called the Surfcruise, put forward by a 21-year-old designer, Rossella Schettino. She says that her dad has helped her with the design. This is the legendary Francesco Schettino, the captain who in 2012 wrecked his cruise ship, the Costa Concordia, by steering it close to the rocks to impress a dancer with whom he was having an onboard liaison. There is something rather magnificent in Rossella not merely going into the unsinkable water-vehicle business but defiantly invoking her dad as an influence. The Costa Concordia itself is also legendary in filmgoing circles as the location for Jean-Luc Godard’s 2010 movie, Film Socialisme. Brilliantly intuiting its terrible fate, Godard used top-heavy cruise ships like the Costa Concordia as symbols of capitalism. Perhaps Godard may now make a short, sharp film about Rossella’s new kayak. • Peter Bradshaw is the Guardian’s film critic"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/30/storm-harvey-texas-louisiana-floods-houston","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T23:57:36Z","webTitle":"Fears of chemical plant explosion as Harvey floods shut down oil refineries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/storm-harvey-texas-louisiana-floods-houston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/storm-harvey-texas-louisiana-floods-houston","fields":{"headline":"Fears of chemical plant explosion as Harvey floods shut down oil refineries","bodyText":"An industrial chemical manufacturer has warned that its plant outside Houston could explode as fears turned to potential fuel contamination and 10 oil refineries in the impact zone of tropical storm Harvey were shut down. Arkema, an industrial chemical manufacturer, warned that its plant, in a rural area near Houston, could explode and that there was “no way to prevent” it. It is unclear how big an explosion might be, and officials have not disclosed the amount of chemicals on site. Employees and nearby residents have been evacuated. According to the Houston Chronicle, the facility lost power from its primary supply and backup generators late Monday night. While the company moved highly volatile organic peroxides into back-up containers to keep them cool, if the chemicals became too hot, they could cause explosions or fires, the paper reported. The storm began to move away from Houston late on Wednesday,, inundating the industrial Texas cities of Beaumont and Port Arthur and making landfall again, coming to shore in south-west Louisiana. Six oil refineries have begun the process of assessing damage and restarting, while two refineries in the Gulf coast region are operating at reduced rates, the department said. A major refinery in Port Arthur was closed on Wednesday after cutting its output to 40% a day earlier. Refineries operated by Exxon, Shell and other companies have released pollutants as torrential rains damaged storage tanks and other industrial facilities on the Texas coast, the Associated Press reported, although it is not clear the significance of the environmental risk they pose. The Houston city center appeared to have relatively little flooding damage, officials said, but the storm leaves mass destruction in its wake. More than 32,000 people are in shelters across Texas, and there are about 107,000 power outages statewide, governor Greg Abbott said. Late Wednesday afternoon, the official death toll rose to 23 after authorities reported that a married couple who drove a pickup truck into floodwaters drowned after a current from a nearby creek swept the vehicle away. Earlier, the Harris County sheriff’s office confirmed two drowning deaths north of Houston. The toll is expected to rise. Also on Wednesday, a submerged van believed to hold six members of a Houston family was located in a muddy water about three meters deep. Efforts to recover the bodies were under way. Separately, officials reported that a three-year-old girl who was found clinging to the body of her drowned mother was likely to be released soon from hospital. A retirement home outside Beaumont was evacuated by airboat, with agents from the Gulf states of Florida and Louisiana participating. The veterans’ administration moved nurses from Dallas, 250 miles north, to relieve nurses in Houston. The Texas department of public safety said 48,700 homes in the area have sustained flood damage, including 17,000 with major damage and 1,000 that were destroyed. The state estimated that 700 businesses had been damaged. Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County flood control district, told the AP that in the Houston area, “the water levels are going down. And that’s for the first time in several days”. But in Port Arthur, near the coast, rescue teams struggled to reach desperate residents. “Hundreds, if not thousands of people are stranded because of high water,” Jeff Branick, a senior administrator in Jefferson County, told the Beaumont Enterprise. “There are people that have crawled into their attic, are on top of the cars because they were not physically able to get on to their roofs.” Cots and belongings were abandoned on the floor of a civic centre in Port Arthur that was serving as a shelter for at least a hundred people when a foot of water rushed in, the Associated Press reported. Evacuees took to bleacher seats; another shelter in Beaumont had reached its 600 capacity. The area, already enduring heavy rain before Harvey’s latest landfall, appeared overwhelmed by flash floods. “Our whole city is underwater right now but we are coming,” Port Arthur mayor Derrick Freeman posted on Facebook overnight. More than 400,000 people live in the Beaumont-Port Arthur area, which is home to numerous industrial facilities, including the country’s largest oil refinery, which was shutting down because of conditions. A meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday that Harvey was “spinning down” but was expected to continue to drop rain on parts of Texas and Louisiana through Wednesday night. Donald Trump tweeted his support on Wednesday morning. “After witnessing first hand the horror &amp; devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey,” the president wrote, “my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!” Trump visited Corpus Christi and Austin on Tuesday. Corpus Christi was hit hard by Harvey when it made landfall on Friday night, but has not suffered serious flooding. The president’s promise of aid was threatened by Republican-sponsored legislation to cut the disaster relief account of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) by $876m. The bill, which was floated before Harvey hit in order to help find money for Trump’s proposed border wall, appears likely to stall. Officials also remained concerned that fear of prosecution among immigrants in the Houston area would discourage some from seeking shelter. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) assigned about 150 employees on Wednesday to help with disaster relief and announced it would not enforce immigration law in storm-impacted areas. Even as the storm moved away from Houston, officials warned that a levee north of the city was in danger of failing, possibly sending water to the rooftops of homes in the immediate area. Some residents have remained despite an evacuation order. The city’s two flood-control reservoirs have received 32in to 35in (81cm to 89cm) of rain since Harvey hit last weekend, according to the Associated Press. “Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding continues in south-eastern Texas and portions of south-western Louisiana,” the National Hurricane Center warned in an advisory early on Wednesday. The storm was forecast to weaken and track to the north-east, bringing rain to parts of Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky by early Saturday. A tropical storm warning was in effect for much of the Louisiana coast. Many roads were impassable along the Texas-Louisiana border. Beaumont police said in a statement on Tuesday that after driving into high water and becoming stuck, a woman floated for about half a mile, holding on to her small child. They were pulled into a boat by first responders who were able to save the child, who had hypothermia, but the woman died. The news was better in Houston, where a rare and welcome sight – blue – appeared on Tuesday afternoon. Residents of the country’s fourth-largest city also woke up, after a curfew period partly designed to guard against looting, to dry and sunny weather. But the situation remained dire. Many streets remain under water and some will be so for days, if not weeks. More shelters have opened to handle the swelling numbers of people seeking refuge and to ease the pressure on the biggest shelter, a downtown convention centre that was operating at double its intended 5,000 capacity.

Leading judges were urged on Wednesday to overturn a government decision to approve a fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire. The last-ditch legal appeal was described by one campaigner as a “challenge to the government’s ‘drill first, ask questions later’ approach to fracking”. Cuadrilla began drilling at its Preston New Road site this month and said it expected to frack at the end of the year. It would be the first fracking operations in Britain since 2011, when tests near Blackpool were established to be the likely cause of tremors of magnitude 2.3. Lancashire council had rejected the plans in 2015 but Javid approved them following a public inquiry. Campaigners tried unsuccessfully to challenge the decision through judicial review, which was heard in March and dismissed by a high court judge in April, but were given the right to appeal. At the start of a two-day hearing, David Wolfe QC, for the anti-fracking campaigners Preston New Road Action Group, submitted that “the secretary of state, through his inspector, misunderstood key local and national planning policies”. In written grounds of appeal, he asked the three judges, Lord Justice Simon, Lord Justice Lindblom and Lord Justice Henderson, to “set aside” the ruling of Mr Justice Dove in the high court and to “quash the secretary of state’s decision”. The campaigners’ solicitors, from the law firm Leigh Day, said the appeal was based on four grounds – that Javid and the inspector made “errors of law” by “misinterpreting” a policy protecting against harm to the landscape; “wrongly applying” the national planning policy framework; denying a fair hearing during the planning inquiry; and “using a wildly different test for assessing the impact on the quality of life of those living nearby”. The judges will hear arguments on behalf of both the communities secretary and Cuadrilla that the challenges should be dismissed. David Elvin QC, on behalf of Javid, said in written submissions that there was “no merit” in any of the arguments put forward by the appellants. A spokeswoman for the Preston New Road Action Group said: “We trust that the secretary of state’s decision to allow fracking at Preston New Road will be found unsound, and Lancashire county council’s original decision will be reinstated. “Even before any fracking has commenced, the local community has been subjected to disruption. They have suffered stress due to the process and, since work commenced on the site, their day-to-day lives have been disrupted by convoys of HGVs, a massive police presence and many road closures.” Gayzer Frackman, an environmental campaigner and appellant in the case, said in a statement before the hearing: “This legal challenge tests the government’s ‘drill first, ask questions later’ approach to fracking. “The government must be held to account for failing to protect UK citizens from the health impacts of fracking and the untold damage it will cause to our environment, our climate, and those living near the site in Lancashire.” Hundreds of anti-fracking activists have campaigned outside the 1.5-hectare (3.7-acre) plot at Preston New Road in the Fylde, Lancashire, for almost a year, with daily clashes erupting between activists and Cuadrilla’s private security contractors earlier this summer. Scuffles between protesters and security guards increased from the start of July as activists marked what they called a month of “rolling resistance”. Cuadrilla has condemned what it described as the “increased illegal and aggressive behaviour of activists”, who it claimed were mostly from outside the area. The firm said this week it remained “confident that the planning consent will not be overturned”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/30/caledonian-sleeper-train-double-beds-revamp-scotland-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T15:22:33Z","webTitle":"Caledonian Sleeper gets double beds and a new look in £150m revamp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/30/caledonian-sleeper-train-double-beds-revamp-scotland-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/30/caledonian-sleeper-train-double-beds-revamp-scotland-london","fields":{"headline":"Caledonian Sleeper gets double beds and a new look in £150m revamp","bodyText":"The sleeper train, beloved of thriller writers and art directors, is making a comeback in Britain. Serco, the operator of the Caledonian Sleeper night trains connecting London and Scotland, has revealed details of a £150m revamp, including en-suite cabins with double beds. Serco took over the Caledonian Sleeper franchise in 2015 promising major improvements, and part-funded by the Scottish government. The company’s chairman, Peter Strachan, has said its aim is to re-establish the Caledonian as “a symbol of Scotland”. The 75 new carriages are being built in Spain, with the first being tested in Czech Republic before travelling to the UK via the Channel Tunnel. They are due to come into service next spring. As well as double beds and private bathrooms for couples – at yet-to-be revealed prices – the carriages will also have wifi, hotel-style key cards and sleek new styling by the Scottish interior designer Ian Smith. Using “patterns reflecting a contemporary Scotland theme”, it will replace the brown panelling and rampant tartan of the old carriages. The death knell had been rung repeatedly for the surviving UK sleeper services, to Scotland and the West Country, and for many more across the continent. It was thought that a nightcap in the dining car and a night in a narrow berth could never compete with budget airlines and the proliferation of short-haul routes. Many services did vanish, but the survivors are fighting back as air travel becomes less alluring with ever-shrinking baggage allowances, strikes and delays, as well as longer queues for security checks and passport control. ÖBB, the Austrian state-owned rail operator, has announced a major expansion of its sleeper service, with “Nightjet” trains targeting business travellers and families as well as tourists, and more trains across Germany, Italy and Switzerland. At the luxury end of the market, passengers are happy to pay more than £2,000 one way from London to Venice for sumptuous travel on the Orient Express, but ÖBB will be competing with airlines with fares such as €149 from to Venice from Vienna. The Scottish sleeper service has run from London since 1850, when steam trains hauled wealthy Victorians out of the grime of the capital to go on hunting and fishing holidays in the Highlands. The operator of the only other UK sleeper line, Great Western’s Night Riviera service to Cornwall, has already upgraded many of its carriages, and is leaning heavily on romance in its advertising. One video, made with Visit Cornwall, collects the fond views of anonymous travellers. One optimistic passenger says: “I’ve never locked my door – you live in hope on the Night Riviera.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/30/st-olaves-pupils-school-exam-results-pass-rates","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T12:40:23Z","webTitle":"The lesson from St Olave’s: pushing out pupils to boost results must stop | Laura McInerney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/30/st-olaves-pupils-school-exam-results-pass-rates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/30/st-olaves-pupils-school-exam-results-pass-rates","fields":{"headline":"The lesson from St Olave’s: pushing out pupils to boost results must stop","bodyText":"In the medical comedy TLC, doctors discovered a genius way to meet targets for cutting NHS waiting lists. They printed their patient list, chopped it in two with scissors, and stuck half of it in the bin. List cut. Job done. Scriptwriters who want to parody the school system may be tempted to copy the joke. A stressed headteacher, seeking to improve the school’s pass rate, rounds up the worst pupils, slings them in a wheelie bin and trundles them towards a dustbin van. This might be funny, if it wasn’t so perilously close to reality. The Guardian’s revelation that St Olave’s, a grammar school in London, asked around 16 pupils to leave halfway through their A-levels because they were not getting B grades in mock exams has shocked readers. It was so widely shared it topped the most-read list on a day when North Korea was launching missiles and the largest state in America was partly underwater. It’s not the first time this has happened. For example, three years ago, students at the London Academy of Excellence, a selective free school for 16- to 19-year-olds, reported they were asked to leave after failing to achieve sufficient AS-level grades that would get them into a top university. Yet, on results day, regular as clockwork, a spokesperson for the school called us at Schools Week, pushing the school’s impressive pass rates and high proportion of pupils attending Oxford and Cambridge. Fewer dud grades means a higher pass rate, which means better marketing, and more praise for the school’s leaders. That said, post-16 education occupies a strange grey area. Access to A-levels is not automatic. Most sixth forms have minimum requirements before pupils can sign up, and St Olave’s and the London Academy of Excellence might argue that not signing pupils into a second year of A-level study is equivalent to not letting them into the course in the first place. Lawyers acting for the families say this practice amounts to an illegal exclusion by the school’s sixth form. We also see this sort of exclusory behaviour happening lower down in schools – albeit less blatantly and to less uproar. Warwick Mansell has been investigating the problem of “missing children” for the past three years. He noticed that schools lauded for a successful turnaround often shrank their intake by around a fifth in a short period of time. While around 7,500 pupils were leaving secondary schools each year, only around 2,000 were reappearing. Where did the missing children go? One hypothesis is that heads encourage parents to remove a low-attaining child and home educate them. By doing so, the school gets the low grades off its data and the parents avoid a formal exclusion for their child that goes on the record. This may explain why home schooling has doubled in the past seven years – with pupils heading towards exams the most likely to be removed. Unfortunately outcomes for pushed-out pupils are pretty poor. The Who’s left report, published earlier this year by research gurus Education Datalab, estimated that around 20,000 pupils leave mainstream schools to go into alternative education – most of whom suffer poor outcomes. Only around 6% of these children achieve even five C grades at GCSE. But excluding low-attaining pupils is good business for a headteacher trying to hit high pass rates. As Datalab researchers noted, exclusions have a “very flattering impact on the league table results of a school”. Hence Rebecca Allen, who heads the research group, has urged the government to ban schools from wiping a child’s data from their books. Instead, she wants the results of pupils who leave to count towards the schools’ final pass rate. “If schools were forced to keep the results of pupils who leave, then GCSE pass rates would fall by up to 17 percentage points in some cases,” the report notes. An alternative approach is banning exclusions altogether. Drew Povey, a headteacher who features in the new Educating Greater Manchester series, due to start on Channel 4 this week, has a firm no-exclusions policy. “Giving up on kids is the worst thing you can do,” he says, “I can’t stand it.” Instead, the school has an extensive behaviour management system and staff trained in therapeutic interventions. It had gone from excluding a pupil every fortnight in 2003 to not having excluded a single child in three years by the time of its last inspection report in 2013. Keeping difficult children on the roll undeniably affects a school’s pass rate, however. And this is where the moral issue gets difficult. Who is a headteacher responsible to? Should one keep a child who is falling behind, or is it better they are educated elsewhere? Is a reputation for great results more important to the wider community than honouring a particular child’s right to continue studying? In the end, the courts will decide. Lawyers acting on behalf of the St Olave’s pupils will put their case in front of a judge later this month. And school leaders who have been pondering throwing kids on to the scrapheap in a bid to improve results would do well to rethink. There’s no comedy in ruining children’s lives. • Laura McInerney is editor of Schools Week.

It has a seasick tilt, as if washed up by tides to the shore. Children try to peer through its tidy windows, but they are just blanks, illusions painted on a brightly coloured structure that turns out to be somewhere between diagram and sculpture. It’s a sight gag, this cartoon beach house – a three- dimensional joke. Another house, almost identical, lies adrift in the harbour. A third is jammed in among the subtropical plants in the park. Richard Woods’s Holiday Home sequence plays upon desirable locations and second homes by the sea, but also upon jerry-built houses, too small for actual families, and tight spots such as cliffs and carparks. Folkestone faces Calais over the water; some people apparently think the house in the harbour might have arrived on an immigrant boat. Woods has got the measure of the Folkestone Triennial. His houses are visually and politically acute; they speak directly to the place and the times; and they’re visible at considerable distance. This is significant in what amounts to an elaborate treasure hunt that sends the visitor, armed with a map, all over the town and wider coast every three years, searching for contemporary art. Way along the shore, past the bodies sizzling on Sunny Sands, you clamber the cliffs to Bob and Roberta Smith’s message on the high Martello tower. “Folkestone is an art school,” the painted declaration insists, in ice-cream colours. The golfers on their last hole are paying no attention. “But what does it mean?” asks a tourist. Four miles in the opposite direction, past the Lubaina Himid Jelly Mould Pavilion and what will one day be the stainless steel Bill Woodrow sculpture, if the welders ever finish, David Shrigley has concealed a neat quip. Among the Victorian lamp posts that run along gracious Clifton Crescent, he has planted one more, a bit stunted and angular, definitely missing the globe and the general elegance. It is made from memory – a modern version of the past, low and very slightly cheapened. Folkestone’s economic base, according to the gaseous hype, is “in transition from seasonal tourism to creative industries” (Shrigley’s lamp perhaps sends up the latter). This once-faded town is certainly awash with studios, galleries and assorted “spaces”, many of them along central Tontine Street, bombed in the first world war and still showing signs of a run-down past. Having failed to get planning permission to build a visitor centre – local opposition apparently centred on perceived disrespect to the bomb victims – the triennial has set up HQ in the Quarterhouse, halfway down the street, with an installation by Studio Ben Allen. Allen, who once worked with Olafur Eliasson, has erected a gothic cathedral of plywood traceries, mirrors at each end, so that the fan vaulting seems to run on for ever. This is beautiful, but too many architectural interventions in the 2017 Triennial put design some way before art. The Balinese-British artist Sinta Tantra has applied geometric forms in seaside poster colours to the exterior of the Cube on Tontine Street. This concrete box certainly needs cheering up, but a coat of paint hardly cuts it. Wong Hoy Cheong has added a false facade of minarets to the Islamic Community Centre. Gary Woodley has painted black and white polyhedrons on one of the beachside tunnels on Coronation Parade, a glum and negligible experience not improved by being tricky to find. That’s the problem with any art trail; the outcome is affected by the journey. The pilgrimage to the Rijksmuseum, say, can enhance every second spent in front of the paintings, whereas a hunt among the pubs and net-curtained windows of Folkestone for Amalia Pica’s many shells, configured in post-surreal arrangements, makes these sculptures seem even more trivial. “Folkestone is an art school”: the legend is printed over and again, on banners, posters, billboards at the station and beach. To some extent, Bob and Roberta Smith – AKA Patrick Brill – has a serious point. Brill has amassed a directory of classes, facilities, talents and events in Folkestone: ideal for the would-be art student, simply outside of an institution. But more than that, his words urge you to look more closely at the town itself, at the earthworks on the beach, the classical arena in the Leas, the variegated colours of the Old High Street, even the bubble-bright buoys festooning the boats. Of course, Brill’s piece alludes to itself as a triennial commission (and performs as a marketing ploy, what’s more). It is as temporary as Lubaini Himid’s lovely pavilion on the beach, a giant jelly mould – starred inside like the Alhambra – standing on twisted sugar pillars. People sheltering inside, incidentally, may have no sense of the connection Himid is making between the history of slavery and sugar. But still the sculpture succeeds on its own terms, with its end-of-the-pier connotations. Whereas Antony Gormley’s loan of two rusting Gorms, stock still and staring out to sea, aren’t such a perfect fit. One of these iron men can only be seen from the Harbour Arm when the tide is out, no doubt making it this year’s biggest draw. But the other is hidden in the last of the Coronation Parade chambers, viewed through dozens of linked and sea-weathered arches. Gormley is not short; his body cast of himself is too high and mighty for these modest surroundings. The Gorms will go, but some of the glories of past triennials are still present all over town – most wonderfully, Christian Boltanski’s park benches, where you may sit and hear readings from the letters of first world war soldiers who passed through Folkestone on their way to almost certain death in the trenches. Perhaps some of this year’s strongest works will also be kept, specifically those with the keenest sense of place – Marc Schmitz and Dolgor Ser-Od’s giant shell-cum-gramophone, for instance, that seems to have fallen to Earth on the East Cliff. This puts you right on the spot. Lend it your ear and the sound of distant oceans is marvellously magnified; talk into it and your voice carries out and away into the wild blue yonder. • The Folkestone Triennial runs until 5 November"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/01/album-dead-all-hail-rise-of-era-u2-taylor-swift-katy-perry","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T12:29:08Z","webTitle":"Achtung, maybe?

Like, “It is a truth universally acknowledged”, in fact. Or – in the case of easy-to-prejudge Pride (In the Name of Love) hitmakers U2 – a recent letter sent to fans. The missive consisted of text banging on about William Blake, employed the blackout poetry technique to tease something on u2.com, and promised “U2 will announce [REDACTED] on [REDACTED]”. Bono handing the Edge some Sharpies would seem to mark the start of a new album campaign. Except that we don’t call them “album campaigns” any more; this is the era of the “era”. The album format is not dead yet but fans and now even artists have pre-emptively shifted their vocabulary, with eras representing something solid while traditional albums become ever more nebulous. Headlining Latitude this year, the 1975’s Matty Healy said of the band’s last album: “Tonight is the end of that era. Tonight is the start of an era called Music for Cars.” Some artists signify eras more subtly (thedaftclub.com offers a history of Daft Punk’s era-specific helmet progression). Others offer a clear visual ringfence that runs through their artwork, videos and stage design; Madonna, Bowie and Pet Shop Boys have all offered multiple iconic moodboards, each tied to an album release. Social media makes it even simpler to herald the dawn of a new era. Frank Ocean went down to Wickes and made a staircase; last month, Taylor Swift (whose new video is a celebration of multiple Swift eras) opted for a blackout across her social channels, the online equivalent of that lose-your-shit moment when the house lights go off before an arena show. In 2013, Swift’s great showbiz pal Katy Perry established herself as the queen of era division when she posted footage of a burning blue wig, signifying the end of the Teenage Dream era as Roar approached. But working as an era artist can bring problems: if it starts badly you have no option but to ride it out. Perry has found this during her current album era, but only has herself to blame. The era rulebook is brief – consistent typography, a distinct colour palette and so on – but one law must be followed: never change your hairstyle mid-era. That, future pop historians will note, was where Perry’s Witness era stumbled. Let’s hope Bono is happy with his current barnet: for guaranteed success he’ll be stuck with it for at least two years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/aug/30/keith-mann-the-inside-man-who-has-exposed-tech-industry-sexism","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T12:33:15Z","webTitle":"Keith Mann: the ‘inside man’ who has exposed tech-industry sexism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/aug/30/keith-mann-the-inside-man-who-has-exposed-tech-industry-sexism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/aug/30/keith-mann-the-inside-man-who-has-exposed-tech-industry-sexism","fields":{"headline":"Keith Mann: the ‘inside man’ who has exposed tech-industry sexism","bodyText":"Name: Keith Mann.

Shocking, I know, but Gazin and Dwyer grew weary of dealing with male designers and developers who were condescending, disrespectful, dismissive and slow to respond. Nerds are like that with everyone. They weren’t like that with Keith. “It would take me days to get a response,” Dwyer told Fast Company, “but Keith could not only get a response and a status update, but also be asked if he wanted anything else or if there was anything else that Keith needed help with.” I like the way this Keith does business.

Ashley claims his former “trusted friend” Tony Jimenez, an executive at Newcastle United under Ashley until 2008, lured him into handing over £3m linked to a fraudulent investment in a French golf course. The Sports Direct boss is seeking £3m plus interest of about £800,000 in recompense for breach of contract. The lawsuit comes shortly after Ashley successfully fought off a legal claim by former Sports Direct executive Jeff Blue over a £15m deal allegedly made in a London pub during a “night of heavy drinking”. Mr Justice Leggatt, the judge who oversaw that case, said he found it “a lot more interesting than some” but ruled that no one would have thought what Ashley said in the pub was “serious”. In legal documents filed at the high court in London, Ashley says that in May 2008 he agreed to pay Jimenez £3m, which he believed would be invested in the Loire-based golf course Les Bordes in return for a 5% “or thereabouts” stake in the site’s owner. The two men agreed verbally that the investment would be paid to Jimenez’s company South Horizon, which was said to be in a position to provide the stake in Les Bordes’ holding company, according to the court documents. Ashley’s high court claim says Jimenez, a former co-owner of Charlton Athletic football club, practised a “deliberate fraud” in order to retain the money for himself without securing the golf course investment. It alleges that Jimenez reassured Ashley the investment was effective and his interest in the shares was being formalised when he knew that was not the case. In 2013 Ashley became aware, according to the documents, of a claim brought by former footballer Dennis Wise over a £500,000 investment in the same golf course. The judge ordered Jimenez to pay Wise compensation of that sum saying that he had been “guilty of considerable obfuscation” concerning the money paid to him. Ashley’s claim says he made inquiries that led to his lawyers receiving confirmation that neither he or Jimenez’s South Horizon were, or had ever been, investors in Les Bordes’ Cyprus-based holding company. When confronted with that evidence, Jimenez claimed Ashley had been too late in sending the £3m and so had lost the opportunity to purchase the shares in Les Bordes, according to the court filing. It was allegedly said Ashley had agreed the sum would not be returned but used as an advance payment of a fee claimed to be owed to Jimenez for procuring a purchaser for Newcastle United. The claim says: “Jimenez did not have any honest belief that he was entitled to the investment sum or to dispose of it,” and that the story about the fee advance was “no more than a dishonest attempt to justify and explain the wrongful disposal and/or misapplication of Mr Ashley’s money”. Details of the case have emerged before Sports Direct’s annual shareholder meeting in Shirebrook next week. Unlike last year, when he toured the company’s controversial warehouse with City analysts and journalists, Ashley is not expected to attend. In a statement issued last week, the company said Ashley faced “conflicting demands for his time in other areas of the business” and so, in a highly unusual move for a listed company, had won the agreement of the board not to be “required to attend”. Jimenez was unavailable for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/31/new-arrivals-update-how-germany-coping-refugee-influx","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T07:26:00Z","webTitle":"New arrivals update: how is Germany coping with its refugee influx?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/31/new-arrivals-update-how-germany-coping-refugee-influx","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/31/new-arrivals-update-how-germany-coping-refugee-influx","fields":{"headline":"New arrivals update: how is Germany coping with its refugee influx?","bodyText":"Two years ago, Germany was turned upside down by the biggest movement of refugees since the second world war. How would it cope? Would Germans, with their famed efficiency, rise to the challenge? And what of those who had finally made it to safety – what future awaited them? One of the aims of the New Arrivals project has been to try to find answers to these questions, working as a team across newspapers in four different European countries. Der Spiegel set to work identifying a compelling case study: a family of eight that had settled in northern Germany and in many senses provided a neat microcosm of the challenges and opportunities facing the new arrivals. With the country facing general elections on 24 September, our Berlin correspondent, Kate Connolly, teamed up with counterparts at Der Spiegel to visit the family and report their story for the Guardian. Separately, to mark the two-year anniversary of the moment Angela Merkel urged her compatriots “we can do this”, Andrew Curry has been to investigate a programme tackling one of the biggest problems facing newly arrived refugees: the lack of services to help them face PTSD and other mental traumas.

Often it comes down to excruciating choices: something to eat, or a bus home? Finally, the tortuous process facing the people in our own case studies.

According to this view, Dugdale jumped before she was pushed, pre-empting the challenge she would have faced sooner or later as punishment for opposing Corbyn from the start – a position rendered unsustainable by the UK leader’s better-than-expected performance in June’s general election. Confirmation of the untenability of her situation came, on this reading, with Corbyn’s successful trip to Scotland last week, in which he played to packed houses in 18 constituencies, suggesting Dugdale was out of step with her own party faithful on the Corbyn question. Viewed like this, her successor is bound to be a loyal Corbynite who will give the UK leader what he currently lacks: a majority on the UK party’s ruling national executive committee. That all sounds logical enough, but it might be a tad too glib. For one thing, the explanation for Dugdale’s departure may not reside solely in the jockeying of political factions. It’s just possible that the human reasons Dugdale cited in her resignation letter played a crucial part too. Those who know her well say that exhaustion – with election upon referendum upon election over the past two years – was real, as was the toll on her personal life. Political analysts are meant to raise an arched eyebrow at such things, as if they are only ever cover stories for the real, political motivation underneath. But every now and again the human factor is genuine and decisive. Even viewed politically, the instant reading is suspect. Seasoned observers are sceptical that a leadership challenge in Scotland was imminent. If the Corbynites were truly readying to pounce, then there would be an obvious Corbynite candidate standing by. But there isn’t. Neil Findlay has told the Guardian he is not running, and there are doubts over fellow MSPs Alex Rowley and Richard Leonard. Instead the early money is on Anas Sarwar, usually described as a moderate and a pragmatist. It’s quite clear that the next Scottish Labour leader will have to be publicly at peace with Corbyn. The Labour leader’s support is building among Scottish party members and supporters, as last week’s tour showed. Corbyn’s message – against austerity, for public ownership – strikes a chord with many Scots who had abandoned the party in recent years. The new Scottish leader will have to be in tune with that sentiment. But that does not mean that Dugdale’s successor is bound to be a card-carrying Corbynite. It’s worth recalling that the one place where Corbyn lost outright in 2016 to his challenger Owen Smith was not Smith’s home turf of Wales, but Scotland. Scottish party members preferred Smith to Corbyn by 18 points. Scottish Labour membership has increased in the Corbyn period, but not by the phenomenal degree it has elsewhere in the UK. The scope for a Momentum-style surge in Scotland is limited. The left is a crowded marketplace in Scotland, with competition from the SNP but also the wider yes movement, including the Radical Independence Campaign, to say nothing of a Scottish Green party that can claim more MSPs than the Lib Dems.

Top stories Senator Derryn Hinch faces questions over his eligibility after he admitted having a US social security number, and being entitled to a US pension. Hinch, who says he gained the number during time working in New York as a journalist, will seek advice from the solicitor general. He said he paid social security tax for a decade, and income tax, which gives him an entitlement to a pension. “That’s not a privilege, it’s a payment for tax I paid in the 1960s and 1970s,” he said. If the crossbencher ends up in the high court, he will join the two Greens (Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters), three government ministers (Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash and Matt Canavan), the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts, and Nick Xenophon, the leader of the NXT. The query over Hinch follows the constitutional law expert George Williams predicting on Wednesday that all the parliamentarians before the high court were in trouble. Williams, who is the dean of law at UNSW, told the National Press Club that “on the current law it is difficult to see ... that any of the seven parliamentarians who will face the high court are likely to survive that challenge”. The governor of Texas has said the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey has affected a bigger area than Hurricane Katrina and that federal help should be “well in excess” of outlays for the historic 2005 disaster. Hundreds of people were feared cut off by floodwaters on Wednesday as Harvey spared Houston overnight but moved east, inundating the industrial Texas cities of Beaumont and Port Arthur before making landfall again in south-west Louisiana.

A former Obama administration official says he believes the Trump administration has given Australia tacit approval to move ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, despite the president disavowing and dumping the agreement as one of his first acts in office. Matthew Goodman, who served as White House coordinator for Asia-Pacific economic cooperation in the previous administration, said he believed the Trump administration had given Australia licence to “just keep the seat warm for the United States”. Goodman said the US in the Trump era had to look for “workarounds” given it had enduring interests, both economic and strategic, in this region. States and territories are powering ahead with policies that will meet Australia’s internationally agreed greenhouse gas emission targets. Despite being chastised by the federal government for unilateral action, South Australia is showing the way, with the ACT and Tasmania not far behind, according to a report by the Climate Council. Compared on measures including penetration of renewable energy, the percentage of households with solar, as well as emissions and renewable energy targets, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and New South Wales are at the back of the pack, with Victoria and Queensland in the middle. The federal government did not know the length of waiting lists for local drug treatment services when it chose three trial sites to drug test welfare recipients, an inquiry has been told. Ministers plan to drug test 5,000 welfare recipients in Logan, Queensland, Bankstown-Canterbury in Sydney, and Mandurah in Western Australia. Welfare recipients will be referred for treatment after two failed tests, and risk having their welfare cut off if they fail to engage with drug services. A Senate inquiry into the government’s welfare reforms heard on Wednesday the government did not have specific data on waiting lists for drug treatment services in the three trial sites before they were chosen. Sport It’s day three of the US Open and a bad day for Nick Kyrgios, who has been knocked out in the first round by John Millman. “Happy for you, good luck,” says Kyrgios to his fellow Aussie, ranked 152 in the world. That’s sporting, but one of the most talked about players in men’s tennis won’t be talked about as a contender for the title any more. You can follow events live here. Meanwhile, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal faced contrasting challenges in the first round, writes Kevin Mitchell at Flushing Meadows. The Socceroos can book their ticket to Russia when they meet Japan in a crucial World Cup qualifier tonight.

Thinking time Social media has provided a learning curve for one photographer who shot a stock picture that, years later, has become the meme of the moment. “I didn’t even know what a meme is until recently,” said Antonio Guillem of the “distracted boyfriend” photograph, which features one smirking man and two women – one being ogled (in a red = alluring danger dress), the other visibly put out. It has now become such a widespread vehicle for pretty much any point you want to pick that the models’ faces are now being used out of context. Perhaps in answer to its enduring appeal, model “Laura” says: “I think everyone once in their lives has been the girl in the red dress; maybe without being looked at with such brazenness.” For both women and men in the workforce the progress of 30 years has hit a peak and full-time work is dissipating. But for women the implications are graver, writes Greg Jericho. Where women have increasingly taken on full-time work, now the desire to work full-time is increasingly outstripping the work available – which is why there is now a record level of women aged 15-35 who are underemployed. The problems that lie ahead for young men and women are somewhat different, though sadly neither is all that positive for the millennial generation. Xan Brooks has assessed the opening of the Venice film festival and has been convinced: the best things come in small packages. He refers to Downsizing, featuring a 12-centimetre Matt Damon, a five-star masterpiece that he describes as a “gorgeous, giddy parable of a modern-day Lilliput”. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has applied his diplomatic blowtorch to the nuclear stand-off in North Korea, saying the US has been paying the regime “extortion money” for years and that “talking is not the answer”. It is the latest piece of rhetoric to emerge after the US president said on Tuesday that “all options are on the table”. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald says Christopher Pyne’s seat could be imperilled by a redraw of boundaries based on population data. It says ABC election analyst Antony Green believes the Labor seat of Makin could be abolished and Labor voters might be absorbed into the minister’s seat of Sturt. The redistribution might cost the Coalition three seats overall. The Daily Telegraph whipped its graphics team into chiselling out a statue of Anthony Albanese and holding him up as a “monument to reason” after the Labor frontbencher spoke out on the colonisation debate. Albanese said there were “far greater issues facing the First Australians than what’s on a statue”. The West Australian has part six, yes part six, of its free Diana magazine.

Recently, some cities have made great strides: from the ambitious public squares programmes of New York and Paris to the pedestrianisation of major streets (realised in the case of Strøget in Copenhagen; proposed in the case of London’s Oxford Street and Madrid’s Gran Vía. Jeff Speck’s grandly titled General Theory of Walkability states that a journey on foot should satisfy four main conditions: be useful, safe, comfortable and interesting. In his book Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step at a Time, he argues that the “fabric” of the city – the variety of buildings, frontages and open spaces – is key. North American, Australian and Canadian cities, which were built for cars, have the challenge of retrofitting walking infrastructure. Older European cities, which were built with walking in mind, have good fabric. This can make them walkable even if they lack pavements, crossings and other infrastructure for pedestrians – as is the case in Rome, says Speck. “Rome, at first glance, seems horribly inhospitable to pedestrians,” he notes. “Half the streets are missing sidewalks, most intersections lack crossings, pavements are uneven and rutted, disabled ramps are largely absent.” But despite all this, as well as its hills and famously aggressive driving, this “anarchic obstacle course is somehow a magnet for walkers”. Why? Because Rome’s fabric is superb. Is it possible to measure a city’s walkability? Walk Score, which lets prospective renters and buyers choose homes based on walkability, ranks cities in the US, Canada and Australia. New York tops the US list for 2017 at an overall 89 out of 100, with Little Italy and Union Square scoring full marks. San Francisco ranked second, followed by Boston. Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal rank 1-2-3 in Canada; while Australia’s most walkable cities are Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. New York famously began its urban transformation programme in 2007, its flagship scheme the part-pedestrianisation of Times Square two years later. The former transportation commissioner for New York City, Janette Sadik-Khan, said: “We changed the city from places people wanted to park to places people wanted to be – street space to seat space,” she said. “On 23rd St, where three streets meet, we created 65,000 sq ft of public space. People choose to sit on the street rather than the park.” Like most transportation experts, Sadik-Khan believes walkability is about more than safety – it is about economic competitiveness, too. According to the UN, well-planned cities should have 30-35% of their land dedicated to streets to get the benefits of high connectivity. Manhattan scores 36%. New York City is far from perfect, scoring third worst in an Inrix analysis of congestion from 1,064 cities in 38 countries, with commuters spending on average 89.4 hours a year stuck in traffic. But what was achieved in the city – first in showcase projects built quickly and with cheap materials like paint, benches and planters – opened people’s eyes to what was possible. Sadik-Khan now works with city mayors around the world via Nacto (the US National Association of City Transportation Officials), recently publishing a tactical urbanism manual, Street Fight: Handbook for an Urban Revolution, to help other planners learn from her experience. Nacto and Sadik-Khan’s work on the Paris Pietons programme clearly draws a lot on New York’s example. By 2020, seven city squares will be redesigned, giving 50% more space to those on bike and on foot. The Place de la République was transformed from a roundabout back to a square in 2013. “Opponents said it would be chaos, but it is not the case,” says Paris’ deputy mayor for transport, Christophe Najdovski. “It is now a place where people can rest, where families with children and older people can come.” Under the Paris-Plages scheme, a former road space on the Seine and La Villette canal basin is turned into a “seaside” resort each summer. Since the city first banned cars from parts of the Right Bank in 2002, the seasonal festival has expanded each year, and is now on both banks of the river. Paris was made for walking, but cars have taken over, Najdovski says. “You can walk from one end of Paris to the other in less than two hours,” he adds, “but historically the city had to adapt itself to cars.” The result: pollution and congestion. Now, walking is a “principal policy”. In the words of Jan Gehl: “Life happens on foot. Man was created to walk, and all of life’s events large and small develop when we walk among other people. There is so much more to walking than walking. There is direct contact between people and the surrounding community, fresh air, time outdoors …” Cities around the world are taking steps. Madrid introduced water fountains to help pedestrians cope with the hot summers. Medellín, in Colombia, built cable cars to link up poor neighbourhoods with employment centres, introduced library parks and widened its pavements to encourage walking. Melbourne, in Australia, transformed unloved alleyways used primarily for rubbish into its now famous “laneways” – buzzing outdoor seating for coffee shops and restaurants. Guangzhou in China has among the highest levels of walking in the world. Redevelopment of the banks of the Pearl river to create an ecological corridor has connected six paths, resulting in 60 miles of greenways, linking tourist attractions and sporting venues serving seven million people. In May, Seoul opened its own version of the High Line. Seoullo 7017 – a half-mile “sky garden” created from a 1970s motorway flyover – is the latest step in a bold plan to transform the city for pedestrians. A decade earlier, the city’s Cheonggyecheon freeway, another four-lane elevated road, was torn down, and the dirty creek beneath reopened to the sky, its riverbanks to walkers. London is moving forward too, with the proposed transformation of Oxford Street, where pedestrians have been crammed on to narrow pavements between queues of buses for decades. Next year, the street will become what Val Shawcross, the deputy mayor for transport, calls a “world-class pedestrian space”, with buses and taxis banished. The idea is to route buses to the street, rather than through it, as part of a project to cut traffic and encourage walking and cycling in the area, ahead of the Crossrail opening at the end of 2018. Some cities, like Dallas, Texas, and Beijing, are going backwards, according to Mario Alves from the International Federation of Pedestrians. As well as cities where a conscious effort has been made to improve conditions for people on foot, some cities are walkable because of their historic centres. There’s Florence in Italy, Vientiane in Laos, Kyoto in Japan – but the most striking is perhaps Fes el Bali, a walled section of Fez, Morocco’s second largest city. Founded in the 9th century, it is believed to be the world’s biggest car-free zone, and its medieval streets are so narrow that rubbish is still collected by donkey. The beauty of the city, in terms of walkability, is its density: 156,000 residents live in an area just 3.5km sq. As a result, almost all trips are by foot – and children can play on the streets. So, where is the most walkable city? Walk Score makes the case for New York in the US, Vancouver in Canada and Sydney in Australia, but what about Paris? Or Fes el Bali? While it seems impossible to give a definitive answer, Alves says tackling cars in cities is key to encouraging walking. “Noise and air pollution are the biggest problems for walking and safety,” he says. “The less traffic you have in a city, the safer it is. Speed is very connected with safety and noise and pedestrians feel much more comfortable to sit down when a street is 30kph or 20mph. When we have low traffic the quality of walking and cycling increases automatically.” Enrique Peñalosa, the mayor of Bogotá in Colombia, which pioneered closing city streets to cars once a week, agrees. “God made us walking animals – pedestrians,” he says. “As a fish needs to swim, a bird to fly, a deer to run, we need to walk; not in order to survive, but to be happy.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/30/ireland-consider-irexit-avoid-brexit-damage-academic-ray-kinsella","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T11:41:31Z","webTitle":"Ireland should consider 'Irexit' to avoid Brexit damage, says academic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/30/ireland-consider-irexit-avoid-brexit-damage-academic-ray-kinsella","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/30/ireland-consider-irexit-avoid-brexit-damage-academic-ray-kinsella","fields":{"headline":"Ireland should consider 'Irexit' to avoid Brexit damage, says academic","bodyText":"Ireland should seriously consider exiting the EU to avoid being left marginalised and economically damaged by Brexit, a leading academic in Dublin has said. The economist Ray Kinsella said the country was too peripheral to the economic bloc’s core interests and Brussels could not be trusted to look after Ireland’s interests. “Brexit means Ireland, which shares a common stance on key issues with the UK, is left marginalised, peripheral and dependent. That reality bears reflecting upon,” he said in an article in the Irish Times on Wednesday. His views, while controversial, will be food for thought for Irish businesses, which face significant economic damage from the prospect of hard Brexit. The Irish government recently rejected similar calls to consider an “Irexit” but Kinsella, a professor of banking and financial services and healthcare at University College Dublin, and a respected commentator on the Irish economy, argues that Ireland’s interests are so tied up with the UK’s that it may not be able to afford to stay within the EU. The UK is Ireland’s biggest export partner and the prospect of tariffs, particularly on food including beef and dairy products, is seen as a significant threat to the economy. Kinsella said Ireland would be more vulnerable if the UK left the EU because the bloc was a “flawed monetary union, skewed towards surplus countries”. He also said the EU could not be trusted to protect Ireland’s interests. It would be “prudent” for voters to remember how the EU forced Ireland to pursue an onerous debt restructuring during the financial crash as part of its strategy to protect the eurozone, he said. “Amnesia can be a terrible thing. It is only prudent to remember that in the bailout negotiations the European Central Bank cut the ground from underneath Ireland when we were at our most vulnerable,” said Kinsella, pointing out that the International Monetary Fund had advocated against the ECB’s harsh stance. In 2010 and 2011 Ireland was forced into a €70bn bailout funded by the ECB, the IMF and the EU but the deal left taxpayers on the hook for private banking debt, leading to a tsunami of increased taxes, salary cuts, job losses, bust businesses and mass emigration. Kinsella said Irexit could restore a measure of control and autonomy and what he described as “suffocating oversight” from Brussels. While Irexit is seen as an unrealistic prospect with almost 90% of Irish voters supporting continued membership of the EU, Kinsella, along with others, believes it should at least be part of the national conversation surrounding Brexit. Earlier this year, the former Irish ambassador to Canada Ray Bassett also argued in favour of Irexit, saying politicians had to break the groupthink over Europe. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, dismissed the former diplomat’s claims, saying Ireland’s best interests were to remain in the EU. He said it was “a common European home that we helped to build and we’re going to stay where we belong, at the heart of it”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/02/how-khaled-hosseini-finds-hope-in-telling-refugees-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T08:00:09Z","webTitle":"How Khaled Hosseini finds hope in telling refugees' stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/02/how-khaled-hosseini-finds-hope-in-telling-refugees-stories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/02/how-khaled-hosseini-finds-hope-in-telling-refugees-stories","fields":{"headline":"How Khaled Hosseini finds hope in telling refugees' stories","bodyText":"I arrive at the nondescript office in San Jose where I am to meet Khaled Hosseini in the middle of a once-in-a-lifetime solar eclipse. The Californian light has a strange quality, silvery and laden. When Hosseini opens the door, I barely get out a formal greeting before he interrupts. “Have you seen it?” he asks. He is tall and dashing, and carries himself with a Clooney-esque, grizzled charm. “C’mon,” he says, handing me a pair of specially made sunglasses and darting off towards the back of the building. He points to a spot in the rear courtyard. “Right there,” he says. “That’s the best spot.” I put on the sunglasses and look up at the sky. The sun is a perfect circle, cut neatly into a crescent by the dark round shadow of the moon. It is like nothing I have ever seen. I had tried and failed to watch the eclipse from my car as I drove to the meeting, but what Hosseini shows me is many orders of magnitude more breathtaking. After a moment I take off the glasses and look in his direction. He is beaming proudly, as though seeing the sun through my eyes. When we start the interview, the novelist is just as attentive. He peppers me with questions about who I am and where I am from long before I get a chance to turn on the recorder. There is a sense that his travels throughout the world as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a post he has held for more than a decade, most recently in Uganda, have given him an increased appreciation for his life and whoever is in front of him. His primary contribution has been to speak with those fleeing fighting in countries such as Afghanistan, Chad, Iraq, Jordan and Uganda and to write their stories down, much as he did for his characters Amir and Hassan in his bestselling 2003 novel The Kite Runner. Another writer faced with such unexpected success (The Kite Runner sold more than 7m copies in the US alone) might have retreated from the world. But Hosseini, himself a fugitive from war, has instead committed himself to quietly documenting the lives of more recent refugees, in the hope his writing will spur the world to take notice of their plight. “Everybody knows there’s a war,” he tells me, “but once you feel what that war means, I think for most people it’s unfathomable not to act on it, even if it’s in a small way. It becomes that much harder to simply dismiss or move past. It prickles your consciousness.” In a sense, Hosseini’s entire mission as a writer has been to prickle the consciousness of the western world. His father was an Afghan diplomat working in Paris when Russia invaded his home country in 1979. His family sought asylum in the US and Hosseini arrived at 15 years old, with only a limited grasp of English. He went on to attend medical school and began practising as a doctor in California. While still working as a physician, he began writing The Kite Runner,hoping to share what life in his homeland had been like. “I expected the book to resonate with people who were interested in the region, who maybe were interested in Afghanistan specifically,” he remembers. “But the degree to which it caught on … it did take me by surprise quite a bit.” The Kite Runner spent 110 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Hosseini followed it up with A Thousand Splendid Suns in 2007 and together, his first two books sold 38m worldwide. But before writing his third and most recent novel, 2013’s And the Mountains Echoed, he began his work with UNHCR, an experience that he says changed him as a writer. “I think my third book was a quieter book. It dealt less with archetypes, [is] a little bit more complex,” he says. “Displacement, refugees, these things are still very much with me … I think I live now, not preoccupied, but engaged in my mind with bigger issues than I was when I writing The Kite Runner.” His latest work is a short story, Sea Prayer, which has been transformed into a virtual reality project in a collaboration with UNHCR and the Guardian. It is a terse and devastating story, told by a father who has sent his son on a boat from Syria and pleads with the vast waters to keep his child safe. The novelist was inspired to write it after seeing the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in 2015 after the boat he was on, destined for Europe, capsized. When his lifeless body washed ashore in Turkey, the shocking photos sparked a huge global reaction, transforming the child into a tragic symbol of the crisis in Syria. At least 8,500 more people have been lost in the Mediterranean since Kurdi died. “The way I thought about it, when I saw the photo, was all the unseen work that goes into the raising of a child,” says Hosseini. “All the private worries, the private anxieties, the making sure they have this, the making sure that they eat properly, that they’re vaccinated, that their clothes fit them, they’re not uncomfortable, that they sleep well, that they get their vitamins. We worry and fret over their wellbeing, and to have done all that work, and see the person that you poured all that love and all that passion and all that work into, and to see that body lying face down on the beach …” He trails off. In the virtual reality project, Sea Prayer is transformed into an immersive painting by artist Liz Edwards, using Tilt Brush technology, to appear with flourishes and splatters of paint in time with the narration, read by Bafta-winning actor Adeel Akhtar. Alongside the visuals is a haunting score composed by musician David Coulter, working with the the Kronos Quartet, an ensemble who donated their time to score the piece. Reading – and watching – Sea Prayer, I am struck not only by the beauty but by the futility it represents; the father pleads with the sea, but the sea either cannot or will not answer his prayers. I ask Hosseini if he remains optimistic, even after spending much of the last decade immersed in the darkest aspects of humanity. “If I don’t have faith or confidence that by doing the work that we do we make [a] difference, then I would live in a really cynical world that I don’t find to be a productive way of living,” he says. “There, the game is really over. At least this way there’s a hope that somebody will connect with these stories.” Hosseini’s hope, as tempered as it may be, is impressive. It is one thing to feel optimism when seated in a comfortable home in a country not quite at war, but quite another to travel and sit with people who have barely escaped unspeakable darkness, and still feel that a difference, no matter how small, must and can be made. • This article was amended on 5 September 2017 because an earlier version to the characters in the Kite Runner as “Amir and Hazara”.

It had set aside this time to discuss a major construction project proposed by a high profile company based there in the sprawling Los Angeles basin. The company was Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, the rocket-building offshoot of the electric car company Tesla, run by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. SpaceX had recently spun off another entity, this one aimed at disrupting the tunnel boring business, cheekily named the Boring Company – and it needed the City of Hawthorne’s cooperation. “We want to prove our technology,” Brett Horton, senior director of facilities and construction at SpaceX, told the city council. The company had recently purchased a used tunnel boring machine from another California city and had begun testing its capabilities below its parking lot. But SpaceX wants to go further, tunnelling a roughly two-mile path beyond its property line and under the streets of Hawthorne. It’s a fairly quotidian infrastructural endeavour, but one tied to a grand vision. Musk wants to build a vast network of tunnels below cities like Los Angeles in which cars and people will be whisked across town on electrically driven platforms at speeds of 125mph. Like the swooping and merging lanes of an interstate highway, the tunnels would criss-cross the metropolis, far below ground level. Elevators would bring cars, cargo and other vehicles down into tunnels and into the system of tubes on what the Boring Company calls an “electric skate”, then back up another elevator at the desired destination – apparently bypassing all traffic above ground. “Traffic is driving me nuts,” Musk tweeted in December. “Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging …” The digging has begun. The company has bored about 160 feet under its own property, with no reported complications. The proposed two-mile extension is being presented as a laboratory for increasing the speed and reducing the cost of tunnelling. It’s a new frontier for a parent organisation that has already developed transformative automobile and rocket technologies. “The next step is to use what we learn to make stronger, faster tunnel boring machines, to make a safe transportation system, and then to figure out where we want to go next,” Horton told the city council. “If you’ve had the opportunity to look at the videos online, it’s not a secret. We want these tunnels to be everywhere. We want to duplicate the road network in LA underground. “We want to prove that we can solve traffic once and for all,” he said. From the aspirational to the absurd Usually these types of proposed projects don’t get built. Sometimes they’re mere marketing or self-promotion, other times they’re earnest suggestions for a better world – either way, they’re almost always able to generate a conversation. “Visionary proposals are an essential way to come together in discussion about the city,” says Nicholas de Monchaux, an associate professor of architecture and urban design at the University of California, Berkeley. Big ideas for the future city are nothing new, and although these schemes can sometimes seem preposterous in their ambitions, de Monchaux says they have a power to inspire. One of the earliest and most enduring visions of an ideal society is presented in the book Utopia, published in 1516 by the lawyer and philosopher Thomas More. “Utopia literally described an island of cities that didn’t exist and couldn’t exist,” says de Monchaux. “But utopias help us think about the world as it actually is and ways we might want to change it – or not.” Perhaps because of its role in modern life and its impact on urban form, transportation has long been the starting point for these thought experiments. And as technology evolves, these ideas have taken on a variety of new forms, ranging from the aspirational to the absurd. Near the far end of that spectrum, a company in China gathered global attention in 2016 with plans to build a lane-straddling bus – a novel contraption designed to carry hundreds of passengers over two lanes of traffic, theoretically bypassing congestion. The prototype of a sort of double-wide subway car on stilts, was completed a few months later and given a test run, with regular passenger vehicles driving underneath. But within days the project was stalled, and was abandoned less than a year later after it was accused of being little more than an investment scam. The founder of the company behind the project and 31 employees were recently arrested on suspicion of illegal fundraising. Although criminal futurism apparently does exist, most of these types of proposals are typically altruistic. In London, a series of aspirational projects have rolled out in recent years presenting new forms of infrastructure aimed at improving the city for cyclists. The London Underline proposes repurposing disused tube tunnels into cross-city bike routes – a scheme for which its designer, the global architecture firm Gensler, was awarded the Best Conceptual Project at the 2015 London Planning Awards. SkyCycle, a slightly less realistic idea from Foster + Partners, suggests adding 220km of bike lanes atop the alignments of suburban rail lines. And then there’s the £600m proposal to build a floating pontoon bike path on the Thames. These projects have gathered accolades and interest, but they’ve also been criticised as distracting policymakers from pursuing more achievable cycling improvements. Similar concerns have been raised about another Musk idea, the pneumatic tube-based intercity transit system known as the Hyperloop. Though still in early test phases and with significant hurdles in the way of even a small-scale rollout, the proposed technology has spurred the launch of multiple companies and coverage by media around the world. Some worry it’s diverting investment from proven and existing transportation technologies like high speed rail. But for the private companies competing to build the first viable Hyperloop system, traditional high speed rail can’t beat a 700mph tube. Musk seems to agree. Although he originally released the Hyperloop idea to the global community in 2013 in the hope that someone else would bring it to reality, now that Musk has his own tunnelling company he has apparently decided to merge the Hyperloop with his underground tunnel traffic solution. “Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop,” Musk tweeted in July. “NY-DC in 29 mins.” While Thomas More sought to use his imagined cities to raise questions and inspire new ways of building society, Musk is looking to put shovels – and tunnel boring machines – in the ground. Construction ‘within weeks’ On 22 August, officials from the Boring Company were back at Hawthorne City Hall, a squat concrete building where a scale model of a SpaceX rocket sits on display in the central atrium. The company was seeking city council approval of an easement allowing it to use subterranean land beneath public property for its two-mile test tunnel, and affirming its exemption from review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Lawyers for the Boring Company explained the tunnel’s proposed path: an L-shaped route that would mostly run beneath city streets at depths ranging from 22ft to 44ft below the surface. An environmental consultant explained that a lack of significant impacts to traffic, air, water or noise enables the tunnel to avoid CEQA review under an exemption typically used to streamline infill urban development. Aside from one member of the public voicing concern about a tunnel collapse and a few questions from council members about the environmental review process, the project was not controversial. The council voted 4-1 to approve the easement. A few details are still to be decided before a final permit can be issued, but strong city support is likely to ease that process. “We want this to be an awesome project that propels us into the future,” Hawthorne mayor Alex Vargas said. Horton, through a communications official, declined to comment after the vote. The tunnel is expected to take five months to build, and construction could begin within weeks.

The Department for Communities and Local Government has confirmed to the Guardian that it will publish details by the end of this month of how local authorities should assess the need for housing. The plans, part of a package of housing measures, will be closely watched as a test of the prime minister’s appetite for enacting controversial domestic reforms. They were slated for publication in July, and a press release drafted, but the launch was delayed at the last minute amid concerns some MPs could face criticism from constituents concerned about over-development. The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, who has the backing of reformers in the Conservative party, would like to see housebuilding boosted significantly, particularly in high-cost areas, to halt the rapid increase in property prices that is leaving many people unable to afford a home. In the housing white paper published in February, entitled Fixing Our Broken Housing Market, the government said: “Some local authorities can duck potentially difficult decisions, because they are free to come up with their own methodology for calculating ‘objectively assessed need’. So, we are going to consult on a new standard methodology for calculating ‘objectively assessed need’, and encourage councils to plan on this basis.” Javid hopes by adopting an expansive approach, which includes data about the local housing market, he can kickstart redevelopment in areas where prices are rising fastest. May’s resolve to tackle the problem may have been strengthened by the party’s poor showing among young people at the general election in June. A recent YouGov poll suggested that just 4% of 18-24-year-olds trust the Conservatives to deal with the issue of housing – against 44% for Labour. Number 10 policymakers have been taking soundings from thinktanks and policy experts about proposals that might help to win back young voters. According to official figures, homeowners could expect to pay about 7.6 times their annual earnings to buy a house in England and Wales in 2016, up from 3.6 times earnings in 1997. The housing need test is one of a package of measures radical Conservatives believe will be necessary to tackle the challenge. The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, in a speech focusing on housing policy in Scotland, said on Friday: “It is a bedrock of Conservative belief that we should encourage a property-owning democracy. “Yet, increasingly, we now have something more akin to a property-owning oligarchy. Made up of lucky, mainly older, people who – by dint of having scaled the housing ladder – are now the ones who now control the country’s economic purse strings.” George Freeman, chair of the Conservative policy forum, has also warned that young people risk rejecting capitalism if they have no chance of owning a home. But Javid and and his allies are likely to find themselves pitched against Tory MPs and councillors wary of “planning blight”. Andrew Mitchell, the former development secretary, publicly clashed with Javid over plans for a housing development in his Sutton Coldfield constituency. May signalled on her trip to Japan that she wants to press ahead with domestic reform, as well as complete the Brexit negotiations. She pointed to her Downing Street speech last year, in which she pledged to right, “burning injustices”, including the fact that “if you’re young, you’ll find it harder than ever before to own your own home”. But watered-down corporate governance reforms published last week raised questions about whether May’s minority government will be willing to take on vested interests. Housing campaigners urged the prime minister to be bold. Gill Payne, the executive director of public mpact at the National Housing Federation, said: “Getting this right will be a show of the strength of government’s commitment to building the homes the nation needs. Getting a consistent and accurate picture of housing need is really important – it cements into the local plan the number of homes that need to be delivered.” She added: “Robust methodology will give a consistent and undisputable approach across the country.” Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: “We hope these changes will help to simplify and join up the way councils across the country assess housing need in their areas, and it’s vital that the new proposals work to deliver as many affordable homes as possible. She added that Javid should tighten up the planning regime, to allow local authorities to exert more control over what can be built, where, rather than relying on the market to deliver. “It’s important to remember that developers can still often build whatever they like, regardless of whether it meets what the council says is needed or not. The government must now take action to change this, by giving councils more power to get housing built that will meet the needs of their community.” Successive governments have sought to make property ownership more affordable. Ambitious building targets have rarely been met, and George Osborne’s focus on subsidising mortgages through the help-to-buy scheme was criticised for fuelling the boom. Housebuilding slumped after the financial crash from more than 215,000 homes a year in 2007-8 to 133,000 in 2012-13. It has since recovered, but has not regained its pre-crisis level."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/03/daniel-draper-director-nature-of-the-beast-dennis-skinner-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T07:30:37Z","webTitle":"Daniel Draper, film-maker: ‘Dennis Skinner sang to me over the phone’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/03/daniel-draper-director-nature-of-the-beast-dennis-skinner-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/03/daniel-draper-director-nature-of-the-beast-dennis-skinner-interview","fields":{"headline":"Daniel Draper, film-maker: ‘Dennis Skinner sang to me over the phone’","bodyText":"Daniel Draper, 30, is a documentary maker from Liverpool whose first feature-length film explores the life of Dennis Skinner, the outspoken veteran Labour MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. Draper met Skinner in 2014 and spent the next three years making the documentary, supporting himself with a part-time job as a chef. Shot for just £2,400 and completed with £21,009 raised on Kickstarter, Dennis Skinner: Nature of the Beast is released on Friday. What prompted you to make a film about Dennis Skinner? I made a short documentary in 2014 called Still Ragged, about Robert Tressell’s novel The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, and Dennis agreed to be in it. Before we started filming, he was talking about trees and collecting chestnuts, and I thought: there’s more here than meets the eye, it’s not all politics. After the project was finished, I sent him a letter saying that I didn’t understand why a film hadn’t been done with him before, and would he trust me to do it – because he’s very wary of what he calls “media types”. He called me back one Sunday morning and we talked for two hours. We just really got on. He was even singing to me over the phone. He’s got quite a fearsome reputation. Were you intimidated? Not really. Everything I suggested, he was up for. I got the feeling that he didn’t want to sing on camera but I had to ask him. His nickname is the Beast of Bolsover, and I thought he might tell me to fuck off, but he never did. He was a joy to work with. I found it interesting to see how differently he’s perceived on his home turf, compared to Westminster… Yes, people in his constituency don’t see him as a leftwing rebel. He’s just someone who speaks like them. He’s a product of where he’s from, of a working-class upbringing and a mining background, and he’s never really changed. It’s sad that that’s seen as being unique in politics. Does he seem to you like a man from a different era? Not at all, no. I’m working class myself, and even though I’m from the city and he’s from the countryside, I feel he’s fighting for my class and continues to do so. He’s as relevant now as he ever was. He doesn’t talk about Jeremy Corbyn. Did he share his thoughts with you? The interview about his political career was filmed in 2014, before Corbyn [was elected Labour leader]. But we made a conscious decision throughout not to mention anything that would instantly date the film. What Dennis represents is that working-class fight. Being a Corbyn fan myself, it’s reassuring to know he’s got an ally like Dennis Skinner. Last year, when the right wing of the Labour party was trying to overthrow Corbyn, Dennis came over to him in the chamber, shook his hand and put two fingers up to the rest of the Labour MPs. That was quite emotional for me. That gives me hope. Did shooting the film make you feel better or worse about British politics? It made me feel better that we’ve got someone like Dennis Skinner representing us. He’s not interested in patronage, only in representing his constituents, which I think MPs should do. Sometimes people on Twitter criticise him: What’s he ever achieved in parliament? But you go there to represent the people who voted for you. It’s refreshing to see that his fire’s still burning. Has he seen the film? He says he hasn’t but I think he has. He’s not really good at talking about stuff like that. I sent him a link and followed it with an email saying, “If you’ve got problems with it, let me know.” He called me up and we spoke about everything but the film. We spoke about the 80s movie Midnight Run for about an hour, but not our film. That’s just his way. But the premiere’s on Friday in Derby and he’s coming along, so I’ll definitely know he’s seen it then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/sep/04/snappcar-business-rent-car-airbnb-sharing-economy-sustainable-transport","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-04T08:02:59Z","webTitle":"The rise of SnappCar, the business that lets you rent out your car","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/sep/04/snappcar-business-rent-car-airbnb-sharing-economy-sustainable-transport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/sep/04/snappcar-business-rent-car-airbnb-sharing-economy-sustainable-transport","fields":{"headline":"The rise of SnappCar, the business that lets you rent out your car","bodyText":"He calls it “Airbnb for cars”, and if Victor van Tol is right, people sharing their vehicles could mean a Europe with 5m fewer of them in five years. In 2011, Dutchmen van Tol and Pascal Ontijd launched Snappcar, a technology platform for car owners to rent their vehicles. The vision was a profitable startup, with economic, social and ecological impact. “The 250m cars in Europe are used on average an hour a day,” says van Tol, chief executive of the Utrecht-based firm. “If a very small percentage of people start sharing, you can make a huge impact in bringing people together, cars not needing to be produced and saving money for owners and renters.” He is, he says, 10% of the way to his goal of 500,000 cars shared, with operations in the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Germany, 400,000 renter members and 45,000 vehicles on offer – all insured through Allianz. Car manufacturers and rental firms are convinced such sharing could be one of the ways we drive in future: Europe’s largest car hire company Europcar took a 20% stake in Snappcar in June as part of a strategy to become a “global mobility solutions leader”. Snappcar has also just completed an asset purchase of Germany’s number two peer-to-peer car sharing firm Tamyca – bringing it closer to challenging European market leader Drivy – and aims to expand to 20 European metropolitan areas, including the UK. There is a host of car sharing options nowadays: you could hire car and driver via Uber, pool a trip with someone going your way via BlaBlaCar, or “share” one of a fleet of cars (the turn-up-and-drive version of professional car rental) via the BMW Group/Sixt’s DriveNow, Daimler subsidiary car2go or Avis Budget Group-owned Zipcar. Although they have had hitches like fitting in with parking regulations or employment practices, they are all based on a modern version of “car ownership”, where you don’t actually own a car – you just borrow someone else’s. Van Tol says it’s a no-brainer that shared cars are more sustainable than a fleet of professional vehicles. “We believe there are enough cars to fulfil the needs of the people,” he says. “It’s a little strange that while you have cars idling on the streets, you add new cars to share. From a sustainability perspective, it makes absolutely no sense.” That said, he believes firms such as Zipcar – which has just launched a London service offering cheap hire for a one-way trip – are helping consumers accept a less formal way of hiring cars, because “the most challenging thing for a business like ours is to get car owners to share their car”. Like Airbnb breaking down the traditional hotel monopoly, van Tol thinks peer-to-peer car sharing gives more power to consumers and to owners: renters can pay less for an older car, for instance, while owners can (with full insurance cover) recoup part of their car costs. But what happens when the sharing model goes wrong? Uber is appealing a British court order to give its drivers minimum wage and sick pay, while Airbnb can go frighteningly awry, for instance when houses are trashed or a guest who apparently refused to leave was pushed down a flight of stairs in Amsterdam in July. Snappcar says it employs a screening method, which scans social media, for instance, to vet users. “You can do nasty things with a car,” he admits. “You can take a car and rob a bank, or go abroad and never come back, which you cannot do with a house.” New European privacy regulations, enforced from 2018, could affect this screening, but Snappcar says it is confident it can stay within the law. What if someone returns a scratched car, and the owner becomes violent? “We cannot prevent some people losing their temper as they are annoyed that the car is damaged or whatever, but mostly people stay calm and just inform us and we take care of it,” says van Tol. Fully autonomous cars will certainly shake things up. Van Tol thinks they will be like “micro public transportation” but while car rental models consolidate, owning a car will still be “a status symbol for some” – and sharing it might mean it’s free or making money. The stumbling blocks would be a ban on this or insurance problems, he says. Getting insurance was almost a disaster, says van Tol, “all the Dutch insurance companies said, ‘No, it’s never going to work’,” until one, Achmea, decided to take a risk. Peer-to-peer car sharing is still very small. It’s a big cultural step to share out your car, says Dr Gonçalo Homem de Almeida Correia, a specialist in sustainable transport at Delft University of Technology. He is sceptical about Snappcar’s car reduction numbers, adding that “a good public transport system can do much more for the sustainability of a city”. Cities need to be far bolder about dissuading personal car use to make more “liveable environments”, adds Jonathan Hampson, UK general manager at Zipcar. “If people own a car, they are pretty irrational about how they get about – they are vested in that car,” he says. “If you break that cycle of car ownership, people make the right decision about where walking is the best, or cycling, or a car, and then they car-share.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"music/2017/aug/31/joseph-shabason-aytche-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T18:40:22Z","webTitle":"Joseph Shabason: Aytche review – dense ambient jazz debut, with birdsong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/31/joseph-shabason-aytche-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/aug/31/joseph-shabason-aytche-review","fields":{"headline":"Joseph Shabason: Aytche review – dense ambient jazz debut, with birdsong","bodyText":"Based in Toronto, Joseph Shabason plays saxophone with art rockers Destroyer and provides icy synths for the R&amp;B outfit DIANA.

The gallery announced on Wednesday that ticket demand was so great that it would extend the exhibition by two weeks and fully expected it to exceed the visitor figures for Bowie. The Bowie retrospective, staged in 2013, three years before his death, attracted 311,000 visitors. Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains has already reached the 300,000 mark and will now close on 15 October. It tells the story of a band that rewrote the rules of rock music performance and repeatedly pushed artistic boundaries, but whose members were always somewhat reluctant rock stars. The V&amp;A curator Victoria Broackes, who also worked on the Bowie show, said the exhibition had been a “massive collaboration between the V&amp;A and Pink Floyd … the band members, particularly Nick Mason, but notably the creative individuals, designers and architects they have worked with over many years. “That combination of authentic staging, amazing sound, rock’n’roll spectacle and the V&amp;A has really shone through in the success of the exhibition and the popularity with not just fans, but with a diverse audience of all ages.” Blockbusting exhibitions exploring rock and pop have become an important part of what the V&amp;A does since the success of a Kylie Minogue show in 2007. Some have sniffily accused the gallery of dumbing down. The V&amp;A argues that performance and music are a key part of what the institution is and has always been. Broackes said: “The fusion of music, theatre, design and performance which the band excelled at throughout their entire career makes them ideal for an exhibition at the V&amp;A.” Pink Floyd may well beat the Bowie numbers at the V&amp;A in London but it will have to go some way to beat the global success of the Bowie show, which has toured venues across the world and attracted in excess of 1.5 million visitors. That makes it the most visited show in the V&amp;A’s history. The most visited exhibition at the V&amp;A in London remains a retrospective of the work of the fashion designer Alexander McQueen, which attracted a remarkable 480,000 visitors over its 21-week run in 2015. After that it is Art Deco, which attracted 359,000 in 2003, and wedding dresses in 2014, which had 316,000 visitors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/03/sundays-best-tv-astronauts-do-you-have-what-it-takes-strike-the-cuckoos-calling","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T05:00:35Z","webTitle":"Sunday's best TV: Astronauts – Do You Have What It Takes?; Strike – the Cuckoo's Calling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/03/sundays-best-tv-astronauts-do-you-have-what-it-takes-strike-the-cuckoos-calling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/03/sundays-best-tv-astronauts-do-you-have-what-it-takes-strike-the-cuckoos-calling","fields":{"headline":"Sunday's best TV: Astronauts – Do You Have What It Takes?; Strike – the Cuckoo's Calling","bodyText":"Astronauts: Do You Have What It Takes? 9pm, BBC2 Of the uncountable reality conceits that have blighted television schedules, it does seem weird that nobody has thought of this one before: putting people through the definitive physical and psychological test of astronaut selection.

In this illuminating session, rapper Freddie Gibbs – who was falsely accused of rape, and imprisoned for it – opens up about his personal and legal issues. Graeme Virtue Film choice Toy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich, 2010) 5pm, BBC1 The delightful and poignant conclusion to the game-changing animated trilogy tugs ever harder on the heartstrings, confronting that bittersweet time when youngsters put away childish things. When Andy heads for college, Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack) and the other toys are accidentally dispatched to the daycare centre-cum-nightmare prison. Cue a triumphant adventure about love, loyalty and a megalomaniac teddy bear. Paul Howlett Exodus: Gods and Kings (Ridley Scott, 2014) 9pm, Channel 4 An old-fashioned, somewhat ponderous, biblical epic in the tradition of Cecil B DeMille’s Ten Commandments. Christian Bale is a noble Moses, getting into a fearful family squabble with his brother, the pharaoh Ramses (a heavily eyelined Joel Edgerton) when leading his people out of Egypt. The special effects are stunning, from the parting of the Red Sea to the plagues – notably the creeping horror of the death of the firstborn. PH Let Me In (Matt Reeves, 2010) 11pm, BBC2 This US remake of the haunting Swedish vampire movie Let the Right One In loses some of the original’s sly humour in favour of a horror fix. But with teen superstars in Kodi Smit-McPhee (of The Road) as the troubled 12-year-old boy, and Chloë Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) as the vampire who befriends him, the sweet, youthful emotion survives alongside the bloodlust.

But it’s not the airy, light-filled glass and white walls affair you might expect of a designer: it’s a purpose-built desk space that hangs in the underbelly of a major city overpass. On one “wall” – the concrete pillar that supports the highway above – a detachable structure of plywood boards and metal tubes serve as a desk, chair and shelves. Using the bridge’s beams as rails, Abellanas’ structure can slide on rollers from one side to the other. It’s an example of what is becoming known as parasite architecture – buildings that cling, perch or sprout from others. The studio took Abellanas, a furniture designer and plumber, just two weeks to build after he discovered the space. He was drawn to its strange mix of materials and location. “Despite being next to trains and with traffic above, it’s a place no one stops to look up at,” he says. Parasite architecture is a growing trend and ranges from planned projects, such as residential wooden pots installed on Toronto’s CN tower, to makeshift structures – such as Tadashi Kawamata’s artistic tree houses, which he scatters everywhere from New York parks to the Paris Pompidou centre, or the entire illegal “villa” one man built on top of a Beijing condo over the course of six years. Abellanas says he wasn’t looking for “a feeling of total silence or peace, but rather that sensation you get as a kid of being able to sit and peek at what’s happening around you without being seen – be it in a cabin or a cardboard box in your own house”. The new “parasite” phenomenon is partly due to how difficult it has become for many architects to realise their designs for public buildings, explains Ellis Woodman, director of the Architecture Foundation. This has lead to a rise in low-cost, short-term projects, many of which seek to engage local communities in new ways. Woodman gives the example of the boat above the Hayward Gallery on London’s South Bank, and the Blue House Yard in north London’s Wood Green, a work and community space on the site of a car park and defunct council building. The foundation has created its own parasite, the Antepavillion, a rooftop project above an east London building for which it plans to commission a young architect each year. For 2017, an air duct-shaped structure has been built by PUP Architects as a provocation for local councils to re-think urban planning in the area. In many cases, pop-ups – such as restaurants, temporary stores and artistic projects – and parasites are much the same thing, but while a pop-up might be a temporary standalone structure, a parasite is often a longer-term intervention in the urban landscape. Meanwhile, Abellanas says he is self-taught and favours a DIY approach to urban intervention. One of his previous projects involved riding train tracks that were built but never used (the recession killed the state project) in a rudimentary self-built car. In another, he climbed a €24m disused tower block in the vein of skyscraper “roofers”. Abellanas sees his project as part of a series looking at Valencia’s disused spaces, and despite the obvious opportunity for social commentary, he says he’s not trying to make a statement about the lack of affordable space in the city. Rents in Spain have grown by 20.9% in the last year, according to housing site Idealista, but thanks to Abellanas’ own ingenuity – and his willingness to work under a busy bridge – he has his own workspace and home. City authorities are yet to react. “I think they haven’t discovered it yet,” Abellanas says. When they do, he assumes they’ll order him to dismantle it – or that someone will break it or steal its materials. “It’s surviving a lot longer than I thought,” he says. “It’s really well hidden.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, or explore our archive"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/30/una-review-rooney-mara-ben-mendelsohn-david-harrower-blackbird","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T15:00:20Z","webTitle":"Una review – Rooney Mara and Ben Mendelsohn have twisted chemistry in disturbing drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/30/una-review-rooney-mara-ben-mendelsohn-david-harrower-blackbird","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/30/una-review-rooney-mara-ben-mendelsohn-david-harrower-blackbird","fields":{"headline":"Una review – Rooney Mara and Ben Mendelsohn have twisted chemistry in disturbing drama","bodyText":"Rooney Mara and Ben Mendelsohn bring a controlled intensity and force – and even a twisted kind of chemistry – to this disturbing if structurally flawed movie, perhaps inspired by key final sequences from Lolita, and adapted by David Harrower from his own much- admired 2005 play Blackbird. Mara is Una, a young woman who, when she was 13, was seduced and abused by a middle-aged neighbour, who finally abandoned her in a seaside guesthouse. This was Ray, played by Mendelsohn. Now, as an adult, she has tracked him down to the gigantic Amazon-style factory warehouse where, after his imprisonment, he has risen under a changed name to middle-management level. Does she want revenge? Closure? Or does she even, in some desolate and damaged sense, want to declare her undiminished love? The action is set in England although, interestingly, cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis (who has worked with Yorgos Lanthimos) makes it look like suburban Australia or the US: it is a movie of bright, clean, hard edges. It is opened out from the theatrical space by interspersing the dialogue with flashback scenes of the original affair, with Ruby Stokes as the young Una, but also a slightly cumbersome plot contrivance in the present, linked to Ray’s dispute with his hatchet-faced boss (Tobias Menzies). Later there is to be a party back at Ray’s house – for which surely he would surely not be in the mood, having seen his career and personal life explode? Ray is very different from Patrick Wilson’s paedophile character in Hard Candy (2005) or Kevin Bacon’s in The Woodsman (2004) or indeed Dylan Baker’s in Todd Solondz’s Happiness (1998). Yet Harrower’s script creates a neat, nauseous twist, which upends the good faith in which we had originally been led to accept Ray’s agony. It’s a movie with a hum of disquiet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/31/the-limehouse-golem-review-billy-night-peter-ackroyd-jane-goldman-olivia-cooke","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:30:17Z","webTitle":"The Limehouse Golem review – lurid but literate Victorian serial-killer melodrama | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/31/the-limehouse-golem-review-billy-night-peter-ackroyd-jane-goldman-olivia-cooke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/31/the-limehouse-golem-review-billy-night-peter-ackroyd-jane-goldman-olivia-cooke","fields":{"headline":"The Limehouse Golem review – lurid but literate Victorian serial-killer melodrama","bodyText":"“Find out all you can about … George Gissing, Karl Marx and Dan Leno!” With these bizarre instructions to his uncomprehending sergeant, the dashing police inspector at the heart of an occult Victorian murder mystery introduces a startling list of celebrity suspects: a novelist, a revolutionary philosopher and a music hall megastar. Bill Nighy takes a rare non-comic role as the dapper detective John Kildare in 19th-century London, on the trail of a pre-Ripper serial killer nicknamed the Limehouse Golem. Each of these famous figures could be the psychotic murderer, but Kildare’s fourth – and prime – suspect was a fictional failed playwright, one George Cree, who has just been found dead. Cree’s widow, former music hall turn Lizzie (Olivia Cooke), is now charged with his murder, but if Kildare can prove Lizzie knew Cree was the Golem, and killed him in self-defence and to rid London of a monster, Kildare might solve the mystery and save poor Lizzie from the hangman’s noose at the same time – and revive his own career, which had stalled because he is known to be “not the marrying kind”. This racy, grisly melodrama is cleverly adapted by screenwriter Jane Goldman from the 1994 novel by Peter Ackroyd, and directed by Juan Carlos Medina, who made the fantasy-horror Painless in 2012. It has been described as a feminist take on the porn mythology of misogynist serial violence, for reasons which are fully revealed at the end but that may not count as exactly feminist. At any rate, it’s an entertainingly bizarre, lurid nightmare with a playfully literary flavour, very Ackroydian, but with hints of Angela Carter and a bit of William Blake. Daniel Mays is an effective foil to Kildare, as the stolid sergeant George Flood, and Douglas Booth is a rather epicene and solemnly declamatory Dan Leno. Interestingly it is Cooke’s performance that suggests a more natural comic. As with all movies set in shadowy Victorian London, with crowded streets and a sketched outline of St Paul’s on the horizon, there is a lot of digital fabrication and green-screen production design, and sometimes it gets oppressively murky in not quite the right way. But it is carried off very elegantly, not least by Nighy: his pursed lips and bearing may lead you to expect a camp or funny line. The fact that none is forthcoming adds to this movie’s chill. Nighy never smiles. A very literate, bibliophile shocker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/aug/31/francesco-tristano-piano-circle-songs-cd-review-musical-magpie-keeps-things-interesting","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:30:17Z","webTitle":"Francesco Tristano: Piano Circle Songs CD review – musical magpie keeps things interesting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/31/francesco-tristano-piano-circle-songs-cd-review-musical-magpie-keeps-things-interesting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/aug/31/francesco-tristano-piano-circle-songs-cd-review-musical-magpie-keeps-things-interesting","fields":{"headline":"Francesco Tristano: Piano Circle Songs CD review – musical magpie keeps things interesting","bodyText":"‘Maybe we have to come up with a new series of labels,” says Francesco Tristano, suggesting “acid classical” and “acoustic disco” before thinking better of it. “Let the music speak for itself.” The Luxembourg-born pianist/composer/producer has done good on either side of the indie classical line, with previous projects featuring the solo music of Luciano Berio and orchestrated versions of Detroit techno anthems. His latest project lands in an innocuous middle zone, with stripped-back piano-writing borrowing the loops and layers of deep house and the spacious textures and wan harmonies of ambient tracks. Canadian polymath Chilly Gonzales adds jazz-ish inflections and buoyant interlocking grooves, but not much else.

Bugg eventually broadened out his bluesy sound, even dabbling in Madchester-esque beats and poorly judged rap on his last album, On My One, backpedalling on comments he’d made rubbishing pop and hip-hop. Deviating from the formula didn’t do him any favours, however, and his third record was his lowest charting to date. And so on to Hearts That Strain, recorded in Nashville and featuring the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach on guitar, in which Bugg firmly returns to troubadour-lite mode. How Soon the Dawn is Wichita Lineman-lite, while In the Event of My Demise combines folklore-like lyrics with a Radio 2 Drivetime chorus. Elsewhere, Waiting is a serviceable duet with Noah Cyrus (sister of Miley), that sounds like a Christmassy Unchained Melody, and Indigo Blue sees Bugg’s strange pronunciation of the colour distract from the song’s workaday dad-rock. Although he has, mercifully, put hip-hop to one side, this lacks the authenticity of a real raconteur."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/30/co-op-nisa-takeover-sainsburys-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T10:48:35Z","webTitle":"Co-op closes in on £130m Nisa takeover as Sainsbury's pauses talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/30/co-op-nisa-takeover-sainsburys-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/aug/30/co-op-nisa-takeover-sainsburys-talks","fields":{"headline":"Co-op closes in on £130m Nisa takeover as Sainsbury's pauses talks","bodyText":"The Co-op Group has entered exclusive talks to buy the wholesale group Nisa in a deal worth more than £130m, as the major supermarket chains attempt to extend their reach into convenience stores. The move comes as Tesco attempts to take over the Booker wholesale group, which supplies thousands of independent convenience stores operating under the Londis, Premier and Budgens name. Morrisons recently signed a wholesale deal with the McColl’s chain in an attempt to adapt to shoppers’ move away from big supermarkets towards smaller stores. Co-op already runs its own convenience store chain and is a wholesaler to a number of regional co-operatives. The potential deal with Nisa would be the first major acquisition for the group since its major financial crisis in 2013, partly caused by ill-advised buy-outs of the Somerfield grocery chain and the Britannia building society. Nisa, which is owned by more than a thousand independent convenience store owners and supplies 2,500 outlets, said it had granted the Co-op a period of exclusive due diligence in the hope that a deal could progress “as quickly as possible”. The exclusive talks come after discussions with Sainsbury’s ground to a halt earlier this month over fears of intervention by competition authorities. Sainsbury’s stepped back after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) expressed serious concerns about the much larger merger between Tesco and Booker. The CMA referred the £3.7bn Tesco deal for an in-depth competition investigation in July and the initial findings of the investigation expected in October. A spokesman for the Co-op said: “We can confirm that we’ve entered into a period of exclusivity with Nisa, which will provide the opportunity for us to carry out more detailed due diligence in the coming weeks.” Nisa’s chairman, Peter Hartley, wrote to the shareholder-shopkeepers, more than 70% of whom will have to approve any deal: “Should an offer of merit emerge from this process, it will be for you, the members, to decide on whether to accept it. However, it is important to stress, that there is no guarantee that an offer will be forthcoming. “As you are all aware our business and the convenience sector continue to evolve at pace and the board of Nisa will continue to review serious queries and offers which emerge (within the constraints of any agreed exclusivity period) and which it believes are in the best long-term interest of the members.” It is possible that Sainsbury’s might return with a new bid, but such a move is unlikely until after the CMA releases its findings on the Tesco Booker deal in October. Nisa’s board has been in talks with the Co-op for some time but initially preferred Sainsbury’s. Many of the group’s shopkeeper members, however, are more keen to explore joining up with the mutual as they want to preserve their independence and control over their supply chain. The Co-op is thought to be prepared to offer up to £140m for Nisa subject to due diligence, which is expected to take about a month. Molly Johnson-Jones, senior analyst at Global Data Retail, said a Co-op acquisition of Nisa would help extend its geographical reach, improve the sourcing of products for both parties and cut costs, creating the opportunity to offset inflation currently affecting UK grocers. She said that Sainsbury’s investors should be relieved that the Co-op had taken the lead in takeover talks as the supermarket was now likely to avoid a CMA investigation and Nisa shareholders’ discontent. “A Co-op-Nisa partnership provides more benefits than a partnership with Sainsbury’s would have done due to complementary business models, supply chains, and customer requirements,” she said. As shoppers have begun to switch away from big supermarkets to buying little and often locally, there has been a rush for consolidation in the highly complex convenience store sector. Both Nisa and the Co-op are understood to have been in talks to take on supplying the 2,200 store Costcutter group, owned by the Bibby Line distribution firm. Industry insiders suggested a three way deal could now be on the cards. Earlier this month, Morrisons signed a wholesale supply agreement with McColl’s, the chain that makes up about 35% of Nisa’s supply business. That deal will see McColl’s gradually withdraw from Nisa over the next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/31/federal-judge-blocks-texas-ban-on-sanctuary-cities-in-blow-for-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T02:46:33Z","webTitle":"Federal judge blocks Texas ban on sanctuary cities in blow for Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/federal-judge-blocks-texas-ban-on-sanctuary-cities-in-blow-for-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/federal-judge-blocks-texas-ban-on-sanctuary-cities-in-blow-for-trump","fields":{"headline":"Federal judge blocks Texas ban on sanctuary cities in blow for Trump","bodyText":"A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction that blocks key parts of Texas’s ban on so-called sanctuary cities two days before the law was scheduled to go into effect. The decision from judge Orlando Garcia on Wednesday is a victory for immigration rights advocates and a potential blow for other Republican-led states that may be keen to follow Texas – as well as for the Trump administration, which has vowed to crack down on sanctuary cities. Coming against the backdrop of Hurricane Harvey, the judge’s ruling will be a welcome boost for the state’s large population of undocumented immigrants. There were concerns that some of those affected by the storm’s widespread flooding had stayed away from shelters or avoided asking for help because they feared that interactions with law enforcement could be a prelude to deportation. Rumours spread that evacuees were being asked for immigration documentation at shelters, which the city denied on Tuesday in a tweet, writing: “We will not ask for immigration status or papers at any shelter.” Houston mayor Sylvester Turner said on Monday that he would personally offer assistance to any immigrants detained after seeking emergency aid. “If you need help and someone comes and they require help, and then for some reason, then somebody tries to deport them, I will represent them myself, okay?” he said. However, Jose Irvinaldama, 23, a trainee pastry chef who found shelter at Houston’s convention centre, said he knew undocumented Latinos who had stayed away lest shelter staff demand papers: “They were worried. They stayed at home.” Enrique Martinez, an office administrator who also sheltered at the convention centre, said he had heard rumours about Latinos being asked for documents. The rumours turned out to be untrue but some believed them, he said. The law, known as SB4, was “one of the most extreme anti-immigrant and anti-Latino pieces of legislation in the country,” Jolt, an Hispanic political activism group, said in a statement hailing the judge’s ruling. “SB4 sought to force local law enforcement to carry out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, opened the door to the racial profiling of Latinos who make up 40% of our state’s population, and [would] allow the removal of democratically elected officials from office just for speaking out against the law.” The US justice department filed a “statement of interest” backing the law. Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said in a statement that “Texas has admirably followed [Trump’s] lead by mandating state-wide cooperation with federal immigration laws that require the removal of illegal aliens who have committed crimes”. But Judge Garcia found that most portions of SB4 “on their face, are preempted by federal law and violate the United States constitution.” Though he limited his 94-page ruling to the question of whether SB4 was constitutional, Garcia noted that “there is overwhelming evidence by local officials, including local law enforcement, that SB4 will erode public trust and make many communities and neighbourhoods less safe. There is also ample evidence that localities will suffer adverse economic consequences.” Plaintiffs in the case included five of Texas’ six biggest cities – Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and El Paso – as well as the tiny border outpost of El Cenizo. “At the end of the day, the legislature is free to ignore the pleas of city and county officials, along with local police departments,” Garcia wrote. “However, the state may not exercise its authority in a manner that violates the United States constitution.” The case is likely to be appealed by Texas and may end up in the US supreme court. The attorney general, Ken Paxton, said in a statement that he would “continue fighting for Senate bill 4” and is “confident SB4 will ultimately be upheld as constitutional and lawful”. Demonstrations had been scheduled in Austin for the end of the week and large groups of protesters agitated against the law, known as SB4, outside the federal courthouse in San Antonio in June, where Garcia heard from civil rights groups who argued that the measure violates the US constitution’s free speech and equal protection clauses and wrongfully inserts the state into a federal sphere. SB4 was signed into law in May by Texas’ Republican governor, Greg Abbott, amid fierce opposition from Democrats in the state’s liberal-leaning cities and Latino rights groups who dubbed it a “show me your papers” plan that invites racial profiling. It was scheduled to begin on 1 September and permit local law enforcement officers to ask the immigration status of people they detained or arrested, a provision Garcia left intact, though he said officers could share details, for example with immigration and customs enforcement, but could not themselves “act upon the information they may obtain”. SB4 also outlaws sanctuary cities – a loose term generally used to describe areas that limit co-operation with immigration agents – by criminalising and fining local officials and entities who do not comply with requests to hold jailed immigrants beyond their normal release times so they can be picked up by federal officers and potentially deported. Its backers describe it as a measure to keep dangerous criminals off the streets and ensure consistent and efficient co-operation between local and federal law enforcement. Economic boycotts of Texas were advocated in Dallas earlier this summer during a conference of elected Latino officials from around the country, while the American Immigration Lawyers Association said it was moving its 2018 conference out of the Dallas area in protest at SB4. “This decision today feels like a ray of sunshine,” the Texas Organizing Project, a community group, said in a statement, “and Texans, especially undocumented Texans, deserve a reprieve in what has been a steady assault on their families.” Rory Carroll contributed additional reporting in Houston"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/31/kyle-edmund-left-to-fly-flag-for-britain-at-us-open-after-second-round-win","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T02:23:07Z","webTitle":"Kyle Edmund left to fly flag for Britain at US Open after second-round win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/31/kyle-edmund-left-to-fly-flag-for-britain-at-us-open-after-second-round-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/31/kyle-edmund-left-to-fly-flag-for-britain-at-us-open-after-second-round-win","fields":{"headline":"Kyle Edmund left to fly flag for Britain at US Open after second-round win","bodyText":"Kyle Edmund might begin to know what Andy Murray feels like at a grand slam if he reaches the second week of the US Open: tired and a little lonely. In his ninth match in 12 days here on Wednesday evening, the 22-year-old heir apparent to Murray’s British crown showed no signs of fatigue in beating the determined American Steve Johnson 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 (4) in two-and-a-quarter hours in the Louis Armstrong Stadium, but it will surely be tough again in the third round on Friday. And, after the exits on day three of compatriots Aljaz Bedene and Cameron Norrie, he will be very much on his own. “I did what I needed to do, tactics and controlling the match,” he said courtside. “I always felt in control. The third set was big, because those key points change matches. I was very happy to close it out in three. “He’s a unique player. Every shot is to set him up for the forehand, and he gives you no pace on the backhand. I’ve gained more maturity and experience [since losing to him two years ago at the Australian Open]. It was a level up then and he crushed me, physically. It was a big learning curve for me.” Edmund revealed after what looked like a routine three-set win over the Dutchman Robin Haase in the first round on Monday that he felt tired after his recent successes – including a quarter-final win over Johnson in Winston-Salem. In a hard-fought first set, Edmund was broken twice and replied with three breaks of his own, as neither player gained convincing dominance. However, he came to life in the second, as he thrashed some searing forehands to go 3-0 up and Johnson looked like the man who had played almost non-stop for a fortnight. A wild return off a second serve handed Edmund the eighth game to love, and the second set. What he needed was a quick kill, to bolster not only his self belief but his energy reserves. He didn’t get one. Edmund has suffered stamina shut-downs in five-setters before, and he had to dig deep for victory again as Johnson stubbornly dragged him into a tie-break. Edmund went 5-3 up as Johnson finally wilted, leaving the British player with two serves to secure the win. An unreturnable serve wide to the backhand wide gave him match point, and Johnson pushed a final forehand long. Norrie, the only other British player left in the men’s draw at the time – given Murray’s absence with a hip strain that will probably require surgery and the earlier loss by Bedene – didn’t hit a rhythm at all in the first set of his second-round match against Pablo Carreno Busta on Court 6. The frame flew past him in 26 minutes as the 12th seed brought his Spanish clay-court skills to Norrie’s favourite surface, with a steady serve and thoughtful groundstrokes. He converted two of five break opportunities, allowing Norrie no looks at all. Norrie got on the board early in the second to boost his confidence, and should have gone ahead in the fourth game, when Carreno Busta saved four break points, but he faded again. In the third, it was a similar story, as he grabbed a 2-0 lead before handing it back, then hanging on for as long as he could. Carreno Busta forced another break in the seventh game as Norrie pushed a backhand wide. The Spaniard remained steady and rounded out a solid 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 win. Norrie, who was born in South Africa and grew up in New Zealand, is British-qualified through his Scottish father and Welsh mother. He is a decent find for Leon Smith’s Davis Cup squad, well balanced and canny around the court, getting a lot of good angles on his left-handed serve, but he is still working on his power off the ground. That deficit allowed Carreno Busta too many easy openings on Wednesday night. Norrie said later he had enjoyed testing himself at a higher level in a major, but conceded, “I didn’t return very well today and I haven’t even looked at my first serve percentage stats, but I’m sure I was real low [50%]. I also double-faulted a lot [nine times].” On the plus side, he said, “I think I belong here and I can play at this level. I guess I can take confidence from that. I’m in good shape. I haven’t been tired in any of my matches, I felt fit out there but you can always improve.” As much as he has enjoyed his first visit to Flushing Meadows, Norrie is staying grounded about his career. “I’m heading back to TCU [Texas Christian University], doing a fitness block with one of the LTA trainers who is coming out to help me, and then I’m playing a bunch of challengers in the States.” There might be a handful of people watching him there, he admitted. Bedene’s defeat earlier in the day was health related: an inflamed knee tendon that finally gave up on him after six weeks of pain. His restricted lateral movement allowed the combative Russian teenager Andrey Rublev – who could take only five games off Murray at the Australian Open this year – to pick his spots for a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 win in less than two hours. Rublev has to back up on Thursday, against Grigor Dimitrov, after the tournament crammed in the matches on Wednesday to make up for the Tuesday rain wipeout. A dispirited Bedene said later he was considering taking the rest of the season off. “I am struggling with movement,” he told the BBC. “I’ve had problems with the knee since Wimbledon. I thought it was going to be OK but it’s not – so tough times. “I was playing one hour a day here and it felt OK, not perfect. It felt okay with the pills. Before the match I thought I was going to feel better but I felt something in the third game of the first set and then I knew I was going to struggle on the forehand side. Usually that’s my better shot, but not today. “I had an ultrasound in Hamburg which showed inflammation of tendon. They said [to take] a month off. I went two, three weeks without tennis but it still wasn’t great. So I will probably have to postpone playing tennis. “I have to do an MRI now. I’m really disappointed. I’m playing well but my tennis depends a lot on my legs, I love to run and it just felt bad. There is little chance of playing St Petersburg [which starts on 18 September]. People advise me also not to go to Asia and rest. I’ll see.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/30/hurricane-harvey-recovery-downtown-houston-texas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"'It's dry as far as you can see': downtown Houston shows signs of recovery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/hurricane-harvey-recovery-downtown-houston-texas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/hurricane-harvey-recovery-downtown-houston-texas","fields":{"headline":"'It's dry as far as you can see': downtown Houston shows signs of recovery","bodyText":"The catastrophe had yet to be tabulated and elsewhere tropical storm Harvey still raged, but downtown Houston on Wednesday appeared to have made a great escape. Driving in on the I-45, now clear of floodwater, the skyline glinted in bright, balmy sunshine. The Eastex freeway had remarkably little debris. Avenida de las Americas was dry, even warm, to the touch. People walked their dogs. “After days cooped up you get cabin fever, you need to get out,” said Gerardine McKeon, her dog, Ty, straining at the leash on the corner of Lamar and Austin. Days earlier, waist-high torrents had flowed down nearby streets, felling trees, sweeping away cars. But the water had gone, restoring a semblance of familiarity to downtown. “It’s dry as far as you can see,” said Liz Spencer, 64, an artist, who viewed a panorama from a skyscraper’s 45th floor. She was now out walking with her nine-year-old granddaughter Ivy and had just scooped up some litter. “This feels like the start of getting back to a normal state of affairs.” The mayor, Sylvester Turner, struck a similar tone at a news conference, calling for the city to return to routine as swiftly as possible. Airports were due to reopen with limited service later on Wednesday and schools will reopen on 5 September, he said. “Let’s play ball, let’s keep moving.” It was a marked contrast to the mayhem Harvey’s second landfall was unleashing on Port Arthur a hundred miles east and to the widespread devastation in outlying areas of Houston, where aerial footage showed entire communities still submerged. Grim news will continue to unfold as waters recede, revealing more bodies – the official death toll stood at 23 – and the scale of damage. Some analysts estimate it will exceed $100bn. Yet downtown Houston, which this week celebrates its 181st birthday, was already showing the first, halting steps towards recovery, or at least normality. Local radio flipped from reports about rescue efforts to tips on filing insurance claims to celebrity trivia: internet trolls were roasting Ruby Rose, a star of Netflix’s Orange Is The New Black, for her pledge to donate $10,000 to LGBTQ flood victims. When you approached the George R Brown convention centre, which since Sunday has sheltered about a third of the city’s 30,000 displaced people, the first impression was of disarray. Hundreds of people milled outside, some with bulging sacks. But they were not, it turned out, waiting to get in. They were waiting to go home, or to the homes of relatives. “We’re leaving today for my uncle’s house,” said Enrique Martinez, 29, an office administrator. After a chaotic first night on Sunday conditions in the Red Cross-run centre had improved but the family would feel more comfortable with relatives, said Martinez. Aaron Reynolds, 30, emerged from the building whooping, like a freed man. “It’s like prison. I’m moving to a hotel today.” Inside the cavernous centre, which had been scheduled to host a gun show until the hurricane hit, Jose Irvinaldama, 23, a trainee pastry chef, was charging his phone and waiting for what he hoped would be good news from his mother who was inspecting the family home. “My uncle says the water is lower so we may go home today or tomorrow.” He said he knew some undocumented Latinos who had shunned the shelter for fear of being asked for papers. Some evacuees were bullish about the future despite ruined homes and no flood insurance. “This is the United States of America, the greatest country in the world,” said Turk Sullivan, 70, a retired pipeline welder. “If we can’t fix it, no one can, and we will fix it. In six months half the problems will be gone and six months after that the other half.” His buddy, Dennis Sliva, 53, lunching on lasagne and a cookie, predicted Houston would bounce back faster that New Orleans after Katrina. “I’m not worried about the future. I’m a carpenter. There’ll be a lot of work.” Charlene Hamilton, 58, a retired nurse in a wheelchair, also looked on the bright side, trusting more in God than the economy. “When I woke on Sunday the water was up to my chest. I’ve got arthritis but I was able to get out the living room window with some help. I’ve no flood insurance but as long as I keep focusing on the Lord I know I can make it through this. I lost stuff but stuff can be replaced. I still have my life.” Eloy Martinez, 57, a plumber who uses a cane, was more downbeat. “It’s going to be real difficult to get established once again. It’s going to be a mess, that’s all I know.” Some evacuees said they were too disconsolate to talk. An elderly Latino man at a desk for information about missing people gazed ahead, apparently not hearing questions, his eyes vacant. Outside the convention centre a pair of Jehovah’s Witnesses offered passers-by a booklet titled “Does God really care about us?” A shirtless Bob Marley fan answered the question, in a way, by striding up and down the sidewalk, shouting a mantra: “The rasta say everything’s gonna be all right.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/31/thursday-briefing-south-asia-battles-flood-calamity","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T05:39:12Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: South Asia battles flood calamity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/31/thursday-briefing-south-asia-battles-flood-calamity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/31/thursday-briefing-south-asia-battles-flood-calamity","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: South Asia battles flood calamity","bodyText":"Top story: Monsoon disaster leaves 1,200 dead and millions displaced Greetings, it’s Warren Murray with the news to get you out of the starting blocks. As we continue to track ex-hurricane Harvey and its impact in the US, attention is swinging to the emergency in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, where more than 1,200 people have been killed in monsoonal flooding. Downpours on a broad arc across the Himalayan foothills have damaged or washed away hundreds of thousands of homes and vast swaths of farmland, as well as causing landslides, damaging roads and taking down power lines. Mumbai, especially vulnerable to flooding, has been paralysed. A four-storey apartment building has collapsed in the major financial centre – one body has been pulled from the rubble and dozens of people remain missing amid a frantic rescue effort. Across the South Asian region an estimated 40 million people have been affected and children are unable to attend 18,000 schools, leading to fears for their future education. The Red Cross/Red Crescent (IFRC) has launched a major appeal to provide immediate relief and long-term help with water, sanitation, medicine and shelter. * * * Don’t mention the war – Theresa May has risked new rancour in the Conservative party by insisting she could fight another election and is “in this for the long term”. Despite discretion perhaps being advisable after the disastrous snap election, the prime minister took the bait when asked during her Japanese tour whether she would step down in 2019 after Brexit. “I’m not a quitter,” she said. The comments might harden the resolve of Conservative critics to replace her once Brexit negotiations are complete next year. Hostilities ceased over the summer only on the tacit understanding that she was willing to take the flak over Brexit, then step aside. Those Brexit negotiations remain stubbornly bogged down over the enormous “divorce bill”. Figures were not on the table in latest talks but the EU demand is thought to be in the order of €75bn. The slanging matches continue as British negotiators try to whittle down the list of UK financial obligations to Brussels. * * * Trump suddenly interested in ethanol – Donald Trump has phoned the Republican at the top of the Senate’s Russia investigation and offered federal support for ethanol fuel programmes in his state of Iowa. Less than a day after news emerged that the Senate judiciary committee will interview Donald Trump Jr over his contacts with Russian operatives, the president happened to have the pleasure of being able to phone its chairman, Chuck Grassley. Ethanol is a vital issue for Grassley, who afterwards tweeted his excitement about the conversation. The White House, possibly not expecting publicity, had no immediate comment. Meanwhile new reporting has delved into contacts between the personal lawyer for Trump and a Russian American criminal and influencer called Felix Sater – who carried around a Trump Organisation card listing him as a “senior adviser”. Email exchanges show Sater telling the lawyer, Michael Cohen: “Buddy, our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it … I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this.” Sater was trying to broker a deal for Trump to build a skyscraper in Moscow, as Trevor Noah explained on the Daily Show. Cohen has confirmed that Trump was told three times about it and signed a letter of intent. Noah summarised it: “Yes, during the campaign Donald Trump totally had connections to Russia.” * * * ‘Something very wrong’ – Grammar schools have been throwing out sixth-formers whose attainment could drag down league table results, teachers and parents have told the Guardian. Parents are taking legal action against St Olave’s school in Orpington after their children’s places were withdrawn at the end of year 12 when they failed to get sufficiently good grades towards their A-levels. The school has not commented but dozens of parents and educators have contacted the Guardian to say the practice is widespread – “We all know it goes on. It’s so damaging to the students. It’s absolutely frightful,” said one former teacher in Buckinghamshire. The Department for Education confirmed the practice was unlawful: “Schools are not allowed to remove pupils from a sixth form because of academic attainment once they are enrolled.” * * * Day Diana was gone – It is 20 years today since the Princess of Wales died in a car crash in a Paris road tunnel. Beginning with the news that rocked Britain, Caroline Davies chronicles a tumultuous week culminating in Diana’s funeral. * * * Assad’s likely victory in Syria – States that formerly wanted Bashar al-Assad toppled now appear resigned to him staying as Syria’s ruler. Middle East correspondent Martin Chulov reports that Jordan has made an about-face and is talking up diplomatic ties with the Damascus regime; while the Saudis have told anti-Assad rebels they are withdrawing their backing. Britain is talking about “transition” rather than immediate regime change, and America is leaving it to the Russians, who have put their military machine behind Assad. International support for the opposition has dwindled because of concern at terrorist groups’ influence. The big question is what happens to up to six million refugees – “how do you get reconciliation out of this”, asks one diplomat. Lunchtime read: Last of the Nazi hunters Established in 1958, Germany’s Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes is tasked with finding the last living members of the Third Reich hiding out around the world who have yet to be indicted and might still be able to stand trial. Six prosecutions have taken place since the turn of the century – but mostly the suspects, the youngest now in their 90s, die before the judicial process concludes. Politically, the office is running on borrowed time, and chief prosecutor Jens Rommel knows that if the Central Office does not complete a full inventory of Nazi war criminals, the information will be lost to history. “It’s important both for the survivors and their relatives, and for German society as well … The point now is to say we’ve left nothing out.” Sport Take a deep breath and bunker down: it’s transfer deadline day. Liverpool are on the verge of signing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for £40m from Arsenal and could take their spending inside a week to around £170m should Monaco sanction the sale of Thomas Lemar. The Gunners, meanwhile, are on tenterhooks over Alexis Sánchez, with Manchester City hopeful that an improved bid will persuade the London club to sell their star player. In tennis, Kyle Edmund is the last Brit standing in the men’s draw at the US Open after he beat Steve Johnson and there were defeats for Aljaz Bedene and Cameron Norrie. Nick Kyrgios, the Australian player, has said he has no devotion to tennis and probably never would after completing a “diabolical” grand slam season with a first-round defeat at Flushing Meadows. And the Maria Sharapova Show, a drama in two parts, extended its New York run on day three when Tímea Babos bowed to the Russian’s enduring aura. Business Flush from fighting off a £15m claim about a deal he made in a London pub, Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley is back in court battling another former associate. This time the Newcastle United owner says former club director Tony Jimenez owes him £3m over a golf course deal that went wrong. In the US, Donald Trump has vowed to cut corporation tax to 15% and “bring back Main Street” by revitalising small businesses. It helped Wall Street into positive territory, giving a strong lead to Asian markets overnight. The FTSE100 is expected to open up 0.11% this morning. The pound has been buying $1.292 and €1.087. The papers Two main themes today: the 20th anniversary of the death of Princess Diana and the future of Theresa May. The Mirror takes up the whole of its front with a picture of Princes William and Harry accompanied by the splash headline: “All of us lost somebody”. The Telegraph uses the same quote and appends the words “that day”. The Sun also devotes its entire front to pictures of the princes and says: “She’s still the people’s princess”. The Mail splits its front between Diana’s sons and Theresa May’s declaration that “I will fight the next election”. The Times goes for a similar treatment. “I’m no quitter” is the May quote picked out by the Guardian. The FT goes its own way, revealing that the NHS is to pay £100m to recruitment agencies to find 5,000 new doctors.

But there’s one question that Google apparently doesn’t want answered: is Google a monopoly? Barry Lynn, until this week a senior fellow at Washington thinktank the New America Foundation, has spent years studying the growing power of tech giants like Google and Facebook. He believes the answer is yes. And that opinion, he argues, has cost him his job. This week Lynn and his team were ousted from New America after the New York Times published emails that suggested Google was unhappy with his research. The tech giant, along with executive chairman Eric Schmidt, have donated $21m to New America since 1999. Schmidt chaired the organisation for years and its main conference room is called the “Eric Schmidt Ideas Lab”. “I’ve been there for 15 years,” Lynn told the Guardian. “And for 14 everything was great. In the last year or so it has got more difficult. And from every piece of evidence that we are seeing that has to do with pressure from Google. “Every day I see people waking up to the power of Google, Facebook and Amazon. We have to do something as a people, we have to do something through our government and address the power of these companies. The number of congressmen and others making statements on Capitol Hill about this is growing very rapidly. The number of businesses who are saying that something must be done about the power of these companies and the way they use their power.” Google enjoyed a long honeymoon where it was seen as a force for good. But as fears over tech oligopolies grow, industry giants such as Amazon, Google and Facebook have found themselves the subject of greater scrutiny from governments and skeptics in academia. Lynn, who ran New America’s Open Markets Initiative, said his problems began last June when the European Union fined Google a record €2.42bn ($2.7bn) for breaching antitrust rules and abusing its market dominance. Lynn posted a brief note applauding the decision and calling on US regulators “to build upon this important precedent”. The post effectively ended his 15-year career at New America, he claims. In a statement New America’s chief executive Anne-Marie Slaughter called the claims “absolutely false” and blamed Lynn’s “repeated refusal to adhere to New America’s standards of openness and institutional collegiality” for the decision. Google said it would “not be a fair characterization at all” to blame Google for the decision. “I can confirm that our funding levels for 2017 have not changed as a result of NAF’s June post, nor did Eric Schmidt ever threaten to cut off funding because of it,” a spokeswoman said via email. But for Lynn and others, this was more than just an office spat with a thinktank backer or office politics gone wrong . It represents a threat to independent research at a time when companies like Google are consolidating their enormous power. “Things started going wrong last summer,” Lynn told the Guardian. Open Markets began working with senator Elizabeth Warren to help her prepare a speech on America’s monopolies and what to do about them. Google, Amazon and Facebook were platforms that could become tools “to snuff out competition,” Warren warned. “Anyone who loves markets knows that for markets to work, there has to be competition. But today, in America, competition is dying. Consolidation and concentration are on the rise in sector after sector. Concentration threatens our markets, threatens our economy, and threatens our democracy.” Before the conference Slaughter’s response was to email Lynn, a correspondence which the New York Times obtained. “We are in the process of trying to expand our relationship with Google on some absolutely key points … just think about how you are imperiling funding for others.” Shortly after the Times story was published earlier this week, Lynn and his team were out. New America had traditionally given its experts autonomy. “They could say what they wanted to say,” said Lynn. “We had these units of expertise and the tradition at New America was that you trusted these experts.” Lynn said he would guess that Google’s attitude had changed for two reasons. First, Open Markets had been gained greater weight in the eyes of policymakers and enforcers. Second, regulators, especially in Europe, have clearly moved towards taking more action. “Google is a very sophisticated team of people. They know how to spend their money and wield their influence in ways that usually get them what they want,” Lynn said. “In terms of researchers, the danger is that research and work writing about Google, about platform monopoly in general, work that should be be doing for the good of the American public will not be done.” Marshall Steinbaum, research director and fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, agrees. “On one level it is completely shocking that something like this has taken place, but it is also not surprising given the degree of market power these companies have. “This is a huge issue in higher education policy. Given the diminished financing from state and federal sources, independent research has become more reliant on corporate sources,” he said. And with that comes strings. Pressure for change is mounting. Luigi Zingalesm, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School, recently told the Financial Times that he and others believe antitrust laws should be reverted back to old laws that also limited political power – and in particular, continued the FT article, “the ability of rich companies and people in coastal areas to control everyone and everything else”. Lynn has incorporated Open Markets Initiative as a separate entity and is working on launching a new thinktank. He said he hopes his new group will provide a platform for independent research into the power of companies like Google and Facebook. “These effects are in so many corners of the political economy,” said Lynn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/30/lakewood-church-joel-osteen-hurricane-harvey","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T22:21:18Z","webTitle":"Why did America's biggest megachurch take so long to shelter Harvey victims?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/lakewood-church-joel-osteen-hurricane-harvey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/lakewood-church-joel-osteen-hurricane-harvey","fields":{"headline":"Why did America's biggest megachurch take so long to shelter Harvey victims?","bodyText":"Towers of diaper boxes were stacked so high it looked like someone was trying to build a scale model of Manhattan. Pillows were piled up against a wall, a supermarket aisle’s worth of toiletries were on offer, and a medical team waited for the wounded and the sick at a triage desk. Outside, people lined up by the dozen to enter. But what took so long? For his church’s slow reaction to tropical storm Harvey, Joel Osteen, the celebrity pastor of America’s biggest megachurch, has found himself the target of a barrage of criticism. Osteen is one of America’s richest pastors. When congregations for multiple services are combined, 35,000 to 50,000 people attend services at Lakewood church weekly, and Osteen’s sermons are seen by more than 7 million people on TV and online. His 2004 book Your Best Life Now was on the New York Times bestseller list for over 200 weeks. His wife, Victoria, is co-pastor. The Osteens are thought to be worth millions of dollars and live in a part of Houston that makes Beverly Hills look understated. Their net worth was calculated at over $55m in 2012, and although the church draws revenues of over $70m a year, Osteen says his only salary comes from book sales. His Night of Hope worship tour has appeared at venues such as New York’s Yankee Stadium. The controversy raged around the Osteens over the weekend as shelters sprouted up elsewhere, from mosques to mattress shops, but Lakewood church did not begin operating as a large-scale shelter and supplies distribution hub until Tuesday. “A church like this with this mode of preaching, it’s supposed to be one of the first to open,” said Andy Osawe, as he stood by the church’s entrance on Wednesday. His home flooded, so he is staying with a friend but hoped to collect some basics: “Shoes, toiletries, little things.” The 56-year-old had seen coverage of the criticism. He wondered if the church had been reluctant to house bedraggled masses in its immaculately maintained building and was now acting decisively because of the negative publicity. “This is just a last resort. They’ve got to,” he said. “Normally they’re supposed to know what to do. This is what I’m saying about humanity – you don’t need to be pressurized to do something.” The Osteens preach a distinctively American form of Christianity: the “prosperity gospel”, which holds that God rewards the deserving with material success. Immense wealth, they might argue, is not only compatible with their beliefs but a validation of them. The logical reverse side of such gospels is that poverty is in essence a matter of individual responsibility. “I preach that anybody can improve their lives,” Osteen, a youthful-looking 54, has said. “I think God wants us to send our kids to college.” It clearly chimes for many residents in Houston, a city that touts a can-do, dynamic capitalist ethos inflected by the get-rich-quick spirit of Texas’s periodic oil booms. With a huge choir, expert musicians, slick preachers, giant screens and audio-visual flair that rivals anything you might find on Broadway, the church’s emphasis is firmly on scale and spectacle. That Lakewood’s services feel like the intersection of religion and entertainment is thanks in no small part to the venue itself, the one-time home of the NBA’s Houston Rockets. Lakewood moved here in 2003 and has spent $95m on renovations. The main auditorium seats about 17,000 people. The auditorium is not being used as a shelter because its sports-arena configuration of steep banks tightly packed with seats is unsuitable for placing mattresses and storing supplies; relief services are being offered in adjacent rooms and hallways. On Wednesday morning, there were hundreds of volunteers taking care of about 410 people, said Donald Iloff Jr, Lakewood’s chief of communications. The Osteens were not available for comment because they had temporarily left after spending the morning at the church, but Joel told CNN it was a “false narrative” to suggest that Lakewood’s doors had been shut. “There was a safety issue the first day or two,” he said. “We would never put people in here until we know that it’s safe, and it was not safe those days, let me tell you.” Iloff said the church was open throughout the storm and three or four people arrived, but it was not formally designated as a shelter because of flooding and accessibility concerns, and since the main downtown refuge is a only a few miles away. “We’re not selling hamburgers, man. You ain’t gonna buy from us instead of McDonald’s. Go to the place you should go to, which is the Red Cross centre … we weren’t the best shelter to go to,” he said, adding that during tropical storm Allison, in 2001 (when Lakewood was in a different building), it acted as a large shelter. “You have the haters,” Iloff added. “There are people who don’t like our ministry, don’t like Joel, don’t like Lakewood church specifically. And then there is a significant portion of the population that hates faith and religion.” Melissa Moreno felt grateful, regardless of the timing: her family of seven had to leave their home after it was inundated by five feet of water on Saturday. They were rescued by boat and stayed in another church; she was at Lakewood to pick up clothes, shoes and diapers. “Since we couldn’t even come through here [before] because the flooding was still going on, I’m guessing it’s a good day for them to open. It’s a big help for us,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/30/ivanka-trump-gender-pay-gap-obama-policy-rollback","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T20:56:25Z","webTitle":"Ivanka Trump supports rollback of Obama's policy to close gender pay gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/ivanka-trump-gender-pay-gap-obama-policy-rollback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/ivanka-trump-gender-pay-gap-obama-policy-rollback","fields":{"headline":"Ivanka Trump supports rollback of Obama's policy to close gender pay gap","bodyText":"Ivanka Trump, who came into her father’s administration vowing to fight for women in the workplace, has blessed a White House plan to roll back an Obama-era policy aimed at eliminating the gender pay gap. The initiative, which was unveiled by Barack Obama in January 2016, would have required employers to collect data on how much they pay their workers, broken down by gender, race and ethnicity. The administration confirmed this week it would halt the implementation of the rule – with the backing of Trump, a White House adviser who has hosted numerous roundtables on women’s economic issues. “Ultimately, while I believe the intention was good and agree that pay transparency is important, the proposed policy would not yield the intended results,” Trump said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing to work with EEOC, OMB, Congress and all relevant stakeholders on robust policies aimed at eliminating the gender wage gap.” An administration official told the Wall Street Journal that the Obama policy was “enormously burdensome”. “We don’t believe it would actually help us gather information about wage and employment discrimination,” said Neomi Rao, an administrator from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. In a memo released on Tuesday, Rao cited concerns over privacy and confidentiality issues, as well as with the paperwork associated with the data collection. Under Obama’s action, companies with more than 100 workers would have begun reporting more detailed information to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 2018. Some of the requirements were set to kick in next month. The former president had signed the executive order on the anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, an equal pay law Obama signed in 2009 that gave employees up to 180 days to file lawsuits after a discriminatory paycheck. Women’s groups swiftly criticized the reversal, with some taking aim at Trump given her professed support for equal pay. “Based on what we’ve seen so far, there’s nothing shocking about Ivanka, self-styled champion for women, turning her back on women when it suits her or her father,” said Alexandra De Luca, the press secretary for Emily’s List, a Democratic group that works to elect pro-choice women to public office. “She’s as much to blame for the relentless anti-woman agenda pushed by this administration as anyone in the White House.” Fatima Goss Graves, the president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, said the administration’s move was “an all-out attack on equal pay”. “Today’s action sends a clear message to employers: if you want to ignore pay inequities and sweep them under the rug, this administration has your back,” Graves said in a statement. The group also called out Ivanka Trump on Twitter, resurrecting a tweet on Equal Pay Day in April in which the president’s daughter said “women deserve equal pay for equal work”. Trump, who released a book this year titled Women Who Work, has vowed to advance women’s issues in the White House but thus far shown little progress. She is reportedly looking to advance a child tax credit in the upcoming debate over tax reform in Congress, but has been criticized by progressive groups for not going far enough in her proposals to date. Trump joined her father at a speech on tax reform in Missouri on Wednesday, in which the president said he hoped a tax reform package would address the costs of childcare. “That’s so important to Ivanka Trump,” he said. “So important to my daughter, it’s one of her very big beliefs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/30/serge-aurier-home-office-clearance-tottenham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T19:18:33Z","webTitle":"Serge Aurier given Home Office clearance to sign for Tottenham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/30/serge-aurier-home-office-clearance-tottenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/30/serge-aurier-home-office-clearance-tottenham","fields":{"headline":"Serge Aurier given Home Office clearance to sign for Tottenham","bodyText":"Serge Aurier is primed to complete a £23m (€25m) move from Paris Saint‑Germain to Tottenham Hotspur after the Home Office granted him a work permit. The London club have also announced the £8m signing of the 19-year-old Argentinian centre-back Juan Foyth from Estudiantes on a five-year contract. Aurier, a 24-year-old Ivory Coast international, was given a suspended two-month jail sentence last year for an assault on a police officer outside a nightclub in Paris. However he protested his innocence and appealed. The conviction had prevented him from entering the United Kingdom last November when PSG played Arsenal in the Champions League and it stood to derail his proposed move to Tottenham. Under Home Office rules, a person with a prison sentence cannot be granted a UK work visa for another five years. But the French courts have downgraded Aurier’s “convertible” sentence to a fine, meaning he was able to apply as normal for the permit. On Wednesday the Home Office informed Spurs the application had been successful. Mauricio Pochettino wanted a new right-back after he sold Kyle Walker to Manchester City for £50m and in Aurier he will get a dynamic, if controversial, figure. The manager has also added the centre-half Davinson Sánchez for a club record £42m from Ajax and Foyth will compete with him and the club’s existing options in the position: Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Eric Dier. Kevin Wimmer has been sold to Stoke City for £18m and Cameron Carter-Vickers has been loaned to Sheffield United for the season. Foyth has represented Argentina at under-20 level 12 times and was a key member of their Fifa Under-20 World Cup and Under-20 South American Championship squads this year. He said: “I really like Tottenham and I’ve always followed them since I was a boy. I really like the league, too, and now I’m going to try to make the most of this opportunity. It’s a dream for me. I also know that many young players are in the team at the moment. I think there’s a wonderful project here. “I believe my style of play is about bringing the ball out and keeping it on the floor. I like individual duels and players taking me on. I’m also fast, so that’s what I think I’m going to contribute to the team.” Harry Kane, the Spurs striker, has described Daniel Levy as a “great businessman”with the fans waiting to see whether the Tottenham chairman will make any deadline-day moves for players. Danny Rose, the injured left-back, had previously caused controversy when he criticised the way that Levy keeps a tight rein on the finances at White Hart Lane. “I’m with England and I don’t want to talk about it [Rose’s comments] too much,” said Kane at the national team’s training camp. “He said what he said but he now just needs to concentrate on getting himself fit and helping us again at Spurs. Daniel likes to do it on the last day [of the window] to get the best deal and we just have to wait and see. “He is a great businessman. He knows what he wants, he’s been around for a long time, he’s great for our club and he runs it in a very good way. The facilities we’ve got now are second to none. Some chairmen are different but he does what he does and feels it’s the best way to help out the team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/30/san-jose-silicon-valley-tiny-home-homeless-backlash","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T22:10:59Z","webTitle":"'Build a wall': emergency housing plan for homeless in Silicon Valley met with fear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/san-jose-silicon-valley-tiny-home-homeless-backlash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/san-jose-silicon-valley-tiny-home-homeless-backlash","fields":{"headline":"'Build a wall': emergency housing plan for homeless in Silicon Valley met with fear","bodyText":"Chants of “build a wall” rang through the meeting room in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose. But this was not a call for a barrier along the Mexican border – it was a cry to exclude homeless people. At the gathering convened by a city councilmember last week, several hundred locals met to discuss a controversial plan to build emergency housing in this affluent city, and get a handle on the homelessness crisis roiling it. One woman said she opposed the shelters because of possible negative impacts on owls and elk. One man made an obscure reference to A Modest Proposal, Jonathan Swift’s 18th-century satirical essay that advocated for poor Irish people to escape poverty by selling their children as food to the rich. The man suggested – probably also satirically – that San Jose consume its homeless population. For Sergio Jimenez, the councilmember who called the meeting, the chant had a particularly unwelcome resonance. “I’m Mexican, a Mexican immigrant, so ‘build the wall’ certainly doesn’t sit well with me,” he said in an interview later. In San Jose, a city of 1 million people and the headquarters for tech companies such as Adobe and PayPal, the plans to place homeless residents in “tiny home” villages have proved spectacularly contentious. On any night in San Jose, over 3,000 people sleep on the streets but there are only around 1,000 shelter beds. The city has proposed building one village in each of the 10 city districts, with no more than 20 homes in each. The homes would measure 70 to 80ft for a single person, and 120 sq ft for couples, with a bed, lockable door and space for storage. They would lack plumbing and municipal electricity, and would likely have solar-powered overhead lighting and a single outlet. Communal facilities would be provided in a central block. The houses are intended as stopgap until permanent housing becomes available. As California real estate becomes increasingly unaffordable – fast-food workers and cashiers must compete with those on tech salaries – San Jose is looking everywhere for solutions. While cities in the Pacific north-west have already embraced the tiny-home concept, San Jose’s seems to be the most ambitious plan yet. It is converting motels into housing and passed legislation allowing churches, mosques and other places of worship to permanently shelter people. There are over 500 homeless housing units in the pipeline. And last year, voters resoundingly approved a $1bn, taxpayer-funded, county-wide bond measure to provide additional housing for vulnerable populations. Still, while residents are willing to tax themselves to help homeless people, it’s a different question when it comes to them living next door. After city staff designated 99 city-owned parcels of land to evaluate as possible tiny-home sites, residents crowded into community meetings. While many support the plan, angry voices have been loudest. Several petitions criticizing the concept, with a total 5,027 signatures, have been created. Homelessness advocates are incensed. “This is one of Silicon Valley’s most important civil rights issues,” tweeted Jennifer Loving, executive director of Destination:Home. Several miles south of downtown, the neighborhood of Thousand Oaks is one of those that has organized. Around the district’s eponymous, square park there are well-kept suburban homes with basketball hoops and American flags. A patch of land bordering one side of the park has been earmarked for consideration as a tiny-home village. “If they wanna live in our neighborhood they should earn the right to buy a home in our neighborhood,” said Mike Martin, 63, an auto parts broker whose home office faces the site. He emphasized that he believes in charity, though not for homeless people who, in his view, have chosen to live as they do. (This idea, while widespread, is highly contestable.) Like other residents, he said he was afraid for the safety of children, and frustrated the neighborhood was barely consulted on the plan. “I have family who are homeless but I’m not gonna let them live in my house, live on my street corner,” he said. “I think it’s a great idea if you wanna put people up in a house, some facility,” he added later, “but don’t build it in my backyard.” In the park, a Russian woman in a tie-dyed outfit who has lived in San Jose for 16 years was walking her two large setters. Svetlana, 42, who declined to give her surname, resides in the next neighborhood over, but said she wasn’t bothered by the thought of a homeless settlement nearby. She spoke admiringly of a homeless man who had offered water to her dogs, and chalked up the outcry to a quirk of national character. “American people don’t like something unusual,” she said. “Even my dogs bark too much, they don’t like it. My dogs poop in the front yard, they don’t like it.” The ethics of putting people in structures reminiscent of garden sheds have been questioned. Barbara Poppe, a former head of the federal homelessness agency, has said that refugee camps offer a higher standard of living. But in Seattle, an evaluation of city-sanctioned encampments, including tiny-homes, was approving. It found that they did not cause a significant increase in crime, and around one-quarter of residents eventually moved into permanent housing. In San Jose, homeless people are enthusiastic. “I’d be the first one to sign up,” said a 65-year-old woman who gave her street name, Chata. She has been on the streets for over three years, after being ejected from a series of homes, and showed a reporter her gnarled toe, which she said was due to be amputated and prevented her from walking properly. “I don’t understand why [the city] can’t help me,” she said. Nearby, two men welcomed the idea, but predicted that homelessness would only worsen. “They’re gonna build a campus here for Google,” said Terry Hammer, who had been homeless until two weeks ago. He said that owing to the tech giant’s efforts to purchase property downtown, rents “are just gonna skyrocket”. His friend, Kenneth, said: “Does it seem odd to you, seeing so many homeless people in Silicon Valley?” At a raucous City Hall meeting on Tuesday, it became clear that the battle lines had been drawn. “When my husband and I put our life savings into a house in San Jose in 1997,” said a woman who took the lectern, “I never thought I’d be here asking you not to put homeless pods in our residential neighborhood.” There was loud applause. The mayor reaffirmed his support for building 10 villages, and the meeting broke up with a resolution to pursue a few pilot projects and consider other locations, punting rather than resolving the question.

Roșia Montană sits on Europe’s largest-known gold deposits – an estimated 314 tonnes of gold as well as 1,500 tonnes of silver – and has been at the centre of a drawn-out fight between the Canadian mining company Gabriel Resources and Romanian activists. To extract the gold, the mining project would involve the heavy use of cyanide, turning a nearby valley into a tailings dam holding up to 250m tonnes of cyanide-laced waste. It would also destroy four mountain peaks, nearby villages, and a series of 2,000-year-old Roman mining tunnels. Three weeks of mass protests in 2013 in effect halted the mine’s development, with the government withdrawing its support in 2014. During a televised discussion, the prime minister, Mihai Tudose, questioned the previous government’s decision to apply to Unesco for the site to be given world heritage status, with its impact on Romania’s ability to exploit the mineral resources in the future. He added that reversing the process now that the nomination had been submitted could prove hard. “We will try to withdraw it, to write that we no longer support the same point of view, which will put us in a very strange position with the international organisations,” he said. “If things remain final, it’s all over.” Those opposed to the mine believe that the government is trying to reverse course to avoid massive compensation claims. Since being granted an exploration licence in 1999, Gabriel Resources has invested $700m (£540m) in Romania. In late June the mining company filed a compensation claim for $4.4bn at the World Bank’s court of arbitration, with the first hearing set for September 2019. “The government is trying to strike a deal with Gabriel Resources,” said Stéphanie Danielle Roth, a Swiss-French environmental activist who has spent years campaigning to stop the mine. “It’s very worrying. The interview was no accident – Tudose was outlining the government’s plans for the future.” On 21 August local media reported that the law firm representing Romania in the dispute had sent a letter to the prime minister suggesting withdrawing from the arbitration and endorsing the mining project. Opposition politicians demanded to know if the reports were true. Mihai Goțiu, a senator for the opposition Save Romania Union party, warned shortly before the prime minister’s television appearance that the government was trying to withdraw the Unesco application and accused it of attempting to make a deal to keep hidden details of the hundreds of millions of dollars Gabriel Resources has spent to gain support among politicians, experts, journalists and others. Renewed protests against the mining project have been announced in several major Romanian cities for this weekend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/30/brazilian-court-blocks-abolition-of-vast-amazon-reserve","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T18:35:29Z","webTitle":"Brazilian court blocks abolition of vast Amazon reserve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/30/brazilian-court-blocks-abolition-of-vast-amazon-reserve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/30/brazilian-court-blocks-abolition-of-vast-amazon-reserve","fields":{"headline":"Brazilian court blocks abolition of vast Amazon reserve","bodyText":"A Brazilian court has blocked an attempt by the president, Michel Temer, to open up swaths of the Amazon forest to mining companies after an outcry by environmental campaigners and climate activists. The federal judge Rolando Valcir Spanholo said the president went beyond his authority in issuing a decree to abolish Renca, an area of 46,000 sq km (17,760 sq miles) that has been protected since 1984. Approving an injunction requested by public prosecutors, the judge said the dissolution of Renca (more formally known as the National Reserve of Copper and Associates) could only be done by Congress. But this may be only a temporary reprieve for the area, which is thought to contain deposits of gold, copper, tantalum, iron ore, nickel and manganese. The attorney general has appealed. In several previous cases related to development of environmentally sensitive areas or indigenous territory, higher court judges have overturned rulings made by local courts. But the injunction buys a little time for opponents and adds to the pressure on Temer, who has repeatedly come under fire for putting economic interests ahead of the environment. The announcement of the abolition of Renca prompted a furious backlash last week. An opposition lawmaker called the move the “biggest attack on the Amazon of the last 50 years”. The supermodel Gisele Bündchen, who has become a prominent advocate of forest protection, has accused the government of selling off the Amazon for private interests. Temer subsequently withdrew his initial decree, and re-issued it with a clarification on protections for indigenous territory and conservation areas. Environmental activists said the move was a marketing ploy, because 30% of the region would still be opened up to mining companies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/aug/31/fake-off-meet-bakings-masters-of-illusion-cakes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Fake off!

Meet baking’s masters of illusion cakes","bodyText":"Illusion cakes – cakes that look like something they are not – must have seemed the perfect trick to divert the eye from The Great British Bake Off’s own recasting. (Was it really Bake Off?) Illusion is a burgeoning area of baking, although its practitioners prefer to think of their creations as “hyperrealistic” and themselves as cake artists. Emma Thomas, a “curator of cake” (she is “employed to bring together cakes as you would do art for an art show”), says hyperrealism is a reaction to the tweeness of the sugarcraft movement. You know the kind of thing: cute puppies and friendly mice and sprays of roses. Hyperrealist cake artists don’t do friendly mice. They are more likely, in a nod to early hyperrealist cake artist Debbie Goard, to do dead rats. After cupcakes, popularised in the late 1990s by the Magnolia Bakery in New York, went mainstream, “People began to get bored of cake,” says Thomas. So cakes burst out of their frilly mini-cases and went sculptural. Most cake artists did not start out as bakers. Sarah Hardy studied as an artist before training in wax figures at Madame Tussauds. She became a hyperrealist pioneer five years ago when she submitted a cake to a show at Olympia in London. The theme was the seaside. “Everyone had done beach huts. What I did was to think as a sculptor and translate it to food. I did a rockpool with seaweed and mussels and barnacles. It was the ugliest cake there.” But it caught the judges’ eyes and she began to receive commissions, including one for a “half-zombie, half-human” cake for Georgia May Jagger’s birthday. A few months later, in early 2013, Natalie Sideserf entered a lifelike cake model of Willie Nelson’s head in a baking competition in Texas. She won, and the Sideserf Cake Studio was born. Sideserf studied fine art at Ohio State University, and Thomas says her work is now “the epicentre of hyperrealist cake art”. She achieved notoriety with her own wedding cake: a plate decorated with the words “Till death do us part”, on which rolled the severed heads of her and her husband. There is a dark seam to hyperrealist cake art – perhaps because the artists know that, sooner or later, their cakes must go to the knife. The endgame is built into the art’s conception. Hardy says: “There’s a tension there when you create something that’s very realistic. People don’t want to ruin it, they don’t want to cut it.” Hardy’s cakes start at about £500 and take up to two weeks to build, including the planning and armature. “You have to really enjoy and celebrate that brief time that [the art] is there for. With the gory stuff, people tell you they couldn’t eat it. But once they are in the room, they are compelled to try. It gives that extra element of looking disgusting and tasting amazing.” These cakes make horror palatable. Where will you put the knife? The sculpture changes shape as it is consumed. Its demolition is its fruition. Thomas once served a head cake. “I cut across her mouth and then down the middle of her face.” People were aghast. “I was like, ‘It’s lemon drizzle! It’s cake. Just eat it!’” But some people can’t. Cake artist Natasha Collins made a cake disguised as half-eaten trifle studded with cigarette butts at a party for Kerrang! magazine in 2011 but when they were “handed out to hardened rockers, no one would touch them”. She keeps her hyperrealist creations off her website in case it puts the brides off. The Bake Off bakers steered clear of horror, focusing instead on disguising cake as other foods – a sandwich, a bowl of ramen, a loaf of bread. These nod to the fast-food subset of hyperrealism, in which highly calorific foods are disguised as other highly calorific food. Ben Churchill, a rarity in the hyperrealist cake world in that he is a chef in his day job, specialises in breakfast-themed cakes – baked beans made of marzipan and covered in orange syrup, presented on toast that is a slice of lemon cake. He prefers congruity to surprise, so his realist lemons are made from lemon bavarois. Other essential ingredients for the fast-food hyperrealist are rice crispies (great for sesame seeds on buns, says amateur hyperrealist Katherine Solomon), marzipan (great for skin) and cornflakes (texture of fried chicken). But all you really need, says Hardy, is “a pile of chocolate, fondant and some really nice cake. It’s the food equivalent of clay and wood.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/01/sports-quiz-week-transfers-deadline-day-us-open-football","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T09:45:08Z","webTitle":"Sports quiz of the week: US Open, deadline day and the end of the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/01/sports-quiz-week-transfers-deadline-day-us-open-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/01/sports-quiz-week-transfers-deadline-day-us-open-football","fields":{"headline":"Sports quiz of the week: US Open, deadline day and the end of the world","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/30/brazilian-citizens-deserve-elections-now","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T18:01:15Z","webTitle":"Brazilian citizens deserve elections now | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/30/brazilian-citizens-deserve-elections-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/30/brazilian-citizens-deserve-elections-now","fields":{"headline":"Brazilian citizens deserve elections now","bodyText":"31 August marks one year since Dilma Rousseff’s removal as President of Brazil, when 61 senators trampled upon the political will expressed at the ballot box by the 54 million Brazilians who had elected her.

It is literally a part of business: store customers can watch any match they want on TV while shopping. NBC will continue to air 250 of the Premier League’s 380 matches live on any number its broadcast and cable channels – including NBC Sports and CNBC – this season. It is what is happening to the other 130 matches that has Rubin concerned. In the past, NBC had made those games available to watch online – providing a user had a cable subscription – making it easier to watch the Premier League in the US than in the UK. But now viewers must pay extra. How many will? The Premier League Pass, priced at $49.99, enables a subscriber to watch those 130 games streaming online, as well as access to what it calls “an unprecedented suite of shoulder programming,” or Premier League-related news and features. NBC says it will still carry the juiciest matches on broadcast or cable. “The investment by NBC since they took over the Premier League rights has been very impressive,” Rudin told the Guardian, “but we want to see as many people able to watch as many matches as possible. There has to be a revenue component to offering a comprehensive service, but we would prefer to see it come from advertising or sponsors, rather than from the viewer.” NBC announced its plan late in June and had issued a news release with specifics early in August, but soccer fans have said there was a lot of confusion over exactly what would be carried on the Premier League Pass. Some people assumed that as long as they subscribed to the full TV package, they would be able to stream online, as they had in the past. They were mistaken. Premier League supporters’ clubs in the US often gather at designated bars and pubs to watch a match together. NBC had not apparently considered that when offering certain matches only via streaming. Spurs played host to Burnley on Sunday morning in a match carried only in the US through the package. Fans told the Guardian they felt they were being “hustled” when they found out they could only watch through a paid stream. NBC’s decision to charge extra for the streaming product was inevitable. An NBC spokesman told the Guardian: “When we signed our long-term extension [in 2016] as the exclusive US media partner of the Premier League, we did so knowing that the media world was changing and that our delivery of content would change as well.” During a conference call in August 2015, in which NBC announced a six-year extension of its partnership with the Premier League, reported to be $1bn, Mark Lazarus, then the chairman of NBC Sports Group (and now chairman of NBC Broadcasting and Sports) did not rule out future fees, saying: “We are protected from the consumer behavioral change and how they are going to consume. Whether it’s digital, whether it’s television, whether it’s a pay‑for situation or whether it’s free over the air, we will have the ability, as long as we work within certain parameters that we have committed to, and we will work on our programming plan each year with the Premier League.” While there is anger among some fans at the new charges, it doesn’t appear there is a mass boycott of NBC’s coverage just yet. Through the first two weeks of the season, NBC reported that Premier League viewership is up 41% – with the caveat that ratings were down last August because of the Rio Olympics. Sports Media Watch reported the 20 August match between Tottenham and Chelsea drew a 0.4 rating and 629,000 viewers on the NBC Sports Network, up 135% in ratings and 148% in viewership from a similar timed – but less glamorous – match last year between West Ham and Bournemouth, but down from the 0.5 rating and 818,000 viewers that had watched Manchester City play Chelsea in week two of the season in 2015. Even though it has more than 80 international broadcast partners, the Premier League has determined that local broadcasters know their audiences better than it does, and is not getting involved in local decisions. “NBC Sports does an excellent job promoting the Premier League, and making the competition available to fans across the US,” Nick Noble, a spokesman for the Premier League, wrote in an email to the Guardian. “They have driven interest in our clubs, and the League as a whole, to unprecedented levels. As with all our broadcast partners, how they choose to make their programming available to viewers is a matter for them.” Rudin, for one, believes NBC’s new charges may end up hurting the Premier League as it continues its quest to grow its market in the US. “As far as the decision to charge for the streaming service, I think they will see viewership decline significantly with a paid streaming service, and that will ultimately hurt the league here in the US, as less people will be watching.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/30/tropical-storm-harvey-houston-voices-aid-shelter","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Voices from Houston: inside a shelter as thousands hide from the storm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/tropical-storm-harvey-houston-voices-aid-shelter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/tropical-storm-harvey-houston-voices-aid-shelter","fields":{"headline":"Voices from Houston: inside a shelter as thousands hide from the storm","bodyText":"Enrique Martinez, 29, office administrator “Our house and car got flood, no power or water, so we came here on Monday.

I dread to think how it affects my children","bodyText":"Children are at their unhappiest since 2010. This headline, from the Good Childhood Report, was one I glanced over at first. I rolled my eyes a little bit. Children have never had it so good, what with all their human rights, better life chances, better health. They have it all, right? Wrong. The report states that young people are worried – scared – about a plethora of things we adults wouldn’t expect to blip on their radar. Most shocking, perhaps, is that 36% of young people worry about their parents being able to pay the bills. A third have financial worries before even reaching adulthood. That should be a wake-up call to those with the power to change things. It makes me think back to the many times my children have gone without in order for us to put money on the electric; haven’t moaned (too loudly) at the thought of having fusilli twists with tomato and herb sauce for their dinner (again). I try to hide how bad things can be. All parents do. But the children have seen me and my husband working, and working hard – struggling to scrape together enough money to keep going for another month. They’ve seen me crying down the phone to my mum, even though I try to hide in the bathroom, begging for £20 to put on the gas card, because it’s all been used again, and this week I’ve already put £25 on the damned thing, and my God, it has a mind of its own and it’s trying to bleed me dry! They’ve seen me trying to make a meal out of three spring onions and a cup of rice. They’ve heard me talking to their dad, trying to work out a way to get through the next seven days with only £8.90 in my purse. (Spoiler alert – it can’t be done, however much I try. It won’t even cover the bus fare to school for my youngest daughter.) They see, and they hear. Children are sponges. That they take notice is demonstrated in small, yet significant, ways. Picking up Tesco value products, as though other brands don’t exist. Not telling me about school trips, because they know I will try to find a way for them to go – however much I will have to go without so that they don’t have to. My youngest is trying to convince me her school shirts (£10 each, only available from the school shop) will last her one more year. They won’t, but she’s adamant they will, which means I’ll sneakily buy new ones to replace those hanging in her wardrobe – she will never know. But of course she will. And I will never know the amount of times their friends haven’t been invited to our house, because it’s cold, or because we don’t even have squash; who wants to invite friends over and not be able to offer them drinks? I will never know all their schemes to make money – I only hear the finalised plans, which are worthy of Del Boy, and mean more to me than the kids will ever realise. Their empathy astounds me. But why should they be even having to think of ways to help us put food on the table? Children see everything, however much we try to hide bad stuff from them. They’re living the struggle alongside us. For children living in poverty, there is a weight of fear we dismiss too easily. We tell them not to worry, leave it to the grown-ups, get on with being children. How easy is that, if they happen to be living in a homeless shelter? If their stomachs are empty and they’re too tired to focus at school? How can they play freely when they know their parents aren’t so much keeping the wolves from the door, as standing on the doorstep begging the wolves not to come closer? For these children, the reality they know is a lot different to the one we like to imagine. There are no food-filled picnics and bike rides with friends in the country. No endless summer days filled with costly activities and ice creams. No latest fashions and gadgets. There’s just today, and then there will be tomorrow, which experience tells them will be no better. No different. No easier. Children aren’t as daft as adults would like to think. Yes, they’re resilient. Kids tend to bend where adults snap under the strain. But for their mental wellbeing, something needs to be done. A third of children shouldn’t have to worry about bills, groceries, and eviction. I’m sure that worry has scarred my own children, regardless of how hard I’ve tried to protect them. They live in fear of losing the little we’ve got. Security, when you’re living on the poverty line, is an illusion. And so, maybe, is childhood. • Kathleen Kerridge is an author of LGBT fantasy fiction, including the Searching for Eden series"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/september-britain-glorious-month-passing-of-summer-august","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T08:19:42Z","webTitle":"September-phobic?

Don’t be. It’s Britain’s most glorious month","bodyText":"That’s it, then. Summer’s perishing before our eyes. Those glorious days of sun and fun and adventure, of rest and recreation, of heat and light and carefree gaiety, all spent. Enjoy these last few hours because they’re all we’ll have of it until next year – if there’ll even be a next year. I know all this because #AutumnIsComing, apparently. What with tomorrow being 1 September, the season is about to turn. Some approach it with fear, as if it’s game over for 2017. But they needn’t. September is a wondrous thing in itself. The best of months. Don’t believe me? There’s one myth that needs nailing immediately. Contrary to what appears to be common perception, the weather does not suddenly deteriorate at the stroke of midnight on 1 September. In fact, the average September is not markedly different from the average August. Even better than that, September can be scorching: the hottest British day of 2016 fell in September. We spend two-thirds of September still tilted towards the sun; for two thirds of the month, daylight outlasts the night. September is effectively another month of summer. Yes, there are those who subscribe to the idea of something called meteorological autumn, which starts on 1 September. But despite the scientific-sounding name, it’s an imposition of an entirely arbitrary border on the natural flow of the year, determined by no more than the turn of a calendar. Far more sensible is the astronomical measure, based instead on the earth’s axis in relation to its orbit around the sun, according to which autumn does not begin until 22 September. So September is nothing to fear. In fact, it’s something to cherish. For those of us without school-age children or school-related jobs, it’s the perfect time for a British-based holiday: it’s less expensive and less busy and the weather is often delightful. But September also brings with it a more appropriate delineation of the day: by the end of the month, the sun rises at the civilised hour of 7am, and sets at a respectable 6.40pm. So the day wakes when we do, and evenings become evenings again; and dusk, of course, is the ideal light for tea. Ill-judged as it may be, September-phobia is worth examining, because it tells us things about ourselves. It tells us that patterns ingrained in childhood are hard to shift: the year becomes so defined by the academic calendar that it’s hard to shake that back-to-school feeling. It tells us that our lives are so busy we struggle to find time to look around and appreciate the rhythms of nature: I wouldn’t want to be unemployed again, but in the few months I spent out of work seven years ago I found myself far more aware of seasonal flows and turns. It also tells us something about psychology and words: September’s name gives the impression that it is related to those darker, wilder months that follow – the embers of the year – when really it belongs in a different category. And it is a category all of its own. September is a month like no other, melding the sunny joy of July with the cosy comfort of October. For many, it signals a fresh start. For others, it is August without the hassle. Yes, autumn is coming, but for the time being, summer lives on. • Peter Ormerod is a journalist with a particular interest in religion, culture and gender."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/aug/31/report-slams-distribution-of-governments-9bn-childcare-spending","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"Report slams distribution of government's £9bn childcare spending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/31/report-slams-distribution-of-governments-9bn-childcare-spending","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/aug/31/report-slams-distribution-of-governments-9bn-childcare-spending","fields":{"headline":"Report slams distribution of government's £9bn childcare spending","bodyText":"Children from families most in need will receive a startlingly low proportion of government spending on early years education and childcare, a report warns. The report, which was published on Thursday by Labour MP Lucy Powell and the Social Market Foundation (SMF), found that a mere £250m worth of the extra £9bn of spending over the next five years will reach the most disadvantaged UK families. It also found that the government’s new childcare spending will largely be enjoyed by the wealthiest parts of the population. The SMF figures showed that around 75% of the spending will go to families in the top half of the population by income. The report in particular criticises the government’s 30-hour-a-week offer for free childcare for infants aged three and four years, which is to begin operating nationally next month. Powell said: “With a singular focus on early years policies which subsidise the already well-off, the government is leaving disadvantaged children lagging further and further behind.” Powell, the MP for Manchester Central and a member of parliament’s education committee, said the UK lagged far behind other countries in tackling disadvantage and promoting social mobility. “Far from addressing this, over the next parliament this is set to get significantly worse with just 2.7% of new money for early education and care dedicated to the most vulnerable children, and only a quarter benefiting the bottom half by income of families. “This huge skewing of resources seriously risks a widening developmental gap between disadvantaged children and their better off peers at the age of five, creating a lost generation who will struggle to ever catch up,” Powell said before the report’s publication. The research looked at the total new spending on early years education and childcare projected for 2017-2022, and found that government policies skewed distribution towards “a collection of retail, political offers to parents”. The bulk of the additional £9bn comes in the form of tax-free childcare for three- and four-year-olds. The majority of extra funding appears to be going to higher income parents, with children from the most deprived backgrounds more likely to miss out. “There are concerns that the 30-hour expansion could damage early education and care as it stands, pushing up the price for parents, and reducing quality,” the SMF report claims. Evidence from pilot areas suggests competition for a limited number of places means that school nurseries and maintained pre-schools will have to prioritise those wanting 30-hour provision, and so halve the number receiving the current allocation of 15 hours per child. Powell proposes replacing the tax-free childcare with more progressive childcare support, with universal free early education from ages one to five. She said: “Ministers should scrap tax free childcare and reverse their inheritance tax giveaway, refocusing this investment to close the pre-school attainment gap forever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/30/west-brom-psg-grzegorz-krychowiak-loan","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T18:10:54Z","webTitle":"West Brom sign PSG’s Grzegorz Krychowiak on season-long loan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/30/west-brom-psg-grzegorz-krychowiak-loan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/30/west-brom-psg-grzegorz-krychowiak-loan","fields":{"headline":"West Brom sign PSG’s Grzegorz Krychowiak on season-long loan","bodyText":"West Bromwich Albion have completed the signing of the defensive midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak from Paris Saint-Germain on a season-long loan, with Kieran Gibbs also joining from Arsenal for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £7m.

Oxlade-Chamberlain was undergoing a medical with Liverpool staff on Wednesday at St George’s Park, where he is preparing for England’s World Cup qualifiers, having spurned a move to Chelsea in favour of working for Jürgen Klopp at Anfield. The Premier League champions had agreed a £40m deal with Arsenal on Monday but the England international, wary of replicating his right-wing-back role for Antonio Conte’s team, declined to discuss the personal terms on offer at Stamford Bridge. The 24-year-old’s stance enabled Liverpool to develop a long-standing interest in the midfielder and agree similar terms to what Chelsea had agreed – £35m plus £5m in add‑ons. Providing there are no unforeseen problems with the medical, Oxlade‑Chamberlain will become Liverpool’s second signing of the week following Naby Keïta. The RB Leipzig midfielder will move to Merseyside next summer after Liverpool paid a £7m premium on a £48m release clause to secure the Guinea international. Arsenal initially refused to hold talks with Liverpool over Oxlade-Chamberlain with relations between the club strained by the Luis Suárez dispute of four years ago. However, faced with the prospect of losing the player for nothing when his contract expires at the end of this season, and the midfielder’s reluctance to join Chelsea, they entered and concluded negotiations swiftly on Wednesday. Oxlade-Chamberlain made 198 appearances for Arsène Wenger’s side after arriving for £12m from Southampton in August 2011. Arsenal’s woeful 4-0 defeat at Liverpool on Sunday is destined to be his last. The midfielder started all four competitive games for Arsenal this season but rejected repeated attempts by the club to extend his contract. Wenger had claimed Arsenal would take a financial hit by keeping Oxlade-Chamberlain until the end of his contract only to relent with Chelsea and then Liverpool meeting the club’s valuation. The England international faces fierce competition to secure the central midfield role he craves at Anfield. Philippe Coutinho, wanted by Barcelona but not for sale, and Adam Lallana will soon return from injury to compete for places with Jordan Henderson, Emre Can and Georginio Wijnaldum, and Keïta’s arrival will further increase Klopp’s options. The competition may intensify this season with Liverpool refusing to concede defeat in their pursuit of France international Lemar. Liverpool have had several enquiries for the 21-year-old rejected by Monaco in recent days but will continue to pursue what would be another club record signing – in excess of £70m – until the deadline. The club’s medical staff are on standby to travel to Clairefontaine, where Lemar is preparing for France’s World Cup qualifier against Holland on Thursday, should Monaco relent and agree terms with Liverpool on the final day. Liverpool also remain interested in Virgil van Dijk but have received no indication that Southampton are prepared to sell their unsettled central defender. Anfield’s business on deadline day will not be confined to incomings. Crystal Palace have not given up hope of signing Mamadou Sakho having had three bids for the French defender rejected this summer. West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City are also interested in the former Paris Saint-Germain captain. Lazar Markovic could be reunited with his former Hull City manager Marco Silva at Watford and Wolfsburg look set to sign Divock Origi on loan after agreeing to pay a fee of £6m for the Belgium strikerOrigi has also been linked with transfers to Tottenham and Newcastle United but Liverpool prefer a loan deal with a European club. They would not consider a loan deal for Origi with a Premier League rival such as Spurs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/aug/31/lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel-formula-one","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel’s epic battle makes Monza unmissable | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/31/lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel-formula-one","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/31/lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel-formula-one","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel’s epic battle makes Monza unmissable","bodyText":"Lewis Hamilton is a driver who wears his heart on his race suit but after victory at Spa his usual exhilaration was tempered by a somewhat cold detachment. In the Ardennes there was a steely acknowledgement that he had won only a minor battle in what promises to be a long fight. Hamilton knows how tough this season’s title fight is going to be. He does so due to the competitiveness Ferrari showed in Belgium on what was expected to be a Mercedes track and because of how title rival Sebastian Vettel extracted everything from his car. For Hamilton it was a cause for caution but for the rest of us it was exactly the start the second half of the season needed and makes this weekend’s meeting at Monza unmissable. Hamilton won at Spa, having held off two determined efforts from Vettel to pass, the second featuring a glorious piece of braking on cold, soft tyres to deny the German, whose lead in the championship was halved to seven points. His pleasure was tempered by the knowledge of how hard he had had to push to hold off his competitor. “People said, ‘You don’t look happy’. I’m happy, but it’s not over,” he said. “I know the difficulties that may be ahead.” Spa, a high-speed, fast-flowing circuit like Silverstone, where Mercedes had dominated, was expected to fall easily to the silver arrows. Vettel’s performance rewrote that script. He was rarely more than 1.5seconds behind Hamilton and had he had track position – clean air and leading from pole – Hamilton doubted he would have been able to make a pass. Ferrari then have developed their car strongly since Silverstone, where Vettel admitted they were nearly a second off the pace. The British Grand Prix however is increasingly looking like a race where Mercedes’ advantage was exaggerated by Ferrari underperforming, which Vettel confirmed. “We didn’t change too much compared to Silverstone,” he said. “Which shows on the one hand that Silverstone was just a bad weekend, but we improved the car, especially the race pace.” Across the stints and on differing compounds at Spa there was almost nothing to chose between them. Hamilton, only hundredths up in the first third, Vettel likewise in the second, with Mercedes’ decision to put Hamilton on soft tyres at the death giving him a one to two-tenths advantage once they had warmed up on the sprint to the finish. In wringing so much from his car, Vettel’s performance was formidable, skilful and obdurate. The four-time world champion proved again that with confidence in his machinery he can drive the wheels off it. Vettel was able to stay with Hamilton despite running in his turbulent air and efforts to shake him off. That the driver was making the difference was clear, he had opened up a gap to his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, who has won four times at Spa and had been quick all weekend, of just over six seconds after seven laps. With Ferrari and Mercedes remaining so close and the two leaders being so well-matched the eight race run-in to the title is a mouthwatering prospect. Vettel says Ferrari have nothing to fear on any track and Hamilton knows it will go down to the wire. “The next race maybe it will be the same, or who knows, maybe our gap will be bigger, or they’ll be ahead again. I can’t predict it,” he said. That next race is Monza, on paper a track that should favour Mercedes – especially in qualifying – with their straight line speed on the straights of the Autodromo Nazionale, where 75% of the lap is at full throttle. But the circuit also features six very heavy braking zones – where Ferrari should have the upper hand. It could prove even tighter than Spa, with the temple of speed hosting a thrill ride. That it will be packed to the rafters to do so is a given, as the tifosi flock to their home race. It will be the culmination of proof of a simple point in F1: make the racing competitive and in Europe at least there is no problem in attracting fans. The Formula One Group has taken to issuing grand prix attendances as weekend figures which can be misleading but that they have gone up is undeniable. Spa was heaving, benefiting from the Max Verstappen-Stoffel Vandoorne effect but also reflecting the added attraction in having two teams and two truly great drivers fighting for the championship. The grandstands were full but equally, out on the general entry area of the grassy slopes overlooking the Kemmel Straight, it was rammed from top to fence. They had a record attendance of 265,000 over the weekend – up 11.8% on 2016. Silverstone was packed as always, with 344,500 fans. Barcelona had 178,000 (up 8%); Budapest 199,000 (up 11.5%) and even Austria, which had seen a decline since its return to the calendar, had 145,000, an improvement of 58%. Formula One’s chief executive, Chase Carey, was at Spa, as he has been at many races thus far. His organisation has many ideas for the future and hopefully he has taken note that while some tracks require Justin Bieber to bring the crowds (although this writer’s preference would be for it to be the Dead Kennedys with Jello Biafra behind the mic – which might not achieve quite what Carey is aiming for), in the sport’s heartlands, decent racing will do the trick."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/30/aaron-rodgers-colin-kaepernick-nfl-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T08:30:07Z","webTitle":"Aaron Rodgers: racial injustice is 'real' and Kaepernick should be in NFL","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/30/aaron-rodgers-colin-kaepernick-nfl-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/30/aaron-rodgers-colin-kaepernick-nfl-protests","fields":{"headline":"Aaron Rodgers: racial injustice is 'real' and Kaepernick should be in NFL","bodyText":"Aaron Rodgers, arguably the best player in the NFL, believes his fellow quarterback Colin Kaepernick deserves to be playing in the league and his continued absence is due to his protest over racial injustice in the US. The former San Francisco 49ers player became a controversial figure last year after he refused to stand for the national anthem in what he called a protest against oppression of people of color. He opted out of his contract in March and became a free agent, but so far, no NFL teams have signed him for the upcoming season, which kicks off next week. “I think [Kaepernick] should be on a roster right now,” Rodgers says in a wide ranging interview with ESPN published on Wednesday. “I think because of his protests, he’s not.” In the interview, Rodgers said he would not join in the protests – which have continued into the current pre-season – but was “100% supportive” of players who chose to express their feelings. He added that the US needs to “remedy and improve” racial equality, and that he wanted to improve his understanding of the subject. “I think the best way I can say this is: I don’t understand what it’s like to be in that situation. What it is to be pulled over, or profiled, or any number of issues that have happened, that Colin was referencing — or any of my team-mates have talked to me about ...

For decades the stretch of sun-beaten concrete running from the Simi Hills to Long Beach has been little more than a glorified storm drain, best-known as a backdrop for dozens of movies, including Grease, Chinatown and Terminator 2. Not for long: $100m of state funding has just been dedicated to revitalising the LA River, extending the existing bike path to Downtown, improving access and creating a sprawling 51-mile wildlife habitat. This is in addition to the city’s acquisition of a 42-acre parcel of land, a former railway yard due to be converted into grassy wetland, which Michael Atkins of Friends of the Los Angeles River (Folar) says will be the “greatest park in LA”. Angelinos may have to wait up to 10 years until the park and the regeneration programme is complete but it seems that the river is giving itself a head start. Pedalling along the Elysian Valley in Central LA (an area known locally as Frogtown), I pass blue herons, cormorants and lush vegetation that has pushed its way through cracks in the concrete. For those who don’t know their sandpiper from their bufflehead, The Frog Spot, a waterside kiosk run by the Friends of the LA River, offers free nature walks. It’s not just the river that is undergoing a renaissance – the quiet riverside neighbourhood of Frogtown itself is also enjoying an upsurge, home to Latino and Asian families whose pastel-coloured bungalows butt up against warehouses, artists’ studios and a pickle factory. Overlooking the water, the recently renovated Spoke Bicycle Café provides a welcome shady retreat. Just a block away is Wax Paper, a micro-cafe in a shipping container. Opened 20 months ago, it was one of the pioneers of the Frogtown scene and is a friendly neighbourhood joint with an entire menu named after radio hosts. Nearby, The Left Bank is a boutique packed with vintage gems (and a free backyard comedy night). As I pedal the four miles to Griffith Park and back, I cruise past a row of modern industrial live/work units – evidence of riverside living’s appeal. At the end of the ride, I’m more than ready for an ale at Frogtown Brewery. Nearing sunset, I park my bike outside a Frogtown favourite, Salazar, a former mechanic’s shop converted into a stylish alfresco Mexican restaurant. “You could never do this on Sunset Boulevard,” says owner Billy Silverman, nodding towards his outdoor patio. Next door a band is sound checking at Zebulon, the iconic Brooklyn music venue that decamped here in April. It makes the most of its cavernous new space with an almost nightly array of international musicians. Although the neighbourhood will benefit from better access to the river and its wildlife, not to mention a car-free route to Downtown LA, not everyone in the community welcomes the changes. There has been tension over recent property prices, a lack of parking and tales of greedy landlords charging exorbitant rent. However Michael Atkins of Folar is optimistic about the long-term benefits of revitalisation to all its residents: “Our mission is to make sure that people can interact with the river and bring them closer to the wildlife. We want to do something grand for Angelinos.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/31/diana-warning-women-tragedy-princess","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Diana was our society’s warning to women | Bidisha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/diana-warning-women-tragedy-princess","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/diana-warning-women-tragedy-princess","fields":{"headline":"Diana was our society’s warning to women","bodyText":"I remember the day Diana died. I was 19, and had crashed at a friend’s place in town. When I woke up – 20 years ago today – the friend said: “Princess Diana is dead.” I went outside and the streets, tube stations, shops and cafes were empty and silent. In the evening I visited Buckingham Palace and that too was silent. Disbelief, remorse and regret hung in the air. These emotions were not misplaced or overblown. I think Diana’s death triggered an intelligent, feminism-influenced grief that people of both sexes understood, either overtly or subconsciously. Her tragedy was to be cut down at the apex of a personal awakening that many women experience. Diana was brought up to be nice, to be kind, to be pretty without being sexual, to be a supportive wife and good mother. Like many women, she entered wedlock in good faith, wore the dress, got the ring, and entered the marital home – only to discover that there was nothing there except betrayal, contempt and duty. The fabled love-bower was a piece of cheap cardboard advertising. Her virtue and devotion counted for nothing: were taken advantage of, not cherished. Her beauty retained no sexual allure for her husband. First she was lonely, then she was angry, then she was bored. Then she struck out for self-definition: to create a role for herself and find some dignity and respect, even some joy, in an unjust world. As soon as she could, she got a divorce. This is what Diana did and it is what many women do. Diana divested herself of stuffy, English, insular, 19th-century monarchical pomp and became part of a more cosmopolitan, sophisticated, racially diverse 20th-century super-elite. Instead of attending interminable state banquets she attended gallery openings, which are much more fun. She was carving out a career as a humanitarian, prefiguring the current era in which Hollywood actors become UN ambassadors, and she was doing divorced dating, including having non-white boyfriends. That shouldn’t be a big deal, but it still is. Diana was becoming her own woman just as she was killed, and part of the country’s horror derives from witnessing an ancient curse against women come true: if you dare to diverge from being “a good girl”, you will be punished. Diana’s intimation that she was being set up for death may not have been correct in every detail – in the sense of the royal family plotting to have her murdered – but her instincts were right and her sense of foreboding was justified. The emotion displayed at her death and the melancholy ruminations of the following two decades are understandable. They stem from an aggrieved recognition of the earthly manifestation of a nasty folkloric lesson: the patriarchal world will shoot you down as a warning to all other women, just as you are making a bid for freedom. In fictional narratives the death of a woman is seen as poignant, as perversely pleasurable even as the audience weeps over the woman’s circumstances and fate: think of the plots of the “great” operas and ballets, or such novels as Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina, all written by men. The reality is tawdry and shameful. Diana was indeed killed, in an unnatural, brutal and spectacular way: hunted down by men who had been targeting her mercilessly for years. They caused her death, and then they objectified and violated her dignity even further: standing over her and photographing her as she died, to help their own careers. When they were done, they discarded her and found other women to follow. That is misogyny writ large; it’s The Rite of Spring, rendered in tabloid format. The legend of Diana resonates because it is an exaggerated version of many women’s emotional reality. In her life and death we see the broadest, most pessimistic interpretations of patriarchal power spelled out. First, Diana was the subjugated Victorian woman, maintaining an angelic image while privately isolated, disrespected and betrayed by her husband and in-laws, the royal family who both protected and controlled her. She escaped, but as a 20th-century media celebrity she was vulnerable to the brutality of the uncontrolled and chaotic wider world, where the abuse comes from strangers and is physical as well as mental: a pack of men watching and tirelessly hounding her in the night. They used motorbikes and cameras to torture her, but underneath these modern gadgets was a warning as old as time: any woman who has the audacity to break her bonds – to speak her truth, supersede her expected role, or go out in public and try to live her life – deserves anything that is done to her physically and mentally. She will be punished for her arrogance, even to death. • Bidisha is a broadcaster, critic and journalist for the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky News"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/30/im-not-a-quitter-theresa-may-says-she-could-fight-another-election-as-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T21:00:12Z","webTitle":"'I'm not a quitter': Theresa May says she could fight another election as PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/30/im-not-a-quitter-theresa-may-says-she-could-fight-another-election-as-pm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/30/im-not-a-quitter-theresa-may-says-she-could-fight-another-election-as-pm","fields":{"headline":"'I'm not a quitter': Theresa May says she could fight another election as PM","bodyText":"Theresa May insisted she could fight another general election as prime minister, arguing that she is “not a quitter” despite June’s disastrous election result and repeated criticisms of her leadership style. Risking reigniting anger from within her own party, the Conservative leader said that she was “in this for the long term” and that there was no foundation to reports that she planned to step down in 2019 after Brexit. In a television interview in Japan, where May has been meeting Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, she said: “There’s a real job to be done in the United Kingdom. It’s about getting the Brexit deal right, it’s about building that deep and special partnership with the European Union but it’s also about building global Britain, trading around the world.” Asked if she would step down before the next election, due in 2022, May told ITV: “I’m not a quitter.” Talking to Sky News, May was asked if she wanted to lead the Conservatives into another election. “Yes,” she replied. “I’m in this for the long term.” The prime minister is keen to stamp her authority on her party before a series of tough Brexit battles in autumn’s parliament, with the EU (withdrawal) bill returning to the House of Commons next week. But she insisted her personal ambitions extend beyond the Brexit negotiations, the third round of which continued in Brussels on Wednesday. “What I’m clear that I want to do is, yes, get on with the job of Brexit, but it’s not just about Brexit. What I want to do is a lot more about the long term, which is about changes domestically, on issues like social justice,” she said, speaking to reporters on the flight to Japan. May has been widely viewed as a lame duck prime minister since the election, which saw her criticised for being unwilling to engage with voters, a repeated use of stale formulations such as “strong and stable leadership” and offering up a narrow set of policies that did not capture the public imagination. The Conservatives lost their overall majority, and May apologised to the Tories’ backbench 1922 Committee, telling the MPs she would only serve as long as they wanted her to fix the “mess” she had created. Many thought that meant she would hang on only to conclude the Brexit talks. Some MPs, including serial backbench rebels Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, have made it clear they believe May cannot lead the party into another election. Morgan said in June that the Conservatives “must not miss the opportunity” of replacing May once the Brexit negotiations are completed next year. Former chancellor George Osborne, now Evening Standard editor, described her as a “dead woman walking”. Cameronite Tories are unenthusiastic about any of the cabinet big beasts who would be frontrunners for the leadership if a contest was held immediately – Boris Johnson, David Davis and Philip Hammond. They hope delaying a contest could allow younger candidates, such as foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat, to build up their reputation. Leadership hostilities ceased over the summer only on the tacit understanding that May was willing to take the flak over Brexit, and then step down. Johnson, speaking to the BBC on a visit to Nigeria, said he would continue to back May. “We need to get Brexit done,” the foreign secretary said. “She’s ideally placed to deliver a great outcome for our country and then deliver what we all want to see, which is this exciting agenda of global Britain. I think she gets it. She really wants to deliver it. I’m here to support her.” One senior Conservative backbencher told the Guardian most MPs would be relieved rather than concerned by the prime minister’s words. “It’s far better that there’s clarity that she’s here for the long haul, it should quieten some of the nonsense that we’ve seen, which has now died down and was coming from one or two people at most,” the MP said. “No Conservative MP should want any talk of a leadership contest or an early election. There’s a serious job to do.” Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative health select committee chair, who was critical of May and the “negative” Tory manifesto, said most backbenchers believed the prime minister had learned from the election and had listened to concerns. “She was right to do this to put a lid on the wild speculation,” Wollaston said. “The country needs a period of calm.” Two former Conservative MPs ousted at the last election both warned that May needed to offer something more hopeful if she planned to fight the next one. Ben Howlett, who lost his seat to the Lib Dems in Bath, said he was optimistic the announcement would “start to settle the government and the party” and “even start to give stability to Brexit discussions”. Neil Carmichael, who lost his Stroud seat to Labour, said the PM still had to learn from her mistakes. “This is going to be a turbulent time and I suppose it’s wise for the captain of the ship to remind people she is still holding on,” he told BBC Newsnight. “I’m sure if she was to fight the next election she would focus on the economy – I can’t imagine there would be any mention of fox hunting.” Jon Trickett, shadow cabinet office minister, said May’s comments showed the prime minister was “deluding herself” about her prospects. The Labour MP said: “Theresa May leads a zombie government. The sooner the public has a chance to vote her and her government out, the better for our country’s future.” The PM’s comments carry an echo of Margaret Thatcher’s infamous 1987 promise to “go on and on” in power, seen retrospectively as a starting point for the dissent which eventually toppled her three-and-a-half years later. May’s visit to Japan will see her hold a series of talks with Abe, as part of an intensive three-day visit intended to reassure the country that the UK can swiftly replicate the trade benefits of EU membership after Brexit. The first day saw the pair mainly discuss the threat from North Korea following the missile fired by Pyongyang over northern Japan on Tuesday. May told Abe that Britain “stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Japan in the face of North Korean aggression”, her spokeswoman said afterwards. May began her discussions with Abe over a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto, before a dinner where the dishes included salted sea cucumber entrails with yam. During a joint train trip to Tokyo on a Shinkansen (bullet train), May briefed Abe on the progress of Brexit. Discussions on Thursday will centre on May’s hope to kick-start post-Brexit trade by replicating existing or pending deals agreed by the EU, starting with Japan. • This article was amended on 31 August 2017.

Tensions boiled over in Brussels as the EU accused Britain of failing to reveal its hand on the financial settlement. UK officials hit back at the EU, saying some claims for money had no legal basis. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, vented his frustration amid slow progress during the third round of talks, which conclude on Thursday. “To be flexible you need two points – our point and their point,” Barnier told reporters. “We need to know their position and then I can be flexible.” Meanwhile, British negotiators fumed at suggestions they were not serious – a charge levelled by Barnier on Monday because the UK has not published a paper on the Brexit financial settlement. Over a three-hour Powerpoint presentation, British officials picked apart the EU claims over liabilities, which are reputed to be about €75bn, although Barnier has never cited a figure. Numbers were not on the table during the latest talks. Instead the two sides are trying to hammer out liabilities the UK could face – a politically sensitive task that will shed light on the final bill and is bound to incite charges of betrayal from hardline Brexiters. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has acknowledged the UK has “obligations” from its 44 years of EU membership, but is refusing to say what they are. The British team thinks the EU is trying to extract more than it is legally entitled to, on the basis of an “unsatisfactory” paper that runs to less than four sides of text and some tables. “The UK has made it clear that it finds the EU position paper on the money unsatisfactory and nobody would sign a cheque on the basis of the commission’s paper,” said a source familiar with the UK’s position. “It is also clear that they have an issue with the current view around town that ‘serious’ means agreeing with the commission. The UK doesn’t agree with it.” In particular, Britain is challenging the claim it should pay into the EU budget until the end of 2020. The EU has said the seven-year budget was agreed by David Cameron in 2013, while the UK counters there is no legal basis for the payments, and too many extras have been thrown in. Barnier has described as “incontestable” British liabilities, which include pensions, unpaid bills and the pending budget contributions. He has described the EU methodology as “rigorous and objective”. The stakes are high because the UK is barred from discussing its future with Europe until there is “sufficient progress” on the financial settlement, citizens’ rights and Ireland – a judgement that will be made by EU leaders. Throughout the negotiations, the UK has railed against this “inflexible” timetable, but the Brexit secretary’s calls to merge talks have been rejected. Barnier’s hands are tied, because his brief has been agreed by the EU’s 27 leaders, who have no wish to rewrite the mandate. While the UK hoped to pass the “sufficient progress” test in October, EU diplomats say they are not concerned about delays until the end of the year. As tempers frayed, Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said hopes of a divorce deal in October looked doubtful. “If it goes very slow, as is the case at the moment, it will be very difficult to say there is sufficient progress when we are in October,” he said. He added: “If only one party around the table is putting a position and the other party is not responding then it is difficult to start a negotiation.” The UK has more than 100 officials involved in the ongoing talks, which also cover citizens’ rights and Ireland. Progress has been heavy-going on citizens’ rights, with little hope of progress on the 50% of areas under dispute. The European health insurance card has proved to be a sticking point, meaning 27 million Britons could still lose the right to claim free or low-cost healthcare when visiting the continent. Even some of the less significant “other” issues are also proving harder to negotiate than some expected. The two sides are far apart on what happens to goods on the move on Brexit day. Although this issue could disappear with a transition deal, failure to reach any deal could lead to long queues at ports, as companies fall into a legal black hole. While the mood is intense, it is also understood to be respectful. There are seasoned negotiators on both sides, many of whom know each other from routine Brussels meetings. Verhofstadt said he saw signs of change in the UK, such as greater recognition that no deal is the worst possible outcome. He also said there was new understanding of the need for a transition period, which he predicted would replicate the status quo. “The more and more time we lose in the coming months, the more and more it is clear that the transition period can only be the prolongation of the existing situation, of the status quo,” Verhofstadt said. This view – firmly in the Brussels consensus – flies in the face of government hopes to secure brand new customs arrangements by Brexit day in 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/02/contactless-car-keys-debit-card","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Contactless means your car keys are the debit card of the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/02/contactless-car-keys-debit-card","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/02/contactless-car-keys-debit-card","fields":{"headline":"Contactless means your car keys are the debit card of the future","bodyText":"Fancy a chip attached to your fingernail to let you pay for goods in shops? Or a tattoo on your hand that lets you wave and pay when boarding a bus or train? Or giving your bank a print of your retina, so all that’s needed is a scan of your eye? These are just some of the ideas being studied by Barclaycard and Visa as the contactless spending revolution continues. More immediately, the first car keys to have a contactless Barclaycard chip embedded in them were launched this week with DS Automobiles, part of Peugeot-Citroën. Fitbit, the exercise tracker, also this week introduced a band that incorporates a contactless payment chip. With the Ionic tracker, due to go on sale next month, cardholders will be able to pay with Fitbit Pay. Meanwhile, on Thursday Visa also announced a partnership with Garmin, perhaps best known for its satnav and GPS products. Its Vivoactive 3 smartwatch will allow wearers to be able to pay via their watch. This month is the tenth anniversary of contactless or “touch and go” payments in the UK, and banks and payments companies are researching ever-more adventurous ways technology could be used to make it even faster. Tami Hargreaves, head of partnerships at Barclaycard, says: “Half of shoppers aged 25-34 would be open to alternative forms of contactless payments, such as retina scanning and contactless chips embedded in their palms and/or fingertips. This makes them the most ‘forward-thinking’ age group when it comes to contactless technology.” “Wearables” such as bracelets and watch straps fitted with contactless chips are already available, while there have been trials of wave-and-pay beer pumps, scarves and hats, and – this month – a contactless ice cream van allowing aficionados to pay for their Mr Whippy in just 60 seconds. Trials are essential to weed out problems – Visa put contactless chips into sunglasses but the problem was they were too easy to lose. At first a sceptical public was slow to embrace the idea. But contactless accounted for over 39% of all Visa face-to-face payments in Europe in April this year, up from 11% two years earlier. This summer Visa hosted the UK’s first contactless music festival, BoardMasters, where every retailer was offered the chance to go contactless, cutting queues and thus waiting times. Barclaycard is forecasting that spending this way will soar by more than 300% over the next four years as seven in 10 Brits begin to use it more frequently for everyday purchases. Its research indicates that almost six in 10 of us now use it, with 71% saying they choose to pay this way more frequently than 12 months ago – indicating a more recent spike in popularity. Just last month, debit cards overtook cash to become the number one payment method, according to data collected by the British Retail Consortium, with growth in contactless a prime driver behind the rise to dominance of the plastic card. Despite all this, half of retailers are yet to adopt the technology. Not all major names, including John Lewis, have done so – to their cost. Barclaycard says that businesses that accept contactless report the number of such sales rising by an average of 30% a day, with uptake increasing fastest among over 60s. But it’s not all about payments. At the Internet of Things Watson research centre in Munich, Visa is working with IBM to develop ways of using the technology to alert drivers when a car’s warranty or certification is about to expire, or if specific car parts need replacing. With this information the driver will be able to order parts with the push of a button, or schedule a service appointment. But Shashi Verma, chief technology officer and director of customer experience at Transport for London, who oversaw the original introduction of contactless payments for Oyster (the largest smartcard-based ticketing system in the world) in conjunction with Barclaycard, believes that wearables have limited attraction for consumers, and that card payments are a more secure and robust system for the longer-term. Popularity stakes · The Czech Republic leads Europe in terms of uptake of contactless payments, with usage of more than 85%. · Slovakia and Poland are in second and third place respectively, with usage in excess of 66%. · UK penetration currently stands at more than 42%.

Trump’s declaration, delivered as usual in the form of a tweet, appeared to reflect frustration that his threats of “fire and fury” against North Korea earlier this month had failed to deter it from carrying out missile tests. He had recently claimed, after a lull of more than three weeks in such tests, that Kim Jong-un “is starting to respect us”. Kim, however, made it clear earlier on Wednesday that there would be more ballistic tests in the wake of Tuesday’s launch of an intermediate range missile, the first ballistic missile North Korea has fired over Japan. He described the test as a “meaningful prelude” to a well-advertised plan to send a salvo of similar missiles into the seas around the US territory of Guam. The launch was condemned by the UN security council, and on Wednesday, senior military officials from the US, South Korea and Japan gave technical briefings on North Korea’s technological advances to the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Robert Wood, the US special envoy on disarmament, said: “The time for debate has long passed; those dangers are clear; and it is now time for concerted action.” In his morning tweet on Wednesday, Trump claimed: “The US has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!” North Korea experts pointed out that there had been no US aid to North Korea since 2008 and no substantive talks since early 2012. Some speculated that Trump’s tweet could have been sparked by comments made on television overnight by the former US intelligence chief James Clapper, who said the US had “limited options” in dealing with a North Korean regime that has demonstrated its ability to build nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles. “We may have to hold our nose and we may have to consider some concessions,” Clapper told CNN. Days earlier, Trump responded angrily to Clapper openly questioning his mental fitness for office. Tuesday’s test of a Hwasong-12 missile over Japan and into the Pacific 2,700km from its launching pad appeared to dash hopes that Washington and Pyongyang were edging toward talks. After more than three weeks went by following a 28 July ICBM test, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, hailed North Korean “restraint” and suggested: “Perhaps we are seeing our pathway to some time in the near future having some dialogue.” North Korea experts warned at the time that the administration was misreading Pyongyang if it thought Trump’s threats had deterred the regime from conducting more tests, including the planned Guam salvo. On Wednesday, analysts argued that the Tuesday test over Japan did not necessarily represent a complete rejection of talks. “They could have been more provocative,” said Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. “Pyongyang could have aimed the missiles to splash near Guam as it was planning. “The timing could be important. The US and South Korea are putting on military exercises and Japan just put on unilateral sanctions, and Pyongyang always responds to provocations with provocations.” She added: “It has shown that Trump’s fiery rhetoric has not made Pyongyang back down, but North Korea has signaled that it could be open to negotiation. It has said it was not willing to negotiate over its nuclear programme while the US is engaged in a ‘hostile policy’. So North Korea is not saying never to talks.” Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, said: “My sense is the North Koreans are now assessing their options about how to best to engage. I think they will want to enter talks once they feel they are entering with a position of strength.” DiMaggio, who helped organize the first official discussions between the Trump administration and North Korean government representatives, in Oslo in May, added: “I think we should fully expect to see another missile test and even another nuclear test in the coming weeks and months.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/30/disneyland-apologises-for-banning-boy-from-princess-experience","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T16:55:50Z","webTitle":"Disneyland apologises for banning boy from Princess experience","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/30/disneyland-apologises-for-banning-boy-from-princess-experience","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/30/disneyland-apologises-for-banning-boy-from-princess-experience","fields":{"headline":"Disneyland apologises for banning boy from Princess experience","bodyText":"Disneyland Paris has apologised after barring a three-year-old from participating in its “Princess for a Day” experience because he is not a girl. Hayley McLean-Glass said she asked if she would be able to book the treat as a Christmas present for her son, Noah, who is a “superfan” of the Disney film Frozen and loves to dress up as Elsa, one of its lead characters. On Tuesday, after having been denied permission, she wrote an open letter to the firm, demanding to know what “terrible awful fate may befall” her son if he was allowed to wear a dress. Responding to the Guardian the following day, a Disneyland Paris spokesperson said: “This experience is available to all children ages three-to-12 and we’ve reached out to the family to apologise for them being provided with inaccurate information.” On the firm’s website, the experience is described as an opportunity to “grant every little girl’s wish with a real princess’ make-up and hair-styling session; a fairytale transformation they’ll treasure forever”. McLean-Glass said Noah was “buzzing with excitement” when he first heard about it. But the response to her email from Disneyland Paris read: “At this time it is not possible to book Princess for a Day for a boy.” In a post on her blog, she wrote: “We have spent a small fortune in Disney items for [Noah], he wears his beloved Elsa dress all day every day ... he even refuses to take it off at bedtime. He knows every single word to Let It Go and all of the other Frozen songs, he’d be able to stand on your stage in the Frozen show and give your Elsa a run for her money I’m sure! “If there’s such a thing as a Frozen superfan, Noah is it!” She added that her son was being prevented from having the “same experiences as the little girls who visit [Disneyland Paris] simply because ‘he’s a boy’”. McLean-Glass wrote: “If a little girl wants to be a superhero, she can be. If she wants to be a Jedi, she can be. She can be whatever she wants.” Disneyland Paris said it was sorry for upsetting the family and insisted that it did not have a policy of barring boys from the Princess for a Day experience. “We are taking this situation very seriously and sincerely apologise to Hayley and Noah for the distress caused,” a spokesman told ITV News. “[This is] an isolated incident. The cast member’s response is not reflective of any policy or belief held here at Disneyland Paris. We are going to ensure this does not happen again. “Diversity is near and dear to our hearts and we want to make sure that all our guests enjoy their experience at our resort. Of course, both boys and girls are welcome to enjoy the Princess for a Day experience in addition to all our other special activities.” McLean-Glass runs a blog on family life, Sparkles and Stretchmarks, through which she has worked with firms such as Butlins as a “brand ambassador”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/31/the-ladies-loos-are-the-worst-why-customers-hate-luton-airport","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"'The ladies’ loos are the worst': why customers hate Luton airport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/31/the-ladies-loos-are-the-worst-why-customers-hate-luton-airport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/31/the-ladies-loos-are-the-worst-why-customers-hate-luton-airport","fields":{"headline":"'The ladies’ loos are the worst': why customers hate Luton airport","bodyText":"It’s not just the late August drizzle, extortionate prices and £2.10 shuttle ride to the train station that await travellers at Luton airport. It’s also the dawning realisation that they have arrived at the worst airport in Britain. A survey by Which? has given Luton a customer satisfaction score of just of 29% – the lowest in the history of the annual survey. Last year, Luton embarked on a £110m expansion that will increase capacity by 50% by 2020, but the work has affected its ability to serve passengers. The airport looks more like a building site. Noise from power tools is punctuated by the crash of tiles into skips. People wander around aimlessly in the absence of effective signage; one traveller complained of “an inconsistency between what it says on the sign and what it actually means”. “The upgrade could have been handled better: it’s an inarticulate mess,” said Geoff Davis, an architect from South Africa. “Nobody knew where to go. It’s overloaded and planned as if they didn’t know how many people would be coming through. “I felt like I was treated like an animal. Security were rude, blunt and flippant.” His wife added: “The ladies’ toilets are possibly the worst I’ve seen in an airport.” Other customers were equally dissatisfied with the Bedfordshire facility, which is officially called London Luton airport. “It was chaos with all the building work,” said Lorraine Dimmer, whose husband had driven her to Luton. “It was £3 to be dropped off – it took about five seconds. It’s a rip-off.” A spokesperson for the airport said it was “disappointed with the results as they don’t accurately reflect the experience of the majority of our passengers”. Which? polled 435 people who had travelled through Luton in the 12 months to May – “the most intensive phase of the airport’s redevelopment”. “As Which? acknowledges, the airport is currently undergoing the biggest transformation in its history,” the spokesperson added. “We appreciate the patience of our passengers as we develop the airport, which will result in a better experience for everyone.” However, the customer experience could get a little bit worse before it gets better. After complaints from local residents about the noise from overnight construction, the airport said the work would now be carried out between 8am and 6pm. Yet it appears the revamp has done little to deter passengers from flying in and out of Luton: 1.6 million did so in July, a 6.2% rise on the same month last year. This marked the 40th consecutive month of passenger growth for the airport. The days of the dreaded shuttle bus to Luton Airport Parkway station are also numbered. Plans for a £200m monorail linking the station to the terminal were recently approved, although construction may not start for some time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/aug/31/share-your-best-money-saving-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:35:02Z","webTitle":"Share your best money saving tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/31/share-your-best-money-saving-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/aug/31/share-your-best-money-saving-tips","fields":{"headline":"Share your best money saving tips","bodyText":"From collecting coupons to joining cashback sites and switching energy providers, there are tactics available for those seeking to reduce weekly bills and improve their personal finances.

It allows for a steady stream of income from big-budget fodder but also for regular soul-cleansing sojourns into artier territory. Ben Stiller’s trajectory has often followed this path, and with age, it appears as if he’s leaning more towards the latter with his regrettable Zoolander sequel proving to be just a greasy appetizer for meatier, festival-dwelling material. After receiving warm notices at Cannes for his role in The Meyerowitz Stories, his third film with Noah Baumbach, he’s now teaming up with underrated multi-hyphenate Mike White for Brad’s Status, premiering at Toronto. It’s familiar territory for Stiller, who’s found much to explore in similarly introspective comedy dramas, and at times this sense of deja vu threatens to distract from the nifty observations on offer. Brad’s status? It’s complicated. Stiller plays the titular character, a family man and the head of a non-profit organization, who feels underwhelmed by the life he’s made for himself. It’s not that he has it particularly bad, but his college friends just seem to have it so much better. Brad spends too much time bitterly scrolling through their latest social media updates, seething at the glamorous lifestyles they appear to have, resenting the decisions that led him to where he now is. When he heads to Boston with his son Troy (Austin Abrams) to check out potential colleges, he finds himself in something of a tailspin, his deep-rooted unhappiness boiling to the surface. As with writer/director White’s finest work, from The Good Girl to short-lived HBO show Enlightened, there’s a great deal of perceptive humor here. Brad’s obsession with coveting the constructed Insta-lives of friends is an uneasily recognizable problem, also recently explored in Ingrid Goes West, and his flip-flopping between accepting and rejecting his lot in life makes for similarly uncomfortable viewing. It’s well-worn territory for Stiller, who’s riffed on this before in Greenberg and While We’re Young, and his casting is both well-suited and somewhat repetitive. It’s infinitely more pleasurable to see him in a more nuanced comedy, but his dissatisfied indie schtick is in danger of becoming just as overused as his broader Meet the Parents persona. He skates perilously close here but his performance remains one of the most consistent pleasures of what feels like a patchier version of far superior films. White’s screenplay is hampered by a rather redundant voiceover that’s full of tiresomely on-the-nose realizations (“Sometimes in life you can lose the plot” and “This is not the life I imagined” feeling particularly inane). It’s frustratingly lazy and inelegant, clunkily signposting Brad’s emotional state at points where the viewer is perfectly able to figure it out without such hand-holding. It’s a film that’s in need of more confident, subtle direction, with White’s long-time collaborator Miguel Arteta sadly absent and White himself taking on the job for just the second time. While White might not make for an entirely convincing film-maker, his script still reveals his considerable skills as a humorist. As with his last script for the short, sharp Beatriz at Dinner, he’s found a way to tap into issues that feel prescient without feeling preachy. Brad’s funk is the direct result of his fragile, conflicted masculinity. He resents being surrounded by “beta males” yet mourns for the political and intellectual idealism of his youth. He both respects and resents money, craving it and idolizing it while critiquing the effect it has on others. He tells his son that as a white kid he’s now the “underdog” and, in one smart extended sequence, a young female student calls out Brad’s white privilege for his self-obsessed wallowing. But who hasn’t wanted more even when they arguably have enough? There’s enough emotional intelligence here to resist labelling Brad a buffoon or a self-diagnosed victim and his complaints will likely resonate with a lot of people. There’s also a fantastic naturalistic performance from Abrams as Brad’s son and their conversations have a wonderful beat to them, believably shifting from warmth to tension within seconds. Brad’s Status is a frustrating concoction. There’s a script full of insight but also inanity and while the performances might jump out, the direction falls flat. Stiller is back on the right route but, like Brad, he could afford to take a more daring detour every now and then. Brad’s Status screened at the Toronto film festival is released in US cinemas on 15 September and in the UK at an unconfirmed date"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/sep/04/imperfect-junior-doctor-training-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-04T09:14:12Z","webTitle":"Letter to my junior doctor self: 'There will be moments of terror and pride'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/sep/04/imperfect-junior-doctor-training-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/sep/04/imperfect-junior-doctor-training-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Letter to my junior doctor self: 'There will be moments of terror and pride'","bodyText":"Dear Nish, You’re a month in. I know what you’re thinking, even though you daren’t say it. It’s a bit of an anti-climax, isn’t it? Those champagne-fuelled celebrations with your friends are a distant memory. The disbelief at the doctor prefix on your debit card has been replaced with resentment. The thrill once sparked by a bleep on your pager now makes your heart sink. Some days you try to slink back into the gaggle of students, wishing you hadn’t wanted to get out of that clan. I know you feel daunted. But that’s understandable. You’ve taken on a weight of responsibility for other people. The cocooned, academic existence you once inhabited has been replaced by a harsh terrain of hierarchy and discordant emotion. I’d be more worried if you weren’t afraid. It is, as someone once said of life, like trying to learn the piano by giving a recital at the Royal Albert Hall. I know it feels like you’re wearing scrubs from a dressing up box. I know you believe you’re the weakest link, but you’re not. You have a long way to go, and a lot to learn. But there’s a more insidious hurdle to confront first – the one of your own making. You’re scared you’re a fraud. Being a good student often came down to deploying bits of obscure medical knowledge, with well-timed accuracy. For now, you think being a good doctor is too. Soon you’ll decide it’s about restoring each patient back to the character they’ve slipped out of. And later, you’ll define it as practical wizardry. Eventually, you’ll decide it’s all of these. Each day you’ll reshuffle their order of importance, and conclude you’re not doing any of them well enough. Let me save you some self-flagellation. Don’t wallow in your failure to meet your distorted definition of a good clinician. Every doctor has a set of personal of traits their patients value. For you, your capacity to listen, your knack for connecting with a stranger, and your sense of humour will form the core of your therapeutic armoury. You’ll waste time looking for affirmation that you’re more than these – don’t. Appreciate them, hone them and use them wisely. I know you think others are handling this better than you. They aren’t. Colleagues will tell you they’ve deftly slipped in five cannulas while you’ve abandoned your single search for a vein; they leap straight into chest-straddles at every resuscitation call; and the nurses already mistake them for the registrar. They’re probably not being truthful. The hermetic, fragile atmosphere of the hospital makes it a thriving petri dish of melodrama. Instead, focus your energy on what you can bring. You’ll see our environment through a new lens. You’ll witness inefficiencies, broken promises and the avoidable delays that melt into a doctor’s background picture. That doesn’t mean they can’t be changed. Or that you can’t be the one to try. Even when you feel your most unworthy, look over your shoulder. You’ll see others treating students like funfair goldfish (“No point in giving them names, they never last that long”). Don’t follow suit. Remember how good the day at medical school was when a doctor noticed you. That’s now in your control. And don’t lose the curiosity mirrored in their eyes. It is a peculiarity that the gift of medical experience brings with two contradictory truths – an increasing awareness of the holes in our knowledge, and more responsibility for decision making. Ask questions freely now. It’s a privilege that comes with being a junior doctor. Inevitably, you’ll make mistakes. Admit them, learn from them and share them with others. Most of all, forgive yourself. Your patients will need you to. Finally, don’t be in such a hurry. Your friends might decide which specialty to uphold, and who they want to epitomise. It will take you longer. Your track will take turns that you can’t even imagine. Don’t panic – enjoy the ride. You have plenty of time to find your niche. You’ve taken your first step as an imperfect apprentice in a lifelong lesson. At the centre of that lies a single relationship, that of one person seeking the help of another. As you immerse yourself in the wondrous complexities of this vocation, never lose sight of that. There will be moments of terror and excitement; of tears and of pride. It’s a privilege to be on this journey. And, although you’ll question this many times in the days to come, you’ve earned it.

What else? Oh yes, cherished television series that captured the mood of an era. Alas, the memo never reached the makers of Cold Feet (8 September, 9pm, ITV), which returned last year on a cloud of fuzzy, late-90s nostalgia, much to the joy of its fans, who still come over all unnecessary at the memory of James Nesbitt bollock-naked with a rose wedged up his bum. And so here we are for a seventh series, witness once more to the cosy camaraderie and frequent fall-outs of Manchester pals Adam, David, Karen, Jen and Pete. We kick off with a visit to a hospital delivery room, where Nesbitt’s Adam and his girlfriend Tina (Leanne Best) welcome the arrival of … a King Charles spaniel. Oh, right. It’s just a dream. Adam, you see, has procreation on his mind. He has taken to staring at passing babies in prams and gazing at Tina, whom he’s been dating for nine months, with new intensity. Meanwhile, Pete (John Thomson), in recovery from a serious bout of depression, is working as a chauffeur for rich suburbanites; Jen (Fay Ripley) is climbing the corporate ladder; Karen (Hermione Norris) is struggling to keep her publishing imprint afloat; and divorced sofa-surfer David (Robert Bathurst) is fleecing old ladies as a life insurance salesman. One thing that has remained from the old Cold Feet is the warmth between the characters; there is no point at which you doubt their longstanding bond. But the smart observation and gentle wit in creator Mike Bullen’s early scripts is harder to detect. Certainly, anyone hoping for a searing depiction of middle age, with all its attendant joys and disappointments, won’t find it here (if you want something gritty, funny and beautiful on the subject, let me refer you to Dear John, the mid-80s comedy series about a newly divorced man, now majestically drowning its sorrows on YouTube). Instead we have Adam, whose charm began to curdle around 2001, who has a bad case of arrested development, and yet has beautiful, smart young women falling at his feet. Seriously ladies – him? Then there’s Karen, a woman with 30 years’ business experience and brainpower to burn, trying to build a publishing empire on the back of one dysfunctional author and a hard-of-thinking PA. Sorry, but no. Even David, a character who once captured audiences’ hearts with his smiling dignity in the face of assorted humiliations, appears so lobotomised that it’s hard to feel anything for him at all. Now you just worry he’s going to fall over the furniture. Bullen has clearly decided that mid-lifers lead action-packed lives and, in fairness, it wouldn’t do to have Karen retiring to bed at 9pm with the Boden catalogue, and Pete and Jen bickering over the evening’s Netflix viewing. And so, nuance and realism are sacrificed in favour of caricature and soap-opera silliness. There are people here who make massive, life-changing decisions in the time it takes most to tie their shoelaces. Bullen wanted to bring back Helen Baxendale’s Rachel, who died in a dramatic car accident in 2003, as some sort of ghostly apparition, which, quite frankly, is something I’d have sacrificed my last custard cream to see. Cold Feet as a haunted house thriller? Now that’s what I call a reboot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/aug/30/new-america-foundation-google-funding-firings","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T16:56:00Z","webTitle":"Google-funded thinktank fired scholar over criticism of tech firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/30/new-america-foundation-google-funding-firings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/aug/30/new-america-foundation-google-funding-firings","fields":{"headline":"Google-funded thinktank fired scholar over criticism of tech firm","bodyText":"An influential Washington thinktank that has received more than $21m in funding from Google and its chairman Eric Schmidt dropped a team of scholars after its leader wrote an article praising the European Union’s decision to fine the tech giant. The New America Foundation is one of the leading left-leaning policy groups in the US and is led by Anne-Marie Slaughter, an author, foreign policy analyst and political scientist. In June, Barry Lynn, a senior fellow who led the thinktank’s Open Markets initiative, wrote a blogpost praising the EU’s decision to levy a record €2.42bn ($2.7bn) fine on Google for breaching antitrust rules and abusing its market dominance. “Google’s market power is one of the most critical challenges for competition policymakers in the world today,” Lynn wrote. According to the New York Times, shortly after the post was published Schmidt, who chaired New America until 2016, contacted Slaughter to communicate his displeasure. The blogpost was temporarily removed from New America’s website before being reposted. Days later, Slaughter told Lynn that “the time has come for Open Markets and New America to part ways”, according to an email from Slaughter to Lynn obtained by the Times. Slaughter said the decision was “in no way based on the content of your work” although she she accused Lynn of “imperiling the institution as a whole”. New America has received roughly $21m from Google, Schmidt and his family foundation since 1999. The organisation’s main conference room in Washington DC is called the Eric Schmidt Ideas Lab. Lynn and his 10-strong team have now set up Citizens Against Monopoly. “Is Google trying to censor journalists and researchers who fight dangerous monopolies?” the website asks. “Sadly, the answer is: YES.” “Tell Google to stop shutting down research into monopolies,” the organisation says on its Facebook page. In an interview with the Times, Lynn said Slaughter had caved to pressure from Schmidt and Google. He said: “Google is very aggressive in throwing its money around Washington and Brussels, and then pulling the strings. People are so afraid of Google now.” In a statement, Slaughter called Flynn’s accusations “absolutely false”. She said: “For the past two months, we have been working with Barry Lynn to spin out Open Markets as an independent program, as we have done with other programs, to preserve his leadership, keep the program together, and maintain a strong relationship with New America. “As I reiterated to him in June, his repeated refusal to adhere to New America’s standards of openness and institutional collegiality meant that we could no longer work together as part of the same institution. I continued, however, to seek a cooperative solution with Barry; unfortunately, I have been unsuccessful. “New America holds itself to high standards of transparency, diversity, and independence. We are proud of the work we do and the values we uphold.” Google responded on Wednesday, saying in a statement: “We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don’t agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group’s independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.” Zephyr Teachout, a former Open Markets fellow and chair of the board of Citizens Against Monopoly, said: “Google has been a funder of New America for a while and the Open Markets team has been speaking out against distortions in our markets and the distortions in markets for some time. “What I see is that Google has gotten too big for its britches, and like many monopolists can no longer brook dissent. It is a really heavy-handed move by Google and in some way proves the point that Open Markets has been trying to make and has made successfully, which is that the problem with monopolies is not merely economic it is that they form into a political power themselves and as Lord Acton said, power corrupts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/24/instagram-influencers-hurtful-messages-sadism-famous","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"‘I view the hurtful messages as sadism’ – what it's like to be Instagram famous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/24/instagram-influencers-hurtful-messages-sadism-famous","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/24/instagram-influencers-hurtful-messages-sadism-famous","fields":{"headline":"‘I view the hurtful messages as sadism’ – what it's like to be Instagram famous","bodyText":"In her 1970s book On Photography, Susan Sontag describes the role of the camera in everyday life as a means to construct “a portrait-chronicle of itself – a portable kit of images that bears witness to its connectedness”. She could, of course, be talking about Instagram in 2017, except that we are becoming increasingly less connected to the images themselves. Through filters, colour washes and crops, the images we post can be little more than projections of how we want to be seen by the outside world; an ideal self. And in many cases this image bears only a passing resemblance to the reality. But what happens when Instagram becomes more than just a pastime? When it becomes a way to make a living? What happens when your followers start to objectify you, or your friends unfollow you because of what you post, or it starts to affect your mental health? What happens when you realise you’ve become “content”? Do you stop? Do you heck. From the biomedical scientist who tries to balance university life with makeup posts to the model who is asked to promote slimming pills, Instagram has a very real, often dark side. And these women should know. Morwenna Ferrier ‘People assume this job is really easy but it’s hard work’ Jayde Pierce – @jaydepierce (beauty/lifestyle Instagrammer), 960k followers I started Instagram just like any other person – sharing pictures for friends and family – and the more I would post, the more followers I would gain. I posted pictures of what I was doing that day, but people seemed to enjoy it and a career came out of it. I’ve always loved makeup, beauty and fashion, and now I have a way to share it and make an income. With advertising, as long as it’s a product I like and would use, then I’m happy to promote. I test things out before I do any promotion and if I don’t like something then I don’t go ahead. Instagram can be stressful. People assume this job is really easy but it’s hard work and as much as there are advantages there are also disadvantages. If you do everything yourself it’s very time consuming. I film and edit all my own YouTube videos and mini Instagram videos. I create content every day (with the help of my partner taking the photos), attend meetings and events, test out products, plan everything. I had a baby six months ago and have just moved into a new home, so I juggle quite a lot in life. But I’m grateful I’m in a job like this. The main disadvantage for me would be the internet hate and getting judged for everything you do 24/7. People feel like they can tell you how to live your life. It’s very frustrating. ‘I can post a photograph from my bed and make money – it’s mind-blowing’ Millie Cotton – @millie_cotton (fashion and lifestyle blogger), 19.6k followers My Instagram is a feed of curated photos. They have a certain look, a certain lighting, a certain aesthetic. I have a private Instagram now as well, which features “real” moments – not that photographs on my Instagram aren’t real, but they are an idealised reality. I wouldn’t put a personal selfie with my boyfriend on my public Instagram, that would go on my private one. I’ve been working with brands for the past few years. There’s a lot of product placement – you have to agree an idea with a brand, and then you produce the content and have to run it by them, and then put it on the internet with an agreed caption. You have to declare that they are paid for, but I think as long as the brand is in line with your regular content and the photo has personality, people don’t mind that you’re promoting a product. Some friends have said “You want to be famous”, to which I reply, “I’ve created a business from putting photographs on the internet. And I have creative control.” I can edit and post a photograph on Instagram from my bed and I make money from it, which is mind-blowing! ‘It’s crazy that your number of followers going up can make you so happy and excited’ Alice – @alxcext (biomedical scientist and makeup Instagrammer), 191k followers Everyone in year eight and nine had Instagram; pictures of friends, pictures of what you are doing. It was never that makeup-focused. It would eventually get to the stage where I would come home after school, get changed, sit down and do my makeup at 3.30 in the afternoon, and that’s when my Instagram changed. I lived with my mum, dad and brother – I’d shut the door and my dad would have a nap in the afternoon and my mum wouldn’t be back until about 5pm, so I had those few hours to take selfies with my door closed. After that I’d have dinner and do work, and that was it. I definitely think it’s an art. It started in sixth form – I was doing the same thing I’d been doing for years – coming home, taking pictures – but I think what changed was that my actual makeup was getting better. I was able to post pictures on Tumblr – that’s when things started to pick up. Overnight I would gain about 5k followers, and it just went up and up. I remember being so happy about itand – it’s crazy that a number going up can make you so excited. I remember going into school and girls that I wasn’t really friends with would be like, “There’s Alice, she’s famous!” and take photos. I never told anyone at uni. I moved into halls and people were like, “What’s your Instagram?” and I would give them my handle. I would never tell them, they could find out on their own. Now I’m in my second year, I’m not that close to many people on my course. One day someone said, “Did you know Alice is Instagram famous?” She was flicking through and saying, “You have so many followers!” And the lecturer caught on to what was happening, and asked if I got paid. I just wanted to fade into the background. My hands were shaking, it was horrific. A lot of Instagram content is stuff that I don’t agree with, I know that brands contact me because they know I have an influence in some way, but I’m very aware that that needs to be used really responsibly. There are really big accounts that post makeup pictures and the majority are white girls, but I’ve sort of discovered this world where there are so many beautiful brown girls. You just have to find them. I wish it wasn’t like that, I wish back in 2008 I could have found the brown makeup community, but it wasn’t that easy then. It’s actually been really recent that I’ve found myself following more brown girls and been really inspired by them and how connected they are to their cultures and background and heritage. I’m really pushing myself to get into that and also reflect that in my makeup. I really want to do more stuff connected to my parents and my background. But in terms of YouTube there is actually a big gap where there aren’t many brown YouTubers. And that’s motivated me to do more. ‘I am very aware that there are stalkers out there’ Doll – @doll_cat_pvssy (feminist sex writer and model), 69.8k followers My life is definitely not conventional, because I’m so passionate about avoiding the 9 to 5. The best part about my Instagram is hearing about how it has helped other women find positivity in their own bodies and their sexualities. But it’s also amazing to connect with others, who you ordinarily wouldn’t get a chance to meet or speak to. I never went to uni, I started working full-time when I was 16. I’ve done a lot of office jobs and now work freelance. I don’t have an alter ego. I do think there are some people – men in particular – who build up an idea of how you are. And I think that can be quite dangerous with social media. But everyone just portrays the best parts of their lives. You don’t talk about the fall-outs you have with your family. I take my Instagram reasonably seriously because I feel like I’m trying to get a certain message across, that feminism is cool, and I’m cool and I’m a feminist. Using social media makes me happy because it is a great way to see how other people are standing up for certain things – seeing the women’s march, seeing people getting together. When I take a picture of myself I am mostly thinking of myself, I don’t really give a fuck what anyone else thinks of the picture. Getting used to being seen definitely boosts your confidence and people pick up on that and treat you in a certain way. The worst feeling I get from Instagram is that of being misread when a guy doesn’t realise what you are portraying and sees you as an object. But I really just view all the hurtful messages as sadism, a reflection of their insecurities, and if anything I’m like, they must be kind of jealous of me. I’m quite thick-skinned, but I don’t get that much negativity from Instagram. You definitely have to be very careful with posting your location. I don’t put where I am until I have left the place, because I am very aware there are stalkers out there, so I take extra precautions. But other than that I don’t feel emotionally vulnerable. I sometimes get comments that I find disrespectful or creep me, but I let them off the first time because most men haven’t been brought up to respect women and their sexuality. I have always been a very independent person – I love my own company and hated sleepovers as a kid. I don’t feel like I’m losing time to hang out with my friends when I’m using social media. If anything, I think it’s forced me to meet other creatives and make art together, so I think I’m more social because of it. I think everybody uses social media to seek some form of validation. You definitely get more likes with the more flesh you have out – sex sells and that’s always going to be the way. Instagram likes might encourage people to reveal more flesh, but essentially it was more about revealing a new layer of confidence. It wasn’t about the likes – it was about exploring myself. I would advise somebody who wanted to build up an Instagram account not to be commercial and to be really raw. That might come across as a bit controversial – it might make you feel uneasy when your boss confronts you about it. You need to be aware that your family is going to know. You just have to be really confident in yourself and if you’re trying to gain followers you need to keep it personal. My family have been surprisingly supportive, and my mum loves to tell her colleagues. It definitely helps to have that support. ‘Without Instagram I wouldn’t be working in my dream industry’ Joanna Kuchta – @joannakuchta (Instagrammer and model), 1.1m followers I think it’s completely OK to monetise your content by advertising brands. We all have to make money some way, and this is how bloggers have been making money since before Instagram. I enjoy working with fashion brands and creating content for them. However, I don’t do a lot of paid posts, because when I started out three years ago I didn’t intend to make money. I just used it as a creative outlet for fashion and photography and I want to keep it that way. I don’t want to sell anything I would not myself use or wear. I would not advertise any teas, shakes or pills that promise you can lose weight. I’ve been approached by these companies. It’s really transparent what they do – they approach skinny girls and ask them to pose with the product and claim that they use it. No amount of money would make me promote a product like that to my 71% female following. Some of my followers have been following me since I turned 18, when I started using Instagram properly. I feel so connected to them, because they have seen me grow so much. When I started I lived in a tiny village in Ireland. I loved fashion and taking photos, so I did that for fun. Then suddenly I was gaining thousands of followers every day. It became my career. With such a large following comes a responsibility that every public figure has. I make sure my followers know that half of the clothes I wear I wouldn’t be able to even afford myself as they are sent to me. I’m so grateful, because without Instagram I wouldn’t be here working in my dream industry. ‘There’s a divide between white commercial stuff and people with my skin tone’ Ama Peters – @ama.peters (finance student and lifestyle Instagrammer), 38.3k followers I made my account when I was about 15 and was just into posting selfies and hashtags. When I started getting emails from companies I realised it was quite a good way to network, so I thought I might as well pursue it. I like to dabble in a few things, but I’m trying to find a specific route to go down so I’m easier to market to brands. Some people who are naturally superficial might get attached – they can’t separate it from real life. But if you have the basic grounding, then I think it’s easy. Because I really couldn’t care less, I just see it as my job, advertising and marketing. But I don’t really care about if I get 2,000 likes on a selfie or one like. It isn’t going to follow me when I’m enjoying my life with my friends. We’re the influencers, but the people being influenced don’t have a clue, they think it’s real life. And that’s kind of dangerous. As an influencer, you have aresponsibility to not exaggerate things too much. I feel like society is just a massive quest for influence in general. I just see myself as a content creator. It’s like if you work for an advertising agency, you get given a job and you create the content. This is the same, but you’re the content. I don’t take selfies for fun, I think about the best way to show off the product that I’m posting. I think race affects the work I get. Working with a lot of British brands, they kind of favour the average English-looking blogger. I want to break through that ceiling and show other people they can have a career in fashion, blogging or anything, no matter the race they are. Because I think there’s a divide between white commercial stuff and people with my skin tone – they get completely different jobs. And it’s not fair at all. It’s difficult because I get way fewer jobs than someone with the same following and the same or even worse content quality, just because they fit into the stereotype of what these brands imagine their customers to be like. You’re missing out a huge amount of people who can’t relate to that. There needs to be more diversity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2017/sep/24/who-are-36-bame-people-uk-1000-most-powerful","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T15:00:48Z","webTitle":"Who are the 36 BAME people among the UK's 1,000 most powerful?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/24/who-are-36-bame-people-uk-1000-most-powerful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/sep/24/who-are-36-bame-people-uk-1000-most-powerful","fields":{"headline":"Who are the 36 BAME people among the UK's 1,000 most powerful?","bodyText":"An analysis conducted by the Guardian and Operation Black Vote has established that of the 1,049 most powerful people in Britain, just 36 are from ethnic minorities – and only seven of those are women.

Why Ipoh, Malaysia, really sizzles","bodyText":"Ipoh’s setting, among limestone hills in the Kinta valley, is magnificent. Whether you approach by road or rail, you’ll be wowed. There are furry-looking green trees clinging to the slopes, with pinkish granite rock in places where they’ve been washed away. It’s so pretty. My earliest memories are of stars over Ipoh (it’s in Perak state). I remember running in the garden, feeling the warm air on my skin and seeing the pinpricks of light above. I was born in Singapore but we moved to Ipoh, where my mother is from, for a few years when I was a baby, and I lived there again for a while from when I was 12. The Kinta valley was once the biggest producer of tin in the world. The pan handlers used to stand in the rivers and sift for it. My great-grandfather settled in Ipoh because of the tin rush – it was a place of opportunity in the late 1800s. My great-grandmother was of mixed Malay and Chinese heritage – we believe she was from southern Thailand and travelled by elephant to Penang, before moving to Ipoh with her husband. The bean sprouts in Ipoh are the best in the world. Local lore says it’s because the limestone makes the water special. We have the fattest, crunchiest bean sprouts I’ve ever come across – nowhere in Malaysia, America or Europe has them as good. In my first novel, Ipoh is almost a character itself: it has moods. On a clear, bright day, the limestone hills are almost blue in the haze, but when it’s cloudy – which only lasts a few hours until the sun bursts through – they become quite dark, with floating mist at the top. I love the moodiness of the landscape – it’s like a painting – and I love the breeziness the hills bring. The old town of Ipoh is easy to walk around. There’s what we call a “five-foot way” in front of the rows of shophouses, a corridor shaded from the heat. A Lithuanian artist has painted murals depicting scenes of Malaysian life on the walls, windows and shutters, which makes it quite distinctive. Of all Ipoh’s night markets, or pasar malam, the biggest is in First Garden on Fridays. I love the bustle, the great food and unusual things to eat, like fried ice-cream. It’s so noisy some vendors wire themselves up to a mic and stand there shouting at shoppers. Malaysians eat out a lot as it’s quite cheap. Try Lou Wong coffee shop for “chicken bean sprouts” with rice or rice noodles: that’s literally all they sell, from lunch until around midnight, and it’s generally packed. The name Ipoh comes from a poisonous tree. Its resin was used by indigenous people in darts for hunting. The ipoh tree was the subject of a 1828 poem by Alexander Pushkin called The Upas Tree. To get away from crowds, go to Kledang Hill. It’s a steep 800-metre hike to the top and takes around three hours, so do it in the cool of the morning. You probably won’t pass anyone and the view is spectacular. • Selina Siak Chin Yoke’s new novel, When the Future Comes Too Soon, is out now (Amazon Crossing, £8.99)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/aug/31/tv-reboots-will-and-grace-roseanne-curb-your-enthusiasm","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T10:00:00Z","webTitle":"Can the onslaught of TV reboots and revivals survive in 2017?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/31/tv-reboots-will-and-grace-roseanne-curb-your-enthusiasm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/31/tv-reboots-will-and-grace-roseanne-curb-your-enthusiasm","fields":{"headline":"Can the onslaught of TV reboots and revivals survive in 2017?","bodyText":"Will &amp; Grace made an unexpected comeback last September after 10 years away from the small screen, releasing a surprise mini-episode on YouTube. The short clip got the old gang back together to discuss the impending election. Will and Grace were as appalled at the idea of Donald Trump the presidential candidate as they were at the notion of a “butt double” in 50 Shades of Grey. Karen, of course, is friends with the Trumps, and returns from a stay in Mar-a-Lago with Donald and Melania. “Please tell me you are not voting for that guy,” Will pleads. “All he does is call people names.” “Grace, did you hear what your pussy gay Muslim boyfriend just said?” Karen fires back. What a difference a year makes: it seemed much funnier in September 2016 than it does in September 2017, where it seems more documentary than sitcom. Nevertheless, it was the preamble to a reboot, with the cast returning for a full season this fall. (Whether it will address the original season finale, which made it clear that Will and Grace had not spoken in 18 years, is yet to be seen.) A recent trailer unravels into a self-referential musical, in which Eric McCormack and Debra Messing visit the old set, only to find the characters of Jack and Karen still there, unaware that they’re part of a TV show. It mentions Instagram and Airbnb, so we know we’re in for contemporary jokes. Another promo has a gag about Grindr. Apps are an easy way of making jokes sound current. Aren’t smartphones modern! I give it until episode three before Snapchat filters see them all with kitten ears and cute pink noses. “It was a phenomenon that changed television forever,” announces the voiceover. Whether this is true is up for debate; I have a soft spot for the original series, despite its flaws, and am intrigued to see if it can survive today. Though its limitations have been made more obvious by its decade of absence, particularly its strange queasiness about gay people doing gay stuff like kissing, it certainly provided something fresh and new in 1998 when it first aired on NBC. That’s a problem not only for the new Will &amp; Grace, but for TV as a whole, which is in the grip of a wave of nostalgia, so much so that even the trashy 80s extravaganza Dynasty is getting a much-needed chance to show us rich people being awful onscreen. Like movies, music and even video games, television has realised that new versions of old things are highly appealing to a certain audience, who have an in-built fondness for something they once knew. The warmth of familiarity can make a launch a much less risky proposition than something totally alien, though the recent Baywatch movie flop showed this strategy is not without limits. The most talked-about TV revivals all had a huge impact on culture, but crucially, those impacts were of their moment. Talk of an L Word reboot, featuring some of the original cast but focusing on a new generation of queer women, takes a show that once stormed television simply because it was unlike anything before it and brings it into the modern era. As with Will &amp; Grace, this lays bare the flaws of the original. While it was soapy and spectacular, it was also questionable, in hindsight, on things like class, race, trans issues and bisexuality. The danger is that if the show changes too much, people will miss its familiarity and its legacy may suffer – but in order to remain relevant, it must adapt to its current context. This is a delicate balance to find. It’s something Roseanne will have to grapple with too, even more so than its “the last season was all a dream” finale. Announcing the show’s return, ABC claimed that when its first episode aired, “television was changed forever”. It was changed because the show spoke about class, and put a self-defined “respectable white trash family” scraping together a living at the centre of its story. The ABC Entertainment president, Channing Dungey, has said that the return will “speak very honestly” about the Trump era, and that it will “bring back a point of view that has really been missing on the air”. This assessment risks feeding into the myth that working-class voters elected Trump – again and again, it’s been proven that the majority of his supporters were from middle-to-high-income households – but perhaps the show itself will be able to make that plain. There are two recent pinnacles of TV’s revival culture, which indicate when it works and when it does not. When Netflix brought Arrested Development back to life, the news was received with near ecstasy by fans. There was a sense that after only three seasons, the sitcom had been cut short in its prime by a network that did not understand its genius. But its fourth season was a letdown; it was messy, overly long and confused. Though fans’ appetites may have been blunted, that hasn’t dampened Netflix’s enthusiasm – the streaming service announced a fifth season in May. “In talks with Netflix we all felt that stories about a narcissistic, erratically behaving family in the building business – and their desperate abuses of power – are really underrepresented on TV these days,” the show’s creator, Mitch Hurwitz, said in a statement at the time, with winning self-awareness. (When discussing the return of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David was asked about a similar kind of context, now that rich men’s political incorrectness is perhaps more of a talking point than when the show originally aired. “Well, I don’t consider myself a prick,” he replied, succinctly.) The stakes were higher for Twin Peaks, which had been off the air since 1991, following a notoriously shambolic second season ruined by network interference. Fans seemed as nervous as they were excited. While other shows can claim to have changed television, few had the long-lasting reach and impact on culture that Twin Peaks did. The new third season is not yet over, but so far David Lynch has only solidified the series’ legacy, by making something more inventive and more astonishing than Twin Peaks fans might have dared to dream a strange dream of. If the creators have new stories to tell, and if there are new ways in which to tell them, then nostalgia may not be as damaging to TV as it has been to Hollywood. But those ifs are big."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/03/gods-own-country-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T07:00:37Z","webTitle":"God’s Own Country review – passion in the Pennines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/03/gods-own-country-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/03/gods-own-country-review","fields":{"headline":"God’s Own Country review – passion in the Pennines","bodyText":"Rural Britain is fertile ground for a generation of new British film-makers. A waterlogged Somerset provided the backdrop for Hope Dickson Leach’s The Levelling. And now the Pennines glower over the family farm in Francis Lee’s equally impressive feature debut, God’s Own Country. It’s the kind of world in which bone-aching toil is a way of life and secrets are buried deep beneath the damp sod. And there are plenty of secrets here. Following his father’s stroke, Johnny Saxby (a terrific, stoically anguished performance from Josh O’Connor) has been forced to take over the daily running of the farm. Surveying his efforts with thin-lipped disapproval are his grandmother (Gemma Jones) and his dad (Ian Hart). With vowels as flat and hard as flagstones, they pass judgment on his efforts. It’s hard to say which weighs him down more – the responsibility or the massive chip on Johnny’s shoulder. To numb his dissatisfaction, he binge-drinks and engages in angry bouts of gay sex with strangers. Then Romanian worker Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu) arrives to help out over the lambing season. Limpid-eyed and almost painfully handsome, his presence unnerves Johnny, who finds it hard to unpick the difference between aggression and attraction. Their first sexual encounter is all sweat and spit, dirt and urgency. But Gheorghe brings some of the tenderness he shows to the animals into what soon becomes a relationship fuelled by Pot Noodles and stolen moments. Through Gheorghe, Johnny can once again see the beauty in the land he had started to regard as a tomb. Lee has a lovely eye for symbolic detail – a single light in the farmhouse window glowing through a dawn the colour of slurry emphasises just how alone Johnny is. The film has drawn comparisons with Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain, but for me there were closer parallels with Eytan Fox’s Israeli drama Yossi &amp; Jagger, about the relationship between two soldiers. Both stories take place in a macho world between men who find the physicality of love rather easier than articulating it. But when the words are finally spoken, it’s a moment to make the heart swell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/02/doctor-foster-ozark-infidelity","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"High infidelity: how TV’s portrayal of affairs has evolved","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/02/doctor-foster-ozark-infidelity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/02/doctor-foster-ozark-infidelity","fields":{"headline":"High infidelity: how TV’s portrayal of affairs has evolved","bodyText":"Ah, Dr Foster, how we’ve missed you, with your loose grasp of the Hippocratic oath, tight grasp of your cheating husband’s many failures, and pioneering of the newest type of TV woman: the one who turns heartbreak into fuel and is sorry-not-sorry about just about everything. At the end of the first series of Doctor Foster, it looked as if GP Gemma Foster (played by Suranne Jones) had triumphed. She had exposed her husband Simon (Bertie Carvel) and his young mistress, Kate, in front of Kate’s parents at the world’s most uncomfortable pasta supper, and then unveiled a whole range of financial dodgy dealings that implicated Kate’s father while she was at it. Finally, she watched Simon, penniless and disgraced, going off with his young lover – pregnant and looking distinctly dowdier than she used to now all that illicit excitement had vanished – in their crap car to London, the city we knew he hated. She, meanwhile, was keeping their friends, their nice house and, most importantly, their son Tom. Some viewers were disappointed that she hadn’t actually killed him, but being banished to London could be viewed as worse. She had proved herself a formidable enemy. “I had a headline through all of it: ‘never the victim’,” says the series’ creator and writer Mike Bartlett. “There was never going to be a scene where she is staring into a mirror crying, essentially asking the audience to feel sorry for her. I always tried to make sure that if she felt any of that, it was matched by her defiance and her righteous anger and desire for justice.” In 2012, Bartlett, who started his career as a playwright, had done a version of Medea, the ancient Greek play in which Medea punishes her unfaithful husband, Jason, by killing his new wife and her own children with him. He had unpicked what felt to him “a good accurate depiction of psychology and which bits were [going] a bit into the ‘mad woman’ trope”. Gemma’s behaviour is certainly extreme though doesn’t, so far, include murder, “but if you go on the internet and type in ‘my cheating husband’ the stuff you get is as extreme as anything in Doctor Foster, if not more so – destroying cars or houses, messages left on public billboards,” says Bartlett. “I was fascinated by that idea that in a relationship you put in 100% of your trust and you dedicate your life to it, and if somebody betrays that, it’s amazing how deep that betrayal goes. Therefore it’s really good for drama.” Two years on, round two is about to start and Gemma’s victory is looking decidedly hollow. Simon and Kate are back with their baby daughter, and they’re about to get married. Infuriatingly, Simon is now loaded, and has bought a giant glossy house, to which he’s invited all his old friends – the ones Gemma got custody of – round for a party to celebrate his and his new wife’s smug return. This is no kind of justice. “Again this came from Medea,” says Bartlett, “but we talked about her desire for cosmic justice – that the gods should be putting this right, there should be balance in the world and since there’s not, the only person who can seek balance is me and I will go to any lengths to right this wrong. It’s interesting how strong that motivation becomes.” There is a sense, from those around Gemma, that it’s time for her to move on – that it’s doing her no good to be so focused on the past. “I quite like writing someone who’s going, ‘You know what, I’m not ready to move on, I’ve got unfinished business,’” says Bartlett. Gemma knows what is expected of her. “I’m supposed to sit dutifully at home, pretend it’s fine that my friends are celebrating the man who ruined my life,” she says at one point. “That’s what I’m supposed to do. But I don’t think there’s any harm in reminding them what happened. To make sure that even if they all forgive, they don’t forget.” Although she may have been inspired by a Greek tragedy, Gemma Foster feels like a very contemporary heroine. Across the TV landscape, it feels as if roles in (hetero) relationships have been shifting. If it’s not the cheated-upon wife refusing to act meek and broken, instead becoming hellbent on justice, there is a slew of women doing the cheating while their men deal with the heartbreak. Sometimes they’re remorseful. In HBO’s Insecure, Issa (played by Issa Rae, who created the show) cheats on her largely sweet-natured but inattentive boyfriend Lawrence with an old lover. She is undoubtedly the protagonist – this is a show about women – and we feel her regret, but it also unpicks what it’s like to be the male victim of cheating. “It’s not something that we get to see,” Jay Ellis, who plays Lawrence, has said. “It hasn’t really been talked about on TV a lot, the different stages we go through. Does he go back? Does he become numb and never have feelings again? Does he go out and look for another girl?” Sometimes the female cheat is gloriously unapologetic. In the Netflix series Ozark, Wendy (played by Laura Linney) is having an affair – though that’s really the least of her husband’s worries, what with him being beholden to a Mexican drug cartel. Still, it’s enough of a diversion for him (and one that doesn’t work out well for her lover). “Twenty-two years, I never cheated, not once. And I had the chance, more than a few times,” Marty (Jason Bateman), the financial adviser-turned-money launderer, mutters in a monologue. “And I never took it.” Wendy is not remorseful (to be fair, what her husband has done is far worse than her having it off with a tracksuit-wearing man called Gary). “People cheat,” she tells him, straightforwardly. “They have sex with people they aren’t married to. It happens. It’s not unique. I was unhappy – you’re not exactly blameless in this.” Over in New York, therapist Jean Holloway (played by Naomi Watts) becomes infatuated with a younger woman in Gypsy, another Netflix drama and one with a mostly female production team. We expect her handsome executive husband, Michael (Billy Crudup), to have an affair with his beautiful PA, Alexis, because that’s what usually happens in TV dramas, but – spoiler! – he displays impressive self-control. He is faithful and dependable. It’s his free-spirited wife who has a problem with marriage. “I think that she was afraid I was going to somehow take her life from her, her joy, freedom,” he says to Alexis, during one of those tell-me-about-your-marriage-problems conversations that almost always precedes an explosion of pent-up extramarital action. Is television reflecting real-life trends? Are more women betraying their partners? It’s hard to say because it’s hard to measure – different people have different ideas about what “cheating” constitutes, people lie to researchers and the quality of surveys varies wildly. In most studies, men are still more likely to be unfaithful than women, but the gap appears to be closing. The US’s General Social Survey, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center, found that the likelihood of a wife cheating had gone up by 40% between 1990 and 2010. A YouGov poll for the Sun in 2015 found there wasn’t much difference in the rate of infidelity between men (20%) and women (19%). “There have been lots of changes,” says Michèle Binswanger, journalist and author of Cheating: A Handbook for Women. “Today, women have higher expectations about their sex lives than 40 years ago; they want to experiment and are generally more independent. They have also more possibilities, because a lot more women are in the workforce – and with smartphones and social media there are more opportunities than we ever had before.” An affair, she says, having interviewed women who sought sex outside their relationships, “often began with some kind of frustration – in the relationship, with their life; they didn’t feel desired, they felt unheard, or just unhappy – and so they started to look for some excitement. For men it’s often a question of opportunity. If they get a perfect opportunity and the risk of being caught is very small, they might be more likely to cheat. Women usually have more opportunities but other motivations.” There are huge wider cultural shifts underpinning this – women are becoming ever more economically powerful, middle age is extending with lifespan (and with it the years of sexual activity) and there is what the anthropologist Helen Fisher calls the “rise of female sexual expression”. Infidelity is not a new story and it has always been a good one (happy monogamous marriages are boring, dramatically, and so are affairs without devastating consequences). Sexual betrayal has also always been “a good way to talk about women, sexuality and relationships,” says Suzanne Leonard, associate professor of English and author of forthcoming book Wife, Inc: The Business of Marriage in Twenty-First Century American Culture. “But I think what has shifted is the moralising tone.” In previous stories about female infidelity, women were regularly punished for straying. “During the heights of the second wave feminist movement, there were a lot more sympathetic portrayals of women having affairs,” says Leonard. “I think that was connected at the time to a much larger move to think about women’s place in marriage. I think what’s going on now is a little bit different – it’s less about a feminist statement about the oppression of marriage and a more sophisticated [take on] the disappointments of, in most cases [on TV], heterosexual relationships.” Television as a medium, she says, has become much more cynical – or at least more willing to interrogate widely held beliefs – in general, and especially when it comes to families, relationships and the institution of monogamy. “We can now talk about polyamory, consensual non-monogamy; I think there’s a space to talk about all the various forms sexuality takes. I think that’s in part where we’re getting interesting narratives.” TV is now the place where the antiheroine thrives – “the female lead who is flawed in all kinds of ways,” says Leonard. “An investigation of infidelity becomes a way to think about flawed humans and flawed relationships.” She points to the decline of the romantic comedy – “that genre is all about the creation of the couple” – in film. “With television, because it’s long-form, you have the ability to offer much more nuanced investigations of female psychology. Something I think you do see happening, where monogamy is still promoted, is in the bromance film. Men will often go off, but then they learn that what they really want is a wife and a family. In some ways, women’s stories have become more interesting as men’s stories have got less interesting.” The other thing that has seems to have shifted in television dramas, says Leonard, is that all the other players in the orbit of the cheating couple are now given more than a single dimension. Showtime’s drama The Affair, about a New York teacher who meets a young waitress while on holiday with his family, is, says Leonard, “a real exemplar of that because here you have equal weight given to both sides of the people having the affair, but then their respective spouses are given complexity and nuance and backstories of their own. Instead of having these ‘stuck’ types – the woman who tempts the unsuspecting man into the affair, or the broken wife who’s left behind – we have a much more subtle exploration of the throes of desire, and sexuality and the compromises that people sometimes make to stay together.” Nobody could accuse Gemma Foster of subtlety but she is compelling. “She does quite extreme things,” admits Bartlett, “but the rule always was the audience has to know why she’s doing those things. We don’t have to like it, or approve of it – some of the best moments are hopefully when you’re screaming at the telly going ‘Stop, don’t do that!’” Doctor Foster returns 5 September, 9pm, BBC1"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/aug/31/nhs-trusts-england-overspend-3bn-higher-reported-study-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T09:01:00Z","webTitle":"NHS trusts' overspend is £3bn higher than reported, study claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/31/nhs-trusts-england-overspend-3bn-higher-reported-study-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/aug/31/nhs-trusts-england-overspend-3bn-higher-reported-study-claims","fields":{"headline":"NHS trusts' overspend is £3bn higher than reported, study claims","bodyText":"NHS trusts in England ended last year with an overspend almost £3bn more than previously reported after temporary funding boosts and one-off savings were stripped out, according to new analysis. The Nuffield Trust found the actual overspend in 2016-17 was £3.7bn, compared with the £791m reported by NHS regulators, which was already above the £580m maximum sought by health service bosses. In a report published on Thursday the thinktank also says the NHS faces a “next to impossible” task in hitting the target of ending the current financial year with a deficit of just under £500m. Sally Gainsbury, a senior policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust and author of the report, said: “The official figures on NHS deficits don’t reflect how severe things are for hospitals in England, as the deficits reported include one-off funding boosts or savings that cannot be repeated the following year. Only by looking at the deficit after these have been stripped out can we see the scale of financial challenge facing the NHS – and it is eye-watering.” The report says trusts have succeeded in making billions of pounds of efficiency savings but these have largely been absorbed by inflation and reductions in the tariff paid to them per patient. Among the items it says helped flatter the financial position of the 238 NHS acute, mental health, ambulance and community services trusts last year were a £1.8bn injection of cash from the emergency sustainability fund and about £300m the report puts down to “accountancy changes”. The thinktank says that although the underlying deficit was reduced to £3.7bn by the end of 2016-17, trusts started the current financial year with a spending gap of £5.9bn because inflation is set to be 2.9%, hitting the NHS with additional costs to the tune of £2.2bn, while the national tariff is increasing by just 0.3%. Even with a further £1.8bn in extra sustainability funding, the Nuffield Trust says providers will have to make cost savings of £3.6bn or 4.3% of operating costs in 2017-18, whereas the highest level of cost efficiencies managed in the past decade was 3.9%, in 2011. Even if trusts continue to make savings at a relatively high rate, the underlying deficit will remain at more than £2bn in 2021 and could be as high as £3.7bn if inflation continues to rise faster than NHS regulators anticipated, the report concludes. Nevertheless, the government has the ways and means to prevent this happening, Gainsbury argued. “Increasing funding to wipe out these deficits and fund much-needed reform in the NHS is entirely possible and wouldn’t even increase the proportion of our country’s wealth spent on healthcare,” she said. “Our hospitals are undoubtedly in financial crisis. But the solution to that crisis is not beyond the reach of the public purse.” Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said trusts were being asked to “balance their books, absorb further increases in demand and costs, meet stretching savings targets, all at the same time as they need to improve A&amp;E performance and deliver new commitments for cancer and mental health provision. This is while funding for the NHS has this year fallen from 3.6% to 1.3%.” NHS Improvement, the service’s financial regulator, declined to respond directly to the report but released its latest forecast of a sector-wide deficit of £523m by the end of the year. Its chief executive, Jim Mackey, said: “NHS organisations are delivering financial improvement while managing increased levels of demand for services across the board.” A Department of Health spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these claims by the Nuffield Trust - the financial position for 2016/17 is as set out in our annual accounts which have been independently audited by the NAO and published. “We are investing record amounts in the NHS and as new expert analysis shows, spending on the NHS is in line with other European countries. Thanks to the hard work of staff our health service achieved financial balance again last year and was again judged to be the best and most efficient health system in the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/30/the-breakdown-pro-14-expansion-germany-spain-canada","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T11:34:08Z","webTitle":"Ambitious Pro14 looks at Germany, Spain and Canada for further expansion | Paul Rees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/30/the-breakdown-pro-14-expansion-germany-spain-canada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/30/the-breakdown-pro-14-expansion-germany-spain-canada","fields":{"headline":"Ambitious Pro14 looks at Germany, Spain and Canada for further expansion","bodyText":"The Pro12 has not quite become the Proteas 14 but the introduction of the South African sides the Cheetahs and the Southern Kings after they lost their Super Rugby status means half the 10 tier-one nations will be involved in the old Celtic league. The Pro14, which kicks off on Friday evening, has been long trying to sidestep out of the commercial shadows cast by the Premiership and the Top 14 in France and its expansion is timely with broadcast and sponsorship deals being renegotiated this season. The fundamental difference with the rival leagues lies in the ownership of the teams involved. The Pro14 is run by unions, not clubs. They see the league as a pathway to international rugby: the call to cut the number of matches on a Lions tour from 10 to eight did not come from Ireland, Wales or Scotland. By splitting the league into two conferences of seven, the organisers have kept the door open to further expansion. The inclusion of a side from the United States has long been mooted and explored while there have been overtures from Germany and Spain, and Canada is seen as a potential option. The Pro14 is not looking for a club armed with a rich benefactor and dozens of foreign recruits but a team backed by its union that would fulfil World Rugby’s brief of expanding the game. “This is not the end of our expansion, just the beginning,” the Pro14’s chief executive, Martin Anayi, said. “We had the option of contracting [which would have meant cutting the two Italian sides who have struggled to make an impact since joining the league in 2010] but that was never a real one because we wanted to grow. “We know there are pitfalls from the example of Super Rugby, which is going from 18 back to 15, but looking at it from various points of view, if it stacks up you go for it. South Africa ticked all the boxes, which is why it happened so quickly. It was the right thing to do and we are excited because it is not for one or two years but six. “The first question of any newcomers is will they come with a competitive team? That is vitally important. Then you look at player welfare and then how do you make it work commercially. If a team is not going to be competitive and works against player welfare, it does not matter how much money it brings in. As far as the United States is concerned, the union there needs to be a willing and active participant in any move, along with World Rugby who are looking to increase the number of elite teams and increase the value of the international game. “The game relies on a successful World Cup every four years and more need to be in a position to win it. As a tournament, we can play a central part in the plan to expand the game in the right way and with the right resources. It puts us in a unique position. You could easily go in and produce a USA team with a blitz of imports but that is where the strategy comes in: a team needs roots and benefits for the union in question as well as World Rugby. It needs to be more domestic. You would fine it hard to make it work if the team was full of foreign imports. Germany is very interesting, along with Spain and Canada. Toronto is the fourth largest city in North America. We should not discount any of those markets and we are doing a lot of work in Italy to improve standards.” Anayi does not see the Pro14 as a direct rival to the Premiership or Top 14, except when it comes to player retention and recruitment. “We have a different model,” he said. “It is both public and private. If we increase more money centrally, and there is more to come in the contract cycles next year, and we have an element of control over costs we can remain competitive. “In England and France they are looking seriously at costs: there is not an endless pit of money in rugby. We have a nice blend of funding and are looking to generate more money centrally: the South African expansion for the first stage of that strategy. In England and France they have incredible owners but a central part of our strategy is to push our players to become internationals and play for the Lions; that is as important as the tournament making more money.” While the Cheetahs are an established franchise, the Southern Kings were formed this decade and beset from the start by financial problems, forcing the South African Union to take them over. Zebre came close to folding earlier this year but Anayi believes Italy will start to make an impact in the Pro14. “We are doing a lot of work in Italy to improve standards and performance,” he said. “Much is being done there now by Conor O’Shea [the Italy coach] and his group. I met with Treviso’s owner recently and he wants to make it a rugby powerhouse. We should not write off the teams we have and we want to improve the depth of our tournament and have more teams chasing Champions Cup spots. It is not just about expanding but strengthening what we have.” Pro14 opening weekend fixtures Friday 1 Sept: Cardiff Blues v Edinburgh, Munster v Benneton, Ulster v Cheetahs (all 7.35pm) Saturday 2 Sept: Ospreys v Zebre (2.30pm), Dragons v Leinster (3.15pm), Scarlets v Southern Kings (5.30pm), Connacht v Glasgow (7.35pm). • This is an extract taken from the Breakdown, the Guardian’s weekly rugby union email.

That’s good value. Cooper plays Stratton, a member of Britain’s elite Special Boat Service, the equivalent of the US Navy Seals. Perhaps there should have been a cameo here for our most famous former SBS officer, Paddy Ashdown. After a calamity on his last mission, which involved the heart-wrenching loss of his American partner, Stratton is assigned to clear up the mess. His boss, whom he calls “ma’am” in the traditional manner, is played by Connie Nielsen with a very bizarre British accent she may have learned from watching Judi Dench doing M. An ex-FSB Russian has stolen biological weaponry from the Iranians for his own use, and Stratton is going to have to get it back. But someone on his team is a rat, feeding information to the enemy. There would appear to be two candidates, but the fact that they are played by two actors from a certain, famous movie franchise might well give you a clue as to which is on the side of evil.

Before meeting Abe, May reiterated her intention to kickstart post-Brexit trade by replicating existing deals signed by the EU, to be amended later as needed, saying this would provide confidence for businesses. May, who attended a traditional tea ceremony with Abe soon after flying into Kyoto, Japan’s former imperial capital, said she would be asking Japan to push ahead with talks to seal a wide-ranging EU-Japan trade deal, with the idea this could then be used as a model for a British deal. Speaking before the tea ceremony, which was followed by a dinner and talks with Abe, May said this model could be used to speed up post-Brexit trade arrangements with other countries. “We can’t sign up to a trade deal with Japan or with any other country outside of the European Union until we’ve left the European Union,” she told ITV in Kyoto. “What we can do is to be talking about that future relationship. That’s what I’m going to be doing here with Prime Minister Abe. I believe we can look at an EU-Japan deal as the basis for a future trade deal between the United Kingdom and Japan.” Asked what the point was of a copycat deal, May said this could be a starting point, with the arrangements amended as needed after Brexit took effect. “Even if we start on the basis of an existing trade deal that a country has with the EU, it will be up to the United Kingdom and that country if we wish to renegotiate and change those terms in the future,” she said. “The important thing is that outside of the European Union the UK will have the control and we’ll make the decisions about who we have those trade deals with and what the terms of those trade deals are.” However, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said the stated approach amounted to a “cut and paste Brexit”. He said: “Brexiteers promised a new dawn of improved trade deals across the world. But rather than jet-setting round the globe, Liam Fox might as well be left in a room with a photocopier.” For her part, May criticised Labour for its change of policy over Brexit, leaving open the possibility of the UK remaining in the EU’s single market after Brexit. “What we see from the Labour party is yet another position from them in relation to the European Union and as we have also seen, not a position that is welcomed by all members of the Labour party,” she told the BBC. She added: “What I set out in my Lancaster House speech is you can’t be a member of the single market without being a member of the European Union, and we are leaving the European Union.” May is spending three days in Kyoto and Tokyo, including a series of talks with Abe, an audience with Emperor Akihito, and a speech to the UK-Japan trade conference. As well as trade, the visit includes a focus on defence and security, particularly since North Korea fired a missile across the north of Japan in the early hours of Tuesday morning, prompting international condemnation. May, who told reporters on her flight to Japan that China was “the key” in exerting pressure on North Korea to curb its missile programme, told the BBC she was “pleased that there was a united condemnation” of North Korea from the United Nations security council late on Tuesday. May removed her shoes to participate in the tea ceremony at the Omotesenke tea house in Kyoto, where she was greeted by Abe. The two prime ministers and their interpreters sat on a low bench behind the table, while a master of ceremonies and his two assistants opposite prepared the tea, drunk out of traditional low cups. She was to travel with Abe on the Shinkansen high-speed train to Tokyo later in the evening. On Thursday, May will visit a Japanese warship and address the country’s national security council as well as the trade event, before seeing Akihito on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/30/taylor-swift-snake-woman-misogyny-look-what-you-made-me-do","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T10:16:22Z","webTitle":"Taylor Swift isn’t the first snake woman.

She’s fighting misogyny’s favourite myth","bodyText":"It’s cool to hate Taylor Swift. She’s a social media pariah, the punchline of every meme, a living snake emoji. Her new single Look What You Made Me Do was jeered into the charts , making it to number one and breaking records on its way. Her new album is to be a treatise on reputation, and boy could Swift deliver a TED talk on that subject. She’s become universally despised to the point where it’s taboo even to admit to feeling sorry for her. One is allowed to concede that 1989 had a few bangers but that’s the limit. Swift became synonymous with the snake emoji thanks to one fateful subtweet by Kim K. Her spat with the Kardashian-Wests is what has earned her most of her bad reputation – she’s a liar who got what she deserved, right? Case closed. But it’s naive to think good old-fashioned karma is all that’s at play in the Swift saga. Swift is not the first snake woman. Since the Old Testament, society has sought to discredit and vilify women by associating them with the scaly and the slithering. It’s the oldest trope in the book – from Eve to Medusa, the snake has always been a faithful misogynist device, used to destroy female reputation. Celebrity culture is at best a lifelike simulation, at worst an outright fabrication. The general public can only guess at what really went on between Swift and West, and the entire incident may well have been a mutually beneficial publicity stunt. Yet it was seized upon with an unconcealed glee by the online horde that now collates and quantifies every female celebrity’s actions for moral evaluation – realistically, it was just the excuse they were looking for. Swift’s downfall was long awaited. She has been dismissed as a maneater who exploits her partners for Youtube hits and, in that famous diatribe, declared a calculating professional victim. We’re supposed to believe the powerful playboys she courts are blameless lambs. Long before the West debacle, she was already branded a snake when she sent attorney’s letters to fans selling Swift merchandise and to her former guitar teacher for attempting to exploit her past. In a society that supposedly abhors the gender wage gap, one could be forgiven for thinking Swift’s unashamed defence of her intellectual property and rightful earnings to be admirable. Instead she was met with a vicious campaign of character assassination – evidence of her years of endless, painstaking kindness toward fans was buried in a sea of hate memes. People were determined to see her as false and traitorous. The eagerness to scrutinise and condemn surfaced again when Swift made fumbled attempts at good feminist engagement. When trying to call out Nicki Minaj in a now infamous Twitter quarrel, she demonstrated ignorance of the intersection of race and feminism. Quickly realising her mistake, Swift listened, learned and apologised, which one might think was an exemplary response – but too late. The witch hunt was already under way. In 2017, it is unacceptable for famous women to learn on the job – they must emerge from the womb with a complete working knowledge of intersectional feminism and if they don’t they apparently deserve a sustained campaign of online abuse. It’s hardly surprising that a year later, Swift backtracked on endorsing misogynist lyrics by West – she was likely terrified of making another misstep. Swift made headlines again recently by suing her sexual abuser for a symbolic $1. She won with style, unapologetically asserting the wrongness of the abuse that was perpetrated on her but on the day of her victory, there was tumbleweed on the Taylor Swift hashtag. The online horde that has judged Swift for so long misses nothing, so the selective deafness on certain actions speaks volumes. Only the damning evidence is accepted as canon. Regardless of what Swift does, she is accused of being a treacherous temptress. She’s always a snake. Her actions are incorporated into the narrative as an afterthought, perfunctory pieces of evidence to support an already foregone conclusion. Like all witch hunts, it’s trial by drowning. If you sink, you die, if you float – we kill you for being a witch, stupid. Hating her is the end in itself, and her response means nothing. She’s tried proudly owning her reputation, she’s tried parodying herself (see Blank Space and her LWYMMD video) but nothing works. Her reputation is set in stone regardless of her actions – but this is nothing new, for her or any famous woman. Only 18 months ago, a different woman was synonymous with the snake – Hillary Clinton. Like Swift, she is not unproblematic – but next to Donald Trump should have been an easy choice as president. The public once again latched onto spurious nothings (in this case phantom emails) to magnify cracks in a woman’s character that would have been passed over in a man. No material evidence was even required for Clinton’s downfall – “woman as serpent” is so ingrained in society that we defaulted to it with only the most subtle encouragement. Her reputation was decided before facts. Once again, the snake reared its head and we all obediently hissed in unison. The snake eating its own tail in Swift’s lyric video is a genius symbol for the hatred without any logical end or beginning; misogyny is always a self-fulfilling aim. It’s an infinitely repeating cycle – it wasn’t so many decades ago that Monica Lewinsky was the snake and Hillary Clinton was the contrasting archetype of purity. Before Swift, it was Lady Gaga or Lana Del Rey being slammed as fake and phony. Now they’ve miraculously fallen back into favour, but for how long? Women are swapped in and out of roles in the machinery of patriarchal society and its race to destroy them. Swift’s new song is superficially crafted as a Kanye diss song, but the “tilted stage” Swift refers to is not West’s, it is ours. We, her audience of billions, are the ones who always leave her slipping off the edge. Swift’s imagery is too spine-tinglingly salient to be accidental – “you said the gun was mine” expertly captures the way the misogynist society conjures up incriminations to vilify, demonise and discredit women. Swift knows she can’t win, so she is content to play up to whatever role will bring her temporarily back into favour – “I’ll be the actress, starring in your bad dreams”. Swift knows her reputation is out of her own hands. Yes, Swift’s new single is a diss track, but she’s dissing us. And we probably deserve it. • Brian O’Flynn is a freelance writer, student and pop culture enthusiast based in Dublin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"inequality/2018/feb/13/when-will-men-live-as-long-as-women-by-2032-say-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-13T09:00:59Z","webTitle":"When will men live as long as women?

By 2032, say experts","bodyText":"In developed countries, the gender gap has long favoured women by one measure at least: life expectancy. Throughout the past 100 years women have significantly outlived men, on whom war, heavy industry and cigarettes – among other things – have taken a heavier toll. But this gender gap is closing – and a new statistical analysis of life expectancy in England and Wales since 1950 suggests that, by the year 2032, men can expect to live as long as women, with both sexes sharing an average life expectancy of 87.5 years. The study, led by Les Mayhew, professor of statistics at Cass Business School, calculated how long a sample of 100,000 people aged 30 would live if they experienced the average mortality rates for each ensuing year, projecting forward until the male and female life expectancy curves intersected. There are a number of factors that explain the narrowing gap, according to Mayhew. “A general fall in tobacco and alcohol consumption has disproportionately benefited men, who tended to smoke and drink more than women. “We’ve also made great strides in tackling heart disease, which is more prevalent in men,” Mayhew said. “And men are far more likely to engage in ‘high-risk’ behaviours, and far more likely to die in road accidents, which have fallen too.” The life expectancy gender gap appears to be closing faster than was previously thought: research published in 2015 by Imperial College had indicated it would narrow to 1.9 years by 2030. The UK as a whole has slightly lower lifespan averages, as life expectancy tends to be higher in England than the other constituent nations. In the years immediately after 1950, women’s life expectancy increased faster than men’s in England and Wales, with the gender gap peaking in 1969, when women lived on average 5.68 years longer. Majid Ezzati, professor of global environmental health at Imperial College, said the gap can be attributed largely to social rather than biological factors: “It’s actually the existence of the gap that is unusual, rather than the narrowing. It’s a recent phenomenon which began in the 20th century.” In addition to the heavy male death tolls caused by two world wars, men started to smoke in large numbers before women did and women’s consumption never outpaced men’s. Male cigarette consumption peaked in the 1940s when tobacco industry figures revealed that more than two-thirds of men smoked. Female consumption peaked later, in the 1960s. As well as changing attitudes to cigarettes and alcohol, the loss of heavy industry jobs – statistically more dangerous in both the short- and long-term – also disproportionately affected men. “As the [life expectancy] gap narrows, our understanding of what it means to be a man and a woman changes,” said Danny Dorling, professor of geography at the University of Oxford. “The difference between the genders also narrows because of the introduction of contraception and female entry into the labour market. But the really interesting thing is it’s actually a kind of reverse inequality: women have lived longer than men who are paid more throughout their lives and are structurally advantaged in any number of ways. We haven’t entirely worked out why that might be.” Postcodes and poverty While life expectancy is projected to improve for everybody in the coming decades, the rate of improvement varies significantly depending on where you live. The Cass analysis projects that by 2030, men in the most deprived areas of England and Wales will on average die 8.8 years earlier than those in the least deprived. For women, the gap between rich and poor will be 7.3 years – with both these lifespan inequalities worsening from their current levels. The research made use of mortality rates after age 30 in order to exclude instances of early death, which are becoming increasingly unusual. But dying young is also much more likely if you’re from a poor background. “Early death will certainly become a rarer event, but higher mortality rates for younger ages will still be the norm in the most deprived decile in England and Wales, unless something radically changes,” Mayhew warned. Even in wealthy areas, however, the rate of improvement in life expectancy appears to be slowing. In May, consultants at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted that pension funds – which consider mortality rates when estimating future payouts – might be able to wipe £300bn off their deficits. “In the first decade of this century, there was a clear trend for improvements in life expectancy,” Raj Mody, global head of pensions with PwC, told the Financial Times. “Pension funds have typically been assuming this trend will continue when forecasting deficits. But over the last five years, that trend has changed and there is a growing view that it is not just a blip.” As life expectancy increases, the number of deaths per year tends to fall. Since 1980 the number of deaths has fallen for both men and women, but the decrease has been greater for men. However, in 2012 the number of deaths per year started to rise again, peaking at 529,655 in 2015 – an unprecedented increase of more than 28,000 deaths on the previous year. This was the biggest jump in percentage terms in almost half a century. The number of deaths in 2016 was down by 0.9% year-on-year, but still represented a significant increase from 2014. The Office of National Statistics believes the upturn in deaths might be because of an ageing population. “As people are tending to live longer, leading to the population increasing in both size and age over time, we may also expect the number of deaths to increase,” a 2016 report said. But a number of academics have attributed the slowdown in improvement to government spending cuts, particularly those affecting social care and the NHS. “There is no biological reason why life expectancy in Britain should level out rather than keep on improving. The UK is still some way behind Japan, for example,” said Mayhew. “But improvement in life expectancy is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain in an economic downturn with an ageing population,” Mayhew added. “Austerity in recent years has affected the supply of social care, for example, and this may have caused mortality to rise in some instances.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/03/micah-p-hinson-presents-the-holy-strangers-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T06:59:37Z","webTitle":"Micah P Hinson: Presents the Holy Strangers review – bewitching Americana","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/03/micah-p-hinson-presents-the-holy-strangers-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/03/micah-p-hinson-presents-the-holy-strangers-review","fields":{"headline":"Micah P Hinson: Presents the Holy Strangers review – bewitching Americana","bodyText":"The story of a wartime family, Micah P Hinson’s self-described “modern folk opera” drifts with the mesmerising quality of an old-time train.

One of those, the 12th Symphony, was the main work in Petrenko’s visit to the Proms with the Oslo Philharmonic, whose chief conductor he has been now for four years. This was only the second performance of the 12th Symphony at the Proms; Malcolm Sargent conducted the London premiere there in 1963. It was Shostakovich’s third attempt at composing a “Lenin symphony”, a programmatic work celebrating the success of the 1917 Russian revolution; material for the first of them, shorn of its programmatic associations, had eventually become the Sixth Symphony, and despite its subtitle – The Year 1917 – the 12th is not graphically programmatic either. The movements all have descriptive titles – the first is Revolutionary Petrograd, the finale The Dawn of Humanity – but otherwise it follows a conventional symphonic scheme. It’s certainly not top-drawer Shostakovich, and by the time it reaches the end of its over-protracted finale, we’ve heard more than enough of the motto theme. But the best of the symphony is well worth hearing; Petrenko ratcheted up the tension thrillingly in the first movement and allowed the wind soloists the space to make the most of their opportunities in the slow second, even if he couldn’t do much to mitigate the repetitiousness of what comes later. The orchestra, which made its mark internationally when Mariss Jansons was its music director in the 1990s, remains a top-class ensemble. It had already had a chance to show what it could do in the 1919 suite from Stravinsky’s Firebird ballet – a moment of raggedness in the Infernal Dance stood out only because it was such an outlier – even though Petrenko kept things on a tight rein, and then created just the right glitzy backdrop for Leif Ove Andsnes’s performance of Rachmaninov’s Fourth Piano Concerto. For all the polish in Andsnes’s playing there was just a touch of brittleness about it all too, which wasn’t inappropriate. Available on iPlayer until 28 September. The Proms continue until 9 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/30/labour-urges-swift-contest-to-replace-kezia-dugdale-as-scottish-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T18:25:20Z","webTitle":"Corbynites hope leftwinger will emerge to stand for Scottish Labour leadership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/30/labour-urges-swift-contest-to-replace-kezia-dugdale-as-scottish-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/30/labour-urges-swift-contest-to-replace-kezia-dugdale-as-scottish-leader","fields":{"headline":"Corbynites hope leftwinger will emerge to stand for Scottish Labour leadership","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn is hoping a leftwing candidate will emerge to stand for the leadership of the Scottish party, after Kezia Dugdale unexpectedly announced her resignation. Labour’s London leadership had initially been expected to press for a quick contest to replace Dugdale, in the hope that Neil Findlay, the MSP who ran Corbyn’s leadership campaign in Scotland, and recently published a book called Socialism and Hope, would clinch the job. But after Findlay ruled himself out on Wednesday, followed by Dugdale’s deputy, Alex Rowley, senior Labour figures at Westminster said they saw no need to rush – and signalled they would like to see an influx of new members into the Scottish party, to “widen the franchise”. The early favourite for the job is Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour’s health spokesman and son of Mohammad Sarwar, the UK’s first Muslim MP. An effective operator at Holyrood but a centrist, Sarwar is regarded with suspicion by some on the left yet is now a clear frontrunner after several leading potential candidates from the left ruled themselves out. Its youngest leader since devolution, Dugdale surprised her party by announcing her resignation on Tuesday night. Allies said it was a personal decision, driven by the relentless pace of Scottish and UK politics over the past two years, and exacerbated by tensions with the party leadership in London. In Dugdale’s resignation letter, she said the loss of a close friend, Gordon Aikman, to motor neurone disease earlier this year had made her reconsider her priorities. “His terminal illness forced him to identify what he really wanted from life, how to make the most of it and how to make a difference,” she said. The unexpected capture of six seats in Scotland in June’s general election has convinced senior figures at the party’s headquarters that it is there the next contest will be won or lost. Although Scottish Labour now has seven MPs at Westminster, the centre of gravity in Scottish politics has now shifted to Holyrood, effectively leaving party members a pool of 23 MSPs to choose from. Richard Leonard, a former GMB official allied to the Corbyn grouping in Scotland, has yet to declare. A close ally said Dugdale’s decision had been a personal one. “She hasn’t spoken to me or anyone as I understand it. My guess is the constant attacks and backbiting by the left who wish to ‘unite’ the party was the last straw. However, her resignation letter is probably the way she feels,” he said. He said attacks within the party from critics such as Findlay, a senior figure in the leftwing Campaign for Socialism, the Scottish party’s equivalent of Momentum, will have added to her fatigue and frustration. Corbyn underlined the importance of Scotland to the leadership in Westminster when he spent five days last week touring the country, including seats Labour hopes it could take from the Scottish National party. Party figures close to Corbyn said there had been no pressure on Dugdale to leave. Claims there was a confrontation between them last week were dismissed as “absolute nonsense” by one source, who said their dealings were cordial and respectful. Dugdale fought hard to establish a more federal structure in Labour, securing a seat for the leader of the Scottish party on the ruling national executive committee, which makes crucial decisions about how the party is run. Rowley will stand in for her for the time being – including on the finely balanced NEC – and is regarded by other members as more likely to support Corbyn. “Jeremy will have things all his own way,” said one. Unite, Labour’s biggest donor, urged the Scottish party on Wednesday not to rush into a contest. Praising Dugdale for increasing the party’s number of seats at Westminster from one MP when she took over two years ago to seven today, the union’s Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said: “We urge the party to reflect upon this turn of fortunes and consolidate, not to act in undue haste on any succession plan.”He added: “There is no need to rush into a leadership election. Under Alex Rowley’s leadership we are confident that the voices of Scotland’s working people will be heard loud and clear at Holyrood.” A spokesman for Corbyn said the timing of any contest would be up to the Scottish executive committee to decide. “The SEC will meet on Saturday 9 September to consider the timetable and process for selecting their next leader,” he said. A final list of candidates is likely to emerge in the coming days. A candidate needs to attract 15% of the nominating body, which is made up of the party’s MPs, MSPs and MEPs. So as of now, that means it needs five of those. Although seen as a centrist who will put off leftwing pro-independence voters, Sarwar has become one of Holyrood’s most effective performers and organised a full-to-capacity rally for Corbyn at Glasgow central mosque last week. Muslim voters in the city are a key demographic for both Labour and the SNP. So far, all of the most likely candidates are men but senior Labour women have pointed out that Dugdale was the only woman among Labour’s key leadership figures – Corbyn, his deputy Tom Watson, and the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones. Jess Phillips, the Birmingham Yardley MP, said: “The Labour party has a thorny issue to face, as if [Kezia]was replaced by a man all of our leadership positions go to men. People will shout meritocracy as if women aren’t good enough and the best person for the job is always a man, but what’s not good enough is if Labour women are always sidelined.” • This article was amended on 31 August 2017.
