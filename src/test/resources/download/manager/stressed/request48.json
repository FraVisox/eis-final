Speaking in Berlin on Monday, Parker listed a series of what he referred to as aggressive actions by Russia, including interference in elections, cyber-attacks, disinformation and criminal thuggery. He drew a distinction between the Russian government and Russian people. “The chief protagonist among these hostile actors today is the Russian government. Notice I do not say Russia. The UK has the utmost admiration and respect for the people of Russia. For their proud culture and long history. “We have no desire to escalate tensions or go back to the tense and dangerous times that Europe lived through during the cold war.” But the Kremlin would be called out for its actions, he said. It was the first time a sitting director general of MI5 has spoken in public abroad. The objective was mainly intended to send a message to UK and European politicians not to allow Brexit to undermine European intelligence sharing. Expanding on excerpts of his speech released in advance overnight, Parker, who disclosed he had studied Russia at university, said the Kremlin had the central and admirable aim of building greatness on the world stage and there were ways to pursue that through the rules-based international order. But Russia instead had through its repeated choices pursued that aim instead through its military and intelligence services. Its default position when challenged was “bare-faced lying”. “The Russian state’s now well-practised doctrine of blending media manipulation, social media disinformation and distortion along with new and old forms of espionage, and high-levels of cyber-attacks, military force and criminal thuggery is what is meant these days by the term hybrid threats.” He cited the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, describing it as reckless, putting not only the former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, at risk but numerous others in the community. The Skripals’ recovery was down to the “near miraculous” medical treatment they had received, Parker said. Russia had offered 30 different alternative theories about the attack, which he described as criminal thuggery. “Whatever nonsense they conjure up, the case is clear,” he said. Parker was speaking at a conference of intelligence officials organised by MI5’s German counterpart, the BFV. He told them he was not a politician but went on to talk about the potential implications of Brexit. He stressed the UK was leaving the European Union but not Europe, and MI5 and its sister agencies MI6 and GCHQ were committed to continued cooperation in combating terrorism. He said it was crucial this cooperation was not weakened. There were communal European laws and treaties within which the intelligence agencies worked and he hoped a comprehensive agreement on Brexit would be agreed to allow intelligence agencies to continue with their joint work. There is concern about laws governing data-sharing and privacy, as well as cooperation in the sharing of airline passenger lists. On top of this is the system of European warrants. He hoped a comprehensive agreement on Brexit would be agreed that tackled obstacles and allowed intelligence professionals to get on with their joint work. He added that although Islamic State had lost territory in Iraq and Syria, the threat it posed would have to be faced for years to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/14/us-citizens-standing-against-poverty-poor-peoples-campaign-america-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T14:35:00Z","webTitle":"US citizens are standing up against poverty – the UK should follow suit | Mary O’Hara","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/14/us-citizens-standing-against-poverty-poor-peoples-campaign-america-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/14/us-citizens-standing-against-poverty-poor-peoples-campaign-america-uk","fields":{"headline":"US citizens are standing up against poverty – the UK should follow suit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The recent “McStrikes” in the UK may not have involved a lot of people but they have symbolic importance. As the workers involved have pointed out, a £10 minimum wage demand is hardly asking the earth of a highly profitable global company. However, on top of the issue of a living wage, the strikers’ sharp focus on zero-hour contracts is crucial. It’s a grim hallmark of the precarious jobs market that is inhabited by a growing chunk of the UK population; 1.8m in 2017. Time and again we are told that “work pays” and is the best way out of poverty, when this is patently not the case. The emergence of the “gig economy” and a corresponding rise in self-employment breeds insecurity and low pay, leaving many in, or teetering on, the brink of destitution. Nevertheless, a range of actions that exposes poverty wages as an unacceptable new normal, along with the abject unfairness of vast pay gaps between bosses and workers and the injustice of spiralling corporate profits at the expense of fair pay, is to be embraced, such as a trade union-organised march on Saturday demanding a “new deal for working people” in the face of enduring low pay. In the US, the front lines of the fight against poverty pay and insecure work have been building up a head of steam thanks to ongoing fair wage campaigns such as Fight for $15. Protests, including against McDonald’s, have become a regular occurrence. Most recently the unprecedented teacher walkouts in a number of states have captured national attention. Cuts to state education budgets and austerity have systematically stripped teaching professionals of anything resembling a living wage. On a broader level, attacks on Medicaid, the primary social insurance programme for the poor, have prompted pushback. Meanwhile, among the most impoverished people there is a steady forging of a different kind of protest movement, such as The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival (PPC). Spearheaded by secular and church grassroots poverty organisations, poor people themselves, and figureheads such as the Reverend William Barber (whose “Moral Mondays” initiative, inspired by Martin Luther King Jr, made headlines a few years ago when it mobilised record numbers of demonstrators in Raleigh, North Carolina, to protest against regressive state policies), the PPC is taking its message to the national stage. On Monday, after two years of preparation and grassroots coalition-building, the PPC kickstarts a social justice effort with six weeks of peaceful direct action in state capitals around the US. The intention of the campaign is to construct a broad, citizen-led movement that challenges the shocking and avoidable scale of poverty and the systemic pillars that reinforce it, including racism. Thousands of people, including many who have never been activists, have signed up. A report, The Souls of Poor Folk, published last month by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington DC, in conjunction with the PPC, conducted an “audit” of poverty in America in the 50 years since Martin Luther King Jr launched his original PPC. The audit lays bare the enormity of poverty in modern America and meticulously documents individual stories of hardship. It points out that right now almost 41 million Americans live below the federal poverty line and that upwards of 140 million people (more than 40% of the entire population) are living under the threat of penury. Taken alongside rising levels of child poverty and austerity in the UK, there can be no doubt that if ever there was a moment for a concerted fight against poverty in two of the richest nations, this is it. • Mary O’Hara is author of Austerity Bites: A Journey to the Sharp End of Cuts in the UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/may/14/new-chemical-compound-stops-common-cold-in-its-tracks-rhinovirus","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T15:26:31Z","webTitle":"New chemical compound 'stops common cold in its tracks'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/14/new-chemical-compound-stops-common-cold-in-its-tracks-rhinovirus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/14/new-chemical-compound-stops-common-cold-in-its-tracks-rhinovirus","fields":{"headline":"New chemical compound 'stops common cold in its tracks'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s a conundrum that has stumped scientists for centuries, but now researchers say they have taken a tantalising step forward in the quest to tackle the common cold. The scourge of workplace, home and school playground, the common cold is predominantly caused by the rhinovirus. But attempts to thwart the pathogen by vaccination or antiviral drugs face a number of difficulties – not least because the virus comes in many forms and can mutate rapidly leading to drug resistance. But now scientists say they have discovered a way to nobble the virus that could one day help those with conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis, for whom a cold is not merely a nuisance but a serious health risk. The trick, the authors say, is to develop drugs that interact with one of the enzymes within our cells – an approach that makes it harder for the virus to become drug-resistant. “Viruses hijack the host to make more copies of themselves. This enzyme is one of the host enzymes that the virus hijacks,” said Roberto Solari, visiting professor at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, and a co-author of the study. Writing in the journal Nature Chemistry, a team of researchers based around the UK report how they looked at molecules that interact with a human enzyme that attaches a type of fatty acid molecule on to proteins. While two of these molecules on their own had little effect on the enzyme, the team found that when they were chemically stitched together they became remarkably potent in preventing the enzyme from working as normal. Solari said that is important, since the virus uses the enzyme to assemble the protein coat which surrounds the genetic material of the virus. “What we found is if we block the addition of this fat, the coat doesn’t assemble so the virus doesn’t package its genes into its coat,” he said. “The virus still makes its own genes, it makes the coat, but the coat can’t assemble so the virus can’t replicate – you actually don’t make infectious particles.” The team say the molecule appears to completely prevent the virus from replicating, whether it is added one hour before, one hour after or at the same time as the cells are infected, and that it remains effective up to three hours after infection. The approach was also found to prevent the replication of other viruses in the same family as rhinovirus – including polio and foot-and-mouth disease. But Solari said a cure for the common cold is a long way off: the drug will need to undergo further developments and optimisation before it can be used as a medication, while tests have so far only been carried out on human cells in a dish. “We haven’t done any animal studies, and we obviously haven’t done any studies in humans, so I can’t tell you formally what the animal toxicity of this compound is,” said Solari, adding that it is also unclear whether the approach would work by the time symptoms of a cold appear – typically a few days after infection. “There is a still a long way before this becomes a medicine,” he said. And, even if the latest discovery does eventually lead to a way to treat colds, its use is likely to be limited to those with respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, for whom a catching a cold can be dangerous. “Rhinovirus, the common cold virus, in healthy people is pretty trivial – you have the runny nose, you have a bit of a temperature, you don’t feel well for two or three days, but you get over it,” said Solari."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/14/npower-owner-innogy-warns-staff-they-will-bear-brunt-of-job-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T14:33:25Z","webTitle":"Npower owner warns staff they will be first to be cut in E.ON deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/14/npower-owner-innogy-warns-staff-they-will-bear-brunt-of-job-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/14/npower-owner-innogy-warns-staff-they-will-bear-brunt-of-job-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Npower owner warns staff they will be first to be cut in E.ON deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Npower owner Innogy has privately told staff it is extremely concerned they will bear the brunt of thousands of job cuts planned as part of a major shakeup of the European energy industry. German energy giant E.ON has warned up to 5,000 jobs will be axed when it acquires the energy networks and customer-facing parts of Innogy, as part of a huge asset swap with RWE. Innogy management said publicly last week that it feared its 43,000 staff would be at a disadvantage to E.ON employees as roles are shed during the integration of the firms next year. More than 6,000 of those are based in the UK, mostly at npower but also in the company’s renewable energy business. Leaked emails from management to staff reveal how deeply worried the firms’s leadership is that Innogy staff will be the biggest losers from the deal. Uwe Tigges, the Innogy chief executive, wrote: “We are extremely concerned that the planned transaction and the job cuts announced by E.ON will be unilaterally pursued to the disadvantage of the Innogy employees.” He said that talks with E.ON and RWE had so far failed to secure legally binding assurances that Innogy staff would not be unfairly affected. As a result of the impasse, Tigges told workers in an email: “E.ON accepts that you, our employees, must continue living with significant uncertainty.” The concerns come as npower said on Monday that its merger with the energy supply business of UK-listed SSE was on track. The UK competition watchdog last week launched a full-scale investigation into the merger, saying the move could push up energy prices. Npower’s profits for the first three months of the year were up by more than a quarter, to £37m, despite losing 66,000 domestic customer accounts due to “intense market competition”. The firm was boosted by the price hike it announced last year, higher demand because of below-average temperatures and its continued cost-cutting efforts. Paul Coffey, npower chief executive, said: “Although our results show signs of progress, this is mainly due to cost management as the market we operate in remains very competitive, which is putting real pressure on margins and customer account numbers.” He warned that the energy market remained tough, and said the government’s energy price cap later this year meant npower would have to continue to strictly manage its costs. The energy supplier was widely criticised last week after becoming the fifth of the big six energy suppliers to hike its standard tariff for about 1 million customers. The company’s standard tariff was already the most expensive of the large suppliers, even before the increase."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/barring-heterosexual-couples-from-civil-partnerships-is-discriminatory-court-told","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T16:16:46Z","webTitle":"Barring heterosexual couples from civil partnerships is discriminatory, court told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/barring-heterosexual-couples-from-civil-partnerships-is-discriminatory-court-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/barring-heterosexual-couples-from-civil-partnerships-is-discriminatory-court-told","fields":{"headline":"Barring heterosexual couples from civil partnerships is discriminatory, court told","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Preventing heterosexual couples from entering into civil partnerships is discriminatory and a disproportionate restriction on their right to family life, the supreme court has been told. Opening legal argument in the test case on the future of such unions, Karon Monaghan QC said many people have well-founded reasons for not wishing to get married. The appeal has been brought by Rebecca Steinfeld, 37, and Charles Keidan, 41, who want to enter into a legal arrangement but are banned because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 allows only same-sex couples to participate. “They have deep-rooted and genuine ideological objections to marriage,” Monaghan explained. “I want to observe that they are not alone in holding those deep-rooted objections.” Matrimony, she said, was “historically heteronormative and patriarchal” and the couple’s objections were not frivolous. “These are important issues, no small matters, and they are serious for my clients because they cannot marry conformable with their conscience and that should weigh very heavily indeed.” Keidan and Steinfeld, who live in Hammersmith, west London, and have crowdfunded their legal campaign, lost earlier challenges at the high court and court of appeal – although the latter ruled that the government’s wait-and-see approach was discriminatory. “One legal regime for different-sex couples but two legal regimes for same-sex couples will ultimately be unsustainable,” it declared. Before the hearing, Steinfeld and Keidan said: “We have met hundreds of couples like us who love each other and want a civil partnership so they can celebrate their commitment and strengthen the security of their family unit. “All they want is the choice of marriage or a civil partnership to suit them, which is currently available only to same-sex couples. We have a new equalities minister and she should take this opportunity to look afresh at the government’s position. It’s time for the government to stop making excuses which play with people’s lives, and give choice to all now.” The government has said it intends to see how extending marriage to same-sex couples affects demand for civil partnerships before making a final decision. The Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a former children’s minister, is supporting the couple. “The government should address the clear inequality within the law and bring forward appropriate legislation to make the necessary changes,” he said outside the court. “My [private member’s bill on civil partnerships] gives the government that opportunity and I urge the new equalities minister [Penny Mordaunt] not to waste taxpayers’ money on expensive court cases and instead use my bill to extend civil partnerships.” At the weekend, the government was reported to be considering abolishing all civil partnerships rather than extending them in order to avoid the problem of discrimination. That suggestion prompted the gay rights charity Stonewall to condemn any attempt to end civil partnerships. “While many have converted their civil partnership to a marriage, many thousands of same-sex couples haven’t – and don’t want to,” Paul Twocock, the organisation’s campaign director, said. “They want to maintain the integrity of the day they made their commitment to each other in a civil partnership. “It’s not right for any government to take that away. Abolition would imply that civil partnerships are now less valued than a marriage and somehow irrelevant. Nothing could be further from the truth for those couples already in them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/may/14/streaming-service-dazn-netflix-sport-us-boxing-eddie-hearn","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T14:43:47Z","webTitle":"UK-based sport streaming service adopts Netflix model after $1bn deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/14/streaming-service-dazn-netflix-sport-us-boxing-eddie-hearn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/14/streaming-service-dazn-netflix-sport-us-boxing-eddie-hearn","fields":{"headline":"UK-based sport streaming service adopts Netflix model after $1bn deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Netflix and Amazon model that has revolutionised entertainment TV viewing is being brought to the world of sport, as a London-based streaming service looks to take on the giants of pay-TV. Few British viewers will have heard of DAZN, pronounced “Dazone” and part of the sports media group Perform, but the business sent shockwaves through the sports world last week with a $1bn (£736m) deal to revolutionise pay-per-view boxing in the US. The exclusive eight-year deal with Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom Boxing, which promotes fighters including the world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua, has taken a leaf directly out of the Netflix playbook. Broadcasters HBO and Showtime dominate top-flight boxing, charging anywhere up to $70 to $100 for a pay-per-view package gathering a few million viewers per fight night. DAZN charges closer to $12 a month and intends to challenge pay-per view TV byamassing tens of millions of customers willing to watch a wide range of sports content cheaply. “We have seen in music with Spotfiy and TV with Netflix and Amazon that people will pay a sensible amount of money for a good service,” the Perform chief executive, Simon Denyer, said. “We want to be a Netflix for sport.” Denyer said the company has the financial firepower to be a real threat. He adds that when the hugely anticipated heavyweight fight between Joshua and Deontay Wilder is finally scheduled, it intends to outpunch HBO and Showtime for the exclusive US rights – which would be a mammoth coup. “If the fight happens we want to show it on DAZN and have a significant budget to negotiate it to get it on the platform,” he said. Denyer is full of fighting talk because in the 18 months since launching DAZN it has already begun to make waves against rivals such as Sky and he has deep pockets to keep the momentum going. Perform is in many ways a British success story – founded in Feltham, London, with about 1,800 of its 3,000 global staff spread from Hammersmith to Leeds – although it is owned by the Ukrainian-born billionaire Leonard Blavatnik’s Access Industries. Blavatnik also owns Warner Music and has a stake in Spotify. Blavatnik – who took the decade-old Perform Group private in a £700m deal in 2014, after it listed on the FTSE 250 in 2011 – has enabled DAZN to make its mark in countries where there are opportunities to strike reasonable deals for sports rights, such as Germany, Japan and soon the US. Next season, DAZN will show more Champions League matches than Sky to sports fans in Germany, where it also has the exclusive rights to air the Premier League, and in Japan it pulled off a coup by taking the J-League football rights off traditional TV in an exclusive 10-year streaming deal. Denyer said the model is exactly the same as that of Netflix and Amazon but mostly focused on live sport. While providers such as Sky and BT only air a fraction of the football matches for any competition they have the rights for, DAZN is going down the equivalent of the Netflix/Amazon binge-watching route. “We are often showing 30 or 40 matches live at once,” Denyer said. “On a typical week we will air 130 matches – we’ve found the average user watches about five.” Denyer says across the five countries in which DAZN has launched to date – Germany, Japan, Austria, Switzerland and Canada – the “blended average” per month subscription charge is only $12. Sky’s average is £46, although in households hooked on sport it is easily double that, including packages such as broadband and telephone. “Netflix and Amazon have proved that large numbers of people are willing to pay a reasonable amount per month [for streaming services],” Denyer said. “Prices have come down while the quality and quantity of content has dramatically increased. We want to do the same for sport.” However, while Sky’s model makes the company close to £1.5bn in profits annually, to achieve the low-cost sports revolution dream Blavatnik is going to have to be prepared to rack up potentially billions in losses buying sports rights until the customer base grows to a size to reach profitability. Last year, while DAZN showed tremendous growth, with revenues rocketing from £8.7m to £90.8m, the overall Perform Group, which also sells some digital sports rights to other media groups, saw its operating losses quadruple from £50.8m to £214m. Nevertheless, DAZN is not the only brand to start to see the potential to disrupt the sports broadcasting market. Last month Amazon struck a $130m non-exclusive streaming deal for NFL matches, alongside NBC and CBS, and in the UK it has deals for the US Open tennis, ATP Tour (previously on Sky) and is still in talks with the Premier League over two potential packages of streaming rights. Disney is gearing up to launch a streaming service based on ESPN content. The UK market is not on DAZN’s radar. The rise in costs fuelled by the rivalry between Sky and BT in recent years has made it harder for a new entrant but Denyer says the sports viewing revolution is going to be global. “There is going to be a significant change in pay-TV over the coming years,” Denyer said. “The question is: do traditional companies transition successfully or do new entrants like us make a better job of it?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/14/victims-crime-handed-over-police-immigration-enforcement","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T13:18:19Z","webTitle":"Victims of crime being handed over to immigration enforcement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/victims-crime-handed-over-police-immigration-enforcement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/victims-crime-handed-over-police-immigration-enforcement","fields":{"headline":"Victims of crime being handed over to immigration enforcement","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Migrant victims of crime are being handed over to immigration enforcement officials by police when they report crimes, figures show. Of 45 police forces asked about the practice of handing over victims’ details, more than half said they did, three said they did not, while the rest either did not reply, did not give a clear yes or no, or said they did not have information about it. The forces were responding to freedom of information requests put to them by BBC Two’s Victoria Derbyshire programme. There are fears the disclosure could discourage migrant victims of crime from coming forward, although the Home Office said it would support vulnerable migrants “regardless of their immigration status”. “Victims of crime must be treated first and foremost as victims,” a spokesperson said. The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) Lead for Immigration Crime, Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer, said: “We are considering whether further advice to police forces is required.” He went on: “The police priority is to protect victims and investigate crime, and we are extremely careful about doing anything to deter victims from reporting to us. Each case is considered very carefully but there will be instances where police need to exchange information with the Home Office.” The NPCC issued guidance on the treatment of victims of crime with outstanding immigration issues in December, saying they would not be arrested on the basis of their immigration status unless there was “an immediate risk of harm to a specific individual”. But just three police forces who responded to the FoI requests were adhering to this guidance. Police officers are able to hand some victims of crime over to immigration enforcement because they have free rein to make background checks on them on the police national computer (PNC). Police forces have told the Guardian they use their discretion when making these checks on both British people and foreign nationals who report crimes to them. Victims of crime are not aware police are making the checks, nor do police need their permission. The Guardian previously reported that Miroslaw Zieba, a Polish national who had committed criminal offences in his home country, reported being the victim of an assault to police who handed him over to Home Office officials after making a PNC check. He was then arrested and detained. Fahad Ansari, Zieba’s solicitor, said: “This creates a real danger that the decision whether to check the PNC for a victim of crime will be subject to an individual officer’s own prejudices. In other words it will lead to the profiling of victims of crime, which will only further reduce public confidence in the police.” Martha Spurrier, the director of the civil liberties organisation Liberty, expressed concern about these discretionary checks. She said: “The government’s obsession with making the UK a hostile place for foreign people at any human cost has put border controls in our hospitals, our schools and our banks – but targeting victims of crime is a new low. Police are bound by the Human Rights Act to investigate crimes effectively, regardless of who the victim is – but this gives officers a licence to act on their prejudices with no guidance, oversight or accountability. “It will leave people afraid to report crime, robbing them of protection under the law and creating impunity for criminals who target vulnerable people with unsettled immigration status. This is criminalising victims and letting criminals off the hook.” Essex police said it was “standard procedure” to check the PNC when investigating reports of crime from victims. The Metropolitan police said PNC checks on victims of crime were conducted at the discretion of officers and West Midlands police said checks might be carried out if a person reporting a crime was known to them. Greater Manchester police declined to answer and said it was a policy matter for the NPCC. Police Scotland said it did not routinely carry out such checks but it was an available option. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it may look up 999 or 101 callers on the PNC when they call to report a crime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/11/putin-world-cup-russia-2018-var-nerve-agent","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T18:00:27Z","webTitle":"The World Cup provides a chance to be reminded of our self-delusions | Marina Hyde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/11/putin-world-cup-russia-2018-var-nerve-agent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/11/putin-world-cup-russia-2018-var-nerve-agent","fields":{"headline":"The World Cup provides a chance to be reminded of our self-delusions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2012, the Pointless host Richard Osman conceived the World Cup of Crisps, in which 32 big-hitting varieties of crisp were pitted against each other in group stages, all decided by Twitter polls. Thereafter, the winners proceeded to knockout stages, meeting in quarter-finals, before progressing to – well, I believe you are familiar with this general format. Osman has since expanded the idea to the World Cup of Chocolate, and a book called The World Cup of Everything, which invites readers to stage their own hotly contested tournaments between the weightiest competitors in the fields of such things as bands, animals, biscuits and so on. I have never game-theorised a World Cup of My World Cup Lies but in a way that particular tournament happens every four years anyway, whether I want it to or not. I have simply yet to formalise it. Which of my grandest self-deceptions would win? Well, clearly, a lot depends on the draw. For instance, I wouldn’t like “I honestly don’t get emotional about England anymore” to be drawn in the same group as “I don’t secretly find it a release once England crash out”. It would be too early for them to meet. See also “I never make jokes based on lazy prejudices regarding national character” and “I especially never do this out of thinly disguised jealously that the nation in question is better at football than us”. I mean, I could go on. “I have never attempted to make an in-game football bargain with a god I otherwise know doesn’t exist.” “I am happy for Germany’s success.” Oh, the things you tell yourself. Or the things I tell myself, at any rate. I’m sure you’re much purer, much less hypocritical and much less of a terrible person than me. Especially when you’re on the internet. But on a personal note, the World Cup is a quadrennial chance to be reminded of my own shallows and self-delusions. I can feel it in those moments of worshipping – literally and wholly loving – a player I despise at club level, for putting England through in the last minute with some scrappy, flukey, comically undeserved goal I basically know is only deferring the agony to come. At the same time, the psychic pall of the England shirt traditionally gets too much even for those of us not having to wear it. It’s all rather too tired and emotional, eventually, like some toxic family Christmas that’s gone on too long. There is a kind of relief and freshly laundered feel to a tournament once England have inevitably buggered off out of it. Think of it as “the reset”. Thereafter I switch to indulging one of the other World Cup lies I tell myself: namely, that I’m a proper sporting purist who is now genuinely happy to simply be watching great international sides that are not my own make their electrifying progress toward a trophy I am absolutely relaxed about England never winning again. Those are just the printable lies but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Instead, set your sights on adventure, as we contemplate Russia 2018 – what could be your last 32-team World Cup! Obviously, I cannot wait for it to start. Not least because, given various developing news stories relating to our hosts, the tournament has rather ghastlier noises-off than usual. I just feel like I’m going to be happier arguing about VAR than about nerve agent. Then again, it’s fair to say the opening game – Russia v Saudi Arabia – is not the “prospect to salivate over” of footballing cliche. On the one hand, the two countries are engaged in a version of proxy war in Syria. On the other, they’ve formed a strategic alliance on energy. Either way, Vladimir Putin will be in attendance. As for further presidential cameos at a tournament he has spent almost £9bn on, despite being not that into it … Well, according to a Kremlin spokesman’s most recent update, “everything will depend on how things go”. This feels like a remark of unsettling vagueness when applied to Putin. The Russian president used his last sporting mega-event as a curtain raiser to invading Crimea, so it is to be hoped this “how things go” is a reference to Russia’s progress through the group stages of the football World Cup, as opposed to any potential sudden developments in Russia’s role in the conflict in Syria/the investigation into the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury/the investigation of possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election/any other of the crazy shit the Russian president’s currently into. So yes, as I say – it does help once the actual football gets underway. And the actual fibbing. The lying – the sweet, sweet self-delusion – is really the key to it all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/16/why-does-alcohol-make-us-drunk-google","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T07:00:42Z","webTitle":"Why does alcohol make us drunk?

You asked Google – here’s the answer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ah, alcohol. As Homer once said, this infamous molecule is both “the cause of, and the solution to, all of life’s problems”. OK, it was Homer Simpson who said that rather than the classical bard, but it’s no less true or profound for that. Sometimes, the rubbish you come out with when you’re drunk really is quite clever, or funny, or both, so long as you can remember it properly the next morning. Our ambiguous relationship with alcohol is older than civilisation – in fact there’s a strong argument that it was the cause of civilisation itself. We’ve been drinking it since our dawn as a species, and it probably helped us evolve into humans in the first place. It may even have played a role in the very creation of life on earth. No, I’m not drunk. This is proper science. For all that time, alcohol has been, as Simpson said so beautifully, both a cause of great pleasure and, for a minority, colossal pain. Our relationship as a society with alcohol swings on a pendulum over time between celebrating the positives and deploring the negatives, and right now we’re over on the temperance side. Between 1785 and 1985, The Times used the term “binge drinking” a total of 49 times. The same paper ran over 300 stories about binge drinking in 2004 alone. Which is odd, because people were drinking much less in 2004 than their ancestors had been at pretty much any point in the preceding two centuries. This means we live in an age of alarmist misinformation about the perils of booze, with a growing belief that any level of consumption of this “poison” is potentially harmful. If there were any truth to this claim, given the quantities we used to drink in the past, the human race would have been extinct long ago. So what does alcohol really do to us? And how does it do it? The truth is, neuroscientists are still in the process of figuring this out. To a significant degree, it depends on who you are, what your relationship with alcohol is, what and how you’re drinking, and also, ultimately, what you mean by “drunk”. Let’s look at the physiological effects first. The active component in booze is ethanol, which as molecules go, has all the sly charm of one of those beery lads who can worm his way past the velvet ropes of any bar in the world. Water soluble and small enough to pass through and between cell walls, ethanol is drawn first to the liver, which immediately begins to break it down. But the liver only works so fast, so surplus ethanol shoots on through to every part of the body and ends up in the brain within minutes. It does all sorts of stuff to our digestive system, our motor functions, our need to pee and much more, but it’s the feeling of drunkenness that fascinates us. Information and instructions are carried around the brain by neurons – excitable cells that carry data. Neurons don’t touch, but communicate across tiny gaps known as synapses, using chemicals known as neurotransmitters. Simplistically, these fall into two types: “excitatory impulses”, which tell us to do stuff and are carried by glutamate, and “inhibitory signals” which tell us to do less, and travel via gamma-aminobutyric acid, or Gaba. Trillions of these signals are happening all the time, and their net effect is the mind itself, and our sense (some would say illusion) of consciousness. Ethanol gleefully speeds into the synapses, cascading into the gaps between the neurons, and then sidles up to them, puts its arms around their shoulders and assures them it’s their best mate in the whole world. You might be suspicious if a stranger did this to you in a pub unless you were already gattered, but your neurons totally believe the ethanol molecules, and scientists still don’t really know why. When it binds to glutamate, ethanol slows it down and stops it from acting, like the pub bore who pins you in the corner and gives you an episode-by-episode recap of Game of Thrones even though you keep saying yes, you’ve seen it, and you really have to go because you just remembered you left the babysitter in the oven. But it behaves quite differently with the depressive Gaba, basically convincing it to switch to shots, grab a kebab and then go on to a club and do Jägerbombs. This double-bind effect – dulling the active signals and amplifying the sedative ones – is what we really mean when we say alcohol is a depressant: it doesn’t make you depressed – at least not at low levels – but it slows down and depresses your active functions, making the brain slower and more sedate and, given enough time and reinforcements, can accelerate the process until you pass out, or in very extreme cases, forget to breathe. But at the same time, ethanol also jacks up the release of dopamine, exciting the part of the brain that perceives reward. Your brain tells you this reward is related to the ethanol you consumed, so you consume more, depressing your brain function while increasing your sense of euphoria. Loss of motor function, memory loss, nausea and so on often only kick in at high blood alcohol concentrations. The vast majority of drinking is more moderate, and here, perceptions of tipsiness are not as straightforward as simple brain chemistry. From the 1970s onwards, psychologist Alan Marlatt developed a series of experiments where the taste of a placebo was indistinguishable from that of an alcoholic drink. He gave the placebo to half the subjects and alcohol to the other half. But then he cut the group in half the other way too, telling half they were drinking alcohol and half they were not. So, you had people expecting alcohol and getting it, people expecting alcohol and not getting it, and vice versa with those not expecting alcohol. Consistently, those who believed they were drinking alcohol – whether they actually were or not – showed signs of intoxication including flushed faces, more animated behaviour and slurring of speech. Those who thought they were not drinking alcohol – even alcoholics, in some of the experiments – did not. Marlatt also showed that the perceived effects of intoxication were far more pronounced in social situations than when subjects were drinking alone. Why does alcohol make us drunk? When you look at the history of our relationship with it in light of Marlatt’s research, the smart-ass, know-it-all-on-the-bar-stool answer has to be: “Because we want it to.” • Pete Brown is the author of several books on beer and pubs.

With all but the most essential traffic banished, there are no revving engines or honking horns, no metallic snarl of motorbikes or the roar of people trying make themselves heard above the din – none of the usual soundtrack of a Spanish city. What you hear in the street instead are the tweeting of birds in the camellias, the tinkle of coffee spoons and the sound of human voices. Teachers herd crocodiles of small children across town without the constant fear that one of them will stray into traffic. “Listen,” says the mayor, opening the windows of his office. From the street below rises the sound of human voices. “Before I became mayor 14,000 cars passed along this street every day. More cars passed through the city in a day than there are people living here.” Miguel Anxo Fernández Lores has been mayor of the Galician city since 1999. His philosophy is simple: owning a car doesn’t give you the right to occupy the public space. “How can it be that the elderly or children aren’t able to use the street because of cars?” asks César Mosquera, the city’s head of infrastructures. “How can it be that private property – the car – occupies the public space?” Lores became mayor after 12 years in opposition, and within a month had pedestrianised all 300,000 sq m of the medieval centre, paving the streets with granite flagstones. “The historical centre was dead,” he says. “There were a lot of drugs, it was full of cars – it was a marginal zone. It was a city in decline, polluted, and there were a lot of traffic accidents. It was stagnant. Most people who had a chance to leave did so. At first we thought of improving traffic conditions but couldn’t come up with a workable plan. Instead we decided to take back the public space for the residents and to do this we decided to get rid of cars.” They stopped cars crossing the city and got rid of street parking, as people looking for a place to park is what causes the most congestion. They closed all surface car parks in the city centre and opened underground ones and others on the periphery, with 1,686 free places. They got rid of traffic lights in favour of roundabouts, extended the car-free zone from the old city to the 18th-century area, and used traffic calming in the outer zones to bring the speed limit down to 30km/h. The benefits are numerous. On the same streets where 30 people died in traffic accidents from 1996 to 2006, only three died in the subsequent 10 years, and none since 2009. CO2 emissions are down 70%, nearly three-quarters of what were car journeys are now made on foot or by bicycle, and, while other towns in the region are shrinking, central Pontevedra has gained 12,000 new inhabitants. Also, withholding planning permission for big shopping centres has meant that small businesses – which elsewhere have been unable to withstand Spain’s prolonged economic crisis – have managed to stay afloat. Lores, a member of the leftwing Galician Nationalist Bloc, is a rarity in the solidly conservative northwestern region. Pontevedra, population 80,000, is the birthplace of Mariano Rajoy, the former Spanish prime minister and leader of the rightwing People’s party. However, the mayor says Rajoy has never shown any interest in an urban scheme that has earned his native city numerous awards. Naturally, it hasn’t all gone off without a hitch. People don’t like being told they can’t drive wherever they want, but Lores says that while people claim it as a right, in fact what they want are privileges. “If someone wants to get married in the car-free zone, the bride and groom can come in a car, but everyone else walks,” he says. “Same with funerals.” The main grumble is that the scheme has led to congestion on the periphery of the zone and that there aren’t enough parking spaces. “The city is the perfect size for pedestrianisation,” says local architect Rogelio Carballo Soler. “You can cross the entire city in 25 minutes. There are things you could criticise, but there’s nothing that would make you reject this model.” Later, at a children’s birthday party, a group of parents discuss the pros and cons of the car-free city. “The problem is first thing in the morning in the few streets where cars are permitted there are traffic jams,” says Ramiro Armesto. “There’s no public transport from the peripheral car parks into the centre. On the other hand, I’ve lived in Valencia and Toledo but I’ve never lived in a city as easy to live in as this one.” Raquel García says: “I’ve lived in Madrid and many other places and for me this is paradise. Even if it’s raining, I walk everywhere. And the same shopkeepers who complain are the ones who have survived in spite of the crisis. It’s also a great place to have kids.” “What’s needed is more areas where you can park for five minutes so that you can take the kids to school when it’s raining,” says Víctor Prieto. “Here, if it’s raining – and it rains a lot – people get in their car to buy bread. They do it less now. I hardly use my car at all now.” The works were all financed locally and received no aid from regional or central government. “In effect, these are everyday public works that have been carried out in the context of a global project, but they cost the same or even less,” says Lores. “We’ve haven’t undertaken grand projects. We’ve done what was within our grasp.” We’re eager to hear your thoughts and experiences of walking in cities.

The song’s lyrics reference Ora’s bisexuality, saying, “I’m 50-50 and I’m never going to hide it,” before going into a chorus that rebuffs a man’s advances, reading: “Red wine, I just want to kiss girls.” A line from Cardi B reads: “I could be your lipstick just for one night.” Pop star Hayley Kiyoko wrote on Twitter that Girls did “more harm than good for the LGBTQ+ community. A song like this just fuels the male gaze while marginalising the idea of women loving women ... I don’t need to drink wine to kiss girls; I’ve loved women my entire life.” She added that the song “belittles and invalidates the very pure feelings of an entire community”. R&amp;B singer Kehlani, who recently defined herself as queer on Twitter, wrote that “there were many awkward slurs, quotes ...

Ahead of the subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, Rees-Mogg, who heads the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs, said he was not minded to take a more conciliatory position. “If we were to do so it would completely undermine the heart of why we voted to leave, rendering our almost-reclaimed sovereignty a myth,” he said. He repeated calls for Britain to walk away from the negotiations if the options May gave the European commission were rejected. “The UK will simply have to leave with no deal because the referendum result must be upheld,” he said. “Democracy is the backbone of established political societies, it fosters stability and fairness and cannot be treated so disdainfully.” Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Rees-Mogg said May “ought not to take Brussels too seriously about the Irish question” when seeking a customs deal. “The commission hides behind faux concern for the Irish border undermining the single market ... We will not impose a border. If there is a deal to be done about the border it will be precisely that: a deal. Nonetheless, if one side keeps refusing to bargain, no deal will be struck.” The intervention came after May held private meetings with dozens of Conservative backbench MPs to try to explain the two options for customs arrangements with the EU. She and Rees-Mogg are reported to have clashed over the consequences for the Irish border during their meeting. The inner Brexit cabinet meets again on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the two rival plans. May still faces having to deal with a significant split among ministers over whether to back a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, or opt for the “max fac” model, which would use technology to police the border. Conservative MPs were invited to five separate sessions at the Department for Exiting the European Union, where May made introductory remarks and took questions. Her chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, then gave a “neutral, technical” presentation of both options, with MPs given the chance to press him further on the detail afterwards. A Brexiter source said the presentation had been “neutral to the point of being incoherent”. David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said the cabinet would “test proposals to destruction” and denied the arguments were coming too late in the process. “We’ve been very focused on other aspects of Brexit, agreeing the withdrawal agreement, the implementation period. The EU themselves set a timescale to discuss these issues and it’s right that we’re focusing on it now,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We are focusing on it in a way that ensures that we get it right, that we test proposals to destruction.” Asked if that phrasing meant he agreed with Boris Johnson’s assessment that the customs partnership was “crazy”, Mundell said: “I agree with cabinet collective responsibility, we’ll look in detail at proposals that have been worked through by the sub-committees.” Before the full Brexit subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, May also faced pressure from the former John Lewis boss Andy Street, who won the West Midlands mayoralty in a surprise win over Labour last year. Street, a Tory remainer, said his region’s car industry was facing an uncertain future without a comprehensive customs deal. His remarks echo those made last week by the business secretary, Greg Clark, who favours the customs partnership option. “As the cabinet examines the different systems for administering customs after Brexit, it must ensure that whatever the final arrangements are, they sustain the manufacturing renaissance we have seen in the West Midlands,” Street wrote in the Times. He said technology would be “part of the solution” but said trade flow was crucial. “If the technology doesn’t work for car parts at Dover or Felixstowe, if there are big delays, new checks or burdensome processes to claim back customs paid, costs will go up and companies will struggle,” he said. “If we get this wrong, we will see the unintended destruction of thousands of jobs in the automotive industry in the West Midlands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/palestinians-to-bury-58-people-killed-in-us-embassy-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T11:30:00Z","webTitle":"Global protests grow after Israeli killing of Palestinian demonstrators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/palestinians-to-bury-58-people-killed-in-us-embassy-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/palestinians-to-bury-58-people-killed-in-us-embassy-protests","fields":{"headline":"Global protests grow after Israeli killing of Palestinian demonstrators","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"International condemnation of Israel’s killing of 60 Palestinian protesters in Gaza has escalated as tens of thousands of people rallied in the coastal enclave to bury the dead. The killings took place on Monday during demonstrations at the Gaza border fence, which coincided with a high-profile ceremony to mark the transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which overturned decades of US foreign policy. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, was among those who spoke out strongly on Tuesday. A spokesman said she was “deeply troubled” by Israel’s use of live fire and “the scale of the violence”. On Tuesday Palestinians marked the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, commemorating the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Senior UN officials condemned the recent killings as an “outrageous human rights violation” and said it appeared that anyone approaching the Gaza border fence was liable to be killed by Israeli soldiers. Ireland summoned Israel’s ambassador to protest against the fatalities. Russia and China also expressed their concern over the killings. But any prospect of the US allowing an investigation under the aegis of the Security Council seemed remote after the American ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, threw Washington’s weight behind Israel, saying no country would show the “restraint” that Israel had. Most of the Gazans who died on Monday were shot by Israeli snipers, Gaza’s health ministry said. According to the Hamas-run ministry, the dead included eight children under the age of 16. At least 2,400 people were wounded. Summing up the concern of many, Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN high commissioner for human rights, said in Geneva: “The mere fact of approaching a fence is not a lethal, life-threatening act, so that does not warrant being shot. It seems that anyone is liable to be shot dead.” He stressed that international laws that applied to Israel made clear that “lethal force may only be used as a measure of last, not first, resort.” In an apparent dismissal of Israel’s justification for the high casualty levels, Colville said: “It is not acceptable to say that ‘this is Hamas and therefore this is OK.” Israel has accused Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, of being behind the protests and said it was merely defending its territory. The UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, said: “Those responsible for outrageous human rights violations must be held to account.” The World Health Organisation also intervened, saying the scale of the injuries was threatening to overwhelm Gaza’s already beleaguered health system. Citing figures from the Gazan health ministry and a group of aid agencies, a WHO official, Mahmoud Daher, told the Associated Press that 2,771 people were wounded during Monday’s unrest. Of those, 1,360 were wounded by live fire, 400 by shrapnel and 980 were suffering from gas inhalation. He said the majority of those wounded by live fire were struck in their lower limbs. As the burials of the dead got under way on Tuesday, a senior Hamas official, Khalil al-Hayya, vowed that the protests in Gaza would continue, while on the West Bank the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, declared a general strike on Tuesday after accusing Israel of “massacres”. The scenes of lethal violence on Monday were placed side by side on the front pages of many of the world’s newspapers with images from the glossy inauguration of Washington’s new mission about 60 miles away in an affluent Jerusalem neighbourhood. Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, celebrated the opening to clapping and cheering from American and Israeli VIPs. Critics of the embassy move, which the US president hailed as a “great day” for Israel, said the optics of Monday’s embassy opening and the Gaza deaths would damage Washington’s stature as a mediator between those parties and could have unpredictable consequences. “Traditionally, we’ve tried to play a role of fireman in the Middle East. Now we’re playing the role of arsonist,” said Ilan Goldenberg, a former state department and Pentagon official who runs the Middle East program at the Center for a New American Security. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, joined the US in blaming Hamas for the deaths at the border. He defended his country’s use of force, saying: “Every country has the obligation to defend its borders.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he condemned “the violence of the Israeli armed forces against protesters” in a telephone call withAbbas and Jordan’s King Abdullah II. He reaffirmed his criticism of the US decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem. Anger at Trump’s December declaration on the embassy helped to ignite the six-week protest movement. To international condemnation, Israeli snipers have regularly fired on demonstrators during past rallies. Trump’s decision to move the embassy and to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel dismayed Palestinians, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. The holy city has been one of the most contentious issues in past negotiations, and broad international consensus has been that its status will be settled under a peace deal, although Trump has said Jerusalem is now “off the table”. Many Israelis have praised the decision to move the diplomatic mission. The Friends of Zion Museum has put up posters in Jerusalem saying: “Make Israel Great Again”, and US flags have been hung from buildings in the city."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/26/is-motherhood-the-unfinished-work-of-feminism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T10:00:53Z","webTitle":"Is motherhood the unfinished work of feminism? | Amy Westervelt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/is-motherhood-the-unfinished-work-of-feminism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/is-motherhood-the-unfinished-work-of-feminism","fields":{"headline":"Is motherhood the unfinished work of feminism?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The topic of motherhood is having a bit of a moment. In addition to several much-discussed books, the past six weeks alone have brought us Sheila Heti’s Motherhood, which explores the will-I-won’t-I decision all women face at some point or another; Angela Garbes’s Like a Mother, a feminist exploration of the science and culture of pregnancy; and Meaghan O’Connell’s memoir And Now We Have Everything, which gives the warts-and-all treatment to pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood. In recent months motherhood has cropped up across various media, including film (Mother! and Tully), TV (The Letdown), and comedy (Ali Wong and Laurie Kilmartin). Most surprising to me, as someone told by women’s magazine editors for years “we don’t cover motherhood”, is the fact that publications like Elle and Marie Claire appear to have lifted their long-standing ban on motherhood. Apparently, it is finally OK to talk about one of the possible outcomes of all that great sex women’s mags have been promising us for years. Elle magazine published a scathing commentary on the economics of, in particular, single motherhood by Bryce Covert last year and just this month a critique from Sady Doyle on depictions of motherhood in modern media, pegged to the release of The Letdown on Netflix. Marie Claire began publishing on the subject more than once every three years or so last year as well. In coverage of Heti’s book, we’re even seeing a long overdue discussion of the impact our culture’s notions of motherhood, and valuing of women according to their reproductive capability, has on women whether they opt to have children or not. It may surprise you to learn, then, that discussion of motherhood in feminist theory is, once again, verboten. Feminism and motherhood have a complicated relationship. Radical feminist Shulamith Firestone articulated this most starkly in her argument that women would never truly be free of patriarchy until they were freed from the yoke of reproduction. She imagined wistfully a day when babies could be created in mechanical uteruses, freeing women from the physical subjugation of childbirth. In contrast, Adrienne Rich argued that it was the patriarchal notion of motherhood, not the actual experience of mothering, that was the source of women’s oppression. Meanwhile womanists saw in this interpretation of motherhood yet another way in which white feminists were ignoring their experiences, oblivious to the history of eugenics and forced sterilization that played into how women of color viewed reproduction. While white feminists often painted motherhood as the ultimate apparatus of patriarchy, many activist women of color saw in motherhood not only freedom but also agency. After a decade or so of inclusion in academic feminism, thanks to the likes of Rich, Patricia Hill Collins, Sarah Ruddick, Miriam Johnson, Alice Walker, and others I’m sure commenters will chastise me for forgetting, motherhood has once again become a bogeyman for feminists. The topic comes up in fewer than 3% of papers, journal articles, or textbooks on modern gender theory. Discussing it marks one as a “gender essentialist” in academia, a label that can end one’s academic career before it even begins. Andrea O’Reilly, the theorist who birthed “matricentric feminism” as a field of study, argues both can be true: “the idea that gender is a social construct – that women are not ‘naturals’ when it comes to mothering simply because of their biological sex– and the idea that mothering matters”. What some theorists forget, of course, is that ideas and expectations around mothering impact all women, whether they have children or not. Those who are not mothers are not only asked about this decision regularly, but also often bear a largely unseen burden as part of the country’s general lack of support for working mothers. While working mothers are being stretched thin and asked to be all things to all people, women without children are quietly covering their maternity leaves or working unpaid overtime, expected to work evenings and weekends because they don’t have kids to go home to after all. These are issues that, left unexplored, create resentment. The complexities of integrating motherhood into women’s identities do not go away simply because feminist theorists will it so. Rather, they pop up in cultural expressions that, while often moving, funny, or informative, tend to lack the sort of research and historical context we’d find in academic explorations of the topic. Despite all of the advances made in the past 50 years or so for women’s rights and the culture’s general valuing of women (and there’s still plenty of work to do there, don’t get me wrong), motherhood is a still a sort of time machine, shooting women instantly back to 1950. In the same way that we need both cultural shift and policy changes to really improve and update American motherhood, we need both media and academic research on the subject. It may well be time for motherhood to have, as O’Reilly has put it, “a feminism of its own”.

The RBA’s subsidiary, Note Printing Australia is facing industrial action from its workers at the money printing facility after the workers rejected an offer of pay rises of 2% a year. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The workers voted overwhelmingly to take protected industrial action in pursuit of a better deal. The workers want Note Printing to give them at least 3.5%. In June last year, Lowe began a campaign to urge workers to seek higher higher wages, saying that in the current climate of low unemployment they should not be afraid to ask for a greater share of the economy’s profits. Economists are warning that sustained low wages growth is threatening to stall the nation’s economic growth. In February, Lowe told a House of Representatives committee he wanted to keep interest rates low in order to reduce unemployment and lift wages. He told the committee he was concerned that annual wage growth near 2% was becoming seen as the new norm. He said a 2.5% inflation rate was consistent with a 3.5% lift in wages. Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union (AMWU) print assistant secretary Tony Piccolo said the RBA was being revealed as a “hypocrite” for denying Note Printing Australia workers fair pay rises while calling for pay rises to boost the economy. “RBA boss Phillip Lowe called on business to lift wages to boost household incomes and keep the economy on track, yet he won’t deliver this for his own workforce,” said Piccolo. “Dr Lowe told Parliament in February that he wanted to see 3.5% wage rises across the country. Then why is he refusing to acknowledge the hard work of his own workers with a 3.5% pay rise – rather than the 2% he’s offering, which is barely above inflation?” he said. Electrical Trades Union (ETU) Victoria secretary Troy Gray said, “We support Dr Lowe’s calls for wage rises. But he needs to get his own house in order before he next approaches the pulpit. “If even the people who literally print money won’t treat their workers with respect and fairness, then clearly we have to change the rules so workers can get the pay rises we deserve. Even the Reserve Bank won’t give workers a pay rise willingly.” The unions want the RBA to sit down and negotiate a fair pay rise. The RBA declined to comment. In 2017 the RBA negotiated a new three-year workplace agreement with its bank staff which provides for a performance-based salary increase distributed from a pool equivalent to 2% of salaries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-essential-report-15-may-results","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T01:38:20Z","webTitle":"The Guardian Essential report, 15 May results","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-essential-report-15-may-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-essential-report-15-may-results","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian Essential report, 15 May results","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/15/ffa-denies-tim-cahill-included-in-world-cup-squad-for-commercial-reasons","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T01:14:46Z","webTitle":"FFA denies Tim Cahill included in World Cup squad for commercial reasons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/15/ffa-denies-tim-cahill-included-in-world-cup-squad-for-commercial-reasons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/15/ffa-denies-tim-cahill-included-in-world-cup-squad-for-commercial-reasons","fields":{"headline":"FFA denies Tim Cahill included in World Cup squad for commercial reasons","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Football Federation Australia has been forced to deny the selection of Tim Cahill in Australia’s latest World Cup squad is linked to a commercial partnership after the striker was revealed as the main focus of a marketing campaign for the Socceroos’ main sponsor, Caltex, a day before coach Bert van Marwijk confirmed a list of 26 players still in contention to go to Russia. Cahill, 38, has retained a chance of appearing – and scoring – at a fourth consecutive World Cup after Van Marwijk confirmed on Tuesday the group who he will take to Turkey for a pre-tournament training camp. That list will be further trimmed by three players before the squad head to Russia in readiness for their opening game against France on 16 June. Despite his status as the Socceroos’ all-time leading goalscorer, Cahill was not considered a shoo-in considering his lack of game time and goals since leaving the A-League and Melbourne City before landing at English Championship side Millwall. Since re-signing for his former club, Cahill played fewer than 100 minutes in 10 substitute appearances – without scoring. Yet Van Marwijk confirmed Cahill was still in his plans a day after Caltex – the fuel company and main naming-rights sponsor of the Socceroos – unveiled a new marketing campaign in honour of the veteran striker. In a mocked-up image of one of the company’s petrol stations, Cahill’s face appears large on the main price billboard, the roof and one of the petrol pumps. The station has also been renamed “Cahilltex”. Five stores around Australia will take part in the promotion. When asked if FFA had given any directions to Van Marwijk over players’ selection for commercial purposes, chief executive David Gallop was firm. “Absolutely not,” he said at Sydney’s North Ryde Caltex station, one of the sites to undergo the makeover. “Have a look at Tim Cahill’s track record,” Gallop said. “He’s a guy who has produced for the Socceroos and Australia so many times. He’s going to Turkey, he’s got a few weeks of intense training and he’ll be right up there [for final selection].” Should he make the final cut, Cahill is likely to play a bench role only, but as a player who can make in instant impact with his eye for goal, he retains value to the team. In more intangible terms, his experience and ability to mentor younger players also contribute to the case for his inclusion. “Representing my country is the biggest honour I could ever have as a footballer and I’m so happy to make the 26 for the camp in Turkey pre WC2018,” Cahill wrote on Twitter. “I can’t wait to head over, join the rest of the squad and get to work. I’ll be giving it everything to make the final squad for Russia.” Other players appear on individual pumps in the mock-up, including captain Mile Jedinak, defender Trent Sainsbury and midfielder Massimo Luongo. Tomi Juric, who is ahead of Cahill in Van Marwijk’s pecking order and expected to lead the line for the Socceroos at the tournament in Russia, also features. It is not the first time Cahill has had an inanimate object named after him – in 2013, Sydney’s Cahill Expressway was renamed the Tim Cahill Expressway for 48 hours. The latest gimmick will stay in place throughout May and June, suggesting Cahill’s place in the final squad of 23 is secure. The Socceroos’ group stage campaign plays out during the month of June. In-form striker Jamie Maclaren, who scored a hat-trick for Hibernian at the weekend to take his total to eight goals in his last 13 matches, was cut from the squad, which was reduced from 32 to 26 with Tuesday’s announcement. It leaves the Socceroos short of options up front, with just Juric, Cahill and inexperienced late-bloomer Andrew Nabbout selected as strikers. Social media response to the squad and the latest gimmick was swift – and for the large part scathing. “This is actually the worst thing I have ever seen. What an absolute farce,” wrote one, while another said: “Wow I just woke up but you already ruined my day.” In addition to the re-named service stations, Caltex also unveiled an exclusive 2018 Socceroos branded onesie, modelled by Cahill. “Set to be the comfiest piece of kit to wear while watching football this winter, the Fansie is the must-have item for Caltex Socceroos fans and sporting fans alike this year,” the official Socceroos website claimed.

If the idea of bunting and taffeta and incongruous hats gives you the heebie-jeebies (not to mention speculation about where and when two people none of us have met will share their first public post-wedding pash), here are some alternative ways to spend your Saturday. Victoria Have a few new pints This is the final weekend of Good Beer Week, an industry showcase for brewers and a celebration of the joy that comes from making your way to the bottom of a pint glass. Whether you’re into fruity pale ale or dark and stormy stout, scraping together loose change or willing to splurge, there are stacks of events in Melbourne and around regional Victoria on Saturday. Pair your pint with a meal, a gig, karaoke, bingo, a barbie. You could even raise a glass to the royal couple ... if you insist. See some experimental art Next Wave Festival, the Melbourne-based homage to experimental and boundary-pushing art, is also coming to a close this Sunday, so this weekend is your last opportunity to catch a bunch of shows. Experience the moody electronics of Marcus Whale and the hard beats of Jikuroux against Athena Thebus’ exhibition, Deep Water Dream Girl, at Testing Grounds. Talk to a chatbot about your climate fears at Bureau of Meteoranxiety. Or head along to one of several installations and gallery spaces across the city. New South Wales Laugh your way through the weekend If you haven’t yet caught up with your favourite comics yet this year, now’s your chance. Hang out with Get Krack!n’s fashion expert and sarong-hoarder, Helen Bidou, or wunderkid Demi Lardner, or sing along to a musical about Pauline Hanson. While we can’t promise that Harry and Meghan won’t find their way into some sets, at least you’ll be able to say you got a giggle out of it. Dive into a giant ball pit for grown-ups You read that right. One of the most popular events at least year’s Sydney festival was the giant ball pit beach designed by US collaborative design practice Snarkitecture. Whatever you think “collaborative design practice” means, the important thing is that the ball pit is back, this time at Bondi Junction, and it’s running late into the night on Saturday with a cocktail bar on-site. If you’re keen, book ahead. See some award-winning photography Head On is an internationally recognised photo festival that has been running since 2010. Its headquarters are set up at Paddington Town Hall, with exhibitions, artist talks, screenings and more taking place until 20 May. But that’s not the only place to find the stunning photography that’s part of the show: there are exhibitions across Sydney, including at Parliament House, the State Library of NSW, the Botanic Gardens and more. Take in some brand new Australian theatre Playwright Nakkiah Lui’s women defy conventional stereotypes about black women, says Nayuka Gorrie. “Lui’s women have agency. Lui’s women have sex. Lui’s women are political,” she writes for Guardian Australia. “Every time Nakkiah Lui produces something new, she stretches the limits of what is possible for the rest of us.” You can catch Lui’s newest work, Blackie Blackie Brown: The Traditional Owner of Death at Sydney Theatre Company’s Wharf Theatres this week (and every week until 30 June). Over in Surry Hills at Belvoir is The Sugar House, written by Alana Valentine and directed by Sarah Goodes, starring Kris McQuade, Sacha Horler, Sheridan Harbridge and more familiar faces from the Australian stage. Belvoir calls it “a story of how Australia went from working class to middle class”, so if you’re intent on avoiding the ostentatious fripperies of the ruling class, this could be just the ticket. Queensland Queer your Saturday Surround yourself with people who defy tradition: all through May, Brisbane Powerhouse is hosting a series of queer-focused performances, panels, exhibitions and gatherings focused on celebrating and interrogating the many manifestations of LGBT+ culture. This Saturday’s offerings include a panel on growing up queer featuring Benjamin Law, a cabaret show based on the music of Mariah Carey, and a queer trivia night. Eat honey puffs, be happy If you’re more interested in feeding the body rather than the mind, head along to Panyiri. Musgrave Park in South Brisbane plays host to the annual Greek festival, which includes more than 30 food stalls, cooking demos and more. There’s entertainment too, stretching over the whole weekend: everything from traditional dancing to plate-smashing to olive and honey-puff eating competitions. Mmm, honey puffs. Gawk at marzipan masterpieces For the really serious MasterChef wannabes – and pretty much anyone with a sweet tooth – the Australian Cake Artists and Decorators Association’s annual International Cake Show is taking over the Brisbane Showgrounds. Less about edibles than art, the event includes free demonstrations, hands-on workshops – including for children – and a huge array of stalls aimed at everyone from the enthusiastic novice to experienced pro. Fair warning though: there’s an “haute couture” wedding zone, so if you’re seriously determined to avoid anything related to nuptials, royal or otherwise, steer clear. Western Australia Get on to the new gender agenda When Taylor Mac’s play was staged at Belvoir last year, Guardian reviewer Kate Hennessy wrote: “Hir – pronounced “here”, the preferred gender pronoun of the play’s protagonist Max – reminds us of theatre’s potential: to be a brilliant conduit that makes ideas alive and accessible. Hir doesn’t merely explore themes of gender fluidity, queer theory and the subversion of toxic masculinity, because that would be dull. It lightens the weight of concepts that many find foreign or fraught, places them in a family setting and detonates them. Shrapnel flies everywhere.” Black Swan’s production is directed by Zoe Pepper, and features Will O’Mahony, Jack Palit, Igor Sas, and Toni Scanlan. Northern Territory Dance in the dry season Bass in the Grass is to Darwin as the Big Day Out was to Sydney and Melbourne. Celebrate the clouds clearing with the sounds of indie duo Client Liaison, hip-hop powerhouse Illy, electropop singer-songwriter Vera Blue, Australian rock mainstay Paul Kelly and more. Bass in the Grass takes over the George Brown Botanic Gardens from 11am till late. Tasmania Catch a world-class local film “BOFA” stands for “Breath of Fresh Air” and the so-named film festival is on this weekend in Launceston. Saturday includes screenings of That’s Not Me (which Guardian Australia reviewer Luke Buckmaster gave four stars), the highly acclaimed documentaries Mountain (also got four stars) and The Namatjira Project, and a 30-year encore of 1988’s The Tale of Ruby Rose. South Australia Take a wine-inspired wander South Australia is known for its wine regions, and this instalment of the Urban Wine Walk will take you meandering through bars and pubs in Adelaide’s west to sample a huge range of local wine. It’s self-guided so you can take your time or power through at will. You can also match your wine to food options at each locale. Find a new favourite hangout, a new favourite tipple, or just use it as an excuse to spend an afternoon with your mates. On the box If you were one of the millions of people who watched – and were stunned by – the film clip for Childish Gambino aka Donald Glover’s This is America, you can stream both seasons of Glover’s TV series, Atlanta, right now on SBS On Demand. It’s not hard to be fascinated by the man who makes music, writes, performs as a comic, acts in and directs television, DJs, and has so many etceteras to his talents it’s hardly worth listing them. Guardian called the black comedy “the best show on TV”, so if you’re up for a night in, put Atlanta at the top of your binge list. • What are you doing this weekend if you’re not watching the royal wedding?

The Greens MP Lidia Thorpe, a Gunnai-Gunditjmara woman who was elected with a swing of more than 11% last year, has drafted nine amendments, beginning with editing the preamble of the bill to force the state to acknowledge that Aboriginal sovereignty was never ceded, and including the replacement of all mentions of “Aboriginal Victorians” with “sovereign clans”. •Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The legislation, due to be debated on Tuesday, raises many of the practical implications of a treaty process forestalled when the federal government rejected the key elements of the Uluru Statement in October. Thorpe said the Greens did not intend to block the bill but given the choice between what she saw as a flawed piece of legislation and no legislation at all, she would “probably” choose the latter. Victoria’s peak body for traditional owner corporations has warned that if the Greens do not support the legislation in its current form, the treaty process – which began at a historic meeting in 2016 and has involved 7,000 people being consulted at forums around the state – could be abandoned. Victoria offers the best chance of negotiating a treaty, after the federal government’s negative response to the Uluru Statement and now that treaty negotiations in South Australia have been put on indefinite hold since the Liberals regained power at the March election. The Andrews government has pushed to enshrine the treaty process in legislation before the November state election. The Coalition is unlikely to support the process if there is a change of government. “We have serious concerns that if this bill does not get through in its current form and it’s not supported by the Greens that treaty could probably be over for Aboriginal Victorians,” the Federation of Victorian Traditional Owner Corporations (FVTOC) chief executive, Marcus Stewart, said. Thorpe said that was a risk she was prepared to take. “Do we want a flawed treaty process that’s set up for failure, or do we want to take a risk and hope that it comes up again?” she told Guardian Australia. “We are a patient people, it’s taken us 200 years to get this far.” The legislation, titled the Advancing the treaty process with Aboriginal Victorians bill 2018, commits the government to working with a yet-to-be-established Aboriginal representative body, to be elected by and from Aboriginal people living in Victoria. Treaty commissioner Jill Gallagher has described the representative body as effectively a prototype for the Indigenous voice model proposed in the Uluru statement, which was the key proposal rejected by the Turnbull government. Once established, Gallagher said, it would provide a working model to debunk Malcolm Turnbull’s concerns that such a body would be undemocratic or incapable of getting public support. The representative body would set the framework for negotiating a treaty and administer an $8m self-determination fund, but would not itself be empowered to negotiate treaties. That would be done between the group seeking to make a treaty – be they an Aboriginal clan, nation, regional or statewide group – and the Victorian government. It is not expected to begin for several years. There are no restrictions in the legislation about what a treaty or treaties might look like or whether they might be struck between the state and individual clans, or larger groups. Stewart said it was too early in the process to restrict who might participate in treaty negotiations or dictate what a treaty might look like, and argued that the Greens amendments did just that. He said the Greens’ model had also not been subject to wide consultation and proposed a framework that was “not universally supported”. The question of what is universally supported, and which group speaks for the majority of Aboriginal Victorians, is unlikely to be resolved until the representative body is in place, and will ultimately depend on how the body is selected. Determining who can be said to speak for Aboriginal people is a central tension of the debate. In a letter to the Victorian Greens this week, FVTOC wrote: “We wish to make clear that the Victorian Greens do not have a mandate from Aboriginal Victorians, and that what you risk is jeopardising perhaps the greatest opportunity for real self-determination we will see in our lifetimes.” Amendments put forward by the Greens would limit participation in the rest of the process going forward to “sovereign clans” and would also require that a council of 76 elders, one man and one woman from each of the state’s 38 language groups, be established to oversee the formation of the representative body. The participation of Aboriginal Victorians who do not identify as a member of a clan, such as members of the stolen generation, would have to be “worked through,” Thorpe said. An amendment calling for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to be inserted as the guiding principle in the act is likely to be supported. The amendments were endorsed at a meeting of the newly formed Clan Elders Council at parliament on Monday. It was the first meeting of the group and partially funded by FVTOC. The Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation also voiced support for the principles underpinning the amendments and called for the bill to be delayed. The Aboriginal affairs minister, Natalie Hutchins, said she would discuss the Greens amendments with the minor party “in due course”. “We’re considering the advice received from the treaty working group and looking forward to the debate for the historic legislation in the parliament,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/15/every-child-has-the-right-to-be-safe-will-you-speak-up-with-me","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T04:12:01Z","webTitle":"Every child has the right to be safe.

But I see a near future where change can bring positive outcomes to our nation. I play a small role at SNAICC – National Voice for our Children, the national advocacy body fighting for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. I say only small because there are plenty of stronger and louder voices in the national conversation speaking up about the changes that need to happen for our people. So I will only speak for myself and the changes that I dream of. Upon the delivery of the federal budget last week, it is clear that change for our people is not a priority for the federal government – but the government of the day has never scared me into thinking change is impossible. I, in tune with how I was raised by my family in Naarm, believe that real change happens from within community, by community and for community. My mum, Sharon Slater, and my dad, Mel Burns, have lived and worked in the Melbourne Aboriginal community for decades. As I grew up, it was a normal part of life to be at work with them. My parents were foster carers, youth workers, basketball coaches, community drivers, fundraisers, and health workers – and completed their own admin at the end of the day. I am proud to follow in their footsteps. All I’ve ever known is my community from within. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday SNAICC has been part of my life since early childhood, as Mum worked in administration and bookkeeping. Family was always centre at SNAICC – the best memory I have is my twin Marjorie and I mucking around with the photocopier. In the late 1980s, following the first child survival seminar held in Naarm, community leaders called for the establishment of a national peak body to represent Aboriginal child care agencies, which led to the creation of SNAICC. Despite the ongoing harsh climate of constant political change that impacts a great number of our Aboriginal community-controlled organisations, SNAICC continues to be the voice of its members and the voice for our children. For me, SNAICC’s work answers a natural calling in this journey to realise the changes that our children, families and communities deserve. Today, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are over-represented in the child protection system at a rate of more than 10 times that of other children. We are losing our children and we must speak up right now, because enough is enough. The Family Matters campaign is the coming together of organisations and individuals across the nation to reduce the over-representation of our children removed from family. Family Matters is an approach that trusts Aboriginal people to deal with Aboriginal business, one that includes genuine collaboration and partnership, empowers communities and involves long-term, all-of-government support across the country. It all comes down to trusting in the legacy of my role models, family members and past leaders who have paved the way before us. Our community knows what works best for our community, and the best way forward when it comes to reunifying the 17,664 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children living away from home with their community, heritage and culture. Community is bringing the Family Matters campaign to the doorstep of Australia. SNAICC put it simply in its recent submission to the Closing the Gap “refresh”: “We have a shared responsibility to ensure the right of every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child to be safe and thrive in family, community and culture.” Now is the time for healing and restoration through connecting with other dreamers and change-makers to move forward together. Will you walk with me? Will you speak up with me? Our children are trusting us with their futures.

Turnbull admitted it was a “big step”, but said it was necessary. “You have to keep people safe,” he told Radio 3AW. “There was a couple of people that came very close to blowing up an A380, with the best part of 400 people the other day … so it is alleged.” Turnbull said he would be surprised if people left home without their identification. “You don’t have to, there is no law that requires you do, but it is hard to think of anyone who wouldn’t have some ID and wouldn’t be able to say a bit about themselves,” he told Mitchell. “The police are being trained to observe behaviour, they pay very close attention to people who are looking anxious or creating a suspicious environment.” In the same interview, Turnbull said the recent bombings in Surabaya in Indonesia, where three families used their children to target churches and police, “potentially” put Australia under an increased risk of a terrorist attack. “We, obviously – in Indonesia they have 500, we think, around 500 people who have returned from the conflict zone,” Turnbull said. “Of course the man who used his family, killed his family, in these attacks had not come back from Syria but nonetheless it is a real challenge. “About 40-some families have come back [to Australia from Isis conflict zones]. We keep a very close eye on these things, a lot of the Australians who went to fight in the conflict zone will never come back because they have been killed and a number of them will not come back obviously because they don’t want to end up going to jail.” Turnbull said his government would not be bullied into changing Australia’s permanent migration policy. “Immigration is run solely in the national interest in Australia. It is constantly under review ... by the government,” he said. “We are constantly ensuring that we get the highest quality of migrants we can. You talk about numbers as if every person is exactly the same. This is a talent business. We are in a war for talent. “What we want to have is not one more person coming to Australia, not one, that we do not need want or need. I’m giving you this commitment – that my government and my government alone, the Australian government, elected by the Australian people determines who comes to Australia – whether they are on the humanitarian program, whether they are on family reunion, whether they are on skilled migration or a student.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/15/naplan-tests-are-vital-here-are-five-reasons-why","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T01:22:00Z","webTitle":"Naplan tests are vital: here are five reasons why | Peter Goss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/naplan-tests-are-vital-here-are-five-reasons-why","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/naplan-tests-are-vital-here-are-five-reasons-why","fields":{"headline":"Naplan tests are vital: here are five reasons why","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Students around Australia begin sitting Naplan tests on Tuesday. Amid calls for a review and one of the world’s leading education experts labelling the writing portion “the worst one of the 10 or 12 of the international tests” and “by far the most absurd and the least valid” he had seen, many are calling the future of Naplan into question. The national assessment program – literacy and numeracy has been a prominent part of Australia’s education landscape since 2008, when it was introduced by the then education minister, Julia Gillard. It’s a controversial scheme, lauded by some but disliked by many. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Ten years on some are arguing it should be dropped entirely. Here’s why it’s a vital navigation tool for policy makers and researchers. What is Naplan? Every May Australian school students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 sit standardised tests in reading, writing, numeracy, spelling and grammar. A great virtue of Naplan is that each domain is scored on a single scale. Achievement can be compared across different school year levels, courtesy of a common learning progression for all levels of the Naplan tests. This lets us analyse the learning growth of specific groups of students as they move through school. I have consistently argued that the best way to lift achievement is to maximise individual learning progress. The same theme underpins the Gonski 2.0 report. And if we want to lift learning progress at scale, we must be able to measure it. What is Naplan used for? There are many claims about the benefits of Naplan, each of which deserves scrutiny on its merits. For example, using Naplan: policy makers and researchers can better understand student performance, to inform system-wide policies, support and resource allocation for schools teachers can use the data as a diagnostic tool to improve teaching in the classroom parents can make more informed choices about where to send their children, via the My School website which publishes school-level results parents have more information about how their child is progressing relative to others. Focusing just on the first point, here are five things we know a lot more about because of Naplan. 1. Achievement gaps for Indigenous students Indigenous students don’t achieve at the same level as their non-Indigenous peers. While this has been known for decades, we would not know just how large some of these gaps are without Naplan, or how the gaps have changed over time. At a national level, year 9 Indigenous students are on average three years behind non-Indigenous students in numeracy, 3.4 years behind in reading and 4.2 years behind in writing. Indigenous students are three to four years behind by year 9 Translating Naplan scores into equivalent year levels makes it much easier to understand and compare performance across student groups. But the Indigenous gap is so large that no fancy mathematics is needed: year 9 Indigenous students scored on average 465 in Naplan writing in 2017, below the 480 non-Indigenous students scored in year 5. The gaps are even larger in very remote areas where Indigenous students are more than seven years behind in writing. 2. Progress gaps for students in disadvantaged schools Students in disadvantaged schools perform worse. Again, not news. What’s more of a surprise is that, when we tracked a cohort of Victorian students across all four of their Naplan tests, the size of the gap tripled, from one year and three months in year 3 to three years and eight months in year 9. Even more concerning was the finding when we compared students with comparable capabilities early in their schooling. From the same year 3 starting score, students in disadvantaged schools fall more than two years behind by year 9, with potentially high-achieving students missing out the most. Students with similar early potential do worse in disadvantaged schools, especially high-achieving students 3. Comparison among states The states and territories are responsible for running school education in Australia. Different states and territories take different approaches. In theory, this means jurisdictions can learn from each other. But this requires accurate comparisons that take account of socioeconomic differences. For example, parents in some states have higher levels of education than in others. On a like-for-like basis, comparable students are achieving at very different levels depending where they live in Australia. States and territories have very different levels of achievement when compared on a like-for-like basis Looking at the next level of detail makes it clear no state or territory can afford to be complacent. For example, New South Wales has the highest levels of achievement of any state for students whose parents have a university degree but its disadvantaged students make less progress than the national average. By contrast, Victoria has the highest achievement levels for students whose parents didn’t finish school but is not stretching its most advantaged students in the same way. 4. Changes over time Naplan has now been running for long enough to identify trends over time. Too often the story is one of stagnation. But there are bright spots, including the early years in Queensland. Relative to the rest of Australia, Queensland has increased its year 3 numeracy and reading scores by three to four months since 2010 It’s interesting to note that 2010 was the first Naplan cohort where Queensland students started school with a prep year. This probably accounts for some of the improvement. But it’s also notable that the relative levels of achievement have improved over time, not just in a single step, suggesting that Queensland’s education system is getting some other things right. The richness of Naplan data allows us to spot much more subtle patterns as well. For example, while very remote Indigenous students are doing very poorly in writing, there are signs of improvement in this cohort in NSW. This level of granular analysis would not be possible without the Naplan tests being done every year, by all schools. 5. Identifying high-growth schools The “holy grail” for many advocates of Naplan is to use it to identify the schools that are most effective in maximising student learning growth, and to apply lessons from those schools to others not adding as much value. This is easier said than done, not least because the socioeconomic mix in each school affects the rate of learning growth as well as the students’ achievement. New analysis, taking socioeconomic factors into account, shows that about 8% of schools have “beaten their odds” for all five cohorts for which we have reliable Naplan progress data. Given that this would only occur 3% of the time for a coin toss, we can confidently say that at least 5% of Australia’s schools are routinely outperforming. About 5% of schools are routinely doing better than we would expect given their student population mix Of course, Naplan can’t tell us why these schools are different. Maybe it’s what the schools and their teachers are doing. Maybe it’s the nature of their incoming cohort. Whatever it is, we need to know. Where to from here Naplan is an imperfect navigation tool. It certainly doesn’t have GPS-like levels of precision. But giving up on Naplan would be like 19th-century sailors dumping sextants and chronometers in favour of returning to using the stars, wind and currents to navigate. Maybe we need to rethink how Naplan is used but, overall, it should be kept. • Peter Goss is the school education program director at the Grattan Institute.

A watered-down version of the tax, which will charge the city’s largest employees $275 per worker annually, is now expected to be enacted by Seattle’s mayor, Jenny Durkan. The tax is projected to generate about $48m a year to address a housing crisis spurred on by Amazon’s rapid growth. A broader tax proposal prompted the tech company to halt construction on one Seattle office tower and put off a lease of another tower. Union construction workers marched on city call to protest the tax, which also drew opposition from business interests. Socialists and self-styled members of the “Seattle silent majority” squared off prior to Monday’s vote. Neither side supported the compromise, and most speakers blamed city leaders for an escalating homelessness crisis that has seen city sidewalks, parks and roadsides packed with tents and shacks. About 60% of the tax revenue will go to new housing projects for low and middle-income Seattle residents. The remainder would go to homeless services, including shelter beds, camps and overnight parking. On Friday, city council members approved a proposal to charge the large employers in the city $500-per-employee. Following a veto threat from Durkan, the council decreased the total charge and included a five-year sunset provision over objections of supporters of the original legislation. “Do not capitulate to [Amazon CEO Jeff] Bezos’ bullying,” Emily McArthur, an organizer with Socialist Alternative, demanded of the council. “Tax Amazon. Be leaders.” Amazon has driven Seattle’s economy in recent years, drawing thousands of well-paid workers to the region. The “Bezos Boom” has proved a mixed blessing, though, as middle-income residents have been priced out of Seattle. The city council president, Bruce Harrell, spoke to a growing “fear of what this city is becoming”. The move by Amazon to create HQ2 – a second headquarters elsewhere – has stoked fears that Seattle’s liberal politics will turn off the company. Threats from Amazon that it will halt growth in Seattle in favor of other offices lend credence to those concerns. In a statement issued Monday, Vice President Drew Herdener said the company would resume construction on the downtown tower but was considering whether Seattle is the place for it to grow. “We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council’s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here,” Herdener said. Marilyn Strickland, president and CEO of the Seattle Metro Chamber, voiced business leaders’ opposition to the tax. “Taxing jobs will not fix our region’s housing and homelessness problems,” said Strickland, who went on to praise Durkan for her role in the compromise. For her part, Durkan said the limited tax would “address our homelessness crisis without jeopardizing critical jobs.” The tax passed by a veto-proof unanimous vote. As it passed, socialists pushing for a larger tax broke out in a chant: “We’ll be back for more! We’ll be back for more!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/13/crystal-palace-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T16:18:04Z","webTitle":"Wilfried Zaha strikes as Crystal Palace brush aside West Brom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/13/crystal-palace-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/13/crystal-palace-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Wilfried Zaha strikes as Crystal Palace brush aside West Brom","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This game ended up a celebration of Roy Hodgson, with the affection bellowed by both sets of supporters. The home fans in the Holmesdale end waited until early in the second half to unfurl their banners of appreciation, with the ground then united in chorusing the former England manager’s name. He looked almost sheepish acknowledging all the adulation. West Bromwich Albion remember Hodgson fondly from his time at the Hawthorns, where he ensured survival and then consolidation over a 15-month tenure before taking up the reins of the national side. He has galvanised Palace in similar fashion, with a team who were goalless and pointless after seven matches ending the campaign outside the top half only on goal difference. The rise has been remarkable. Hodgson, Croydon-born and content in familiar surroundings, can plan progression from now. The first task will be to guard against complacency. “We mustn’t start thinking that, just because we’ve finished 11th, that’s our level,” said Hodgson. “That has only really been a product of the last three games [which were all won] otherwise it might have been us going down, and not West Brom. So we have to plan and build on this success. We need a philosophy and a clear idea of where we want this club to go.” Talks with the sporting director, Dougie Freedman, will resume this week to plan for next term, with only Damien Delaney of those players out of contract on 1 July having confirmed he will depart. There must be resolution on the futures of Yohan Cabaye, Joel Ward, Bakary Sako, Julián Speroni and Lee Chung-yong. Ruben Loftus-Cheek will return to Chelsea, leaving a void to be filled in midfield. It would take a mind-blowing offer for Wilfried Zaha for Palace to consider selling their talisman. There is no desire to sell a player who is contracted to 2022 and without whom this team did not muster a point in the 10 games he missed this season. “I understand people coveting Wilfried, but he loves playing for the club, he’s a Croydon boy and I don’t think he’s going to jump at the first opportunity,” said Hodgson. “He knows full well the last thing on anyone’s mind here is letting him go. We don’t need to sell him.” True to form, it was Zaha who eventually opened the scoring here, converting the excellent Patrick van Aanholt’s centre as West Brom struggled to reorganise after the introduction of Christian Benteke. Van Aanholt would add a second soon after, following some slick close passing in a cramped penalty area, rounding Ben Foster to score for the third game in succession. That confirmed the only defeat of Darren Moore’s caretaker stewardship of Albion, but should not detract from the impact he and his staff have made over the last six weeks. “We’ve restored pride in the football club,” said the interim manager. “We stopped the rot and offered hard work and endeavour, and even provided a bit of a feel-good factor. We’ve seen that over the final six weeks of a very difficult campaign.” Moore is a leading candidate to take up the position on a full-time basis, with West Brom hoping to confirm an appointment before the end of the week. Michael Appleton and Dean Smith have also been heavily linked."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/may/13/newsnight-should-not-have-likened-corbyn-to-lenin","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T16:56:38Z","webTitle":"Newsnight should not have likened Corbyn to Lenin | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/13/newsnight-should-not-have-likened-corbyn-to-lenin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/13/newsnight-should-not-have-likened-corbyn-to-lenin","fields":{"headline":"Newsnight should not have likened Corbyn to Lenin","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The decision by the BBC complaints unit to reject viewers’ concerns over the way Jeremy Corbyn was depicted in Newsnight’s coverage of the Salisbury poisoning of a former Russian agent and his daughter (Report, theguardian.com, 11 May) displays a startling ignorance of everything we know about the communicative power of images. Images are never innocent or neutral. They work by association, reminding us of similar images. Newsnight’s visual montage projected on the studio’s huge curved screen showed Corbyn in a Lenin-style hat with the Kremlin in saturated red in the background. The BBC’s argument that this was “intended to epitomise the story rather than to express or invite a particular attitude to it” is frankly risible. Whether intended or not, the image carried powerful reminders of Soviet leaders in similar poses reinforcing the Daily Mail’s persistent association of Corbyn’s policies with communism as state repression. For a news medium that relies so heavily on images to anchor stories, ignoring the weight of connotations they inevitably carry undermines the “sound news judgment” the BBC claims to uphold and which viewers have a right to expect.

The committee said allowing prisoners to vote went to the heart of questions about a citizen’s responsibilities and the purpose of prison to rehabilitate offenders. Its conclusions, which were resisted by two Conservative MSPs but backed by its Scottish National party, Labour and Liberal Democrat members, will be seen a challenge to the first minister’s emphasis on her party’s progressive ideals. While Alex Salmond was first minister, the SNP government repeatedly rejected calls for inmates to be allowed to vote, despite a series of European court of justice rulings that the UK’s ban on prisoners voting violated the European convention on human rights Backed by most other parties, Sturgeon opposed efforts led by Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party co-convenor, to allow inmates to vote in the 2014 independence referendum, even though referendum law allowed her government to widen the franchise to include prisoners. That decision was challenged by three prisoners who took their case to the supreme court. The judges ruled Scottish ministers could not be forced to do so because the human rights convention only covered elections, not referendums. Supporters of the move believe an expected electoral reform bill due in this parliament could be amended to introduce prisoner voting if Sturgeon’s government does not voluntarily include it. Christina McKelvie, the SNP chair of the committee, said: “We are acutely aware that prison is a place people go to be punished, and that there will be individual cases people find distasteful; but we need to think about rehabilitation, and not further excluding and alienating people from society.” The Scottish government released a non-committal response, stating: “This is a report which covers a broad and detailed range of issues. As with all parliamentary reports we will consider it carefully and provide a formal response to the committee in due course.” Scottish ministers have new powers to allow prisoners to vote in Scottish elections, but to do so would require support from two-thirds of Holyrood MSPs. UK ministers have introduced very modest reforms for UK elections, to allow only those inmates out of prison on temporary licence to vote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/13/pompeo-us-firms-invest-north-korea-kim-jong-un-security-assurances","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T19:58:25Z","webTitle":"Pompeo: US firms could invest in North Korea and Kim may get ‘security assurances’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/13/pompeo-us-firms-invest-north-korea-kim-jong-un-security-assurances","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/13/pompeo-us-firms-invest-north-korea-kim-jong-un-security-assurances","fields":{"headline":"Pompeo: US firms could invest in North Korea and Kim may get ‘security assurances’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Sunday that if North Korea agrees to fully dismantle its nuclear weapons program, the Trump administration will allow the American private sector to invest in the country. Pompeo also hinted that the US might assure Kim Jong-un he can stay in power after any deal. If a deal is reached at or after the summit meeting between Kim and Trump scheduled for Singapore on 12 June, Pompeo said on Fox News Sunday, “private sector Americans, not the US taxpayer” could “help build out the energy grid that needs enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea”. Americans could also help, he said, with investment in infrastructure and agriculture to help feed the North Korean people. Appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation, Pompeo floated the possibility of “sanctions relief”, a remark that jarred a little with a comment by Donald Trump’s national security adviser. John Bolton told CNN’s State of the Union: “I wouldn’t look for economic aid from us.” Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator, said private investment or sanctions relief for the North would “be the best money we ever spent”. Graham, a member of the Senate armed services committee, told CBS “there’d be a lot of support in Congress to give North Korea a better life. Provide aid, relieve sanctions with one condition: that you give up your nuclear weapons program in a verifiable way.” He also said “the average North Korean is about three inches shorter than … their neighbours in South Korea because of the terrible conditions in North Korea”. Studies have concluded that such a height difference does indeed exist. Pompeo met Kim last week in North Korea, for the second time, helping set the stage for the summit and securing the release of three Americans who the Pentagon said left hospital on Sunday. Asked if the US was in effect telling Kim “regime change will be off the table” if he meets American demands, Pompeo told Fox: “We will have to provide security assurances, to be sure.” Pompeo did not elaborate, but North Korea has sought assurances before. A statement issued during negotiations in 2005 said the “United States affirmed that it has no nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula and has no intention to attack or invade [North Korea] with nuclear or conventional weapons”. The North has said it needs nuclear weapons to counter a US effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government. “Make no mistake about it, America’s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into LA or Denver or to the very place we’re sitting here this morning,” Pompeo said, from Washington. “That’s our objective, that’s the end state the president has laid out and that’s the mission that he sent me on this past week, to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.” Trump hailed progress with North Korea on Twitter on Saturday, writing: “North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture!” Pompeo told Fox the North’s promise to destroy the site was “good news. Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk upon the American people that is destroyed, eliminated, dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world.” The secretary rejected suggestions that Trump’s praise of Kim and claims of success have been made too soon. “The president can have a successful outcome,” Pompeo said, “that the two of them can meet and see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people.” Pompeo was asked if in his talks with Kim he had discussed his previous exchange of insults with Trump, in which the US president coined the nickname “Little Rocket Man” for a leader who in return called him a “mentally deranged US dotard”. “We didn’t cover that,” Pompeo said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/14/st-mungos-homelessness-charity-complaint-filed-over-unlawful-removal-eu-rough-sleepers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T05:01:19Z","webTitle":"Complaint filed against charity over removal of EU rough sleepers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/st-mungos-homelessness-charity-complaint-filed-over-unlawful-removal-eu-rough-sleepers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/st-mungos-homelessness-charity-complaint-filed-over-unlawful-removal-eu-rough-sleepers","fields":{"headline":"Complaint filed against charity over removal of EU rough sleepers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Lawyers have complained to the Charity Commission about a leading homelessness charity for its work accompanying Home Office enforcement officials on patrols where some migrant rough sleepers were unlawfully arrested, detained and deported, the Guardian has learned. Many of these rough sleepers are claiming compensation from the Home Office. The Public Interest Law Unit (Pilu) has lodged a complaint with the Charity Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) about the conduct of the homeless charity St Mungo’s when it accompanied Home Office immigration, compliance and enforcement (ICE) teams on these patrols until December. The complaint focuses on how St Mungo’s handled private and sensitive data about its migrant rough sleeper clients and the impact of the charity’s role on the unlawful arrest, detention and removal of some of these rough sleepers by the Home Office. The complaint has been lodged as the scandal about the Home Office’s unlawful removal of migrant rough sleepers grows. The BBC has revealed that the government is to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds compensation to some of the migrant rough sleepers identified during such patrols. In the year to May 2017, 698 homeless EU nationals were targeted and removed from the country. Pilu made the official complaints after a successful legal challenge against the Home Office policy of rounding up and deporting migrant rough sleepers last December. The Home Office argued that rough sleeping was an abuse of EU treaty rights, even though many of those who were rough sleeping were exercising treaty rights by working. The policy was halted after the high court ruled it to be unlawful and discriminatory. An internal St Mungo’s document obtained by the Guardian, entitled Enforcement policy for EU and non-EU nationals not engaging with outreach team, states that if migrant rough sleepers did not agree to voluntarily return to their home countries within 12 weeks “then their names will be forwarded to the UKBA [United Kingdom Border Agency]”. The document adds: “These individuals’ details will be passed on to the ICE by the outreach team. Following this a joint shift will be agreed with outreach, ICE, Parks Police to target/tackle these individuals.” A freedom of information (FoI) response to Pilu from Brent council, which contracts St Mungo’s to do outreach work with rough sleepers, states that “the role of the outreach worker is to only provide information to ICE on the location of clients who do not want to engage with reconnection”. A Pilu spokesman said: “As evidence is continuing to emerge in the aftermath of the judicial review, we felt it was important to report St Mungo’s to the Information Commissioner’s Office as well as the Charity Commission. We are calling on the ICO and the Charity Commission to thoroughly investigate the extent and nature of communications and working relationships between St Mungo’s and the Home Office.” Howard Sinclair, chief executive of St Mungo’s, said: “We question the accuracy of the FoI response from Brent. We haven’t heard from the information commissioner or the Charity Commission but will respond if they contact us. “We take all complaints very seriously. Our policy is that we do not share information about individuals [with] the Home Office except when an individual has given their consent, or in situations where people are at significant risk to themselves or someone else. We think leaving a vulnerable person to die on the streets is unacceptable, which is why we work with various agencies to actively offer support to people away from the streets and on with their lives.” A Brent council spokesperson said: “Our FoI response relied on information given to us by St Mungo’s. Since submitting this information, St Mungo’s has informed us that it was in fact incorrect. They have told us that they will be giving us the correct information as soon as possible.” A Home Office spokeswoman said: “This government is determined to break the homelessness cycle. We have ceased all relevant investigation and action on the immigration status of EEA [European Economic Area] citizens because of rough sleeping. Complaints or claims for compensation will be considered on a case by case basis.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/14/big-society-safety-net-predators-vulnerable","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"When society’s safety net is shredded, the predators move in | Phil McDuff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/big-society-safety-net-predators-vulnerable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/big-society-safety-net-predators-vulnerable","fields":{"headline":"When society’s safety net is shredded, the predators move in","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It may be hard to believe, in the midst of a benefit sanctions regime that sees one in five universal credit applications turned down, and a “hostile environment” that directly led to the Windrush scandal, but most of the current Conservative government also stood at the 2010 general election with a campaign that centred on something called the “big society”. The idea was that the state, massive and overblown as it apparently was after years of Labour profligacy, was taking up too much space in people’s lives. Move the government out of the way and communities would step in to fill the gaps, giving it some of that old British blitz spirit, reinvigorating civil society along the way. As with many Tory policies, this was based on the fantasies of people whose only interaction with the realities of the private rental market was checking the yields on their property portfolios. It’s a philosophy that contains a toxic mix of soft-focus nostalgia for a time that never was, and quasi-religious moralising that sees poverty not as a scourge to be eradicated but a tool for disciplining society’s undeserving into better behaviour. Predictably, this experiment in social engineering did not reveal a hidden population of people with the time and money to spare who had just been held back by the stifling provision of basic public services. The gaps left by the slash-and-burn policies of the Cameron-era coalition were filled not by an army of cheerful local volunteers, but by predators who saw other people’s vulnerability as an opportunity for profit. As Jennifer Williams reported in the Manchester Evening News, the city’s homelessness crisis has provided a rich opportunity for unscrupulous landlords offering “temporary housing” facilities that are often neither temporary nor really housing, except in the broadest possible interpretation, with people living for years in squalid, dangerous buildings. Vulnerable people are given a stark choice – live in a rundown, dirty, unmaintained and insecure environment, or risk life on the streets. The charitable organisation Justlife estimates that there are tens of thousands of households in the UK living in unsupported temporary accommodation, over and above the official homelessness figures. As the big society gave way to the hostile environment, so too did the dangers to which migrants were exposed. In their Women Living in a Hostile Environment report, the End Violence Against Women Coalition says: “The impact of No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) conditions on migrant women who have suffered domestic abuse and are financially or otherwise dependent on their spouse or partner has been devastating.” Unable to go to the police or seek public support for fear of falling foul of the Home Office’s opaque rules and obsession with deportation targets, women find themselves dependent on and unable to leave abusive partners. From loan sharks to exploitative employers, rogue landlords to domestic abusers, rolling back basic public services has created opportunities for the unscrupulous to take advantage of those with nowhere else to turn. The big society has become the predatory society. The existence of a forgotten and neglected underclass of people is not something unique to the Conservatives’ time in office. Vulnerable people and those who prey on them are not new. The safety nets in the UK have often been badly maintained and easy to slip through, but the Tory solution has been to blame the safety net itself rather than its design, and then to work to make it even worse. The right wing will argue that this is a negative view of humanity, that they, and they alone, believe that people are noble of spirit and capable of rising above their circumstances. Rather than telling people to rely on “handouts” we should be encouraging them to pull their socks up and get on their bikes. But poverty is a social phenomenon, and public services were the tools that we built to enable people to rise above it. Being poor is exhausting and stressful, and running the gauntlet of a predatory society is a full-time job in itself. At the sharp end of a brutal and precarious society, people do not have the time or resources to perform the role of “we were poor but we were happy” peasants for the edification of privately schooled landowners looking to justify their monopolistic hoarding of the nation’s wealth. Those who find themselves in this situation are regarded as unworthy and undeserving and therefore eminently ignorable – and it’s easy to do when the people tearing up the safety nets are also writing the rules about what counts as deserving. As the late Terry Pratchett observed: “While it was regarded as pretty good evidence of criminality to be living in a slum, for some reason owning a whole street of them merely got you invited to the very best social occasions.” Tory policy can – and should – be reversed, but to truly make a difference we have to see through the bankrupt ideology that tries to reimagine letting economic predators off the leash as being socially progressive. Rather than sanctions or deportation targets, we should be setting the target that everyone should have access to a life worthy of living. There should always be an alternative to the loan shark and the slumlord, but it won’t just appear because rightwing theorists say it should. The work has to be put in to make sure everyone has somewhere to turn other than the predators in our society. If not, then what is to stop them taking advantage? • Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/20/phil-neal-leads-the-way-in-liverpools-walking-football-team","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T14:15:00Z","webTitle":"Phil Neal leads the way in Liverpool's walking football team","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/20/phil-neal-leads-the-way-in-liverpools-walking-football-team","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/20/phil-neal-leads-the-way-in-liverpools-walking-football-team","fields":{"headline":"Phil Neal leads the way in Liverpool's walking football team","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On windswept astroturf around the corner from Anfield stadium, 34 men with a combined age of well over 2,500 were being put through their paces before their weekly walking football game. “Come on lads,” says their coach, Bill Bygroves. “Get those hips going. Pretend you’re dancing with your girlfriend — or boyfriend. That’s right, Jim. On your toes. Very nice. Can you believe he’s 90? Look at him go!” On the sidelines, one of England’s most successful players of all time winced as he stretched out his calves. “I think I’ll give this bit a miss today,” says Phil Neal, as men 20 years his senior followed orders to sit down with a ball between their feet. “I was at Kenny Dalglish’s golf day yesterday so I’m a bit worn out.” When he first turned up to the walking football sessions at Anfield sports and community centre last year, the other players thought they were dreaming. Surely that wasn’t Phil Neal lining up for selection. The Phil Neal. The only player to appear in all four of Liverpool’s European Cup victories between 1977 and 1984. Only Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs have won more trophies than his 23. The unforgiveable bubble perm had long given way to a shiny bald head but it was unmistakably him, the defender they nicknamed Mr Consistency. His new team-mates weren’t starstruck for long, despite many of them standing in the Kop during Neal’s heyday. Before he had a chance to get his bearings he’d been nutmegged by Tommy Doran, a 73-year-old retired builder. Until seizing that golden opportunity, Doran’s proudest footballing moment was aged eight, when an impromptu game in the Anfield car park with 50s Liverpool legend Louis Bimpson left him with a broken wrist. “Phil Neal is an idol of mine,” says Joe Blundell, 81. “I was amazed to see him here, but you quickly realise how ordinary he is.” He wondered whether the current generation of Liverpool stars would be doing the same in their dotage. “The money is so high now they live in another sphere, don’t they?” Maybe Mo Salah would, he mused. “He’s building a school and a hospital back home in Egypt, isn’t he?” Neal, along with his old team-mate Alan Kennedy, had been invited along by Bygroves, who doubles as Liverpool FC’s chaplain and was signed by Bill Shankly as a schoolboy. If it began as a charitable gesture it soon became a genuine passion for both veterans: Kennedy got so into the rapidly growing sport that he was recently selected for England’s first over 60s walking football team, alongside Bobby Charlton’s younger brother Tommy, 73. Both Kennedy and Neal are now regulars at Bygroves’ sessions, an initiative of Red Neighbours, Liverpool’s community outreach programme. Neither are paid to attend. The sessions are free, apart from the tea and biscuits afterwards. “I only joined up so I could give Phil Neal the runaround,” says Tony Perischine, a 74-year-old Evertonian, who plays with his brothers, aged 64 and 70. “Oi,” yells Bygroves, as Neal misses a pass. “Just ‘cos you’ve played in five Champions League finals doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay attention, mate.” At 67, Neal is one of the younger members of the Red Neighbours walking football squad. Though he doesn’t look it, Jim Mounsey, 90, is the oldest. Rules dictate that no one is allowed to tackle him or any of the octagenarians once they have the ball, but Mousney still looks sharp and scored a tidy penalty when the Guardian was in the stands. He joined up after a friend spotted a flyer in the local clinic and suggested he give it a go. He’d been looking for a way to keep fit after his local swimming baths shut down and now relishes the game. “I still feel the impulse to kick the ball,” he says. The sessions have been life-changing for Sol Sorsky, who is 82. When he started, in January, he couldn’t even kick the ball. He was not allowed to play at school — “I wore glasses and lads with glasses couldn’t play football” — and was dangerously overweight. “Everyone says I look fitter. I’m much happier. One of the other lads said to me the other day, ‘no offence but when you first came here you were a doddery old man. Now you’re a rottweiler!’” The social aspect is as important as the exercise, says Bygroves. Post-match refreshments often turn into a Beatles singalong with ladies from Red Neighbours’ walking netball team, who practise inside at the same time. The men even have their own supporters: Liz Hayes, 68, and Edith White, 79, who cheer from the sidelines. Neal insists he gets a decent workout from walking football, though he is trying to learn to take things a little easier: “My brain still thinks I’m a Liverpool full-back but my body has other ideas.” The non-contact rules dictate that he can’t tackle as hard as he did in his prime, and running is strictly forbidden. “But yes, you do let some of them get past. At 90, you deserve a clear chance at goal. You can still be as competitive as Klopp’s boys whatever your age.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/14/cian-healy-leinster-racing-92-european-champions-cup-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T09:00:24Z","webTitle":"Cian Healy urges Leinster young guns to rule Europe after Champions Cup win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/14/cian-healy-leinster-racing-92-european-champions-cup-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/14/cian-healy-leinster-racing-92-european-champions-cup-final","fields":{"headline":"Cian Healy urges Leinster young guns to rule Europe after Champions Cup win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Deep in the bowels of the wonderful Estadio San Mamés on Saturday night stood Cian Healy, reflecting on his fourth European Champions Cup triumph as a player after Leinster’s 15-12 victory over Racing 92. No team, let alone an individual, has ever won five but, according to Healy, this side have barely started. “The plan is to put a lot of stars on the shirt – not four, not five. I want to see Leinster grow and be dominant in Europe for years. The crop that are coming through … long after I’m gone they’ll hopefully be doing that.” It is easy to see where such confidence and optimism springs from. Not only do Healy’s team have seasoned gunslingers like himself and Johnny Sexton but they also have young players threatening to rewrite the laws of professional rugby gravity. James Ryan, the 21-year-old lock, has now played 21 senior matches for Ireland and Leinster and won them all, earning a Six Nations grand slam and Champions Cup medal in the process. With Ryan, Dan Leavy, Garry Ringrose, Robbie Henshaw and Jordan Larmour all 24 or younger, the future for Irish rugby is not so much bright as luminous. Given they have already become just the second team in European club history to go through an entire nine-match campaign with a 100% record and also have a home Pro14 semi-final against Munster this Saturday, it hardly needed Healy to suggest that Ryan, in particular, could develop into a serious talent. “I first saw him at Clontarf and he was a string bean – skinny, tall, talented. When you see him step up to the plate it’s jaw-dropping. It’s a case of: ‘Hold on a second, he doesn’t look like he can do what he’s doing.’ It’s class. Eventually he’ll lose a game and we’ll pick him up and dust him off and send him out again.” Equally fascinating to non-Irish eyes is the breakdown of Ryan’s 21 winning games: eight for Ireland, nine in this season’s Champions Cup and just four in the Pro14. His English equivalent would be playing far more league minutes, assuming he could oust the highly paid Kiwi or South African import ahead of him, and enjoying rather fewer restorative weekends off. Credit also has to go to the coaches supervising the development of Ireland’s glittering young things. Leinster’s director of rugby, Leo Cullen, and his lead coach, Stuart Lancaster, are fortunate to have such exciting raw material at their disposal but very little of it goes to waste. “We want guys to play for Leinster and Ireland a long time, so we need to make sure we pick our battles with our guys,” stressed Cullen, as excited as anyone else by Ryan’s potential. “We are lucky to have him, he is a very special talent.” The only slight cloud on Leinster’s horizon is the need to replace the retiring Isa Nacewa, another four-time European winner and perhaps the most underrated player of his generation. With Nacewa on the field his team rarely, if ever, look flustered and, appropriately, it was the captain who kicked the two crucial late penalties which finally floored Racing after Sexton had tweaked his groin and handed over the kicking duties. If the first European final to be played on Spanish soil was not an expansive classic it was never less than thunderous. They love a bullfight in the Basque country and this nostril-flaring, head-down collision was not one for fragile matadors. Racing lost Dan Carter before kick-off to a hamstring strain, had their South African fly-half Pat Lambie hobble off with a knee injury which is set to rule him out for the rest of the calendar year and were also missing their linchpin Maxime Machenaud at scrum-half. In the circumstances they could be proud of their efforts, undermined only by a late rush of blood by Teddy Thomas who, with the score locked at 12-12, tried to run the ball in his own 22 and gifted Leinster the position from which Nacewa landed the killer blow. “He [Thomas] is a young player and I hope this experience will be useful for him in the future with us and France,” muttered the Racing coach, Laurent Labit. Leinster’s young players have no such issues and are also mature enough to know how to win ugly when required. Even Healy is not overly keen to watch a rerun – “I’ll keep a romantic view of it… it was like winning a fight without throwing a punch” – but he knows a proper rugby team when he sees one. Irish rugby, both at national provincial level, has never had it so good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/13/fahrenheit-451-review-michael-b-jordan-adaptation-fails-to-catch-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T19:59:55Z","webTitle":"Fahrenheit 451 review – Michael B Jordan adaptation fails to catch fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/13/fahrenheit-451-review-michael-b-jordan-adaptation-fails-to-catch-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/13/fahrenheit-451-review-michael-b-jordan-adaptation-fails-to-catch-fire","fields":{"headline":"Fahrenheit 451 review – Michael B Jordan adaptation fails to catch fire","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One peculiar side-effect of the Trump era on popular culture is that old tales that might have felt speculative in another time are being made new again, lent fresh urgency and vigour by current events. “It could happen here”, has been the resounding – and by now somewhat cliched response – to Hulu’s incel-evoking adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, whose success must have had executives rifling through the Penguin Modern Classics section for ripe dystopian IP. Quite whether anyone’s first choice though would have been Ray Bradbury’s 1953 book Fahrenheit 451 is debatable. While it may have some pertinent truths to tell about anti-intellectualism and the stultifying effect of mass media on individual though, its setting – an authoritarian state where books are illegal – feels rather less compelling in an age when information can be widely disseminated at the swipe of a thumb. Iranian-director Rahim Bahrani (99 Homes, Chop Shop) finds a solution of sorts to this issue with an uneven HBO TV movie adaptation of Bradbury’s book, which stars Michael B Jordan and premiered at the Cannes film festival. It’s a film that drags the source material into a gleaming Black Mirror-tinged future where where, not just books but all forms of writing and indeed art have been outlawed, and mass communication instead takes place through a series of emoji-like images sent around the Nine, a heavily censored, state propaganda-spewing update of the internet. Books still have a totemic presence, and mass burnings of them are livestreamed onto the Nine to dissuade would-be bibliophiles and entertain everyone else, but they are treated as illicit, dust-coated objects from a darker time. (Early in the film a group of schoolchildren gawp and shudder as one is displayed in their classroom, a scene that doesn’t seem too much of a stretch to imagine happening in a class full of smartphone-native kids in a time not far from now.) The people doing the burning are nominally known as the firemen, though they’re closer to a fascistic, heavily militarised police force, led by the sadistic captain Beatty (depicted with characteristic menace by Michael Shannon). Jordan meanwhile plays Guy Montag, a young fireman who is being fast-tracked for promotion due to his willingness to do what needs to be done, a willingness that is helped along by memory depleting sedatives administered every day in the form of eye drops. Secretly though, Montag is beginning to question the mission, and his doubts are accelerated after he witnesses a woman burn herself alive rather than be parted from her novels. He smuggles her copy of Notes From the Underground home and thus begins a process of enlightenment, helped along the way by resistance fighter Clarisse (Sofia Boutella). Jordan, who exec-produced the film as well as starring in it, is gaining a reputation for portraying this sort of roiling, conflicted figure, though his performance here doesn’t match his turn as Killmonger in Black Panther in its rawness and complexity. Bahrani’s film seeks to draw some neat parallels with the present. The demise of books, we learn, was ended not by diktat but by the will of the public, who instead of reading “were just glancing at headlines generated by an algorithm.” There’s a sense too that the firemen’s form censorship might be the logical endpoint of a social media culture that refuses to expose itself to dissenting thought. Visually too the film pops and dazzles, the soft futurist blues and pinks reminiscent of Blade Runner 2049 giving way to the violent yellows and blacks once the conflagrations start in earnest. And there are some creepy technological touches, like the Siri-like devices that offer up alternative facts and spy on its users. At the same time there’s a high-minded, hectoring tone throughout that soon begins to grate, with only the slightly pantomime figure of Shannon breaking up the film’s portentous tone. For all its mentions of Proust, Dostoevsky and Kafka, the film never really grapples with the knotty ideas behind the works it namedrops. We never get a sense of what in these books has intellectually stirred Montag from his stupor. Ultimately though, the main issue with this Fahrenheit 451 may not be the fault of its director but with the source material. No film adaption could match the potency and thrill of reading a book about a world where books are banned. It’s a monument to the power of literature that even the firemen would struggle to burn down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/13/michael-gove-irish-border-technology-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T16:45:31Z","webTitle":"Gove casts doubt on merits of customs partnership proposal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/13/michael-gove-irish-border-technology-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/13/michael-gove-irish-border-technology-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Gove casts doubt on merits of customs partnership proposal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Michael Gove has cast fresh doubt on the possibility of a breakthrough in the cabinet customs deadlock, saying there were “significant question marks” about proposals for a customs partnership. The environment secretary expressed scepticism about the merits of Theresa May’s preferred customs partnership model, saying the proposal had flaws and needed to be tested. Gove indicated he had some sympathy for the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who called the proposal “crazy” this week. “Because it’s novel, because no model like this exists there have to be significant questions about the deliverability of it on time,” Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “More than that, the NCP [new customs partnership] requires the British government to in effect act as the tax collector and very possibly the effective deliverer of regulation for the EU,” he added. Brexiters prefer an alternative model, the so-called “max fac”, which uses technology to do customs checks with limited friction on the Northern Irish border. Gove admitted cabinet ministers remained conflicted about both proposals, saying “there is agreement that neither of these two models is absolutely perfect”. The cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee will meet again on Tuesday but is not expected to emerge with a compromise. A government source suggested the two working groups of cabinet ministers, set up last week to thrash out arguments for both proposals, needed to be given time to work through the two options. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, expressed some frustration with the deadlock and the counter-briefings. Asked if he was one of the ministers threatening to block the new customs partnership, which appeared to be the prime minister’s preferred model, he said: “I’m backing the prime minister. I think that we have to trust Theresa May.” “You can’t iron out every single detail of a negotiating position in public,” he told LBC. “It’s going to be bumpy of course because it’s a different course to the way we were going to go but we’ve got to have some confidence and trust in her.” The former cabinet minister Stephen Crabb also said MPs were becoming increasingly disturbed by the deadlock. “I am not alone in saying there is a growing concern on the backbenches about how entrenched some of the positions in the cabinet seem to have become,” he told the BBC. “The vast majority of Conservative MPs don’t see this question of a customs union as some kind of ideological cage fight.” He added that cabinet ministers who refused to budge may find that “parliament will be making the decisions for them”. Under the customs partnership model, the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU and its backers believe it would go some way to solving the issue with the Northern Irish border. Brexiters prefer the “maximum facilitation” model that relies on technology to minimise border checks, which critics say cannot resolve the Irish border issue and would require lengthy development of sophisticated new technology. On Sunday, Gove said he would not back any delay to the UK leaving the customs union beyond the transition period to allow new border technology to be developed. “In delay there lies no plenty,” he said. “The critical thing is to meet that deadline. My experience in government reinforces my belief that we need to make sure we deliver things at pace.” Ireland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said there had been a clear commitment from May that there would be no border infrastructure. He said any backtracking would mean “a very difficult summer for these negotiations if that happens”. Though the EU has been widely reported to have rejected both of May’s customs options, Coveney indicated a softening of approach to the customs partnership, saying he was open to a solution “as long as it achieves the outcome of there being no physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland and no related checks or controls”. Coveney said the Irish government “don’t take our lead from Boris Johnson in relation to Brexit. We take our lead from the prime minister. She has signed up to very clear commitments.” Johnson has been excluded from the two working groups examining the merits of both options, as has the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is most in favour of the customs partnership. Gove will examine the customs partnership alongside Liam Fox and David Lidington, while David Davis will examine the “max fac” model with Karen Bradley and Greg Clark, who have expressed scepticism about that model’s negative effects on business and on its workability at the Northern Irish border."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/13/spanish-newspaper-el-pais-appoints-its-first-gender-correspondent-metoo","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T13:29:47Z","webTitle":"Spanish newspaper El País appoints its first gender correspondent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/13/spanish-newspaper-el-pais-appoints-its-first-gender-correspondent-metoo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/13/spanish-newspaper-el-pais-appoints-its-first-gender-correspondent-metoo","fields":{"headline":"Spanish newspaper El País appoints its first gender correspondent","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Spanish newspaper El País has appointed its first gender correspondent after lobbying from its female journalists, and in recognition of the fact that society is undergoing a “profound change” after the #MeToo movement and recent large-scale women’s rights protests across the country. The paper, which was founded 42 years ago as Spain began its transition to democracy following the death of Franco, said greater attention had to be paid to “the new role women have in society”. It added: “This isn’t just about writing more stories about women; it’s about including more women in the stories.” On International Women’s Day on 8 March, more than 5 million workers took part in Spain’s first “feminist strike” to protest against sexual discrimination, domestic violence and the gender pay gap. At the end of April, demonstrations were held across the country after five men accused of the gang-rape of a teenager during the running of the bulls festival in Pamplona were found guilty of the lesser offence of sexual abuse. The trial, known as the Wolfpack case after the nickname the group gave itself, shocked Spain and led the government to announce a review of sexual offences legislation. “The huge turnout in Spain on 8 March, the protests over the Wolfpack sentence and the earthquake of reports of sexual abuse we’ve seen through #MeToo – which has given rise to the #TellIt (#Cuéntalo) movement in Spanish – all give an idea of where feminism is in the 21st century,” El País said. The paper added its commitment to gender issues would be evident across all its sections and would inform its international coverage, particularly in Latin America. Pilar Álvarez, who will be the paper’s first gender correspondent, said the move was intended to yield “more in-depth and ambitious coverage of what’s going on with women”. She added: “It’s not just about women; the word gender also covers men and we’re very much looking at what’s going on with men and how men are changing.” Álvarez said one of the main tasks would be investigating what comes after #MeToo and the recent protests in Spain. “They’ve been followed by a lot of agitation and noise and we’re going to do what journalists do: separate the noise from the facts,” she added. “We’re also going to keep a lookout so we can balance out the presence of men and women in the news.” The announcement follows similar initiatives elsewhere. In October last year, the New York Times appointed a gender editor while the Washington Post has advertised for a gender columnist."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/14/patients-being-turned-away-from-sexual-health-clinics-rcn-says","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T23:01:12Z","webTitle":"Patients being turned away from sexual health clinics, RCN says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/14/patients-being-turned-away-from-sexual-health-clinics-rcn-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/14/patients-being-turned-away-from-sexual-health-clinics-rcn-says","fields":{"headline":"Patients being turned away from sexual health clinics, RCN says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nurses have reported having to turn patients away from short-staffed sexual health clinics, leading to fears over a drop in infection testing. Overstretched resources in the field mean that the public are being left unprotected, according to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), which launches a report on Monday as sexual health experts warn that services are at “tipping point” due to budget cuts. It found that the number of 18- to 24-year-olds being tested for chlamydia, the most common disease, has fallen by close to half a million in the five years since the government moved public health services into local authorities. Despite a 25% fall in tests, recent figures recorded a higher level of positive diagnoses, now at 128,000 cases a year. The past five years coincided with what the RCN described as detrimental changes to commissioning of services, funding reductions and a “dangerous” recruitment freeze. An RCN survey of more than 600 nurses working in sexual health found services severely understaffed, with few registered nurses, a mix of skills that the body described as inadequate and little access to training. Nurses reported having to turn patients away, a lack of clinics, low morale and a “tick box” culture. Six in 10 said there had been a reduction in the number of registered nurses where they work, with the majority pointing to recruitment freezes as the reason behind shortages. The report also found that while the introduction of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine for teenage girls had contributed to a 74% reduction in genital warts in 15- to 17-year-old girls, access to cervical screening for HPV has been affected by confusion in commissioning and provision. The impact of sexually transmitted infections remains greatest in heterosexuals aged 15 to 24, black ethnic minorities and gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Helen Donovan, professional lead for public health at the RCN, said: “This is a worrying picture of understaffed services going to extreme lengths to try to cope, even turning people away – the last thing a health professional ever wants to do. “If people are not able to access services then serious STIs could go undiagnosed and untreated – it is a major risk to public health.” Olwen Williams, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said that the findings provided more evidence that sexual health services had reached tipping point: “With the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea and record levels of syphilis, these cuts have come at the worst possible time.” The Department of Health said: “This government has a strong track record on public health—teenage pregnancies are at an all-time low and sexually transmitted infections continue to fall overall. Local areas are best placed to understand their own needs, so over the current spending period, we will invest more than £16bn to help them deliver the right services for their communities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/13/ivanka-trump-in-jerusalem-for-embassy-opening-as-gaza-braces-for-bloodshed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T06:12:59Z","webTitle":"Ivanka Trump in Jerusalem for embassy opening as Gaza braces for bloodshed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/13/ivanka-trump-in-jerusalem-for-embassy-opening-as-gaza-braces-for-bloodshed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/13/ivanka-trump-in-jerusalem-for-embassy-opening-as-gaza-braces-for-bloodshed","fields":{"headline":"Ivanka Trump in Jerusalem for embassy opening as Gaza braces for bloodshed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ivanka Trump is in Israel for the inauguration of the US Jerusalem embassy on Monday, as protesters in Gaza prepare for a day of rallies along the frontier that are expected to be met with gunfire.

In Gaza, a strip of land Israel has blockaded for a decade, tens of thousands of people are anticipated to gather for protests along the perimeter fence. Frustration and desperation at Trump’s December declaration helped ignite a six-week movement in which residents of the enclave have gathered near the frontier, with groups throwing stones and burning tyres. They have demanded an end to severe restrictions on movement and called for a “right to return” to their ancestral homes. Israeli snipers have killed dozens and wounded more than 1,700 when firing on demonstrators in past rallies, according to Gazan health officials. Organisers hope Monday’s will be the largest demonstration to date, on the eve of the 70th anniversary commemorating the Palestinian “Nakba”, or catastrophe, referring to their mass uprooting in the war surrounding Israel’s 1948 creation. Israel has portrayed the movement as a “terrorist” ploy by Hamas and as a security threat to its civilians, pointing out attempts to damage and breach the fence. No Israeli has been wounded since protests began on 30 March. Hamas, which rules Gaza and has supported the protests, said it would not stop people from attempting to break through the fence. The Israeli army said on Sunday that it held Hamas accountable for anything in the Gaza Strip “and its consequences”. It added it had increased the deployment of “combat battalions, special units, field intelligence forces and snipers”. In Jerusalem, dozens of foreign diplomats are expected to the attend the opening of the new mission, set on the site of the US consulate, although many ambassadors who oppose the move will skip it. Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed the hilltop city in a move not recognised internationally. Most countries have kept their embassies in Tel Aviv. The fate of the ancient city has been a critical and unresolved issue in past US-brokered peace talks. The Palestinian leadership rejected Washington’s traditional role as a mediator following Trump’s Jerusalem decision. More than 1,000 Israeli police, including special patrol units and undercover officers, will be working near the event on Monday. Security preparations have taken three months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/14/round-of-improved-afl-contests-heralds-a-more-compelling-season","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"Round of improved AFL contests heralds a more compelling season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/14/round-of-improved-afl-contests-heralds-a-more-compelling-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/14/round-of-improved-afl-contests-heralds-a-more-compelling-season","fields":{"headline":"Round of improved AFL contests heralds a more compelling season","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In both literary and popular entertainment, the element of surprise is a useful tool for anyone who wants to create a compelling story. Vera Tobin, a cognitive scientist who studies connections between cognition, language and narrative, opens her book The Element of Surprise by noting different kinds of surprise – events we didn’t anticipate, mismatches between our perceptual expectations and experience, and astonishing revelations that undermine deeply-held beliefs. If you asked a hundred people to ascribe three adjectives to the first seven weeks of AFL season 2018, “compelling” would be nowhere to be seen. Like Helena Bonham Carter in a Tim Burton film, the season appeared trapped; unchanging to the point where we had to stifle our yawns. While Friday night’s game between Hawthorn and Sydney at the MCG promised more than the D-Grade detritus dished up over the past two weeks, then, nobody anticipated a seven-goal best-afield performance from third-gamer Ben Ronke, who was barely able to find his way onto the ground. “I walked out of the coaches’ room and he [Ronke] was just about to walk in and I asked him where he was going, and he said, ‘I don’t know how to get out on the ground,’” said Sydney coach John Longmire. Ronke’s feat is made even more remarkable in that he was the second-last pick in the first round of the 2017 rookie draft, and his primary task appeared to be a defensive one – to shut down the classy Hawthorn half-back, Sean Burgoyne. “He’s a smart footy player,” said Ronke of Burgoyne, dabbling in understatement. “He took me to the ball a couple of times and I tried to utilise that to my favour as much as I could.” Ronke found the ball more than a few times and was deep in Sydney’s forward line as the Swans clung to a two-point lead with less than two minutes to go in the last quarter. Gary Rohan kicked long from just inside the centre square, to the top of the goal square where the 182-centimetre Ronke outpointed two Hawthorn opponents to take the mark and seal the game. “Not Ben Ronke, Buddy Ronke,” gasped Seven’s commentator Bruce McAvaney in a half-lidded tone usually reserved for Hawthorn’s Cyril Rioli. The following day, as the clouds overhead conspired to shut out the sun, the only thing that lit up the MCG was the Essendon fan who burnt his merchandise on the concourse after his team slumped to its sixth defeat in seven weeks. Essendon’s season has quickly dissolved into a mismatch between expectations and experience. Despite not winning a final for 13 years, many experts had Essendon pegged for a top-four spot after the Bombers recruited Devon Smith, Adam Saad and Jake Stringer. Only Smith can be deemed a triumph of that triumvirate, on determination if nothing else – on Saturday he laid a game high 15 tackles. In contrast, from the stands Stringer’s effort looked like that of a guy who got laid off from the warehouse a couple of weeks ago and hasn’t gotten off the couch since. “This is a group that have created something [so] that people look at this Essendon group and say: ‘This is who they are,’” said Essendon coach John Worsfold. About the only thing Essendon is responsible for this year is group therapy. Instead of laying a foundation for a tilt at a finals series, Worsfold now finds himself in charge of a team that has two wins and six losses at the time of year when rumours of coaching careers are dumped on a ravenous football media like burley to sharks. Had you tipped North Melbourne to be on four wins and four losses after two months of football, you’d have been within the margin of error for optimistic. The Kangaroos have been one of the revelations of the season, and while they eventually went down to the reigning premiers on Sunday, their play has undermined the deeply held belief that their year would be one defined not by hope, but by despair. The Kangaroos’ effort and desire for the contest is perhaps best embodied by Ben Cunnington. The 26-year-old midfielder is a footballer who tears every last shred of meat from the bone, and on Sunday he had a career-best 38 possessions. While that may sound more impressive than remarkable in this era of disposable disposals, 32 of these were contested – something that nobody else in the game has achieved. The previous best was 29 by Patrick Dangerfield in 2015. While the Kangaroos sit in tenth spot on the ladder, the fright they gave Richmond – a week after upsetting Sydney at the SCG – suggests they are a genuine challenger for the final eight. If you saw that coming, you’re a liar. In a season that has been described in terms more effluent than effulgent, it is nice to be reminded that the game can still delight (Friday night’s game at the MCG and Saturday night’s ‘Showdown’ were two of the best games of the year) and surprise us. Things are about to get a lot more compelling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/13/coalition-says-costings-for-budgets-tax-measures-too-unreliable-to-release","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T02:53:22Z","webTitle":"Coalition says costings for budget’s tax measures too ‘unreliable’ to release","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/13/coalition-says-costings-for-budgets-tax-measures-too-unreliable-to-release","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/13/coalition-says-costings-for-budgets-tax-measures-too-unreliable-to-release","fields":{"headline":"Coalition says costings for budget’s tax measures too ‘unreliable’ to release","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Turnbull government is continuing to insist that its tax package must be considered as a job lot, and it will get through the Senate intact, despite the obvious parliamentary resistance to the third tranche of the reforms, which flattens the income tax scales, benefiting high-income earners. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said on Sunday the government was often underestimated when it came to dealing constructively with the Senate, and he said the plan needed to be legislated as a whole because it dealt with both short and long-term problems. Morrison is also continuing to resist calls to release detailed, year-by-year costings of the tax measures beyond the forward estimates, contending the figures would be “unreliable”. Labor has made the case the government should not ask the parliament to sign up to a seven-year plan without a clear understanding of the costs to the budget once the benefits begin to flow to high-income earners, when the government scraps the 37% tax bracket. The Grattan Institute has produced analysis demonstrating the top 20% of income earners will benefit most from the tax plan Morrison outlined in the budget last Tuesday. Its analysis found that once the third phase of the plan was in place, $15bn of the $25bn annual cost results from collecting less tax from the top 20% of income earners. Morrison told the ABC on Sunday that if Labor wanted year by year breakdowns of the tax package, then it needed to produce year-by-year breakdowns of its promise to end cash refunds for excess imputation credits for individuals and superannuation funds. “So when people want to apply the same standards to the government that they do to the Labor party, fair enough, but on this score we have supplied the clear costing over 10 years and Labor is looking for [an] excuse not to provide tax relief for Australians because they don’t believe in it,” the treasurer said. The government last week unveiled a new low and middle-income offset of $200 for people earning under $37,000, rising to $530 for more than four million people earning between $48,000 and $90,000. It also proposes to increase the 37% tax threshold from $87,000 to $90,000 before axing that bracket altogether in 2024-25 – a development that would see people earning between $41,000 and $200,000 paying the same marginal tax rate. The package costs $13bn over the forward estimates and $140bn over the medium term. The government has the requisite support for the first stage of its plan but Labor and a number of Senate crossbenchers, including the One Nation bloc, have been cool on the last phase on the basis it makes the tax system less progressive. Bill Shorten used his budget reply speech last Thursday to promise he would almost double the rebate for low and middle-income earners and he signalled strongly Labor would not support phase three of the government’s plan. Labor will also impose a 49% rate for people earning over $180,000 if it wins the next federal election. The competing tax plans will face their first on-ground political test during a super Saturday of byelections over the coming month or so triggered by the last vestige of the dual citizenship crisis. An opinion poll released on Saturday suggests the Coalition has a good chance of taking the Queensland seat of Longman from Labor because of the high One Nation vote, and it could also win back the South Australian seat of Mayo from the Centre Alliance MP, Rebekha Sharkie. The Liberals will not field a candidate in the two Western Australian seats in play, Fremantle and Perth, to save resources for the federal election, which can be called anytime after August. The byelection season is looming as a major test for both major party leaders. A government has not taken a seat from the opposition of the day at a byelection for a century."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/15/afc-harrogate-uk-military-school-audit-teenage-recruits","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T12:20:44Z","webTitle":"UK military school audit reveals teenage recruits at risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/15/afc-harrogate-uk-military-school-audit-teenage-recruits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/15/afc-harrogate-uk-military-school-audit-teenage-recruits","fields":{"headline":"UK military school audit reveals teenage recruits at risk","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Concerns over the safety and welfare of 16- and 17-year-old soldiers have emerged in an internal audit that flagged up a string of issues relating to staff, the standard of education and living conditions, the Guardian can reveal. The audit found that a drive to fast-track late joiners at the Army Foundation College (AFC), which trains and educates teenage recruits, had led to significant issues including skewing staff/student ratios in risk-to-life activities such as weapons training. It also found some staff had not received criminal record clearance before arriving at the college. The audit concluded that able teenagers were not being challenged in lessons at the college in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, and some recruits were unhappy about their accommodation and food. AFC Harrogate hit the headlines in March when it emerged that 28 recruits aged 16 and 17 had claimed they were assaulted and abused by instructors during a battle camp in the summer of 2014. The case against the instructors collapsed after concerns over how the investigation had been handled. The audit took place in 2015 and has come to light now because of a parliamentary question put by Liz Saville Roberts, the leader of Plaid Cymru at Westminster, who said it raised concerns about the policy of the armed forces recruiting minors. The audit report flags up “many areas of good practice” at AFC Harrogate. But problem areas highlighted include: Instructors arriving at the college without disclosure and barring service (DBS) certification. Significant issues being created by the arrival of fast-track late joiners – particularly in relation to staff/student ratios in risk-to-life activities such as “skill at arms” – weapons training. Substantial numbers of instructors arriving without the necessary training – causing a significant factor contributing to instructor overstretch. The auditors heard concerns from staff over the discipline of junior soldiers (JS) and restrictions on penalties they could impose. “It was perceived by staff that JS know the limitations of the system and are adept at exploiting them. Staff authority is undermined,” it said. Junior soldiers expressed concern about their living conditions. The report said: “Crockery is often dirty; dinner regularly appears to be the leftovers from lunch … JS felt that to complain would be fruitless.” A female junior soldier spoke of a lack of heating in some of their rooms. She did not report it, thinking cold rooms were part of army life. The report also said junior soldiers were not medically screened to assess them fit for service until they were at the college, resulting in some being discharged within days of arriving. Junior soldiers arriving at the college with good numeracy and literacy found lessons “boring, uninspiring and lacking any meaningful differentiation,” the report said. Last week the Guardian revealed that the army had been spoon-feeding graduates of AFC Harrogate identikit quotes to be used in local and regional newspaper articles extolling life in the military. Rachel Taylor, director of programmes at Child Soldiers International, said the audit report showed what recruits and instructors really felt. She said: “It reveals boredom and ill-discipline in the classroom, frequent cancellation of training activities, high dropout rates, and widespread complaints about the quality of accommodation and food. Even more worrying is the lack of attention given to the safety and welfare of these young recruits.” Emma Sangster, coordinator at ForcesWatch, said: “This audit confirms our evidence that the provision is substandard. This audit points to a number of issues of significant concern with the army’s training college for its youngest recruits.” The army said issues highlighted in the report had been considered and, where appropriate, addressed. A spokesperson said: “We take the welfare and duty of care of all our soldiers, especially those at Harrogate, extremely seriously. Internal inspections are a part of our rigorous regime of safeguards to ensure this, and are conducted exactly for the purpose of identifying areas where we can improve. “The areas highlighted in this report, from 2015, have been considered and where appropriate addressed. The Army Foundation College (Harrogate) was inspected by Ofsted in November 2017 and we are looking forward to the publication of the report later this month.” On the specific point regarding DBS checks it said any military personnel arriving on site without clearance are either returned to their previous unit or are subject to a plan to ensure they are not left unsupervised with recruits. A special team had been set up to address the skill at arms point. An independent advisory panel that carried out visits in 2017 painted a brighter picture. It said: “The IAP is confident that the duty of care to junior soldiers is actively embedded throughout the college.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/14/apple-class-action-lawsuit-defective-macbook-pro-keyboards","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T10:51:50Z","webTitle":"Apple facing class action lawsuit over defective MacBook Pro keyboards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/14/apple-class-action-lawsuit-defective-macbook-pro-keyboards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/14/apple-class-action-lawsuit-defective-macbook-pro-keyboards","fields":{"headline":"Apple facing class action lawsuit over defective MacBook Pro keyboards","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Apple is facing a class action lawsuit over the design of its MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards which, consumers complain, has keys that are prone to becoming stuck. The lawsuit follows a litany of complaints across user forums, specialist media and a petition with over 21,000 signatures urging Apple to recall the Mac laptops released since late 2016. “Because of the new keyboard design, consumers report that fixing affected keys requires replacing the whole keyboard, which costs $700,” Girard Gibbs, counsel for the plaintiffs, state. “Because typing is the primary purpose of laptops, over time, consumers have become more and more frustrated with the keyboard defect.” In 2015 Apple introduced a new key switch mechanism that allowed it to produce a keyboard much thinner and with a smaller amount of travel. It was first used on the 12in MacBook laptop, and then later on the redesigned MacBook Pro line from late 2016. The “butterfly” mechanism replaced the older “scissor” mechanism, which is still used by the majority of laptop keyboards, and was intended to make the keys more stable and responsive when pressed. But the plaintiffs claim the redesign has resulted in a defective product: “Apple’s butterfly keyboard and MacBook are produced and assembled in such a way that when minimal amounts of dust or debris accumulate under or around a key, keystrokes fail to register.” As typing is the keyboard’s primary input for the laptops, the plaintiffs argue that when a keys become stuck on the MacBook or MacBook Pro the machines, which cost upwards of £1,249, become “unsuitable for its ordinary and intended use”. The lawsuit argues that “Apple has failed to disclose that the keyboard is defective, and this information would have been important to Plaintiffs’ decision to purchase a MacBook” and that even after repair the problem reoccurs. Clearing dust and debris out of the keyboard is difficult. Apple has a guide on how to clean a MacBook or MacBook Pro keyboard with compressed air, but further treatment requires repair by technicians. Apple did not immediately comment.

Skripal was a regular lecturer in the US and Europe for at least a decade, speaking at universities and military academies and to other groups interested in intelligence. However, Whitehall sources said the revelation that he spoke on the lecture circuit, as other spies had done before him, neither explained nor justified the nerve agent attack. Although his operational knowledge ended with his arrest in Russia in 2004, Skripal was still regarded as being of value because of his inside knowledge of the workings of Russian military intelligence. According to the Czech magazine Respekt, Skripal visited Prague in 2012 and held discussions with Czech intelligence. He briefed security officers on Kremlin espionage methods, and the meeting was described as “beneficial”. Members of Czech intelligence subsequently met Skripal in the UK at least once, the magazine reported. The claims shed new light on the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, 10 weeks ago in Salisbury. The pair were targeted with novichok, a lethal Soviet-developed nerve agent, in what the UK government maintains was a clandestine Russian operation. The Russian government and its embassy in London have furiously denied the claims. They have pointed to the fact that Skripal – a senior officer in the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence outfit – was jailed for spying for the British and later pardoned. He was exchanged in a spy swap in 2010 and settled in the UK. He gave sensitive briefings to European intelligence agencies after he moved to Britain. It seems that MI6 approved of and facilitated these trips. In June 2016 Skripal travelled to Estonia and met a select group of intelligence officers there, the New York Times reported on Monday. It said it was unclear what they discussed. Although his operational information was dated, ceasing with his arrest in Russia in 2004, he was still regarded as being of value because of his inside knowledge of the workings of Russian military intelligence. Security sources in the Czech Republic said Skripal’s meetings with Czech intelligence agents would probably have been useful, but they dismissed them as a likely motive for the poisoning attack. “It’s clear that he cooperated with the British services before that and they were the owners of his information, so that’s the reason [he was targeted],” one retired senior agent with the Czech foreign intelligence service, ÚZSI, told the Guardian. He added: “The ties between MI6 and the Czech intelligence services are so good that it’s normal that the British were willing to rent him out, so to speak, to the Czech services. It would have been a very useful and interesting meeting for the Czechs, there’s no doubt about that. When do you have the chance to meet a KGB or GRU officer? Almost never.” Ondrej Kundra, a security specialist with the magazine Respekt, said Skripal probably passed “specific information” about the operation of Russia intelligence operations in the Czech Republic gleaned from his previous position as head of the human resources with the GRU, Russia’s foreign intelligence agency. The Czech Republic has expressed repeated reservations about the large number of Russian diplomats – estimated at around 100 – stationed in the country amid suspicions that many of them are undercover spies. “He knew the names of some GRU spies who were working within the EU – it didn’t matter that he was no longer working for them himself and had left many years before,” said Kundra. “He knew agents who are still operating. But it’s not only about providing specific information. It’s also about the Czech guys wanting to know what these agents look like, what is their psychology and behaviour patterns, and so on. It’s one thing reading about these guys – if you have the chance as an agent to see them and ask questions, it’s even better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/15/growing-number-of-children-groomed-to-film-own-sexual-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T23:01:41Z","webTitle":"Growing number of children groomed to film own sexual abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/15/growing-number-of-children-groomed-to-film-own-sexual-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/15/growing-number-of-children-groomed-to-film-own-sexual-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Growing number of children groomed to film own sexual abuse","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Children are being coerced and blackmailed into live-streaming their own sexual abuse from their own homes, researchers have found. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which carried out the study, says that large numbers of victims are white girls apparently from relatively affluent backgrounds, often streaming from their bedroom. Their profile contrasts markedly with that of typical offline abuse victims who are often homeless or poor, it points out. In a three-month period last year, the charity identified 2,082 images and videos of live-streamed child sexual abuse. Of that number, 96% were girls and 98% were children aged 13 and under, with most (69%) assessed to be between 11 and 13. Almost three in 10 (28%) were aged under 10 and the youngest victim was just three years old. The vast majority (96%) showed a child on their own in a home environment, leading the IWF to conclude they are being groomed, coerced and blackmailed into live-streaming their own sexual abuse over webcams, tablets and mobile phones. Sarah Smith, IWF technical projects officer and author of the paper, said: “This new research shows a worrying new trend in the abuse of children. Permanent captures from live-streams showing children being groomed or encouraged to perform sexual acts now represent most of the new images and videos IWF see. Our recent data shows that so-called ‘self-produced’ content accounts for more than one in three of reports that are made to the IWF. This is an alarming figure.” The Microsoft-funded report, published on Tuesday, found that 40% were classified as category A or B abuse (the most serious categories). In some cases, children were being coerced into sexual activity in order to gain “likes” or comments from viewers, the researchers found. In one instance detailed in the report, a child, who gave her age as 12 years old, referred to having 50 viewers to her broadcast stream. After repeatedly exposing herself to the webcam, she stated that she would halt the broadcast if people did not start commenting or liking the stream as there would be “no point” in her continuing. In many cases it was not possible for the reporters to identify the likely location of the victims, but, where it was possible, they said the majority appeared to be outside the UK. Three-quarters (73%) of content appeared on 16 dedicated forums, indicating it was being shared with the intention of advertising paid downloads of videos of webcam child sexual abuse. The IWF said its report points to the need for greater awareness amongst educators, professionals and carers. Susie Hargreaves, IWF chief executive, said: “This form of grooming is complicated and only possible because of the ‘anonymity’ the internet offers. An offender may be, for example, a 40-year-old man. But by abusing a legitimate internet site to create a false profile, he could appear online as a 12-year-old schoolgirl. Sadly, through this study we saw a range of grooming scenarios that abusers employ. “We know that this information will be terrifying for most parents. That’s why we are trying to warn parents, carers and professionals working with children, about the potential abuse of live-streaming technology by offenders.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/14/wpp-chairman-martin-sorrell-roberto-quarta-glass-lewis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T10:14:44Z","webTitle":"WPP chairman faces investor revolt over unpublished Martin Sorrell report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/14/wpp-chairman-martin-sorrell-roberto-quarta-glass-lewis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/14/wpp-chairman-martin-sorrell-roberto-quarta-glass-lewis","fields":{"headline":"WPP chairman faces investor revolt over unpublished Martin Sorrell report","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The WPP chairman, Roberto Quarta, faces a shareholder revolt over the departure of the former chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, after influential advisory group Glass Lewis recommended that investors vote against his re-election at the advertising giant’s annual meeting next month. In a report to investors, Glass Lewis said it had “severe reservations” about issues including the failure to publish the outcome of the investigation into personal misconduct that prompted Sorrell to resign – therefore classifying him as a “good leaver” keeping up to £20m in future share payouts intact – and poor succession planning. Glass Lewis also recommended that investors reject WPP’s pay report, which saw Sorrell paid £14m last year, because of the lack of transparency around his departure. The advisory body also criticised the way Quarta, who is also head of WPP’s nomination committee, has prepared in advance for life after the departure of the company’s founder after 33 years. “We harbour concerns as to the transparency and efficacy of the succession process,” said Glass Lewis. “Despite previous assurances we believe the nomination committee has failed to adequately prepare for the replacement of Sir Martin. Our concerns are heightened by the opaque nature of the investigation into Sir Martin [and] his ‘good leaver’ status. Absent further information regarding Sir Martin’s retirement, we believe shareholders are unable to determine the extent to which he should be treated as a ‘good leaver’.” WPP has always maintained that there has always been a number of potential internal candidates, including the WPP Digital chief, Mark Read, who is currently co-running the business on a day-to-day basis alongside colleague Andrew Scott, as well as a “constantly refined list of external candidates”. Tim Armstrong, the head of Oath, the Verizon subsidiary that owns AOL and Yahoo, has been cited as a potential successor. Glass Lewis also cited Quarta’s increased workload – he is also chairman of Smith &amp; Nephew, the FTSE 100 medical equipment maker which has also recently had a change in chief executives – as unsatisfactory. A spokesman for WPP said Sorrell has been “treated in accordance with his contract and also in accordance with the approved compensation policy and the stock plan rules”. The spokesman added that a vote against Quarta was not in the interests of investors at a time when WPP has no chief executive, as some analysts argue that the best course of action is a £22bn-plus break-up of the ad group. “Recommending a vote against Roberto Quarta is against the interests of investors at such an important time when the business needs stability until such time as a new chief executive is appointed,” said the WPP spokesman. “The investors have shown support for WPP by the share price rising by 18% since Sir Martin Sorrell’s retirement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/14/i-wouldnt-bet-against-a-miliband-centrist-party-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T11:49:47Z","webTitle":"'I wouldn't bet against a Miliband centrist party': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/14/i-wouldnt-bet-against-a-miliband-centrist-party-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/14/i-wouldnt-bet-against-a-miliband-centrist-party-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'I wouldn't bet against a Miliband centrist party': your best comments today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"David Miliband’s comments on Brexit dominated conversation on the site on Monday morning.

The right will shout about the ‘2008 economic collapse’ and the left will shout ‘Iraq’ but for the many who want a politician to deal with today, he looks like a pretty serious option. A new party could steal a lot of Labour’s very good policies and add in a slice of aspiration to make a pretty compelling alternative. The far left and the far right Brexiteers are between them, brewing up what could very soon be a ‘perfect storm’ that a new centrist party could flourish pretty well in. Many Tory voters only continue voting for them because there is no alternative for them to vote for and the same goes for many Labour voters. Both parties should shape up because we live in very different times from the SDP days. The unexpected, politically speaking has been happening for a while now and I wouldn’t bet against a new ‘centrist’ party. Kdbur ‘Brexiters must be delighted that David Miliband keeps helping their cause’ Brexiters must be delighted that David Miliband, Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair keep helping their cause by opening their gobs. Maybe that’s partly why the proportion of voters who would vote to stay or leave if there was another referendum, have stayed about the same as they were when we voted to leave, according to polls. algae64 ‘I’d rather have Miliband’s analysis on why his old constituency voted to leave the EU’ I’d rather have David Miliband’s analysis on why his old constituency of South Shields voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU and what conditions he thinks would be necessary for them to either change their mind completely or at least enough to accept the freedom of movement that being in the EEA would require. It also needs to be noted that England voted Out more strongly than UK as a whole (and England outside of London much more strongly) and that the Tories won a majority of 59 seats in England in 2017. Any imposition of EEA by Parliament would be an imposition by Scotland and Wales on England and electoral hemlock for Labour in England. trosser ‘Corbyn needs to change his stance on the single market’ If Corbyn doesn’t change his stance on the single market, I can guarantee that all those young people who adore him will change their minds. I can also guarantee that Labour will lose the support of a lot of people like me. GreatestCat Is it offensive to call ruddy-faced middle-aged Tories ‘gammons’? In recent months, says this Pass Notes piece, the word “gammon” has become a shorthand for middle-aged, right-leaning white men who won’t stop railing against a system they feel is working against them, even though they are ultimately among its greatest beneficiaries. ‘Political insults have a long and unhelpful history’ Political insults have a long and unhelpful history. The current crop, left and right, are both borne out of their respective sides’ political impotence. ‘Remoaner’ etc are the right desperately attempting to deflect from the fact that Brexit is a shambles and to distract from their lack of a coherent vision or strategy for a post-EU Britain. ‘Gammon’ (as well as ‘melt’, ‘centrist dad’ and the rest) are the results of the intellectual poverty and incoherence of Corbynite left-wing politics – the fact that the left doesn’t really have any ideas, so it can’t really respond to criticisms. Spoonface ‘A simplistic view of a complex issue’ Yes, it’s offensive. I don’t agree with most of the dissenters that it’s racist, but I do think there’s a nasty ageist element to it which buys into this idea that the old sold out the young through the EU referendum – which is a simplistic view of a complex issue. Ultimately these labels personalise the political, and are too loosely-defined to be useful or fair. It becomes far too easy to dismiss any middle-aged white man (is it only men?) whose views you disagree with as a ‘gammon’, and that way you don’t have to think about and counter what he has to say. If you can’t live without labelling your opponents, label these men in a way that’s fair and accurate. Call them Conservatives. That’s labelling enough. ByDog Comments have been edited for length.

If not, don’t worry, Panos Cosmatos will recreate this moment for you. As with his first film – 2010’s slightly more Rush, Omni Magazine and early Cronenberg-inspired Beyond the Black Rainbow – Mandy is set in that most futuristic date, the year 1983. But this story is a little more steeped in demonic myth than microchips. After a slow credit sequence of a timber yard, set to King Crimson’s gorgeous song Starless (you don’t hear a Robert Fripp guitar solo in films too often) we meet Red (Nicolas Cage) and Mandy (Andrea Riseborough). They are in a love haze in their strange woodland cabin beneath lava-coloured skies. They debate which is their favourite planet (she makes a good case for Jupiter), we see her sketching and reading fantasy novels in an early Mötley Crüe T-shirt. (That’s key, because before they were a hair band, they had more than a whiff of Satan to them.) Then: trouble. A biker gang (or are they hippies?) with a messiah-complex leader (Linus Roache) soaked in hallucinogens spies Mandy and “must have her”. His Hellraiser-esque minions capture her and, when she does not submit to his advances (indeed laughs at his manhood), she is set on fire while Red, tied in barbed wire, is forced to watch. Though left for dead, Red frees himself and seeks his vengeance. If there was more to the plot I’d tell you, I swear, but this one is really more about the mood and, eventually, the action. The first hour of the film is slow and, dare I say, trippy. Then the second half proudly stomps into “I can’t believe I’m what I’m seeing” territory. It’s a mixed blessing having Cage in the lead. He’s certainly someone who can smelt a weird-looking axe, charmingly spit bon mots at hellions and get a cheer when he snorts an enormous amount of cocaine off a glass shard. But there are moments in which he gets an inadvertent laugh. This isn’t to suggest Cosmatos and co-writer Aaron Stewart-Ahn’s screenplay doesn’t have humour – it has the most memorable macaroni cheese television commercial in all of cinema – but a lengthy freakout scene in a bathroom (with Cage in tighty-whities and a shirt with a tiger on it) is destined for meme-hood, even though I think it wants to be taken seriously. But this is criticising the response and not the text itself, which, while extremely simple, exudes craft at every turn. The late Jóhann Jóhannsson’s synthesiser-heavy score and Benjamin Loeb’s colour-saturated cinematography delivers the promise of every great painted 1980s VHS box cover. Tricky effects, like a drugged-out sequence shot with a CRT monitor’s gloss, the slowed-down voices as Red achieves his final form and a sublime use of fonts (and a main title card that doesn’t appear until one hour in!) are pure catnip for fetishists of this milieu. Either you are one of the devoted or you’re not. You won’t know what camp you’re in until you see it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/14/italy-m5s-five-star-movement-league-parties-name-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T19:14:00Z","webTitle":"Italy’s M5S and League parties asked for more time to iron out policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/14/italy-m5s-five-star-movement-league-parties-name-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/14/italy-m5s-five-star-movement-league-parties-name-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"Italy’s M5S and League parties asked for more time to iron out policy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and far-right the League have asked for more time to form a government as they iron out policy differences. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, and his M5S counterpart, Luigi Di Maio, had been expected to present their programme to Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, and name a prime minister on Monday. Di Maio, 31, was the first to speak to Mattarella, and emerged from the meeting saying “a few more days” were needed to finalise a government contract that included a policy to scrap an increased retirement age and others that would tackle corruption and jail tax evaders. “We agree that we have to move quickly but as we are writing a programme for the next five years, it’s very important that we do it as well as possible, so we asked for a few more days,” he said. Comments from Salvini showed that the parties, which between them won more than 50% of the vote in the inconclusive elections in March, still needed to reach a compromise on various issues, namely immigration. The 45-year-old said he wanted his party to have a free rein at cracking down on “the business” of illegal immigration. He said the new administration would only begin “if it can do things”. Salvini added: “If I go into government I want to do what I promised to do. The last thing I want is to take the president and Italians for a ride.” Both he and Di Maio are keeping quiet about their choice of prime minister, indicating a struggle to agree on who could lead their coalition government. Di Maio earlier said the candidate would be “a politician and not a technician”. The pair have been locked in negotiations since Wednesday night. In line with their campaign pledges, they have reportedly reached agreement on introducing a flat tax as low as 15% and a universal basic income. They have also pledged to attempt to renegotiate European treaties. It is up to Mattarella to grant more time as well as endorse a prime minister, programme and government lineup. If the talks fail, then new elections are likely. Pointing to the rising support for the League in opinion polls, Salvini said that fresh elections would be in the party’s interests but that he would do everything to give Italians a government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/15/nightwood-conceit-torment-readers-djuna-barnes-reading-group","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T10:33:57Z","webTitle":"Nightwood: a ‘wonderful book’ – or ‘woven in conceit’ to torment readers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/15/nightwood-conceit-torment-readers-djuna-barnes-reading-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/15/nightwood-conceit-torment-readers-djuna-barnes-reading-group","fields":{"headline":"Nightwood: a ‘wonderful book’ – or ‘woven in conceit’ to torment readers?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Djuna Barnes’s Nightwood is one of the most divisive books we have tackled on the reading group. Just consider this quick selection of responses sent in over the last week: “A really wonderful book, and I’m overjoyed to see it came out of the hat.” “I still think Nightwood is an overestimated text, woven in conceit and clad with self-indulgence.” “It’s a lark.” “I wonder if it’s still in print chiefly because it’s so short and therefore suitable for tormenting students and book discussion groups.” Touché. And the uncomfortable suspicion about that last joke is that if Nightwood were actually longer, no one on Earth would finish it. (The original manuscript was 670 pages long: a terrifying prospect.) I must also give the floor to SydneyH: We asked for modernism - and boy, did we get it. Barnes throws out the rules of structure, form and even sentence construction – and that’s part of the fascination. Just as her outcast characters are trying to shrug off the shackles of early 20th-century society, so Barnes breaks the rules of prose. Sometimes it’s exhilarating. There are some glorious surprises and descriptions – here’s a description of the first chapter’s main subject, Felix: “With the fury of a fanatic he hunted down his own disqualification, rearticulating the bones of the Imperial Courts long forgotten (those long remembered can alone claim to be long forgotten), listening with an unbecoming loquacity to officials and guardians for fear that his inattention might lose him some fragment of his resuscitation.” Barnes loves contradictions. I suppose the idea of listening with loquacity is funny, even if her exact meaning is elusive. Maybe Felix is not really listening. Or he is listening and expounding on what he hears and interjecting. Nightwood takes a bit of fudging and a few mental loops, but it has a kind of charm. I’m still stumped by a “fragment of resuscitation” and there’s plenty more that I think I’m missing. But I hope that if I read the book again, I might well learn to love it. And then there are sentences like this: “She seemed to have a skin that was the pattern of her costume: a bodice of lozenges, red and yellow, low in the back and ruffled over and under the arms, faded with the reek of her three-a-day control, red tights, laced boots – one somehow felt they ran through her as the design runs through hard holiday candies, and the bulge in the groin where she took the bar, one foot caught in the flex of the calf, was as solid, specialised and polished as oak.” Barnes often deliberately severs the link between her main verbs and her subjects in these long unwieldy sentences. It’s difficult – but not without purpose. She makes you check and recheck where you are, leaving you like a booky Tantalus, eternally grasping for meaning just out of reach. TS Eliot once wrote that Nightwood is “so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry” can appreciate it. I’m still not sold – but perhaps I lack the right training. I don’t think I will ever be convinced that the line about “holiday candies” isn’t just a complicated way of repackaging the well-known expression “like writing in a stick of rock”, or other similarly overstretched similes. If that isn’t bad writing, what is it? And why make it all so elaborately tedious? I have a partial answer to that last question. Early in the book we are introduced to Dr Matthew-Mighty-grain-of-salt-Dante-O’Connor. At first he even seems more long-winded than his name – but if you stick with him, a kind of reward comes. The “incredible disorder” of his private home setting is described: “The room was so small that it was just possible to walk sideways up to the bed, it was as if being condemned to the grave the doctor had decided to occupy it with the utmost abandon.” In a few more brief lines, we understand Dr Matthew’s poverty, his thwarted medical ambitions, his secret longings. We are made to understand why he puts on such a preposterous public face: his self-promoting babble is a defence mechanism. He remains a windbag, but maybe not such an absurd one. Nightwood is full of similar moments of enlightenment and reassessment, though getting to them can be a slog. I find myself agreeing with all the opinions shared by the group; less coming down on both sides of the fence and more being impaled on the pickets. Even Eliot once said of Barnes: “Never has so much genius been combined with so little talent.” So it’s no surprise that she has divided readers – but at the very least, she’s interesting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/14/tessa-jowell-family-hail-increased-brain-cancer-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T09:02:31Z","webTitle":"Tessa Jowell's family hail increased brain cancer funding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/14/tessa-jowell-family-hail-increased-brain-cancer-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/14/tessa-jowell-family-hail-increased-brain-cancer-funding","fields":{"headline":"Tessa Jowell's family hail increased brain cancer funding","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tessa Jowell’s family have hailed a government decision to double funding for brain cancer research and roll out better diagnostic tests to all NHS hospitals in tribute to the former Labour cabinet minister, saying they hoped it could help other people survive the illness. The decision was announced by Theresa May and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, after it was announced that Jowell, who had spent the last months of her life campaigning for better treatment and diagnosis for those with brain cancer, had died aged 70. No 10 announced it would fulfil two of Jowell’s key campaign aims, including a national rollout of a brain cancer diagnosis test, gold standard dye, used to identify tumours. The method is used in only half of brain cancer centres in England. Her husband, David Mills, said the family was hugely proud of what Jowell had achieved. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “She had an extraordinarily successful career in politics, and then somehow after this disease struck her she added another 25% to it, in what she’s done to publicise the shortage of research for brain cancer, and to give people hope that they wouldn’t have had.” Jowell had sought immunotherapy treatment in Germany, and had been hoping to try a vaccine made from the DNA of her tumour, but died 36 hours after suffering a haemorrhage, Mills said. “One thing she said was, ‘If I can just survive two years at a time, or even a year at a time, new things will come along and it’ll give us new hope,’” he said. “And I think that is, in a sense, the message that is coming out now – that with this wonderful initiative from the government there will be more impetus into the research that’s necessary, and people who suffer from this disease will have a growing chance to survive.” Jowell’s daughter, Jessie Mills, said her mother had been active and in good spirits until the haemorrhage, and died peacefully. “We were with her every single moment,” she said. “We didn’t let her go for the whole of the last couple of days that she was very, very ill. We literally laid next to her, kissing her, holding her, telling her how much we loved her.” She added: “It’s the greatest honour of my life to be her daughter, and the way she was until the last moments was just so courageous and brave.” Speaking earlier on Today, Hunt said the message from Jowell had been an important one: “When it comes to rarer cancers, the issue is attracting the research funding for high quality research projects. And what Tessa identified was that we’re not putting enough into research, which is why what we’re announcing today will, we hope, catalyse more funding into research.” Downing Street has said it hoped the first symposium would take place by the end of the year. The work to fulfil the commitments will be led by health minister Lord O’Shaughnessy. Jowell met May and Hunt in Downing Street in February, when they unveiled a new £45m brain cancer research fund, with new government funding of £20m over five years. That has now been doubled with more new money to £40m, which will bring the total research fund to £65m, including £25m from Cancer Research UK and £13m of regular funding. The government also said it would speed up the use of adaptive trials – another key ask by Jowell during her House of Lords speech. “New adaptive trials can test many treatments at the same time,” she said. “They speed up the process and save a lot of money.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/14/cornish-tin-mining-cambourne-south-crofty-mine","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T08:14:22Z","webTitle":"Cornish tin mining moves closer to revival as developer plans float","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/cornish-tin-mining-cambourne-south-crofty-mine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/cornish-tin-mining-cambourne-south-crofty-mine","fields":{"headline":"Cornish tin mining moves closer to revival as developer plans float","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tin mining is set for a comeback in Cornwall, as a Canadian company that plans to reopen the South Crofty mine in 2021 announced it would float on the London stock market next month to help fund the venture. Vancouver-based Strongbow Exploration acquired the rights to the tin mine in the Cornish town of Pool in July 2016. After operating for more than 400 years, South Crofty was the last tin mine to close in the UK 20 years ago, due to a lack of investment and falling metal prices. But since then demand for tin has increased while global supply is falling, driving a 60% surge in tin prices since January 2016 to $21,000 (£15,457) a tonne. Tin is used as solder in consumer electronics and other electronic devices, electric cars and solar cells. Richard Williams, the Strongbow chief executive, said: “The company continues to advance South Crofty to a production decision, with a plan to recommence production in 2021. The project has all necessary permits in place and, as a former producing mine, offers great potential at a relatively low risk. “The global demand for tin, especially in consumer electronics, combined with current tin price forecasts, underpins Strongbow’s strategy.” He estimated that the mine would employ 275 people, in an area where jobs are scarce. While global demand for tin is expected to remain stable, supply is set to decline over the next five years as production from the world’s main producers – China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Peru – continues to fall. Strongbow is already listed in Canada and is backed by Canadian precious metals firm Osisko Gold Royalties, its biggest shareholder with a 30.6% stake. The firm will float on London’s junior Aim market in June because it needs to raise £25m over the next 18 months to fund its plans for South Crofty. The company owns a mining licence valid until 2071, has planning permission to build a new process facility and has received a loan from Osisko to construct a water treatment plant. A previous attempt to revive the mine by Baseresult Holdings, which acquired the site in 2001, failed and South Crofty was placed into administration in 2013."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/15/voters-prefer-2018-budget-to-last-years-but-labor-still-ahead-guardian-essential-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T18:00:35Z","webTitle":"Voters prefer 2018 budget to last year's but Labor still ahead – Guardian Essential poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/voters-prefer-2018-budget-to-last-years-but-labor-still-ahead-guardian-essential-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/voters-prefer-2018-budget-to-last-years-but-labor-still-ahead-guardian-essential-poll","fields":{"headline":"Voters prefer 2018 budget to last year's but Labor still ahead – Guardian Essential poll","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week’s budget has been more positively received by Australian voters than the government’s 2017 offering, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll, and more people think the major measures will be good for working people. But there is also resistance to providing tax cuts to higher income earners, and substantial resistance to the government’s controversial plan to flatten the income tax scales, as well as a degree of cynicism about the Coalition’s motives. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The poll, commissioned to chart the political impact of last week’s economic statement, finds that 44% of a sample of 1,027 respondents approved of the Coalition’s fifth budget, while 28% disapproved – which is a rosier reception than last year’s budget was given. But people on low incomes were less likely to approve of the key measures than people earning more than $2,000 a week, with 30% approval from people earning less than $600 a week compared with 51% approval from voters higher up the income scale. There is also scepticism about the practical impact. More people think the income tax cuts won’t make a difference to their household, or they won’t receive them, than think they will make a noticeable difference to their cost-of-living pressures. Only 24% of the sample thinks the budget is good for them personally (up 6% since last year). Voters under 35 and people on higher incomes are more inclined to think the tax cuts will make a real difference than other voting groups. A sizeable majority of voters, 79%, are cool on the third phase of the government’s tax plan, the controversial component of the package that would flatten the income tax scales and lead to people earning between $41,000 and $200,000 paying the same marginal tax rate. Most think people earning $200,000 should be paying a higher rate of tax than people at the bottom of the new tax bracket. The sample is divided on whether or not Australians on higher incomes should get a tax cut – 40% say yes and 44% say no. More than half the sample believes the budget is good for the well off, and a sizeable chunk think it will be good for Australian business (45%), the middle class (42%) and average working people (40%). Compared with the 2017 budget, more voters think this year’s offering, which includes tax cuts for people earning less than $87,000, will be good for average working people (up from 22% to 40%). People also feel it is positive for Australian families (up from 25% to 35%) and for people on lower incomes (up from 20% to 35%). But politics is also front of mind for many voters. A majority of the sample (62%) thinks the budget – likely to be the last one the government delivers before calling a federal election – is more about improving the government’s popularity than improving the economy. A slimmer majority (56%) thinks the budget doesn’t do enough to reduce the deficit and is more beneficial to the haves than the have-nots (54%). Compared with responses to last year’s budget, respondents were more likely to think that the 2018 outing doesn’t do enough to reduce the deficit (up 15% to 56%) and the budget is more about delivering the Coalition a sugar hit than about boosting the economy (up 11% to 62%). Even though the Guardian Essential poll the week before the budget suggested voters were more interested in governments boosting social spending than offering tax cuts, the post-budget environment has created a turnaround. Thirty-nine per cent say they support the income tax cuts over paying off debt or funding schools and hospitals, while 30% would rather investments in health and education, and 18% want deficit reduction. Low-income earners were the most negative about the budget, with 65% of people earning under $600 characterising it as disappointing while only 31% thought it was fair. In terms of its impact on the economy, and on perceptions of the government’s capacity to manage the economy, 28% said the budget increased their confidence and 23% said it decreased it – a marginally more positive response than in 2017. The results in the new Guardian Essential survey are in line with other opinion polls in suggesting that the budget has delivered no outsized turnaround in the Coalition’s sustained negative poll trend. There has been a slight positive movement in the poll’s two-party-preferred measure post-budget, with Labor now ahead of the government 52% to 48%, compared with last week when Labor was ahead 53% to 47%. That movement is inside the poll’s margin of error. The major opinion polls published by media outlets post-budget now have a spread of two-party-preferred results, with Ipsos (Fairfax Media) putting Labor ahead 54% to 46%, Newspoll (News Corp) putting Labor ahead 51% to 49%, and Guardian Essential falling between the other two surveys. The government has now lost 32 consecutive Newspolls, although recent surveys suggest either a tightening of the contest or a sharper measurement of the distribution of preferences. The government did not win a Guardian Essential poll during 2017, and has not prevailed in any survey this year. Despite the regular hype about so-called budget “bounces”, they rarely deliver an immediate political result. But the Coalition is hoping the $140bn it has promised over a decade in personal income tax cuts for both low- and middle-income earners, and higher earners down the track, will mark the start of a political recovery that will project it positively into a federal campaign. Bill Shorten used his budget reply speech last week to up the ante over tax cuts to low- and middle-income earners, almost doubling the government’s proposed cash rebate, and promising more generous social spending, funded by medium-term savings and revenue measures. Both Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull will face considerable pressure in coming months. The dual citizenship imbroglio has triggered a handful of byelections in marginal seats – a mini-election over the coming weeks, where both sides will campaign on their respective tax plans. The prime minister can call an election any time after August but has been at pains to send a public signal that the real poll test won’t be until early in 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/14/hunt-tells-johnson-to-keep-brexit-rows-private","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T11:05:46Z","webTitle":"Hunt tells Johnson to keep Brexit rows private","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/14/hunt-tells-johnson-to-keep-brexit-rows-private","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/14/hunt-tells-johnson-to-keep-brexit-rows-private","fields":{"headline":"Hunt tells Johnson to keep Brexit rows private","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The health secretary has told Boris Johnson to keep his disagreements over Brexit private, warning that open expressions of dissent could mean a worse deal for the UK. In one of the strongest public rebuffs to the foreign secretary by a fellow cabinet minister, Jeremy Hunt told Johnson he should maintain collective cabinet responsibility and “work as a team”. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about Johnson’s dismissal of Theresa May’s preferred post-Brexit customs solution as “crazy”, Hunt said this had not been helpful. “It’s important that we have these debates in private, not just because of collective responsibility – which is what democracy depends on – but also because this is a negotiation,” Hunt said. “And so, on the EU side, if they see divisions in the open, then they will exploit that.” Asked if Johnson should resign, Hunt said no, but argued that this was, in part, because the foreign secretary was one of the architects of the UK’s decision to leave the EU and should therefore see the process through. “I think he has a very, very important role to play in government, and he is the architect of the whole Brexit campaign,” Hunt said. “And we are listening to what he said and we are doing what he wants.” Hunt continued: “But I just think that we also have to recognise we’re not the only people who read the papers, in Britain. They’re read all over the world and we need to give Theresa May some space. “We’re going to have very lively debates, right the way through until 28 March next year, and probably beyond. But … we should probably have them in private, because that will strengthen Theresa May’s negotiating position.” Asked whether his message was, in summary, “Boris belt up”, Hunt replied: “You could say that. I’d say he’s a marvellous foreign secretary, let’s work as a team.” Hunt’s comments come before a cross-party campaign against a hard Brexit launches next week;the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, the ex-Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and the former Tory cabinet minister Nicky Morgan will share a platform at an event next Monday. Miliband told Today that the trio were getting together because of a “national crisis” over Brexit. “The UK has no negotiating position on the fundamental issues that face the country as it contemplates its Brexit relationship with the European Union,” he said. With only 120 days to go before a European council meeting at which a deal will be decided, “the truth is that Britain is being held to ransom by the demand for hard Brexit”, said Miliband, who runs an aid charity in New York. He said there was a strong argument for the UK to stay both in the customs union and the European Economic Area (EEA) after Brexit. He urged Labour to support a Lords amendment passed last week seeking continued UK membership of the EEA. “The Labour position was not to support that,” Miliband said. “And the warning for Jeremy Corbyn is that if he’s not very careful, he will be the midwife of a hard Brexit that threatens the living standards of the very people that he says he wants to stand up to represent.” May faces a significant split ahead of a crucial meeting this week of her Brexit inner cabinet over whether to push ahead with a customs partnership, in which the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU in an attempt to minimise the impact on the Irish border, or opt for a so-called maximum facilitation model, which would seek to use technology instead. Speaking on Radio 4’s Westminster Hour on Sunday, May’s former de facto deputy, Damian Green, suggested one solution might be to go for maximum facilitation but with some sort of extended transition period for it to work. “I think the most likely endpoint will be some of what’s called the maximum facilitation, some variant of that,” he said. “I, personally, am not yet convinced that you could have that in place by the end of 2020, at the end of the implementation period, and, therefore, you might need to bolt on to that another period, a sort of transition period into that, so that we know not only that it works, but that it works from day one. It was, Green added, “not the time for members of the cabinet or anyone else inside the Conservative party to indulge in ideology” over such issues. it had flaws and needed to be tested."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/13/european-roundup-barcelona-unbeaten-record-goes-levante","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T20:55:27Z","webTitle":"European round-up: Barcelona lose unbeaten record after 5-4 Levante defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/13/european-roundup-barcelona-unbeaten-record-goes-levante","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/13/european-roundup-barcelona-unbeaten-record-goes-levante","fields":{"headline":"European round-up: Barcelona lose unbeaten record as Levante win  5-4","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Barcelona’s hopes of an unbeaten La Liga campaign were ended in their penultimate game as they lost 5-4 at Levante. The champions had gone 36 games unbeaten but trailed 5-1 after 56 minutes and their dramatic fightback came up short. Emmanuel Boateng’s hat-trick and Enis Bardhi’s double put Levante in charge and, despite Philippe Coutinho completing a hat-trick of his own and Luis Suárez scoring a penalty, Barça’s bid for history came up short. Fifth-bottom Levante had won their last four matches but were not meant to be a threat as Barça, who rested Lionel Messi, aimed to become the first team to remain unbeaten in a 38-game La Liga season. But the hosts took the lead through Boateng after nine minutes and the Ghanaian rounded Marc-André ter Stegen to add a second in the 31st minute. Coutinho pulled one back seven minutes before the break with a deflected effort from the edge of the area but Levante started the second half in style. Bardhi found the top corner 33 seconds after the break and Boateng completed his treble three minutes later after being played in by Antonio Luna. Bardhi then added his second to make it 5-1, curling the ball into the far-left corner from Roger’s pass. Coutinho reduced the deficit three minutes later from close range and completed his first Barça hat-trick with 26 minutes left with another deflected effort from range. Suárez converted from the spot in the 71st minute after Sergio Busquets was fouled from a corner to make it 5-4 but Ernesto Valverde’s side could not find a late leveller and keep their run going. In Italy Juventus wrapped up their seventh successive Serie A title and fourth league and cup double in a row with one match to spare when a 0-0 draw at Roma gave them the point they needed. The Turin side, who won the Coppa Italia on Wednesday with a 4-0 win over Milan at the same Stadio Olimpico, took a four-point lead over second-placed Napoli with one match to play. Napoli will finish as runners-up for the second time in the last three seasons after winning 2-0 at Sampdoria in a match briefly interrupted in the second half because of anti-Neapolitan chants by home supporters. Juventus maintained their perfect domestic record in their four seasons under Massimiliano Allegri. They have also reached two Champions League finals in that period. Roma, already qualified for next season’s Champions League, dominated the first half and Edin Dzeko and Radja Nainggolan just missed the target as the hosts looked dangerous. Paulo Dybala had the ball in the net two minutes after half-time but he was fractionally offside and Roma were reduced to 10 men when Nainggolan, already booked, was sent off for an ugly foul on Dybala in the 68th minute.

Can a new initiative bring change?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Though America has seen a string of mass shootings over the past year, no gun control legislation has been passed at the federal level. Three months after 17 people were killed and 17 injured at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, leading to a national push for reform led by student survivors, the debate has shifted, from Capitol Hill to states across the country. As November’s midterm elections approach, advocates of stricter gun laws hope to place the issue directly into the hands of voters. States such as Oregon and Washington will consider ballot initiatives including a ban on assault rifles and raising the minimum age for purchasing certain kinds of gun. Activists increasingly believe the issue will be litigated at the state level, given the National Rifle Association’s strength in Washington. After all, polling has found that voters are broadly supportive of modest gun restrictions, a trend that has held since the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 children and six adults were killed. “It’s not surprising that people are turning to the ballot to address gun safety,” said Donna De La Cruz, a spokeswoman at the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a progressive group that focuses on ballot measure campaigns. “In poll after poll, commonsense gun laws are overwhelmingly popular.” “Many politicians are too beholden to the NRA to address the gun violence epidemic,” De La Cruz said, noting that the 2018 elections will see “a classic use of ballot measures to enact important reforms that corporate-controlled legislatures are unwilling to pass”. The ballot initiative process typically requires petitioners to secure a minimum number of signatures from registered voters, in order to force a referendum. Efforts to pass new gun laws this way have still proved contentious. In 2016, groups on both sides of the debate poured millions into two ballot initiatives. In Maine, voters rejected mandated background checks on all gun sales. In Nevada, a similar proposal was narrowly approved, only to be blocked by the state’s Republican attorney general. At least a dozen states have tightened firearm regulations since Sandy Hook. About twice as many, however, have taken steps to loosen gun laws. This year, an initiative in Oregon that would ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines is prompting a backlash. Local officials said they received a record public response to the measure, Initiative Petition 43, during a two-week comment period. Many comments expressed opposition to the proposal; some expressed criticism over the use of the phrase “assault rifles”; others questioned the measure’s legality. The petitioners had planned to target the 2020 elections, but moved up their plans following the shooting in Parkland. In Washington, an initiative was mounted after legislators failed to pass legislation to expand background checks and raise the age limit for purchasing assault weapons. Increasing the age limit for the purchase of such rifles from 18 to 21 has picked up steam since Parkland. The 19-year-old gunman, Nikolas Cruz, passed a background check that enabled him to purchase the AR-15-style weapon he used. “There’s a lot of momentum,” the Washington state attorney general, Bob Ferguson, told a local news channel. “I’d be surprised if there wasn’t a serious attempt made to put some combination of those proposals on the ballot because the legislature simply won’t do it. People deserve a vote.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/13/pianist-lauren-zhang-wins-bbc-young-musician-of-the-year","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T21:11:32Z","webTitle":"Pianist Lauren Zhang wins BBC Young Musician 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/13/pianist-lauren-zhang-wins-bbc-young-musician-of-the-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/13/pianist-lauren-zhang-wins-bbc-young-musician-of-the-year","fields":{"headline":"Pianist Lauren Zhang wins BBC Young Musician","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A 16-year-old pianist has won this year’s BBC Young Musician award. Lauren Zhang, who lives and studies in Birmingham, competed against 18-year-old saxophonist Robert Burton and 18-year-old cellist Maxim Calver to win the title in the 40th year of the competition. She performed Prokofiev’s 2nd Piano Concerto in G minor, op.16 with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mark Wigglesworth. The judges praised her performance of a hugely challenging and ambitious work: “Her exceptional level of technical skill and intelligent musicality shone through in a beast of a piece,” said Kerry Andrew, chair of the judging panel. “She has a natural genuine musicianship … and a real intelligence,” said violinist and previous winner Nicola Benedetti. Lauren said: “I’m astonished … I can’t quite believe it! It’s been a fantastic opportunity to play with the CBSO and the journey right from the start of the competition has been incredible.” Lauren is currently studying for her GCSEs at King Edward VI High School for Girls – she has three exams on Tuesday – and also attends the Birmingham Junior Conservatoire. She began learning the piano at the age of four and also plays the violin. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Lauren and her family moved to Birmingham in 2010. At the Junior Conservatoire she is taught by Robert Markham, who himself was a finalist in the BBC Young Musician competition in 1986. Principal of the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire Julian Lloyd Webber said: “Having spent a lifetime making music with some of the world’s finest musicians I can honestly say that Lauren is up there with the best – she is a total phenomenon.” She is a compelling performer, said concert pianist Tom Poster, one of the judges in the keyboard final. “As she played, there was an electricity in the room. People were really listening.” Judging Sunday’s final alongside Andrew were conductor Alpesh Chauhan, cellist Natalie Clein, saxophonist John Harle and pianist Sunwook Kim. Also at Birmingham’s Symphony Hall to hand over the trophy, and perform himself for the audience while the judges conferred, was 2016’s winner Sheku Kanneh-Mason. His 15-year-old sister Jeneba was one of this year’s keyboard category finalists. Lauren will be performing on the BBC Radio 3 stage at BBC Music’s The Biggest Weekend in Coventry on 28 May and at the Young Musician 40th anniversary concert at the Proms on 15 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/14/california-battered-by-global-warmings-weather-whiplash-is-fighting-to-stop-it","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T10:00:25Z","webTitle":"California, battered by global warming’s weather whiplash, is fighting to stop it | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/14/california-battered-by-global-warmings-weather-whiplash-is-fighting-to-stop-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/14/california-battered-by-global-warmings-weather-whiplash-is-fighting-to-stop-it","fields":{"headline":"California, battered by global warming’s weather whiplash, is fighting to stop it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 1988 – the same year Nasa’s James Hansen warned Congress about the threats posed by human-caused global warming – water expert Peter Gleick wrote about the wet and dry extremes that it would create for California: California will get the worst of all possible worlds – more flooding in the winter, less available water in the summer. Three decades later, California has been ravaged by just this sort of weather whiplash. The state experienced its worst drought in over a millennium from 2012 to 2016, followed immediately by its wettest year on record in 2017. The consequences have been similarly extreme, including hellish record wildfires, narrowly-avoided catastrophic flooding at Oroville Dam, and deadly mudslides. A study published last month in Nature Climate Change found that these wet and dry extremes will only worsen in California as temperatures continue to rise. As lead author Daniel Swain wrote: most of California will likely experience a 100 – 200% increase in the frequency of very wet November-March “rainy seasons” … California will likely experience an increase of anywhere from 50% to 150% (highest in the south) in the frequency of very dry November-March periods … Since California is so dependent on precipitation during its relatively brief winter rainy season, even a single dry winter can quickly lead to adverse drought impacts upon agriculture and the environment. Last week, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment also published a report detailing the indicators and impacts of climate change on California. The most dramatic impacts include wildfires that are larger and more frequent, and the most severe drought since recordkeeping began. Underlying these events is a long-term warming trend that has accelerated since the mid-1970s. In addition, spring snowmelt runoff is decreasing, sea levels are rising, glaciers are shrinking, lakes and ocean waters are warming, and plants and animals are migrating. In short, climate change will continue to have severe consequences for California, whose economy recently surpassed that of the UK to become the fifth-largest in the world. But the state has also become a leader in trying to minimize those climate damages. California’s global warming solutions In 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act into law, whose most significant component was a carbon cap and trade system. The bill required California to reduce its greenhouse gas pollution to 1990 levels by 2020, and the state is on track to meet that goal despite a growing population and thriving economy with an $8.8bn surplus. California has proved that an economy can thrive with a price on carbon pollution in place. In 2016, California passed an update to the California Global Warming Solutions Act requiring a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas pollution by 2030 on the way to the target 80% reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. California’s annual per capita emissions (11.5 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per person) are currently on par with those of Germany and Japan, and 40% lower than the US average. California is investing in climate change solutions, like pilot projects using farms to sequester carbon. More than half of the state’s electricity is generated by carbon-free sources (21% hydroelectric, 12% solar, 9% nuclear, 6% wind, 6% geothermal), and another 43% comes from natural gas. While California can take steps to further reduce the greenhouse gas pollution from its electric power (for example, it just became the first state to require solar panels on new homes), electricity now comprises less than 20% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the biggest culprit, now accounting for 37%. That’s why California’s war with the EPA over vehicle fuel efficiency standards is so important. With its low-carbon power grid mix, California can achieve significant transportation emissions cuts by transitioning to electric cars. So far they comprise about 4.5% of the state’s vehicle fleet (340,000 electric cars), well above the national average of 1.1%, but with a long way to go yet. The state’s goal is to have 1.5m electric cars on the road by 2025 and 5m by 2030, with a $2.5bn initiative to install another quarter million charging stations in California to meet the growing electric vehicle infrastructure needs. America should follow California’s lead California has become a leader both in experiencing climate change impacts and taking action to mitigate them. The state has provided a perfect example that contrary to current Republican Party beliefs, climate change has serious economic and human costs, whereas economies can thrive after putting a price on carbon pollution. America needs leaders with the foresight of California’s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/bafta-tv-awards-2018-full-list-of-winners","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T20:17:00Z","webTitle":"Bafta TV awards 2018: full list of winners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/bafta-tv-awards-2018-full-list-of-winners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/bafta-tv-awards-2018-full-list-of-winners","fields":{"headline":"Bafta TV awards 2018: full list of winners","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Drama series The Crown (Netflix) End of the F***ing World (Channel 4) Line of Duty (BBC One) Peaky Blinders (BBC) -

The ancient ride I’ve been following through a corner of the Bigland Hall estate is covered in fog. Normally my compass’s needle points to magnetic north no matter which way I turn. Today? Useless. The needle spins around like a roulette wheel. With visibility down to a few metres, I’m lost. I have the verges to guide me, but is the Flookburgh-Haverthwaite road still to my right? Or have I inadvertently turned through 180 degrees, so that the B5278 is now to my left and I am walking back the way I came? A ghostly apparition looms ahead, materialising into someone I know. It’s Martin “Bilbo” Bagness, former coach of the British orienteering team. Who better to confirm whether I’m heading in the right direction. He is mapping the terrain for a future race. More detailed than their Ordnance Survey counterparts, his maps help orienteers choose their own routes on the hoof. Runners have to visit checkpoints in a set order, but how they get there is up to them. Some may prefer to take challenging short cuts, through trees, say; others to circumnavigate obstacles. It’s not for nothing that the sport’s nickname is “cunning running”. By Bigland Tarn, which I now see appearing in lifting mist, a runner can align the tarn’s shape on the map with its actual watery configuration. Once so orientated, the map identifies terrain features in every direction. When I mention my recalcitrant compass, Bilbo laughs. Orienteers call this the Bigland Triangle. There’s an underground metal pipe here that deflects the compasses that every runner needs to carry. As visibility returns and with it the limpid haze-free light that photographers crave, I am rewarded with the distant bulk of Ulverston’s Hoad Hill, with its 100ft replica of the Eddystone lighthouse commemorating Sir John Barrow (1764 1848), the town’s most famous son. Having learned to navigate by the stars and the sun as a boy, he went on to become a naval administrator and traveller, and mapped tracts of South Africa never depicted before. He would surely have approved of orienteering."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/21/country-diary-adders-place-in-sun-aigas-highlands","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T04:30:15Z","webTitle":"Country diary: adders find their place in the Scottish sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/21/country-diary-adders-place-in-sun-aigas-highlands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/21/country-diary-adders-place-in-sun-aigas-highlands","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: adders find their place in the Scottish sun","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Warmth is what it takes, that’s all. Every spring that first burst of sun in clear skies brings our adders back to life. In common with most other reptiles the world over, Vipera berus has to warm up. They are cold-blooded and have been hibernating underground for more than six months. Their metabolism will have all but closed down. They need to fire it up again. I once found one inside a dry-stone wall I was repairing – cold, curled and comatose. I carefully put it to one side before returning it to the depths of the wall to complete its hibernation. With the warming soil, adders wake up and very slowly slither out to see what the new world has to offer. One assumes that they must be very hungry, but hunting for mice or voles takes action – which requires a warm-up to get the cold blood flowing. So they head for a rock in full sun. They wait until the stone has absorbed some heat and then out they come, into full view, each basking reptile gloriously happy to be warm. So out I went one afternoon a couple of weeks ago, a day of full sun to a cheering 19C. Up on to the moor, to a large exposed rock where I have seen adders many times over many years. I knelt to feel the stone. Perfect: a deep warmth issuing to my palm. But not a snake to be seen. I walked on, keeping my jack russells, Nip and Tuck, obediently to heel. Ten minutes later Tuck growled. There on a rock a few feet away, neatly coiled like a braided rope, head resting on the fattest coil, black eyes gleaming and bifid tongue flicking, was the most exquisite male adder I have ever seen. His long dorsal zig of pure jet zagged against a ground of pale lemon like winterkilled grass. He was magnificent. I stepped back and hauled the dogs in to my feet. He had seen us, no doubt about it, but wasn’t budging. This was his moment, his warm-up.

Trump’s most senior foreign policy aides signalled that the US would continue pressuring allies to follow Washington in backing out of the pact, which gave Tehran relief from sanctions in exchange for halting its nuclear programme. John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, predicted that “the Europeans will see that it’s in their interests to come along with us” rather than continue with the 2015 deal, under which major European corporations have signed billions of dollars of contracts in Iran. Asked on CNN’s State of the Union whether that meant the Trump administration would impose sanctions against those firms, Bolton said: “It’s possible. It depends on the conduct of other governments.” US sanctions on Iran reimposed following Trump’s withdrawal not only block American firms from doing business in the country, but also bar foreign firms that do business there from accessing the entire US banking and financial system. Mike Pompeo, Trump’s secretary of state, said on Sunday wealth created in Iran under the terms of the nuclear deal “drove Iranian malign activity” in the region. He declined to rule out sanctions against European firms. “The sanctions regime that is in place now is very clear on what the requirements are,” Pompeo said on Fox News Sunday. Trump’s decision to scrap the nuclear deal was sharply criticised by European leaders, who have pledged to uphold their side of the agreement. Alarm has been particularly high in France, whose energy giant Total last year signed a $5bn deal to extract Iranian natural gas. Airbus, the French-based plane manufacturer, has already begun delivering jets to Iran Air under a multibillion-dollar contract. Volkswagen, the German automaker, has resumed exporting cars to Iran. Richard Grenell, the new US ambassador to Berlin, warned this week in a tweet: “German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.” Some European leaders have called for measures to nullify the US sanctions. Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said last week: “We have to work among ourselves in Europe to defend our European economic sovereignty.” European Union officials have indicated they may threaten similar measures to those that pressured then president Bill Clinton to give waivers to European companies under US sanctions on countries such as Cuba during the 1990s. Trump himself hinted that there would be no concessions to European firms during remarks at the White House last week in which he confirmed the US withdrawal, which he promised during the 2016 presidential campaign. “We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanctions,” Trump said. “Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.” Trump claimed the nuclear deal was “decaying and rotten” despite general consensus that Iran was complying with it, had dismantled its nuclear programme and was allowing international inspections. Trump officials also complained about clauses in the deal that would have relaxed restrictions on Iran after about a decade. On Sunday, Bolton asked on ABC’s This Week: “Why would any business, why would the shareholders of any business, want to do business with the world’s central banker of international terrorism?” The US has said it will allow “wind-down periods” of 90 to 180 days, depending on the industry involved, for companies to scrap existing contracts in Iran. New business deals have been immediately barred. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has embarked on a tour of the deal’s other member states. He spoke hopefully in Beijing on Sunday, alongside Chinese officials. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said Trump’s decision was a “violation of morals” but said his country would remain in the deal. “If the remaining five countries continue to abide by the agreement, Iran will remain in the deal despite the will of America,” Rouhani said, in remarks broadcast on state television. Doubt has been cast over the survival of the deal by senior Iranian clerics and Revolutionary Guard officials. On Sunday, Theresa May told Rouhani in a phone call that Britain and its European partners will remain committed to the deal as long as Tehran continues to meet its obligations. The British, German, French and Iranian foreign ministers are due to meet in Brussels on Tuesday. Late on Sunday, Trump returned to the issue on Twitter. “Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place,” he wrote. “They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now, that will not happen!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/13/tottenham-hotspur-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T16:23:45Z","webTitle":"Tottenham fight back to beat Leicester in thriller and seal third spot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/13/tottenham-hotspur-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/13/tottenham-hotspur-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham fight back to beat Leicester in thriller and seal third spot","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Tottenham support chanted that they were going home and there is excitement among their number at the prospect of returning to the rebuilt White Hart Lane next season. Yet what a send-off they gave to Wembley. The merits of the club’s temporary accommodation at the national stadium have been a talking point throughout a season that has finished with them securing third place in the Premier League and a third consecutive Champions League qualification. Spurs started badly at Wembley but they grew into the old place and they can look back on a handful of outstanding wins against Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal in the league, plus Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid in the Champions League. On the other hand the three defeats that Mauricio Pochettino feels have scarred the season were also here – against Juventus in the Champions League, Manchester City in the league and Manchester United in the FA Cup. This victory against a spirited Leicester City will stand the test of time mainly for its wackiness. The entertainment value, however, was rich. On an afternoon when defending was clearly not a part of either team’s plans, Tottenham trailed 3-1 before storming back to lead 4-3 thanks to a pair of Erik Lamela goals and an unwitting assist from him for the other one. Jamie Vardy found the equaliser for Leicester with his second of the game before Harry Kane – who else? – sealed it for Spurs with a second of his own. Tottenham had invited a host of their former players to the game and one of them, Paul Gascoigne, who was presented on the pitch at half-time, could be seen performing The Floss dance up in the stands when Kane’s winner went in. Around him Gary Mabbutt smiled, Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa applauded and Dimitar Berbatov just looked cool. Kane finished with 30 league goals for the season but it was not enough to overhaul Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah in the race for the Golden Boot. Kane had won the award in the previous two seasons with 25 and 29 goals. Leicester played a full part in a see‑saw spectacle and they will wonder how they went home with nothing other than a fifth defeat in seven league matches. The focus will now turn to the future of the manager, Claude Puel, but it is fair to say that his players performed for him here. “Speculation is not my area,” Puel said. “We need stability. I will try to make this work. This is just the second time in 18 years we have finished in the first half of the table.” The game exploded into life at the outset, with Vardy in the mood. He put Leicester in front with a flicked header from Riyad Mahrez’s free-kick but Tottenham hit back when Danny Simpson’s loose pass hit Lucas Moura and Kane was away. He beat Eldin Jakupovic with a low shot inside the near post. Tottenham had lost Jan Vertonghen to a calf problem in the warm-up and so Pochettino reshuffled, bringing Victor Wanyama into the line-up in midfield and dropping Eric Dier back to central defence, where he partnered Toby Alderweireld. Kyle Walker‑Peters enjoyed a rare opportunity at right‑back and he suffered, at times, defensively yet he looked good going forward. It was pretty much the story of every player’s day. Leicester were back in charge with 16 minutes on the clock and the goal owed much to an incision from Kelechi Iheanacho. Walker-Peters and Vardy challenged for a loose ball and, when it broke for Mahrez, he banged past Hugo Lloris. Leicester ought to have been further in front on 26 minutes but Demarai Gray could not beat Lloris when one-on-one, after Vardy’s lovely touch. Spurs were booed off by some of their supporters at the interval. It was even crazier in the second half, with Iheanacho making it 3-1 with the goal of the game – a precision left-footed drive into the top corner, after holding off Wanyama, which is no mean feat. Game over? Not at all. Spurs were in front 13 minutes later. Lamela scored his team’s second and fourth goals from low Walker‑Peters crosses while the equaliser for 3-3 came when Harry Maguire jumped into a challenge on him. The ball ricocheted off Lamela and went in off Christian Fuchs for an own goal. Back came Leicester and after Lloris had saved brilliantly to keep out Iheanacho, Mahrez ushered in Vardy, who finished explosively into the near top corner. Kane created the winner for himself with a move that sent the Leicester substitute, Hamza Choudhury off towards Brent Cross. He bent his shot expertly into the far corner. Though Vardy fired high when well placed in stoppage-time, there would be no further twists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/13/tessa-jowell-did-exceptional-work-for-those-whod-lost-loved-ones","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T16:56:49Z","webTitle":"Tessa Jowell did exceptional work for those who’d lost loved ones | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/13/tessa-jowell-did-exceptional-work-for-those-whod-lost-loved-ones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/13/tessa-jowell-did-exceptional-work-for-those-whod-lost-loved-ones","fields":{"headline":"Tessa Jowell did exceptional work for those who’d lost loved ones","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tributes have rightly been paid to Tessa Jowell’s courage and inspiration to others during her last illness after the diagnosis in 2017 that she had the most aggressive form of brain cancer (Tessa Jowell dies aged 70, 13 May). Much has also been said about her career as an MP and minister, as the key player in the team that brought the 2012 Olympics to London and then, from 2015, in the Lords. Less has been said about her inspirational role as a champion of those who were affected by loss of loved ones on 9/11 when the then prime minister, Tony Blair, asked her to take on the role of humanitarian minister in addition to her role as secretary of state for culture, media and sport. Tessa was there in 2005 after the 7 July London bombings supporting those who had lost loved ones and those who were injured, so often in life-changing ways. She was there to support them in every way she could and was also unstinting in her encouragement for the work of the London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund, LET’s predecessor from 2005 to 2008. Tessa also helped to actively organise the 10th anniversary remembrance events on 7 July 2015, both the service in St Paul’s Cathedral and the memorial event in Hyde Park that day. She played a key role with those she had got to know in 2005 and had stayed in touch with regularly since that time. Had it not been for her illness, I am confident that she would have wanted to be involved supporting those affected by the terrorist events in London and Manchester in 2017 as well as supporting the residents of Grenfell Tower. She was exceptional in many ways and will be greatly missed. We pay tribute to her and offer many thanks again for her warmth and humanity.

On his arrival in the UK, Erdoğan, who is in the midst of a high-stakes domestic election campaign, insisted that Anglo-Turkish relations were going from strength to strength and would develop even more after Brexit. Human rights campaigners, opposition politicians and exiled Turkish businessmen have called on Britain to denounce the Turkish government’s systematic arrest of journalists, opposition politicians and human rights campaigners in an anti-terrorist dragnet. Britain is eager to show that a post-Brexit “global Britain” will be a close ally of Turkey, a Nato partner, and has taken a strategic bet on Erdoğan’s survival ever since the failed military coup in July 2016 designed to dislodge him from power. The UK was the first to send a minister to Turkey in solidarity with Erdoğan, an act of friendship not forgotten in Ankara. Erdoğan arrived at RAF Brize Norton on Sunday lunchtime. His state visit is expected to include a joint press conference with May, a speech at the prestigious thinktank Chatham House, and a meeting with the Queen at Buckingham Palace. Speaking in Reading at the annual Turkish-British Tatlıdil Forum on Sunday, he said Turkey and the UK were “fighting shoulder to shoulder as responsible nations to defeat terrorism”, adding: “Our partnership in the defence industry is the best example of what we can achieve together.” He said: “We want to continue our economic relations as the governments of Turkey and the United Kingdom without interruptions after Brexit.” The aim, he said, is to boost trade from $16bn (£11.8bn) to $20bn (£14.7bn) a year. The UK is especially eager to make progress on a BAE Systems deal to provide technology for the first phase of development of a Turkish-made fighter jet. The EU minister Ömer Çelik also warned that the EU would be much weaker as a result of the UK leaving, and held out the hope of framing a new trade deal with the UK. Britain’s enthusiasm for closer economic ties is balanced by unease at the way Turkey is seeking to weaken Kurdish fighters operating in northern Syria. Britain argues that the western-backed Syrian Kurds should not necessarily be seen as the same as Kurds fighting for independence inside Turkey. The UK is also trying to prevent Turkey’s burgeoning political ties with Russia building into a military relationship. The visit had been arranged prior to Erdoğan’s decision to bring forward the date of presidential elections by a year to 24 June, and the tour runs the risk of being used as a backdrop to his election campaign. Many senior Turkish politicians, by contrast, have been banned from campaigning in other other European countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. Erdoğan won a referendum last year that will give the next elected president unprecedented personal powers, as part of a switch from a parliamentary to presidential system of government. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, denounced the visit. “The UK has a strong, proud history of democracy and human rights, but our reputation on the world stage is in danger of being eroded by this Conservative government’s desire to woo world leaders like [Donald] Trump and Erdoğan,” he said. “May’s administration appears to have substituted diplomacy for sycophancy in its pursuit of Brexit.” “By permitting a state visit and audience with the Queen, May and Boris Johnson are essentially rolling out the red carpet for a man with a disregard for human rights, who is responsible for alarming oppression and violence.” In the latest crackdown on free speech, Turkish ministers have warned Twitter not to allow the use of hashtags that are critical of the president. Last week, a hashtag meaning “enough” went viral after Erdoğan said he would quit if the Turkish people said they had had enough of his leadership. In a sign of how the bloody coup has upended Turkish politics, Hamdi Akin Ipek, the chair of a London-based company called Koza and once one of Turkey’s richest businessmen, has written to May to complain about Erdoğan’s abuse of human rights. Now exiled in London, Ipek said newspapers and broadcast channels he owned were closed by the state in 2015 in what he says is a series of steps to eliminate not just his business, but all internal opposition. The Turkish government claims Ipek is an ally of the exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen, who it says ran a secret network inside Turkey to mount a coup to overthrown the elected government. Ipek said: “A human rights crisis has been created in Turkey,” which he says “ought to bring shame on the community of civilised nations”. Ipek said his brother “has been in jail for two years without hope of access to justice, along with hundreds of other businessmen, judges, civil servants and journalists who are being kept in custody for no other reason than the fact they are perceived as enemies”. Ipek urged May to use Erdoğan’s visit to call for an end to the unacceptable human rights abuses, the release of those imprisoned without evidence of any crime, and an end to the state of emergency. All civil society was being abolished, he said. He added that some of his staff who relocated to London feared for the safety of their families in Turkey. • This article was amended on 13 May 2018 to correct the name of the Chairman of the company Koza.

British education is not intended to prepare children for life: it is structured to exclude those who don’t really understand what is required of them. The intention is not to reduce inequality, but to reward the existence of inequality. Our economy continues to discard individuals and groups that fail to generate a sustainable personal income. Benefit payments are being withdrawn to encourage people to work more effectively or, alternatively, to reduce their standard of living to match their work contribution. Two thousand years ago, to quell discontent, the Roman emperor, August, decreed that the recipients of the free monthly dole of grain would increase to one fifth of the population. The Tories are currently implementing cuts in free grain, free education and free healthcare. Brexit will mean a cut in benefits. The conclusion will not be pretty. Martin London Henllan, Denbighshire • In one sense the proposed expansion of grammar school places represents a failure of nerve. If Damian Hinds really believes in the case he’s presenting (Report, 11 May), he and his government would be seeking to reverse the grammar school ban in the Commons but they know that would be defeated. In a second sense it’s a massive, if misguided, assertion of nerve: how has he the nerve to find extra millions for selective education at a time of a national schools funding crisis. Professor Colin Richards Spark Bridge, Cumbria • So the government is giving money to expand grammar schools for the benefit of “disadvantaged pupils”. These pupils are 11 years old. This is the government that has spent years pulling the rug out from under these same children – from the closure of Sure Start to the welfare changes – with the consequent rise in the numbers of children living in poverty. No child in wealthy Britain should be “disadvantaged” at 11 years old and addressing that from birth is surely the job of government. Alison Pierce Buxted, East Sussex • Your headline “Make working-class education a priority” (10 May) should read “make higher education a priority for the working class”. If we had a better thought-out education system where the process of learning enthused all children, there would be no need for this patronising headline. I would like to see a process of learning, and a choice of content, being developed for the 50% that cannot obtain a place, nor wish to take up a place, in a university. What we need is a system of learning where an individual, at any point in their lives, can gain qualifications, or just improve their education, with the necessary support. This safety net was provided by a nationwide adult education service that no longer exists in any kind of meaningful way, and its erstwhile partner the Open University now also appears to be under threat. The present government appears to be aligning itself with the first Education Act in the late 19th century, which required workers to be literate in order to feed the economic machine. Not much different from promoting the degrees that businesses say they need. David Selby Winchester, Hampshire • Keen to highlight that his new policy “provides access to world-class education”, Damian Hinds glosses over the UK’s geography, the many counties with no such provision, the vast majority of schools conveniently concentrated in the most affluent areas of the UK. Only those who indulge in Tory spin would agree this benefits families of all backgrounds and locations. What is apparent is that this government is not living up to Hinds’ promise of “helping all schools grow”. Children in mainstream primary and secondary education have seen £2.8bn of cuts since 2015, with further cuts planned by 2020 – cuts that will have a profound effect on an entire generation. There is nothing world class about that. Bridget James Swaffham, Norfolk • Your brief five lines on the government’s retention of the 50% cap on religious selection at free schools does scant justice to this humiliating retreat from an ill-considered commitment. Both main parties persist in favouring faith schools despite their wide unpopularity – a poll a year ago showed that 80% of the public wanted to keep the cap (including 67% of Catholics) and an earlier poll for the Westminster Faith Debates found 45% against and only 32% in favour of any government funding of faith schools. No doubt the parties reckon the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church are too powerful to be tangled with. This unlikely victory for cohesion and inclusiveness, following a sustained and widely supported campaign led by Humanists UK, may bring politicians at last to realise that the churches’ historic control of one-third of our schools is not unchallengeable after all. The case against faith schools has been made time and again – they are religiously, socially and ethnically divisive, owe their marginally better academic results solely to their selective admissions practices, and too often deny pupils a balanced education in sensitive areas. Yet almost every penny they spend is provided by the public. All the arguments are there for the courageous party that dares to call the churches’ bluff – as the bluff has now been called of a notably deceptive and self-interested campaign by the Catholic Education Service. David Pollock London • It would have been interesting in the interview with Dominic Grieve (Journal, 12 May) if he had been asked how his original proposal to remove the 50% cap for faith schools (now to remain in place) and the allowing of free schools who can have 100% faith-based admissions square with the government’s aim to encourage community cohesion.

Chvrches – named, after all, for a place of communion – specialise in sonic succour. There’s no false salvation for disheartening times to be found in the Glasgow trio’s third album, but a battery of bright, rallying choruses that break free of sludgy despair. Lead single Get Out is a punchy plea for release from ruts personal and political, Graves a raging against apathy, Deliverance a crisp warning against the presumptions of religion. All this comes wrapped in their most seductive package yet. Over two self-produced top 10 albums, Lauren Mayberry, Martin Doherty and Iain Cook, all graduates of alternative and post-rock bands, have refined a sound that keeps one foot in indie electronica, the other in modern radio pop and its heart in 80s synths. Here, they’ve embraced co-producers for the first time in Greg Kurstin and Steve Mac, and their most sparkling euphoria, bolstered by live drums, is to the fore on the likes of gorgeous opener Graffiti, a neon-inked love-letter to young friendships. For every sunburst, though, there’s a chill, as on My Enemy, a duet between silvery-voiced frontwoman Mayberry and the National’s Matt Berninger that creeps in with a breaking-hearts snap of beats, or on dark, technoid epic God’s Plan, sung by Doherty.

Not only will it be the NHS’s birthday that month, but it will be the 40th birthday of Louise Brown, probably better known as the world’s first “test-tube baby”. Louise’s arrival, by caesarian section shortly before midnight on 25 July 1978 at the Royal Oldham hospital, made headlines around the world, marking as it did the birth of the first human to be conceived using in-vitro fertilisation. Her birth was a sensational medical breakthrough. It was also a watershed moment for NHS maternity services, which for the past 70 years have been characterised by change – both in policy and technological advances – with hospital admissions becoming the norm. For the first time, the one in six couples who would otherwise be childless were offered medical interventions such as IVF. Meanwhile, new techniques in antenatal testing and monitoring, notably ultrasound, became routine in antenatal care. In 2016, 96.5% of all babies delivered in England and Wales were born in hospital. Seven decades on, more change is planned in an attempt to make services safer, more person-centred and family friendly, as the NHS struggles to meet the needs of a rising number of births, an increase in older mothers, and rise in those with complex needs. In some respects this move towards more person-centred care will be turning back the tide of history. Since the founding of the NHS, expectant families have increasingly been encouraged to have hospital births, a trend accelerated during wartime. This medicalisation of maternity services was a cornerstone of the NHS’s stated emphasis on care from the cradle to the grave. Despite this, and improvements to maternal and infant mortality rates, there was never any clear universally agreed vision for maternity care too often overseen by a male-dominated medical profession, according to medical historian Angela Davis, from Warwick University. This “state of confusion” led to a recommendation in 1959 that 70% of all births should take place in hospital, followed by a target of 100% in the Peel report in 1967. The result? Women reported being left in corridors and men were banned from the delivery rooms, and only allowed to visit at pre-ordained times. This was the experience of former art teacher Audrey Evans, who gave birth to her first child, Robert, in June 1958 at Darlington memorial hospital. She went on to have four more children – two more in hospital, followed by two home births for her youngest children, helped by a community midwife and supported by husband Bernard. “The beds were in a corridor because it was so busy,” recalls the 84-year-old, who now lives high above the harbour in Newlyn, Cornwall. “We had to form an orderly queue and then were pretty much left on our own. Robert was a bit stuck and had his arm over his head so they had to use forceps. I was given an injection, so I don’t remember much. Bernard was allowed to see me in the evening. I was in hospital for 10 days.” Between 1985 and 1988 home births fell to 0.9%. By 1994, the government published Changing Childbirth – a vision of future maternity services, which was meant to put women at the centre of care. However, the rhetoric was not matched by reality and a second report Better Births, released in 2016, highlighted a huge variation in maternity services. Too often women were told what to do and rarely saw the same professional twice. Two years on, the government has published an implementation plan aimed at personalising care and breaking down barriers between professionals. Ministers have also promised an extra 3,000 training places for midwives and maternity support staff over the next four years. According to Prof Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, head of maternity, children and young people at NHS England and national maternity safety champion for the Department of Health, the key to improving services is continuity of care from the same one or two midwives. Figures show women who saw the same one or two midwives throughout their pregnancy are less likely to lose their baby or experience pre-term birth. By March 2019, one in five women is expected to benefit from the continuity of carer model. This will be rolled out to the majority of women by 2021. Looking forward, Dunkley-Bent says: “Being a recipient of continuity of care … is very different to experiencing the care delivered through more traditional models of midwifery, which in some areas can mean meeting a different midwife at every appointment. Becoming comfortable with someone, building a relationship with them, which grows and deepens over time, enables trust to develop and women begin to share their deeper anxieties and insecurities as well as enjoying the more positive aspects of growing knowledge and confidence through a supported journey of discovery.” The measures mean change is afoot again, although, there is acceptance that some maternity providers would move faster than others. However, there are signs this time round that change may be lasting. Dunkley-Bent insists progress will be closely monitored and says: “Regardless of the pace, sustainability is key.” ‘Once I got on it, the home birth system was brilliant’ Emily Pinkerton had her first daughter in hospital. Here, she explains why she opted to have her second at home Building up a good relationship with a community midwife was critical for 34-year-old Emily Pinkerton as she prepared for a water birth at her home in Woodford, East London. Having had a successful water birth in Whipps Cross hospital, north-east London, for her first baby, Pinkerton, now 37, felt confident home was the perfect place for her second. Her daughters Hannah and Lucy are now aged six and two. “The worst bit about having a baby in hospital was waiting 12 hours after the birth to come home,” she recalls. “I had never met the midwife who delivered my daughter, Hannah. However, the birth itself and care I received was very good. I just felt that I didn’t need to be there. Both Hannah and I were fine. “When I was pregnant for a second time, I was very keen to have a home birth. My husband, Robert, was a little worried, but he felt as if he was in control as he organised getting the pool ready.” Pinkerton remembers her antenatal care and births as if it was yesterday. Persuaded by her doctor to have a hospital birth first time around, she had regular hospital checkups. However, during her second pregnancy, antenatal checks were made by a dedicated home-birth team during home visits. “There was a bit of bureaucracy getting on the home-birth system, but once I did it was brilliant,” says Pinkerton, who works part-time for the Financial Conduct Authority. “I built up much more of a relationship with the midwives than I did before. When I went into labour with Lucy, my husband put Hannah to bed, and one of the midwives who I had seen through the pregnancy came to the house with a community midwife. They sat and watched and let nature take its course.” She has this advice for other pregnant women. “Do what you feel comfortable with and don’t be afraid to ask questions.

Others are in high-level management roles, and it’s not unusual to find nurse academics training junior doctors alongside student nurses in university medical schools. The responsibilities they carry, and the contribution they make to every part of the NHS – spanning the whole cycle of life from pre-conception to death – could never have been imagined by their predecessors 70 years ago. “They were originally the handmaidens to the medics, but those boundaries have moved and their responsibilities have risen exponentially,” says Toni Schwarz, head of the department for nursing and midwifery at Sheffield Hallam University, one of the largest nurse-training universities in England. “We have lifted the ceiling on where student nurses should see themselves today – it’s not just about being at the patient bedside.” That view is confirmed by student nurse and career changer Clare Manley, who gave up her job as a £49,000-a-year highschool business manager to train as a nurse. Forty-two-year old Manley originally began nurse training 20 years ago, but was forced to give it up when she was diagnosed with epilepsy. But the desire to nurse – something she describes as “an itch which needed to be scratched” – stayed with her. She is now in her second year at Sheffield Hallam and plans to become a nurse consultant, probably in mental health. “That for me is where I want to go. There are four parts to the job – practice and patients, research, training and education, and some policy development,” she says. Today’s student nurses are ambitious. “They want to feel they are always being developed,” says Prof Lisa Bayliss-Pratt director of nursing at Health Education England, the government agency responsible for NHS workforce education and training. It is advances in medicine and science, and the way that the burden of disease has changed over 70 years, that have influenced nurse development. Back in 1948 their priorities would have been infection control, improving sanitation and people’s diet in post-war Britain. “It was doctors who gave the first antibiotics, doctors who measured blood pressure,” says Prof Donna Kinnair, director of nursing, policy and practice at the Royal College of Nursing. “I think if you were to compare the knowledge of a doctor in 1948, with a qualified nurse today, there wouldn’t be much difference.” An increasing older population, living longer with more complex and often multiple needs, and the growing number of people with long-term conditions such as type 2 diabetes, are perhaps the biggest issues influencing the future direction of nursing. New nursing roles, such as nurse associate, are being developed to take on tasks traditionally performed by registered nurses, who are then free to adopt more complex work. In the next 10 to 15 years the community nursing workforce is expected to grow, supporting people living in their own homes or in intermediate care. They will work in an integrated health and care system – between hospital and community – and have broader, and more advanced, clinical skills, offering complex care including pain relief and intravenous fluids. Hospitals will become centres for patients who are acutely ill, requiring a nursing workforce who are “highly technically competent,” says Schwarz. Summing up the future, Bayliss-Pratt says: “Our advance nurse practitioners of today should be the community practitioners of tomorrow.” Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.

Since then, the health service has grown to become the single biggest employer in the UK, with 1.7 million workers across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, making it the fifth-largest workforce in the world. It is probably the most diverse workforce in the UK – for instance, some 62,000 NHS staff in England are EU nationals. It’s not unusual to be treated by a nurse from the Philippines or India or seen by a doctor from Egypt, Korea or even Russia. As the workforce demographic has changed there have also been huge advances in medicine. There has been a move towards more patient self-management in an integrated health and social care system, with more people looked after outside of hospital nearer home. At the same, time patient demand has soared, and it is anticipated that 190,000 more staff will be needed in England alone by 2027 if the current pressure on services continues apace. All these factors are influencing the careers landscape. The challenges, according to NHS leaders, are three-fold: to attract new staff; to retain and develop those who already work for the NHS; and to create new roles where skill gaps are identified. The government is committed to increasing nursing associates – a bridging role between healthcare assistant and registered nurse. By 2027 some 45,000 will be in post, with 17,000 expected to become registered nurses. The development, according to Health Education England (HEE) chief executive Prof Ian Cumming, has already triggered a rise in the number of people applying to become healthcare assistants because there is now a defined career path. A growth in medical associate professions is also expected – such as surgical care practitioners trained to perform some supervised surgery and advanced critical-care practitioners who look after hospital patients with life-threatening conditions. In future, more physician associates – who can carry out many of the duties typically provided by a GP – are also likely to be found across the NHS. Helen Gilburt, policy fellow at the King’s Fund thinktank, says: “Physician associates have taken up roles in general practice and hospitals; they are adaptable with a broad skills set. In the US they are found in hospital and surgical teams and treating people with long-term conditions, so it will be interesting to see where they develop and grow in other parts of the NHS.” While these new roles are emerging, it’s also crucial to build on the skills of existing staff, she says: “Getting people who have different skills to work more closely together is more effective than redesigning traditional roles.” Opportunities for existing staff to become advanced clinical practitioners – experts often working autonomously – will increase in future. Danny Mortimer, chief executive at NHS Employers, says: “I think there is more interest in roles around advanced clinical practice in nursing and the allied health professions than, for example, physician associate, because there are more of these roles and the people are already there.” Most of the growth in jobs is expected to happen in the community as more people are treated outside of hospital. Technological advancements, which enable patients to self-monitor their condition at home, will also have an impact on how health careers develop: “I think the iPad will transform primary care,” says Cumming. The desire of doctors for more flexible careers will also influence how medical paths develop. Chair of the BMA’s junior doctors committee, Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, predicts there will be more portfolio careers in medicine in future and hopes there will be more flexibility in junior doctor training, including the chance to work overseas – an avenue HEE is already exploring. Cumming says: “More people want the option to work internationally, and we are looking at what we can do to build links.” Nurses might in future spend some of their training in Australia, while Australian nurses work in the UK as part of a job swap, he suggests. The employment options in the health service today could never have been envisaged when the NHS began. The service still offers a career for life, but it is its status as a national treasure that is probably its biggest selling point: “The public feels that the NHS is linked to our national identity,” says Mortimer. “People working in it feel part of something and can make their contribution – that shared ethos, which was there after the war, still continues today.” Working in healthcare: professionals have their say Mairead Roche 55, a former nurse, has been a practice manager for 24 years. She works at the Rosslyn Hill surgery, Hampstead, north London, leading a team of four. When I became a practice manager we very much worked in silos and were quite isolated. We didn’t have a lot of cross-practice working, we didn’t share staff. Our patients didn’t see other clinicians [in the practice]. I think working more together has been the biggest change I have seen. GP referrals today are also assessed by an intermediary service staffed by GPs. Although our core contract has expanded, the amount of money we receive in proportion has not. I’m also talking about policy and strategy every day and it’s a real art to match patient demand to appointments and to get it right. GPs have become very business-focused because they realise it could get sucked out from under them, generally by private providers. Lots of them are becoming managers themselves, giving that strategic lead, which means the practice managers may in future become high administrators. Mike Maguire 52, runs the Marton Pharmacy, Middlesbrough. He is honorary lecturer at Durham University’s school of pharmacy and chair of the local professional network for Durham, Darlington and Tees. When I qualified 29 years ago, my role was to dispense prescriptions and give advice to patients when medicines were dispensed. That had changed a lot from what my dad did when he opened his pharmacy in 1961; then he used to make up potions and lotions and medicines. In 2005, I moved to new premises, which included a therapy centre and a patient consultation room too, as I could see the way that the NHS was moving. The pharmacy has a real local presence. We deliver services such as flu immunisation, smoking cessation the morning-after pill – we’ve moved away from just medicines. We are a great asset to the NHS and I think we will become much more integrated into the NHS. Pharmacists now work in GP practices and urgent care centres. Locally, NHS 111 is looking at using community pharmacists for urgent cases instead of people going to A&amp;E, out-of-hours GPs, or a walk-in centre. I think Dad would be amazed. Michelle Chapman 36, is a physician associate (PA) in acute medicine at East Surrey hospital, Redhill; board member of the faculty of physician associates at the Royal College of Physicians. The PA role appealed because it is public-facing and I liked the combination of science and medical. Being a PA is about team work, it allows you to be a generalist, which means it offers mobility, so I could move into general practice, or elsewhere, with my core training. I am part of the medical team alongside junior doctors. Sometimes I am on the consultant-led ward round, or I might manage patients referred from A&amp;E. I work under the supervision of a doctor. I can decide a patient management plan – which is reviewed by a consultant – and I can take on the management of that patient. I can order investigations, but I can’t prescribe or order x-rays. We aren’t replacing doctors, but we are there to complement them. Owen Williams 50, chief executive, Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS foundation trust. If you look at workforce diversity, then we have seen growth. There is still work to do at a senior level. We have made progress, particularly around doctors, but there is still work to be done on the nursing side. One of the biggest changes I have seen is a commitment to end this notion of competition, which has led to more collaboration. Competing against each other to provide care doesn’t seem logical when we are all financially challenged. Collaboration gets people or organisations that are different, with different cultures, working together and that has an impact on health inequality. I would hope that we will be more diverse in 10 years’ time, not because it’s something we have to do, because it’s PC, but [because diversity] can take us to a better place.

That’s the message from the anti-poverty charity Global Justice Now in a report that warns of an “e-pocalypse” across the southern hemisphere, as western firms keen to sell sophisticated digital services use their muscle to outmanoeuvre local businesses in poorer nations. Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable after decades of underinvestment that has left many countries with seemingly little option but to accept the terms laid down by the tech giants. “Tech companies like to project a modern, progressive image to the world. But under the surface, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Uber are pursuing an agenda that could hand them dangerous levels of control over our lives and profoundly harm economic development in the global south,” the report says. Industry bodies deny that there are moves to establish global rules that would force-feed western technology to developing-world countries. They say that e-commerce liberates small and medium-sized businesses to export goods they could never previously afford to sell. They also say that states’ attempts to keep data in local servers prevents tech firms benefiting from economies of scale by housing data in vast hubs across the globe. Christian Borggreen, a researcher at the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), the Geneva-based lobby group for Facebook, Netflix, BT, Amazon, eBay and others, says: “Forced data localisation is on the rise globally. Since the year 2000 the number of national requirements grew from 15 to 84.” That is significant, he says, because there is a risk that countries that demand data localisation “do this for protectionist or censorship reasons”. He is thinking of Russia and China. There is also a potential risk of damage to productivity from throwing sand in the wheels of global tech. The International Monetary Fund said last month that half of the productivity gains in the developing world came from globalisation, and much of that comes from the adoption of western technology. However, Nick Dearden, head of Global Justice Now, says it is essential that developing countries retain their citizens’ data within their borders to avoid the core of their economies being directed from abroad. The idea that they should be passive receivers of western technology, and borrow heavily on international financial markets to pay for it, means they become prey to the whims of foreign businesses, he says. “Without [keeping data local] it’s so much more difficult for countries to regulate and tax industries, for them to get really any benefits out of investment with no skills, jobs or technology transfer, or to nurture infant industries. It’s the central problem with the way trade deals operate.” Susan Aaronson, a digital trade expert at George Washington University in Washington DC, says fighting the adoption of international rules to protect local data privacy is the wrong approach. She argues that developing world countries “could say to tech firms ‘you need to pay for our data and you need to be transparent about how you use it’. They haven’t so far. They’ve accepted the Facebook model.” Separately, they could negotiate common rules for e-commerce. Nick Ashton-Hart, a trade expert who used to work at the CCIA, says the report should consider the issue of data separately from e-commerce. Whereas Dearden considers Amazon, eBay, Alibaba and other trading platforms as rent-seeking operators that suck money out of the economy, Ashton-Hart says they should be seen as giving small businesses in developing-world countries access to global markets. Allowing them, along with Facebook, Google and other global operators, to store data where they want to would create huge efficiency savings that could be passed on to local businesses and consumers. If there is a problem taxing or regulating technology transfers, intellectual property or the sale of goods and services across borders, that is an issue of local governance, says Ashton-Hart, who now works for the International Chamber of Commerce, a group that promotes UK exports. Likewise, governments can set the rules for their citizens’ online privacy and do not need to do it by demanding that global firms maintain relatively small local databases. “The bigger issue is that more than 100 countries have no privacy laws at all, according to Unctad, but this isn’t addressed at all,” says Ashton-Hart. “If developing countries want to protect their nationals, that’s where to start, and NGOs should be calling them out for not doing it.” The issue has come into sharp focus with the EU’s plan to impose new data protection rules in Europe that force companies to win the consent of users before storing personal data online, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It becomes law at the end of this week, and is causing huge anxiety in the tech sector and a backlash from small business that rely on customer databases to generate new business. Facebook repatriated 70% of its international customer records to the US once it became clear that the servers hosting the data in Ireland would be subject to the rules. Dearden says the issue has become pressing since e-commerce leapt to the top of the World Trade Organisation’s agenda last year in Argentina. African countries were particularly alarmed at proposals to establish a level playing field that would force them to allow trade with major foreign businesses. In a statement following the meeting, African countries signed up to a declaration by the Rwandan delegation, which said the planned rules meant small businesses would be “least likely to be able to effectively compete with multinational corporations, who have become global digital leaders, and have decimated smaller companies”. It said these multinationals had “benefited from digital industrial policies such as subsidies, R&amp;D subsidies, development of, and access to, and ownership of technologies, economies of scale, government-sponsored infrastructure, tax benefits, etc”. Dearden admits developing countries are split, with some wanting to take whatever the tech firms have to offer to spur growth. “Some on the pro side have been talked to by the developed countries. Others think it sounds nice but don’t know all the implications. But WTO was a major victory for us in that formal movement on this wasn’t agreed – and that’s because some developing countries, especially in Africa, fought it tooth and nail.” Some of the most advanced African countries are the most serious about protecting their domestic industries from foreign competition. Only last week, Kenya pulled out of a free trade pact with China after it decided the deal was too one-sided. Technology is seen as solving huge problems for developing countries, from corruption to poor standards of education and healthcare, but the issue of democratic control is unlikely to go away – and is likely to prevent international agreement being reached any time soon. An Apple a day … the race for hi-tech healthcare The tech industry’s appetite for markets to conquer is insatiable and healthcare is a priority. Last year Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, revealed that his near-trillion-dollar company was putting healthcare at the centre of all its phone developments. Apple wanted to save lives, he said. A smartphone can be your personal doctor, monitoring your health minute by minute, accessing test results and providing medical information. But this could become a serious issue if the big tech companies don’t just provide the phone, but also hold the health information gathered by it – information that is in high demand from, for instance, financial services companies looking to sell products to the country’s healthiest people – or to cancer patients. In the UK, consultants working at the Royal Free Hospital trust in London were told last year that it had been illegal for them to approach DeepMind, an artificial intelligence firm owned by Google’s parent, about developing software based on patient data from the trust. DeepMind walked away. But it has stressed to its investors that structured health data and artificial intelligence are the next phase in the company’s business plan. It wants to move into disease detection, constructing a new data infrastructure around health data, and potentially sell insurance off the back of this information. The main target is the $3tn (£2.2tn) US market, but the big populations of the developing world will be in its sights. Apple is in the process of setting up a network of medical clinics in the US through a subsidiary, AC Wellness. Some believe it could be a blueprint for countries unable to invest in anything more than rudimentary health systems. Nick Dearden, head of the charity Global Justice Now, says: “Big tech companies see vast new markets in providing tech-based versions of healthcare and education, particularly in Africa. The problem is that such private ‘solutions’ are already failing the majority, because they sideline and crowd out investment in decent, high quality, universal education and healthcare, which many lower-income countries desperately need.” Education is an area of interest to Google that brings with it similar issues. Dearden says, especially when the technology literacy rate is under 30% in rural Kenya (according to an IBM Digital Villages study), and the Kenyan government is one of the most advanced users of technology in Africa. Dearden adds: “Patented, tech-based education can easily be tailored to suit different income categories, with the poorest being totally shut out or given a much lower level of service than richer people. What’s more, countries will be locked into services which can only be provided by specific hi-tech companies for years or decades … This should worry all of us – because Africa is a guinea pig for a world totally controlled by a handful of mega corporations.” Tech industry lobbyists argue that developing-world governments will benefit from billions of pounds of research and development carried out by US firms over the past decade. This will help countries put in a modern digital infrastructure, they say, and save huge sums on education and healthcare budgets. But Silicon Valley’s aspirations to make the world smaller and bring people together, no matter how sincere, are being met with more cynicism than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2019/dec/29/alasdair-gray-influential-scottish-writer-and-artist-dies-aged-85","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-29T11:04:51Z","webTitle":"Alasdair Gray, influential Scottish writer and artist, dies aged 85","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/29/alasdair-gray-influential-scottish-writer-and-artist-dies-aged-85","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2019/dec/29/alasdair-gray-influential-scottish-writer-and-artist-dies-aged-85","fields":{"headline":"Alasdair Gray, influential Scottish writer and artist, dies aged 85","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The writer and artist Alasdair Gray, who blazed a trail for contemporary Scottish fiction with his experimental novels, has died aged 85. Gray’s publisher Canongate announced the news on Sunday, saying he died early in the morning after being hospitalised for a short illness in his home city of Glasgow. In a statement, Gray’s family thanked his friends and hospital staff, calling him “an extraordinary person; very talented and, even more importantly, very humane”. Among those to pay tribute were author Val McDermid, who credited Gray for having “transformed our expectations of what Scottish literature could be”, and Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called him “one of Scotland’s literary giants, and a decent, principled human being.” “He’ll be remembered best for the masterpiece that is Lanark, but everything he wrote reflected his brilliance,” she added on Twitter. “Today, we mourn the loss of a genius, and think of his family.” The novelist Ali Smith called Gray “a modern-day William Blake” and said: “He was an artist in every form. He was a renaissance man. His generosity and brilliance in person – felt by everyone who knew him even a little – were a source of astonishing and liberating warmth. The few times I met him in life, he was all these things in a unique combination of polite, frank, detached (or maybe more truly differently attached), sanguine, many-voiced, wise, warm, kind, hilarious, acutely truth-telling, uncompromisingly articulate.” Gray came to fiction late, publishing his first novel Lanark at the age of 46 in 1981. A experimental, pornographic fantasy – 1982, Janine – followed three years later, with his rambunctious reworking of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Poor Things, appearing in 1992. As his literary reputation increased, winning both the Guardian fiction prize and the Whitbread novel award in 1992, the elaborate illustrations he created for his books began to draw attention to the pictorial art Gray had been producing all along. The stream of commissions for murals and portraits gradually increased, and he finished his career as one of Scotland’s most admired and versatile artists. Born in the northeast of Glasgow in 1934, Gray was brought up on an estate the writer once described as “one of the earliest and most posh of the municipal housing schemes”, remembering the schoolteachers, printers and local civil servants who lived in his close. He studied painting at the Glasgow School of Art, and worked as a muralist, part-time art teacher and theatrical scene painter while writing scripts for TV and radio. In 1954, Gray began writing the novel that would occupy him on and off throughout the 1960s and 70s. Lanark divides the story of a life into four books, alternating between Glasgow and a shadowy version of the city called Unthank. The novel opens with book three, in which a young man finds himself in a dark metropolis filled with strange diseases, and then jumps back to fill in the story of Duncan Thaw, who grows up in Glasgow just before the second world war. The Guardian called it “fluent, imaginative”, a novel “of undeniable quality, but rare, and not for all tastes, like an oyster, or a truffle”. This truffle was soon compared to Joyce’s Ulysses, and was the making both of the author and his independent publisher, Canongate. Writing 20 years later, Janice Galloway remembered how the novel’s “exuberant, at times despairing, always vivid voice” made her feel “acknowledged, spoken to, listened for”. As Thaw suggests in the novel, Glasgow’s magnificence had remained unnoticed, because “if a city hasn’t been used by an artist, not even the inhabitants live there imaginatively”. Writers such as Galloway, Ian Rankin, Irvine Welsh and Ali Smith woke up to find their own world given back to them in fiction, and Scotland’s cultural confidence enlarged. Gray followed it with 1982, Janine – an intricate sadomasochistic fantasy so typographically complex that the author insisted his contract contained provision for up to six rounds of proofs – before turning to a more conventional realism for three novels exploring nationalism and power. Poor Things, a patchwork of Victorian fragments, returned to tricksier territory, charting Bella Baxter’s rise from the creation of gifted surgeon Godwin Bysshe Baxter to become her own woman. The Guardian hailed it as “a bibliophile’s paradise of postmodern precision” and awarded Gray its 1992 fiction prize. As his public profile began to rise, Gray began to publicly support Scottish independence, publishing a short polemic called Why Scots Should Rule Scotland in time for the 1992 election. Devolution was never enough for the author, who agreed with Margaret Thatcher when she claimed Tony Blair as her greatest achievement. “Like US citizens,” Gray argued, “the UK electorate has no chance of voting for a party that will do anything to seriously tax our enlarged millionaire class that controls Westminster.” The steady stream of novels, short stories and non-fiction continued, including an illustrated translation of Dante’s Inferno published in 2018. But alongside his writing, Gray carried on painting. Speaking to the Guardian in 2010 as he published a survey of his visual art, the author explained that since his parents had given him crayons and paper even before he could read, painting was perhaps more natural than writing, but “one is always a tremendous holiday from the other”. “I feel healthier painting than writing,” he said, “because when you’ve been writing a lot and your head is full of words, you are still muscularly not exhausted, but you’re nervously exhausted, so in order to sleep you go out and drink heavily, unless you’re more disciplined than I am.” Gray confessed himself sometimes rather surprised by his own productiveness, despite what he called “my alcoholism”, reflecting ruefully on how his life might have been changed if he had found financial success a little earlier in his career. “I think I would have painted much more than I did,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/may/28/tv-giant-discovery-to-shut-european-hub-as-it-mulls-post-brexit-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T16:39:04Z","webTitle":"Discovery to shut European TV hub as it mulls post-Brexit plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/28/tv-giant-discovery-to-shut-european-hub-as-it-mulls-post-brexit-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/28/tv-giant-discovery-to-shut-european-hub-as-it-mulls-post-brexit-plan","fields":{"headline":"Discovery to shut European TV hub as it mulls post-Brexit plan","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Discovery is to shut its European broadcasting base in London as the US TV giant behind channels including Animal Planet and Eurosport mulls post-Brexit plans for a new continental hub. Discovery broadcasts more than 100 TV channels across Europe from its headquarters in west London, making the pay-TV giant the biggest broadcaster to use the UK as a hub for the continent. The Guardian has learned that Discovery is to shut the European playout hub for broadcasting its channels, affecting up to 100 jobs, as it moves to a US-based transmission system. However, it will continue to employ 1,300 people in the UK, where it makes programmes and broadcasts 16 channels to British viewers. The company said that while it will move the playout of non-live channels – it airs shows from Gold Rush to Running Wild with Bear Grylls – it will look to develop the playout centre as a hub for sport and live broadcasting. However, Discovery, which owns Eurosport and has the exclusive European TV rights to the Olympics and jointly airs Wimbledon in a deal with the BBC, already has a major sports TV facility in Paris. Discovery will continue to hold all of its TV licences with the UK broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, which under European Union rules means it can broadcast across the continent. However, broadcasters and Ofcom have warned the government that if it fails to strike a deal to keep EU-wide broadcast rights post-Brexit, companies will have to look to relocate significant parts of their businesses and TV licensing arrangements to the continent to continue to transmit across Europe. “This is part of our vision to move to a more agile operational technology model,” a spokeswoman for Discovery said. “This has nothing to do with Brexit and everything to do with technology innovation being core to our company and brand.” Nevertheless, Discovery has been evaluating the location for its European broadcasting hub if a Brexit TV deal is not struck. Discovery’s decision to close its European playout base will be a stark reminder for the government of how the world’s biggest TV companies are not wedded to the UK. Discovery is understood to have lined up options for Amsterdam, where businesses including Netflix have their European headquarters, and Warsaw. Poland is the home base of the Discovery executive, Kasia Kieli, who was promoted to become the broadcaster’s head of Europe in November, and after Discovery’s $12bn takeover of rival Scripps has become home to one of its largest workforces and bases in Europe. In November, the Ofcom chief executive, Sharon White, revealed to an audience in Brussels that a number of major UK-based broadcasters have told her they have contingency plans to move editorial functions to other cities in Europe. While there is no suggestion of large-scale job cuts post-Brexit, internally Discovery has quietly stopped calling London its international headquarters. “We are transforming our business and that means there will be change,” the spokeswoman said. “Across our business, we are constantly looking at ways to improve the operational effectiveness and efficiency of our business, while seeking new opportunities to grow.” One source said that shutting the playout centre is part of a global strategy being implemented by Discovery – and other traditional broadcasters – to develop a digital structure in the fightback against the rise of new rivals such as Netflix. Discovery was the first to move to a cloud-based playout system with its US channels last year. “Brexit forced the issue to be focused on but it is about changing consumer behaviour and the digital threat,” the source said. The Commercial Broadcasters Association (COBA), which is chaired by the senior Discovery executive Susanna Dinnage, has said that if Brexit results in UK TV licences no longer allowing EU-wide broadcast it could cost the economy £1bn in annual investment from international broadcasters.

The lurching rhythms of Colombian cumbia, the stridency of reggaeton and even Andean pan pipes are all part of the mix distilled by producer Pedro Canale, who trades as Chancha Vía Circuito and whose third album, 2014’s Amansara, won international plaudits and a place on the Breaking Bad soundtrack. Bienaventuranza (“Bliss”) is equally engaging. Some of its cuts are simple folk instrumentals: Los Pastores is played out on Cuban guitar, Sierra Nevada on Andean flutes and pipes (instruments usually dreaded thanks to shops selling scented candles), both given discreet bird and animal calls. Grittier are tracks that call on guest vocalists; Ilaló floats the elegant voice of Mateo Kingman over an insistent cumbia shuffle, while the reggaefied La Victoria comes with a rap by Colombia’s Manu Ranks. Canale is, however, a mystic child of nature as much as city hipster: his beats come from both drummed logs and synths, and he constantly evokes the high peaks of Peru and the forests of Amazonia.

This is how we can protect them","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Poor Twiglet the dog. Her short-lived career as a comfort animal for anxious Cambridge university students ended prematurely this week, after unprecedented demand to take her out for soothing walks left her feeling rather overanxious herself. At her peak, the jack russell was being booked out for eight hours a day, which says something about stress levels approaching finals. We are now well into education’s annual slough of despond: primary school Sats finished this week; GCSEs have just begun; A-levels and finals are next. Exams have always been, and will always be, stressful. What’s new is the cliff-edge feeling surrounding them: a paralysing fear of failure, combined with an ever-rising threshold for success that leaves too many children convinced it would be the end of the world to slip a grade.It’s tough even for resilient kids, but for those who are already prone to anxiety it’s hellish. Primary school teachers are having to reassure 10- and 11-year-olds that their futures won’t be irrevocably decided by Sats, which were only ever intended as a test of schools and not of children. Secondary school teachers describe panic attacks, children crying in class, and a rampaging anxiety among GCSE students who are once again guinea pigs in some education secretary’s politically driven experiment. This time, it’s Michael Gove’s legacy to the nation: super-rigorous “gold standard” exams. No more coursework, and a new numbered grading system that replaces the old A and A* – already beyond most kids’ reach – with new grades 7, 8 and 9. The line between 8 and 9 must be so fine now as to be irrelevant to almost all employers – yet the most perfectionist, anxious, overachieving kids (not to mention the most ambitious parents) will feel it matters and those are precisely the kids to worry about. Meanwhile the fear of failure that drives some to revise until 1am is also, in a different way, driving the kids who switch off school entirely because they know they can’t do this. And all to what end, exactly? Who is really rooting for this new academic Hunger Games, beyond people who took their own O-levels so long ago they’ve no idea what it’s like now? We are told it’s to prepare kids for an increasingly competitive world. But it’s unclear how early failure to master JB Priestley’s An Inspector Calls on the one hand, or risking burnout for a 9 grade on the other, relates to the problems kids will face on leaving school: fewer good jobs available for the less academically able, as routine work is increasingly automated and casualised, plus uncertainty over Brexit and an economy past its productive peak that isn’t yet sure where the next one’s coming from. Too many kids, meanwhile, are perfectly aware even from primary school of what they’re supposedly up against. Even getting a degree no longer feels like enough in an increasingly competitive workplace, so the pressure students put themselves under to get firsts has increased exponentially. Speculation that an increase in students getting firsts must be down to grade inflation, or universities trying to please their now-paying customers, wilfully ignores the fact that these kids are visibly pushing themselves harder than their predecessors – and not just academically. Every holiday is stuffed with high-octane work experience and CV-building activities. When I went back to my old college recently, half of the bar had been turned into a coffee area: they don’t loll around boozing like we did but bring their laptops in and work. Oh, and there’s now a dedicated mental health nurse. Having seen too many contemporaries realise only in their 30s that the anxiety they’d struggled with for years wasn’t normal, I wonder if in part we’re just more open now to seeing and treating problems that were perhaps always there in teenagers, and that’s a good thing. (An estimated one in 10 children now have clinically diagnosable mental health disorders, but that’s the same rate as in 1999.) The sharp rise in mental health referrals by schools suggests they’re spotting problems earlier, although unfortunately the services to which these kids are referred are stretched to breaking point. We’re probably also more alert to those teenagers who wouldn’t necessarily reach a diagnostic threshold but are still significantly unhappier than anyone wants a child to be: anxious, fragile, struggling to cope. These kids may need professional help managing their feelings, but we should also be asking why so many of them are suddenly having such feelings. While the young people we should be most worried about are the ones struggling even to leave their rooms, rather than the ones queuing up to walk the comfort dog, even the latter may be more stressed than a 20-year-old should be, or even used to be, and they’re telling us something about the world we as adults have created for them. What could we do differently? For a start, parents need to beware projecting their own anxieties on to kids who aren’t mature enough to handle them. Social media companies could stop kicking and squealing every time someone suggests limiting children’s access to their addictive, feel-bad platforms, which only intensify teenagers’ emotional ups and downs. Child and adolescent mental health services must be properly funded to meet rising demand, and backed up by pastoral measures in schools and universities to build emotional resilience – which includes learning to bounce back from life’s inevitable setbacks. Governments of all colours, meanwhile, have to learn to stop fiddling pointlessly with exams. No more tearing up syllabuses, marking schemes or grade boundaries for the sake of a headline; give teachers time to absorb one set of changes before leaping into the next; and focus instead on building an economy where getting a decent job doesn’t feel like a game of musical chairs in which too many chairs are snatched away. That’s a far harder test for politicians, obviously. Some might even call it a “gold standard”. But we are heaping too much pressure on small shoulders. It’s time adults started to lighten the load. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/20/the-fight-to-define-the-very-essence-of-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T07:05:50Z","webTitle":"The fight to define the very essence of Israel | Bernard Avishai","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/the-fight-to-define-the-very-essence-of-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/the-fight-to-define-the-very-essence-of-israel","fields":{"headline":"The fight to define the very essence of Israel","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Perhaps the hardest thing for people not living in Israel to grasp is that for most Israelis, talk about how to deal with the question of Palestine is just foreground. In the background is a contest over what kind of state Israel must be. It is not just thinking about war, with Iranian proxies, say, which makes the situation demoralising. Thinking about peace is also demoralising, though in a different way. For Israel would not come out of a sustained war the same country it was when it went in, but nobody expects it to come out of a peace process the same country, either. What leaks into nearly every conversation these days is uncertainty about Israel’s future boundaries. I don’t just mean geographic boundaries. I mean legal, institutional and cultural limits. Most people in the country will insist that Israel is and must remain Jewish and democratic. Almost nobody can tell you what this means. Obviously, Israel cannot maintain an occupation, denying a great many people political rights, and remain democratic in any ordinary sense. But there is an even more disturbing problem, which calls the Jewish state into question. Can a state for world Jewry be a republic of citizens, many of whom are not Jews? And just what is a Jew in the legal terms statehood presumes: a member of a Hebrew-speaking civil society, a follower of Orthodox Jewish law or a bearer of J-positive blood? The question is troubling enough as it is, but it also has immediate consequences for the ways Israelis imagine their fight, especially since the Netanyahu government, which has been promoting its “Jewish nation-state law”, seems so satisfied to promote rabbinic law as Jewish and speak of democracy purely in terms of majority rule. “Look,” most Israelis will now tell you, “we might have to push the Arab states around or make them believe that we can – and we have to be able to do this with the blessing of western democracies or at least Trump’s America.” If you ask them: “But isn’t pre-emption and lethal force making your neighbours more determined to fight you?” they answer: “Our neighbours hate us anyway and, sadly, most of our own Arab citizens do, too. It is naive to believe that they won’t, given the kind of state we are.” So Israel’s democracy – indeed its survival – does not simply depend on how its military does against threats in Israel’s immediate neighbourhood. It will have to change – and seems stuck. To their credit, Israelis have already met the daunting challenges of building a vibrant Hebrew culture and an exacting economic engine, qualifying themselves to be included among advanced, global players. The challenge of the old industrial world was national self-sufficiency, which Israel’s socialist and military leaders of the 1960s were reasonably good at. The challenge of the new economy is integration into global markets, corporations and universities, which today’s Israelis are really good at. And yet Israel’s Arab citizens, a fifth of the population, are threatening a shock to Israel’s civil society, which the state apparatus has no means to absorb. Even if the occupied territories just disappeared, and if things were somehow to revert to the status quo ante 1967, the country would face a crisis – not an uprising like Gaza’s, perhaps, but something like the suburbs of Paris in 2005. In 2015, 60% of Arabs accepted Israel having a Jewish majority. Today, 44% do. The trend, in the age of Netanyahu, is clear. For their part, nearly half of Israeli Jews say they will not live in the same building as an Arab. True, Israeli Arabs are the children and grandchildren of Palestinians who were led by reckless strongmen at the end of the British mandate. The latter rejected partition in 1947 and were short-sighted to count on their Arab neighbours to put an end to the Zionist project. Ethnic cleansing happened on both sides during the 1948–49 war. And, also true, Israeli democracy has been a kind of liberation for many Arab intellectuals and professionals; many report of being relieved to find a civil space to speak of sexuality and family foibles; Israeli Arab workers earn, on average, about seven times the average income in the territories. If Israeli Arabs disappeared, the Israeli medical system and tourist facilities would collapse. More than 70% of Israeli Arabs say they would prefer to live in Israel than a Palestinian state. The vast majority of Israeli Arabs are now third-generation Israelis. Many have assimilated. They cannot be told that Israel is a haven in a heartless world. Their country has evolved into an advanced, global, multicultural state and its democratic flaws have become insufferable to them. They believe, and their experience confirms, that no matter how well they perform as citizens they cannot aspire to live as equals or even live where they please. Their resentment is toward a pervasive legal structure that discriminates in favour of Jews as individuals. “Jewish and democratic” is not simply a slogan. It appears in something like constitutional law in Israel and has become as totemic as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Bundled together with the 1950 Law of Return, which accords immediate citizenship to any Jew who immigrates to the country, and with the (partly informal) Status Quo Agreement, establishing the Orthodox rabbinate as officials of the state, the Basic Laws amount to the so-called “small constitution”. The Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty took final shape in 1994 and is the closest thing Israelis have to a bill of rights. It guarantees the protection of life, body, dignity, property, privacy and – touchingly – intimacy. No citizen of a western country would be embarrassed by its language. But unlike some other Basic Laws, this one can be revoked by a simple majority of the Knesset – not a hypothetical flaw. Netanyahu’s government, determined to expel Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers, has legislation pending that will allow the Knesset to override supreme court constitutional rulings, also by a simple majority vote. Although liberal norms are fixed in the hearts of elite Israelis – journalists, scientists, business professionals and scholars accustomed to working in the west and performing by its standards – they are hardly fixed in the Israeli settler right and Orthodox community. Besides, the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty falls well short of the European Union’s charter of fundamental rights, or Israel’s declaration of independence, for that matter. There is still no civil marriage in Israel, no separation of religion and state and no universal (or, for most, secular) standard for earning Israeli nationality. There is weak protection against being held without charge for “security” offences and very weak protection against discrimination on racial or ethnic grounds. One could go on. No wonder, then, that a poll of the Israel Democracy Institute from 2008, even before Netanyahu came to power, exposed a fascinating anomaly: 96% of Israeli Jews wanted a “democratic” state and 85% wanted it “Jewish”. Yet where democratic freedom and Jewish law clashed, only 54% said they would protect democratic freedoms. By 2015, a Pew study found that 48% of all Israeli Jews agree with the statement: “Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel”. The real problem is that Israel came into being, in effect, as two states, not one. Israel was established so successfully after 1948 because a revolutionary Zionist national home, populated by Hebrew-speaking worker-citizens, had succeeded in establishing a pioneering state within the larger colonial state administered by the British mandate. David Ben-Gurion originally thought this Zionist state would be a kind of scaffolding to be dismantled when the Israeli state was built. Alas, it proved more resilient than that. So Israel is inarguably Jewish and democratic, but this really means that Israel is a democratic state encasing an older, heroic state, made up of residual Zionist institutions and an officially sanctioned rabbinate. Israelis share a public realm of democratic law and judicial protection, assuring the equality of all citizens, including the minority Arab population. But Israeli Jews share an inner state, in both senses of the term, focused on the material and spiritual needs of Jews alone. Ideology of the settlers has taken root It is tempting to look back on 1967 with a certain wistfulness: young people, heady victories, reckless enemies, unavoidable hubris. Wistfulness goes well with what is probably the most common conception of Israel that educated people in the west – and many liberals in Israel itself – have: that Israel somehow came off the rails in 1967; that this was once a nicely social democratic state and is now being ruined by the blowback from its occupation – by quickly multiplying, pietistic settlers, whom successive governments somewhat naively tolerated; that if only Israel could end terrorist attacks, emancipate itself from the occupation and replant most settlers back within the green line, then the country and its Zionism could get back to being themselves. But the settlements are less of a problem than the ideology of the settlers, which has taken root in the broader population. Security strategy was a part of how these settlers justified themselves; security is ontology in Israeli political science. But for most today, settlements have no strategic value – missiles, not invasion are the existential fear. Rather, a kind of inertial intimacy with the ancient lands around Jerusalem has proved more than a little intoxicating. My wife, the literary critic Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi, has written about this curiously eroticised impulse – betrayed in Prophets and Jewish lyric poetry since Andalusia – to repossess the “distressed, kidnapped, damsel-land”. All of us back in 1967, young and old, religious and secular, were drawn to the Land of Israel’s once-prohibited places. After 1967, and even after 1973, we roamed freely to places such as Hebron. We sat leisurely in Ramallah cafes, wiping plates of hummus, imagining ourselves in Damascus – as we soon would be, no doubt, when the Arab states finally came to their senses – mistaking the fear and natural hospitality of Palestinian merchants for resignation in the face of Israeli sovereignty. We went on little pilgrimages, in our cars and buses – to Rachel’s Tomb on the road to Bethlehem or the putative Machpelah Cave near Hebron, where the patriarchs and their wives were said to be buried. We then returned home to our block of flats and BBC melodramas at night. We thus became dangerously tolerant of the fanatics who were moving into Hebron, advancing a new holy trinity – “people of Israel, land of Israel, Torah of Israel” – and who now number more than 600,000 within a 40-mile radius of Jerusalem. This menace of cancer cells is that they evolve into forms that seem so passably normal on the surface, that they seem invisible to the immune system. But ideology is only half the story. The settlements were established so effortlessly after 1967 because the Zionist institutions that built them, and the laws and culture that drove them, had been going full throttle within the green line since the 1948 war. One strains to recall this now, but the 1948-49 war of independence occasioned an Israeli annexation of Palestinians’ territory pretty much equal in size to the West Bank. The leaders of the state – from Golda Meir to Yigal Allon – had seen it all before, you see. In the chaos of the 1948-49 battles, some 750,000 Palestinian Arabs either fled their homes or, as in Lod and Ramle, were driven out. The targets of blame and numbers of people suffering this catastrophe – what Palestinians call their Naqba – have been heatedly debated since the archival work of the so-called New Historians in the 1980s. But one decisive fact was never debatable, which was that Arab refugees, understandably leaving a war zone, were not permitted to return. Their “abandoned” lands were then taken over as state property to be used for Jewish settlement. The writer and Mapai leader Moshe Smilansky wrote: “Someday we will have to account for [this] theft and spoliation, not only to our consciences, but also to the law.” The folly of annexationist policies is still more or less obvious to a majority of Israelis, most American Jews, even US officials claiming to be preparing Trump’s “ultimate deal”. But the same people who condemn settlements today seem unable to acknowledge the political institutions and mythology that enabled them to get going in the first place. For the settlers’ ideals and energy did not just grow out of thin air. Both emerged more or less inexorably from an institutional Zionist logic and a powerful Zionist bureaucracy – right for their time as a revolutionary national movement under the British mandate, but increasingly wrong for a modern state and civil society. And the corollary of the settlers’ culture war is theocracy. Orthodox communities are growing faster than any others; their privilege has a momentum of its own. Over the past 70 years, Israel’s strongly Orthodox Jews – both National Religious and Haredi – have increased from about 10% to at least a third of the Jewish population. Only about 42% call themselves secular, though about two-thirds would like the buses to run on the sabbath, so “secular” here must mean something closer to atheist. The demographer Arnon Soffer argues that Israel will be a majority Orthodox state by 2030. Thirty years ago, about 70% of Israeli students attended the secular stream. Today, just 39% do. The National-Orthodox schools teach settler-ideology, “love of the land”, sexual modesty, ancient temple veneration and what the great Jewish historian Salo Baron called the “lachrymose version of Jewish history”. Haredi schools are closed, rather cultish affairs, and instructors can be violent in their discipline. Yeshivot teach rigorous observance of Jewish law, interpreted by revered rabbis. The language of instruction may be Yiddish, while Hebrew is reserved for Torah and liturgy. Youth usually marry in their teens, often to partners chosen for them by parents and matchmakers. They study virtually nothing of science and technology in their schools and often seem in positive fear of western liberal humanities. Haredi kindergartens are subsidised by the municipal tax, the arnona. Residential middle schools for boys, the pnimiyot, are subject to the more or less airless indoctrination of the 19th-century, one-room schoolhouse, or heder; in these publicly supported schools, there are rarely secular studies and no computer training. The boys learn the mind-bending techniques of scholastic rabbinic debate, but are not exposed to what would pass for critical thinking – that is, the capacity to look at the perversities of thinking itself, which make the claim of revelation somewhat, well, suspect. Their insulated world, what Arthur Koestler called their “claustrophilia”, make them worshippers of Holy Land, and thus implicit champions of the settlement movement, which has afforded them cheap housing across the green line from Beit Shemesh and Modiin. By the way, roughly the same proportion of Orthodox citizens want the state “to support the emigration of Arab citizens”. Thirty-four percent of Israelis say that Arab culture is inferior to Israeli culture. About a third of Israeli Jews would have Yitzhak Rabin’s assassin, Yigal Amir, pardoned. Jerusalem and Tel Aviv: opposing models? Jerusalem is ground zero of an emerging Orthodox alliance: more than 45% of schoolchildren in Greater Jerusalem are now Haredi, a number often linked to the estimated 200,000 mainly secular Jews who have left the city for the coastal plain over the past generation. In Jerusalem, about 30% of schoolchildren are Arab, while about 13% are National Religious. That leaves about 12% in secular schools, which Haredi activists may harass and take over when their neighbourhoods outgrow their own. But the influence of the Orthodox does not stop at the schoolroom door. Where everyone is hungry for unity, Orthodox Judaism has become a kind of comfort food. Framed portraits of obscure Haredi rabbis hang discreetly behind cash registers in fruit stores and dry cleaners. As one of my secular students put it, only half-mockingly: “The idea was a Jewish state, wasn’t it? So what is more Jewish than a rabbi?” Many secular friends, who otherwise agree with gay rights, opposed the parade in Jerusalem, claiming earnestly that this was, after all, a holy city, and perhaps gays should stick to Tel Aviv. In a way, the two cities, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, now constitute the choice. Some 42% of Israelis, the so-called centre, say, not without humility, that all they want is for Israel to have a “Jewish majority”. The nature of that majority will be fought out by two urban models. Jerusalem has become the head of the settler octopus, the seat of its yeshivot, the personification of Greater Israel. Tel Aviv, and its northern suburbs, have become a hub for Global Israel, hip, cosmopolitan, cybernetic, cynical. There is a Hebrew political culture for both, but only the latter Hebrew is self-ironising, playfully anglicised – erotic, brassy, metaphorical, mischievous. This is the Hebrew every with-it Israeli knows and every democratic Israeli unknowingly counts on. This is what just won the Eurovision song contest. Then again, even Tel Aviv Hebrew carries the weight of the Torah-culture’s archaic power. You cannot live in a state with an official Judaism, valorising that power, and expect no erosion of “citizenship” per se. You can try, as most secular Israelis try, to speak the language, ignore the archaism and tolerate the Judaism. But then it is harder to teach children what democracy is. From its origins, Israel tried to contain the tension. It cannot do so indefinitely. Nor does it need to define things that torture its intelligentsia but no democratic state actually needs to define. A Jewish state – it cannot be emphasised enough – does not have an identity like that of a Jewish person. A state is also not a family, or a club, or a congregation. It is a commonwealth, a social contract, in which individuals who are subject to equal rules of citizenship work out their lives – if they wish, in voluntary association with people, families, clubs and congregations. The only plausible “Jewish and democratic” state is a democratic state that speaks the Jewish national language, in effect, a Hebrew republic. Again, the Hebrew of Tel Aviv is spacious enough for Arabs to absorb its nuances and yet remain Arabs, at least in the hybridised way minorities everywhere adapt to a majority’s language and the culture it subtends. Diaspora Jews are nothing if not proof of how this can work. Those preoccupied with demographic trends, including leaders of Israel’s peace camp, have an understanding of “Jewish and democratic” that is shallow and mechanical. They are painting by numbers. If there is hope here, it is that the businesses and towers of Tel Aviv are facts on the ground just like the settlements in the territories are. Nor are settlers alone in determining Israel’s political fate. The most important and least specified force comes into relief when we look at the centre in a different light, not as political leaders, but as economic players. I am referring to a new generation of elite professionals whose talk about demographics is actually a placeholder for a potentially open-minded vision – people who are willing hostages to the market pressures and liberal values inherent in globalisation. If they intend to maintain their country’s economic vitality and retain their own power, this elite will have to nudge Israel in the direction of global integration, no matter what their traditional prejudices about Zionism’s cause may be. Ultimately, this must mean not only two states, Israel and Palestine, but the separation of religion and state and the retiring of old Zionist institutions. The only Israel that could integrate in this way, so they are discovering, is a country that looks much like that Hebrew republic. And given that Israel and Palestine together are no bigger than greater Los Angeles, the confederation advocated by Israeli Arabs may well be the only way to make two states work. In any case, the advocates of Greater Israel will ultimately have to be defeated by advocates for Global Israel – not an easy challenge so long as the Trump administration cheers on the former. But Trumps and Netanyahus come and go. Eventually, things that can’t go on don’t. If Israel were to take shape as a Hebrew republic, would Israeli Arab elites agree to join it? And if they did, would Israel’s Jews accept them? You walk down Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv and the questions do not seem rhetorical. But a new generation will have to think, not just about bad apples, but about bad barrels, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/20/secret-brexit-deal-scotch-whisky-threat-us-imports","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T23:05:40Z","webTitle":"Secret Brexit deal could threaten scotch whisky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/20/secret-brexit-deal-scotch-whisky-threat-us-imports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/20/secret-brexit-deal-scotch-whisky-threat-us-imports","fields":{"headline":"Secret Brexit deal could threaten scotch whisky","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A post-Brexit trade deal with the US could mean whiskey galore for the UK. But while drinkers might be celebrating, this could be bad news for scotch whisky distillers who are being warned that their industry faces a glut of imports from US producers if trade barriers come down once the UK leaves the EU. US trade groups want any trade deal signed between the two countries to drop current EU requirements relating to the ageing of whisky, something that would allow US manufacturers to promote their rival, younger products as whiskey (the spirit made by non-Scottish producers is spelled differently). Discussions between the two countries over what can and cannot be included in a potential trade deal are being conducted in secrecy, according to transparency campaigners. Last December, Greenpeace’s Unearthed investigations unit reported that the UK and the office of the US trade representative had signed an agreement that information, papers and discussions relating to the talks should be considered “sensitive” or “confidential”. But some key issues can be gleaned from the annual barriers to trade analysis, prepared by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The voluminous document’s demands for an end to prohibitions on chlorinated chicken and other meat washed in microbial rinses have been widely aired. But it also reveals that the US would push the UK to accept GM foods and biotech seeds, and to do away with certain prohibitions on chemical flavourings, live cow exports and endocrine disrupters which affect hormones in animals. The US also wants protected designation of origin, which safeguards products such as Cornish pasties or Melton Mowbray pork pies, dispensed with because they “undermine access” for US producers. The analysis discusses the current EU requirement that a product labelled as whisky or whiskey must be aged for a minimum of three years as a quality requirement. It states: “The United States has a long history of quality whiskey production, particularly by micro-distillers, which has not entailed minimum aging requirements, and views a mandatory three-year aging requirement for whiskey as unwarranted. Recent advances in barrel technology enable US micro- distillers to reduce the aging time for whiskey while producing a product commensurate in quality.” Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said the whisky issue was the tip of a large iceberg. “We’re always told that international trade deals will help us sell more whisky – but this latest information from the US trade representative shows a trade deal with the US could actually be a threat to this iconic drink. The US government don’t like our food standards, and they repeatedly tell us that abandoning these standards for imports is essential if they’re going to sign a deal. That means allowing food like chlorine washed chicken and hormone fed beef into our markets. But it could also mean changing the standard on the production of whisky and allowing iconic products like stilton to be made in the US.” A spokeswoman for the Scotch Whisky Association said it would campaign for EU food standards to be applied to any trade deal with the US. “According to EU legislation, whisky produced or sold in the EU is required to be matured for at least 3 years, and meet other well-established criteria,” the spokeswoman said. “We are opposed to the sale of any whisky in the UK that does not comply with the legal requirements for whisky under EU law.” Dearden said that opinion polls suggested that the majority of people do not want a trade deal that lowers standards and called for discussions to be made more transparent. “We’re going to have to fight for a more democratic trade policy if we want to stop Liam Fox’s attempts to Americanise the UK economy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/27/in-brief-moment-grace-meet-me-museum-anna-karenina-fix-lessons-russian-literature","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T11:00:23Z","webTitle":"In brief: A Moment of Grace; Meet Me at the Museum; The Anna Karenina Fix: Life Lessons from Russian Literature – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/27/in-brief-moment-grace-meet-me-museum-anna-karenina-fix-lessons-russian-literature","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/27/in-brief-moment-grace-meet-me-museum-anna-karenina-fix-lessons-russian-literature","fields":{"headline":"In brief: A Moment of Grace; Meet Me at the Museum; The Anna Karenina Fix: Life Lessons from Russian Literature – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A Moment of Grace Patrick Dillon Ebury Press, £12.99, pp224 In 2015, shortly after celebrating her 50th birthday, theatre producer Nicola Thorold attended a routine GP appointment about bruises that had appeared on her legs following a virus that had been difficult to shake off. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia and died a year later. In A Moment of Grace, her husband, the writer and architect Patrick Dillon, constructs a narrative as structurally intricate as it is affecting. Alternating between the story of Thorold’s treatment, the couple’s relationship and the aftermath of her death, it is a profoundly moving and impassioned account of a 28-year romance: “Love was the hut in which we found shelter.” Meet Me at the Museum Anne Youngson Doubleday, £12.99, pp224 Youngson’s epistolary novel follows the correspondence between Tina Hopgood – a farmer’s wife living in Bury St Edmunds – and professor Anders Larsen, a curator at a Danish museum. What begins as an inquiry about the Tollund Man, and Tina’s thwarted plans to visit the museum, soon develops into a much-valued friendship. As the two enter into detailed discussions about history and archaeology, as well as sharing intimate details about their family lives, the book becomes a thoughtful and gentle meditation on buried passions, regrets, love, grief and loneliness. But Youngson’s debut offers hope for change in its tender exploration of what it means to have experienced a life well-lived. The Anna Karenina Fix: Life Lessons from Russian Literature Viv Groskop Fig Tree, £9.99, pp224 (paperback) In her introduction to The Anna Karenina Fix, comedian and journalist Groskop acknowledges that while she has two degrees in Russian, she is nonetheless a “shambling amateur” with a desire to wrestle Russian literature back from the “very clever people who want to keep it for themselves”. Her focus is on what it “can teach us about life without us actually having to live through the things described”. As such, we have a book that is part memoir, part self-help manual and part breakneck tour through some of the greats (Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Pushkin and Chekhov), making for an enthusiastic and highly knowledgable jaunt through 150 years of literature.

But if oil analysts are right and the cost of crude is set to carry on rising, hitting $100 a barrel over the coming months, the big story of 2019 is going to be how oil came down to earth with a bump. There are, without question, solid reasons for the oil price rises. The global economy has been performing more strongly than expected, with almost every region doing its bit to push up demand. Donald Trump’s tax cuts in the US and the reluctance of the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank to tighten policy mean there is no immediate threat of recession. On the other side of the equation, supply has been kept in check. Part of this – the Opec production curbs – was planned. Other aspects of it – the chaos in Venezuela and Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal – were not. As a result, there is no longer an oil glut as there was in the middle of the decade. If Iran is frozen out of the global oil market, other suppliers will eventually take up the slack. But it will take time for Opec members to ratchet up supply – even assuming that they decide to do so. The same applies to shale-oil producers in the US. Prices are going up because traders are speculating that demand for oil will exceed supply – and for now that looks like a reasonable assumption. But push things forward six or nine months and things look a bit different. Although the global economy seems healthy enough, it has eased back since hitting a peak in the final months of 2017 and early 2018. Europe had a weaker-than-expected first quarter; China is clearly slowing down. In the US, it is a different story. There, the economy is operating at close to full employment, investment is up and consumers are spending freely. But, in a classic case of the law of unintended consequences, any benefits Americans enjoy from Trump’s tax cuts are soon going to be gobbled up by the higher fuel prices caused by the president’s get-tough approach towards Iran. The Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, is already thinking about raising interest rates three times before the end of this year, and is even more likely to act if it sees higher petrol and diesel prices pushing up inflation when the labour market is so tight. To be sure, there are reasons to think oil prices may hit $100 a barrel and carry on rising. With Trump in the White House, anything could happen. The Middle East could erupt into a full-scale conflict between Iran and Israel. The brittle detente between North Korea and the US could break down. In those circumstances, the cost of crude would stay higher for longer. But in the absence of a new geopolitical shock, oil prices will eventually start falling. In oil-importing countries, more expensive crude will eat in to the discretionary spending power of consumers, leading to weaker demand in 2019. This will happen just as the US public is starting to feel the impact of higher interest rates, and as the effects of the tax cuts are wearing off. On the supply side, two things will happen. First, US shale production – which is highly profitable with oil at $80 a barrel – will expand. Second, Opec producers will – whatever they say in public – quietly start to exceed their quotas in order to make up for the shortfall caused by sanctions on Iran. Demand for oil is going to fall while supply is going to rise. Markets do not always behave in the way the economics textbooks predict, but this time, they will. MPs were right to give Carillion chiefs a roasting The language of the joint select committee report into the collapse of Carillion was punchy, even bombastic. It told of “recklessness, hubris and greed” at the failed outsourcing firm, lamented a “rotten corporate culture” and named and shamed three directors. The Confederation of British Industry was not impressed. Deputy director general Josh Hardie complained that the report was irresponsible, giving and gave the impression that British business in general was greedy and reckless. Such “knee-jerk soundbites” – as he described the choicest phrases – risked harming investment in Britain. Perhaps the criticisms struck a little too close to home. After all, Carillion was taken to task for its aggressive accounting, including booking revenues it had not yet pocketed. That’s not a million miles away from the accounting scandal at Tesco, where corporate responsibility fell for eight years under the eye of one J Hardie. It is also worth noting that Carillion’s auditor, KPMG, and the other big accountants, are all members of the CBI. The Institute of Directors took the opposite approach. Ministers were “right to criticise the failures” at Carillion, said director of policy Edwin Morgan, as many in the business community had been “appalled” by the affair. The tone of the Carillion report may be edgy, but it is also refreshing. Its authors dispensed with the niceties, abstractions and caveats common to these documents. After such an ignominious scandal, members of the public want to hear what happened in plain English and, for once, that’s what they got. If there is a reason not to invest in Britain, it isn’t the language of the Carillion post-mortem, but the inadequacies of the directors, regulators, government and corporate culture that killed it. That needed saying. Corruption solutions start on the home front Corruption is a global tax on development. Tax havens are awash with cash that could and should be spent alleviating poverty in poor countries. Overseas demand for real estate in Belgravia or Manhattan is the other end of the dirty deals that siphon off cash that might otherwise be spent on health and education in the developing world. Knowing that corruption exists is one thing. Fighting it is altogether more difficult. That much is obvious from the new memoir, Fighting Corruption Is Dangerous by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who spent two spells as finance minister of Nigeria, trying to clean up the oil-rich country. Okonjo-Iweala had some successes in her anti-corruption drive. Modernising Nigeria’s payments system, for example, rooted out more than 60,000 “ghost” workers. But she made powerful enemies along the way and left office in 2015 with the job far from complete. Clearly, Nigeria is by no means the only country with a corruption problem, but should be considered a test case. If it can be cracked there, it can be cracked anywhere. So what needs to be done? While pressure from the International Monetary Fund can help, the fight against corruption is ultimately a domestic affair. Governments have to be up for the struggle, and they need a thought-through plan that can build and maintain a domestic coalition willing to take on vested interests. Leadership from the top is vital. So is a good communications strategy to keep the public on board. Fighting corruption requires strong institutions and administrative arrangements for tax collection, record keeping and law enforcement – things poor countries often lack. This is where outside help could make a difference. Okonjo-Iweala suggests that western countries could also offer paid fellowships to provide safety nets for those who take personal risks by exposing corruption. The IMF has also announced that it will monitor developed countries to ensure that their financial systems are not conduits for money laundering. The temptation is to think that eradicating corruption is about getting the good guys to take over from the bad. It is a bit more complex than that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/18/newcastle-dean-richards-no-interest-england-job-rfu","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T21:00:09Z","webTitle":"Newcastle’s Dean Richards: I’ve absolutely no interest in any England job","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/18/newcastle-dean-richards-no-interest-england-job-rfu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/18/newcastle-dean-richards-no-interest-england-job-rfu","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle’s Dean Richards: I’ve absolutely no interest in England job","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dean Richards has stated he has “absolutely no interest” in being England’s head coach, suggesting he would not last a week in the job. Richards’s stock has soared after guiding Newcastle to the play-offs and on Thursday he was named the Premiership’s director of rugby of the season, 17 years after he last won the accolade with Leicester. Eddie Jones signed a contract extension until 2021 in January but it includes a break clause after the World Cup next year and the Rugby Football Union has begun its recruitment process, planning for both eventualities. Richards was touted for the role in 2008 and would again be an attractive option for the RFU, having rebuilt his reputation with Newcastle after the 2009 Bloodgate scandal. He recently signed a new three-year deal with Newcastle but the RFU demonstrated a willingness to buy its chosen candidate out of contract with Jones. “When someone suggested it I laughed because I have absolutely no interest in it at all,” Richards said. “I just don’t fancy it. It is a totally different job to being a director of rugby at a club. There is more politics, more dealing with the media. All the stuff that I find very difficult and don’t like, you’d be expected to do more of. It takes a special person to do the international job. “You only have to look at the treatment of Martin Johnson, Stuart Lancaster and Andy Robinson by the media and by the RFU when it didn’t go right. Why would I want to put myself through that? I am a little bit blunt, a little bit straight-talking and certainly not one for politics at all. I would almost certainly fall foul in the first week.

She was also an advocate of other 20th-century repertoire, notably of Béla Bartók and Paul Hindemith, and felt an affinity with the British composers Frederick Delius, whom she considered an English Szymanowski, recording his three violin sonatas, and Benjamin Britten. A recording of a 1967 performance of Britten’s Violin Concerto at the Royal Festival Hall with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Witold Rowicki, won the German Critics’ award in 2012, as well as praise from Rob Cowan of Gramophone, who described Wiłkomirska as a distinguished exponent of the Britten: “She was clearly on top form … [and] movingly persuasive in the work’s many lyrical passages.” A teacher, Irena Dubiska, once told her: “Wanda, if you cannot play well, play beautifully.” Wiłkomirska’s playing, on a violin made in 1734 by Pietro Guarneri of Venice, was intuitive, musical, silken-toned and conveyed musical structure – important in the playing of contemporary music. Wiłkomirska was an international violinist of the highest level. In 1976 she played the Britten with the LSO at the Royal Festival Hall under Erich Leinsdorf, and later with the Royal Philharmonic and Hans Vonk (1981). She also performed at the Edinburgh festival under Kurt Masur. Her worldwide partnerships included performing with Leonard Bernstein, Otto Klemperer, Carlo Maria Giulini and Zubin Mehta, and with the Cleveland, Hallé, Royal Concertgebouw and New York Philharmonic orchestras. Wiłkomirska made two appearances at the Proms: in 1967 performing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra under Jan Krenz; and returning in 1983, after her defection from Poland, to play Szymanowski’s Second Violin Concerto with the National Youth Orchestra and Charles Groves. Under Poland’s postwar communist regime Wiłkomirska was regarded as a cultural ambassador and given a fair amount of freedom to travel abroad. In a 1998 interview she recalled: “I joined the party, I never deny it. But just as I openly waved a red flag, with the same openness I went to the opposition after many years.” In 1952 she had married the party member Mieczysław Rakowski, who eventually became prime minister in 1988, but in 1976 she was among the many artists and intellectuals who opposed restrictive amendments to the constitution. She encouraged Rakowski to soften his views, but they divorced the following year, and, after martial law was imposed in 1981, she defected, first to Germany and then to Australia. Daughter of Dorota Temkin and Alfred Wiłkomirski, she was born in Warsaw into a musical family, and had little choice but to join in. Alfred taught at the Warsaw Conservatory and had three children, Kazimierz, Michał and Maria, from his first marriage, who performed as a trio. Kazimierz was the director of the Polish music school in Gdansk. Dorota was a piano teacher and her son, Wanda’s brother Josef, became a conductor, cellist and composer, who took part in the Warsaw Uprising. Wanda started the violin at a young age with her father, who taught her the exercises of Otakar Ševčík from his famous “method”. She then studied at the Academy of Music in Łódź, from where she graduated in 1947. She moved to the Ferenc Lizst Music Academy in Budapest and came under the influence of Ede Zathureczky, a pupil of the Hungarian virtuoso Jenő Hubay, whom Wiłkomirska described as a “pedagogical genius”. She then turned to lessons with Henryk Szeryng, whom she met during a visit to Paris. She gathered various prizes (Geneva 1946, Budapest 1949, second in Leipzig’s International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition in 1950) and gave her Wigmore Hall debut in 1951, before sharing second prize with Julian Sitkovetsky (Igor Oistrakh came first) in the Henryk Wieniawski violin competition in Poznán in 1952, playing Szymanowski’s First Concerto. Wiłkomirska subsequently performed this concerto with the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra and Witold Rowicki for the opening in 1955 of the rebuilt Warsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall. It was this performance that led to her close association with both Szymanowski concertos and many of his other small pieces and pointed the way towards performing with this same orchestra and repertoire in the US. Wiłkomirska liked visiting small venues and playing for audiences without access to major centres. If there was no piano, she would play on her own, her programmes including solo works by JS Bach, Hindemith and Bartók. “I have the big cities,” she said. “I have all those Londons and New Yorks, Berlins and Moscows. But I can’t forget the little cities where I played when I was young and unknown.” Recordings were largely for the American label Connoisseur Society, and included a wide variety of chamber music. After leaving Poland, Wiłkomirska combined her concert playing with teaching and held positions first in Germany at the Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst, Mannheim, and then, after moving to Australia in 1999, at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the Australian National Academy of Music, in Melbourne. She also served as a jury member on a number of international competitions. But although she had performed widely outside Poland before her defection, she found it difficult to re-establish her reputation in the later part of her career. In 1990 she returned to Poland for the Warsaw Autumn and a performance of her fellow émigré Andrzej Panufnik’s Violin Concerto. She confessed how nervous she had been in advance of the audience response, but in the event she was welcomed enthusiastically. In recent years she returned to live in Poland. She is survived by her two sons, Wlodzimierz and Artur. • Jolanta Wanda Wiłkomirska, violinist, born 11 January 1929; died 1 May 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/18/jos-buttler-england-recall","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T17:00:04Z","webTitle":"Jos Buttler’s recall is a decadent pick that’s perfect for our times | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/18/jos-buttler-england-recall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/18/jos-buttler-england-recall","fields":{"headline":"Jos Buttler’s recall is a decadent pick that’s perfect for our times","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Every year in the US five people die and 10 million dollars of damage is caused as a result of deep-frying a turkey. This appears to be a festive tradition among bearded flag-draped men with hunting knives and baggy shorts, men for whom freedom’s just another word for caramelising your own arteries and shouting a lot on YouTube. But freedom comes at a cost. Each deep-fried turkey takes seven gallons of superheated fat. A special chain is required to lower it into its hell-cauldron. Moisture is the key issue: a pocket of concealed water inside the turkey can cause it to explode into a roiling spume of flames and fat. All things considered it would probably be more sensible to cook these turkeys in the oven, to play it straight. But then, you don’t get a special chain. You don’t get seven gallons of oil, or great melting mouthfuls of face-scalding fat-soaked bird, so tangy and moist and crispy-skinned you’re already salivating over it now. Bad ideas that look delicious. Delicious ideas that are – despite being delicious – also clearly very bad. Ideas that end up with everyone catching salmonella, the house on fire and England 86 for eight on a nibbly green seamer. There was a note of this in the first sight of England’s squad for the Lord’s Test against Pakistan next week; with specific reference to the gripping, oddly decadent selection of Jos Buttler as a specialist No 7 batsman, given licence to wander out, sniff the air and basically make the game up in front of him. There is a degree of natural resistance to this, a sense that to pick Buttler is to devalue decisively the proving grounds of county cricket. Buttler averages 17 in four red‑ball games over the past year. His selection is at odds with all we have heard about the informed methods of Ed Smith, out there crunching his data curves, occasionally emitting a clank of excitement over some outstanding first-innings metrics from the strangely overlooked Cakebread-Thomas of Derbyshire seconds. Instead we have this. Faced with an ailing team and a general anxiety about how to make all forms of cricket more instantly comestible the selectors have reached for the most more-ish option; have decided, basically, to just give up and deep-fry the turkey. And yet it is undeniably the right thing to do. Not playing Buttler when you have the chance to play Buttler: that really would be weird. “He hasn’t been picked because of the IPL,” Smith said this week. But he clearly has. Buttler has been picked, in part, because he is famous, because right now he is among the top three hottest, most luminously attractive cricketers in the current edition of the sixth biggest sporting league in the world. This is simply the truth and everyone involved should embrace it, because it’s both entirely sensible and entirely consistent with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s more gimmicky attempts to popularise the game. If we’re willing to junk the basic robustness of the sport via the Hundred, to introduce the new colts cricket rules trailed this week – ditch the lbw law, double-run maxi zones in the field – then it looks like old-school good sense to pick the most pop-famous cricketer in the country as often as possible. The fact is Buttler stands outside the normal rules and numbers. This has been said before about other cricketers. But in this case it’s actually true. He was a ludicrous spectacle in the IPL this year, driving and cuffing and gliding his way to 389 runs off 258 balls at an average of 97, with that familiar, beautifully delicate kind of violence in those whip-crack wrists. It is traditional at this point to suggest batting on pitches where the ball moves, where a flighty fifty can lose a game rather than win it, is a different matter altogether. Plus Buttler has been batting with a self‑made technique in India, adopting that white‑ball power hitting stance, front leg shifted to one side so he can hit in front of square from the same base, sending the ball through the field in a weird flat, scything arc. The thing is, it works. Just as moving up to open has worked, despite the need to adapt instantly to new angles, speeds, pressures. English cricket has no history of producing unorthodox players, certainly not at this global-genius level. But for once it is perhaps simply time to go with it. The real issue around Buttler’s career isn’t his ability to defend against the swinging ball. The absurdity of mature Buttler is that he is essentially a blank in his own country, a Category A sports person in a global game who could probably walk in and buy a plastic bat in the Catford branch of Sports Direct without anyone offering a yawn of recognition. This week the chairman of the ECB told us children just don’t like cricket. This is of course dangerous nonsense. The game is good. The talent is there. But it is also invisible to swathes of the population, just as Buttler has become English sport’s great invisible superstar, hidden away behind the high hedge on the last remaining patch of green. For an industry that spends a lot of time quivering and whining about what it doesn’t have, Buttler is the asset, the talent. Centre stage may be a little left of centre these days. But it’s time to get him out there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/may/21/retrograde-asteroid-is-interstellar-immigrant-scientists-say","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T12:27:38Z","webTitle":"Asteroid from another star system found orbiting wrong way near Jupiter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/21/retrograde-asteroid-is-interstellar-immigrant-scientists-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/21/retrograde-asteroid-is-interstellar-immigrant-scientists-say","fields":{"headline":"Asteroid from another star system found orbiting wrong way near Jupiter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A permanent visitor from interstellar space has been found in our solar system, astronomers studying an asteroid orbiting our sun have revealed. While collisions with Earth by comets and asteroids from within our solar system are thought to have brought organic material and water necessary for life to emerge, experts say the latest discovery suggests bodies from beyond the solar system might have also have played a role. “It would be very interesting to go and observe it more and understand its composition,” said lead author Dr Fathi Namouni from the Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur. “Before [the discovery of this asteroid], we only had to work to explain solar system phenomena with the objects that are in the solar system and thought to be part of the solar system all the time,” he said. “Now we have new sources of material that actually influenced the solar system – and so the solar system did not grow up in isolation.” The latest discovery marks the first time an asteroid that appears to be a permanent member of our solar system has been revealed as having its origins in another star system. ‘Oumuamua, an asteroid spotted hurtling through our solar system earlier this year, was only on a fleeting visit. Known as asteroid 2015 BZ509, the permanent visitor is about 3km across and was first spotted in late 2014 by the Pan-Starrs project at the Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii. Experts quickly realised the asteroid travelled around the sun in the opposite direction to the planets – a retrograde orbit. Further work on the asteroid revealed it takes the same length of time to orbit the sun as the planet Jupiter at a similar average distance, although in the opposite direction and with a different shaped path, suggesting the two have gravitational interactions. But unpicking quite where the asteroid came from was challenging. Asteroids that orbit the sun on paths that take them between the giant planets – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune – are known as centaurs, and it is thought that many might come from distant bands of material within the solar system such as the scattered disk or the Oort cloud. Several, like BZ509, are known to have retrograde paths, although how they ended up on such orbits is unclear. What’s more, centaurs’ orbits are difficult to pin down precisely and are thought to be unstable. But there was a clue there was something unusual about BZ509: while previous studies suggested retrograde centaurs stay gravitationally “tied” to planets for 10,000 years at most, recent work had suggested this asteroid’s orbit had been linked to Jupiter for far longer, probably as a result of the planet’s mass and the way both take the same time to orbit the sun. Writing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Namouni and co-author Dr Helena Morais from São Paulo State University in Brazil describe how they developed a new computer model that allowed them to produce a million possibilities for the asteroid’s orbit, each with tiny differences, and trace their evolution. To the team’s surprise, the results reveal that the asteroid’s orbit appears most likely to have remained very similar and linked to Jupiter for 4.5bn years – in other words, since the end of planet formation. “That was completely unexpected,” said Namouni. The discovery provides vital clues as to the asteroid’s origins. “It couldn’t be debris of the solar system because at 4.5bn years, all objects, planets, asteroids, comets in the solar system are going around the solar system in the same direction,” he said, adding that the model suggests the most likely explanation is that the asteroid was captured by Jupiter as it hurtled through the solar system from interstellar space. “It means it is an alien to the solar system,” he said. Namouni said the asteroid is unlikely to be the solar system’s only immigrant. The computer modelling reveals that asteroids that had been captured by Jupiter but then broke free from the planet’s gravitational pull would now be orbiting the sun on a path perpendicular to the plane of the solar system. Namouni says astronomers should go on the hunt for such bodies. “When [BZ509] was captured [by Jupiter], probably it wasn’t captured all by itself, or maybe it broke up,” he said. Dr Licia Ray, a planetary scientist at Lancaster University who was not involved in the research, said the discovery of a body from another star system in the midst of the solar system was exciting. “That means you can get a lot of cross-contamination, for lack of a better word, of stellar planetary systems during their formation,” she said, adding that it might be that other asteroids came into our solar system and crashed into the sun, were ejected or even smashed into planets or moons – a tantalising possibility not least because the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have conditions favourable for alien life. “It definitely could mean that you could get organic building blocks [of life] spread between different systems,” she said. The team are now hoping to go further. “We are looking to apply our time machine simulation to the orbits of other retrograde centaurs to see where they come from,” said Namouni."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/shortcuts/2018/may/20/from-zuckerbergs-apology-to-just-harried-should-you-wear-a-topical-t-shirt","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T13:00:57Z","webTitle":"​From Zuckerberg’s apology to ‘Just Harried’ – should you wear a topical T-shirt?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2018/may/20/from-zuckerbergs-apology-to-just-harried-should-you-wear-a-topical-t-shirt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/shortcuts/2018/may/20/from-zuckerbergs-apology-to-just-harried-should-you-wear-a-topical-t-shirt","fields":{"headline":"​From Zuckerberg’s apology to ‘Just Harried’ – should you wear a topical T-shirt?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Last month, New York magazine announced an innovative way to circumvent falling print media revenues: turning headlines from the Cut, the magazine’s popular fashion section, into slogan T-shirts, in partnership with Merch by Amazon. At $25 (£18.50) a pop, headlines such as “What do Jared and Ivanka do all day?” or “Four men and Greta Gerwig” became what Women’s Wear Daily have dubbed “wearable content”. It isn’t a new idea. Since 2011, high-street retailer Weekday been releasing a weekly news-reactive T-shirt, inspired by that week’s hot topics. The brand’s Zeitgeist project is responsible for a range of T-shirts with social media-friendly slogans such as “Miranda for president”, after former Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon launched her plans to run for governor of New York, or “I’m sorry – sincerely yours, Internet”, after Mark Zuckerberg apologised over Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal. After rapper Cardi B announced her pregnancy on Saturday Night Live, Weekday printed “I wanna party with Cardi” commemorative tees, while her previous pregnancy denial resulted in a “Let me fat in peace” T-shirt for the Cut. “It gives us a chance to say something and stand for something,” says Annika Berger, Weekday’s print designer. “Sometimes we talk about serious stuff, like human rights, politics or science, and sometimes we talk about fun things that have gone viral.” For the wearer, the benefit is obvious: it’s an opportunity to make a funny joke or a smart comment without having to be funny or smart. For smaller brands, it can also be a way to shift merchandise at a lower price point, while establishing cultural credentials. British designer Phoebe English was compelled to print a T-shirt bearing the word “Travesty” after the Brexit referendum, although she is now embracing a more positive message, “Hope”. “They are about wearing your heart not on your sleeve, but on your actual heart,” English says. Meanwhile, unisex London label Blouse recently tapped into royal wedding hysteria with a commemorative “Just Harried” T-shirt, which was limited to just 50 prints allocated by Instagram ballot. Given ethical qualms with fast fashion, the responsive model is a little unusual. A viral T-shirt is about as fast as it gets, at a time when we’re being urged to shop more sustainably, with longevity in mind. That said, keep hold of your “Miranda for president” T-shirt long enough and time might just make it a valued memento – more than can be said for much of the high street’s wares."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/18/texas-school-shooting-santa-fe-high","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T20:39:10Z","webTitle":"Santa Fe shooting: Texas governor confirms 10 people dead and 10 wounded","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/18/texas-school-shooting-santa-fe-high","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/18/texas-school-shooting-santa-fe-high","fields":{"headline":"Santa Fe shooting: Texas governor confirms 10 people dead and 10 wounded","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ten people have been killed and 10 wounded in a shooting at a Texas high school that ended with a 17-year-old suspected shooter, a student at the school, surrendering to the authorities. In the latest school massacre to hit the US, police rushed to Santa Fe high school, about an hour from Houston, on Friday morning before 8am local time. Students ran into a nearby field and woods, and took shelter at a gas station after shots rang out. At least one teacher yelled: “It’s real.” Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, confirmed on Friday afternoon that 10 people had been killed and 10 injured. He said: “[This] has to be the worst disaster ever to strike this community … and one of the most heinous attacks in the history of Texas.” By early afternoon, the suspected shooter had been identified as 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis. Donald Trump broke off from an event at the White House and called it “ a very sad day”. He condemned “an absolutely horrific attack” and said his administration was “determined to do everything in our power” to prevent such incidents. A woman who answered the phone at a number associated with the Pagourtzis family declined to speak with the AP. “Give us our time right now, thank you,” she said. Pagourtzis plays on the Santa Fe high school junior varsity football team, and is a member of a dance squad with a local Greek Orthodox church. Abbott announced an immediate effort to gather state lawmakers and experts together to discuss changes to the law to try to prevent such tragedies in future, including speeding up background checks. He said: “It’s impossible to describe the magnitude of evil here ... we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who pose a risk to others.” Abbott did not use the name of the shooter during an afternoon press briefing, but appeared to confirm his identity by referring to certain social media postings that had been found to relate to Pagourtzis, including an image of aT-shirt with “Born to kill” written on the front. The governor said the suspect used a shotgun and a .38 revolver in the attack on his school. “Both of these weapons were obtained by the shooter from his father,” he said, adding that the father legally owned them. A number of explosive devices, including pipe bombs, pressure-cooker contraptions and Molotov cocktails were found at a number of locations including the scene of the shooting, two residences relating to the suspect, and a car, Abbott said. Abbott said the shooter, who is in the custody of the Santa Fe police department, had told officers he had intended to attack the school then kill himself, but he got cold feet and instead surrendered himself to law enforcement. But he said there were few “red flags” that would have warned the authorities ahead of time that the 17-year-old was a direct threat, he said. At the White House, Trump said: “We are with you in this tragic hour and we will be with you forever. We will do everything we can to keep weapons out of our schools and out of the hands of those who should not have them.” Trump pledged action on gun violence after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February, and held high-level meetings with victims, survivors and lawmakers at the White House. But little action has resulted at the national level to change gun laws, despite a huge movement sparked by Parkland students calling for greater gun control. Dakota Shrader, a 10th-grader, told reporters: “We were in class. It was first period. The alarm started going off, everybody went outside, all the teachers were like: ‘Get this way, get this way, come over here.’ Next thing you know we hear the booms and everybody starts running as fast as they can.” A friend was shot in the leg, she said, “and the next thing you know all the art [class] windows are getting shot, shattered”. Authorities have not yet confirmed that report. Student Michael Farina, 17, said he was on the other side of campus when the shooting began, and he thought it was a fire drill. A principal came sprinting down the hall telling everyone to run. He said another teacher yelled out: “It is real.” The tragedy comes three months after the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 and is the 16th school shooting this year that resulted in injury or death. Santa Fe is a semi-rural commuter-belt city of about 13,000 residents located 30 miles (48km) south-east of Houston. On Friday afternoon, the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence lobbying group released a statement expressing sorrow and anger over the shooting and called for Congress “finally” to take action on legislation to combat gun violence. Brady Campaign co-presidents Kris Brown and Avery Gardiner issued a joint statement that read: “We are heartbroken today. Once again, children are shot in their school. “What will it take for Congress to step up and do their jobs to protect innocent children from gun violence?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/19/royal-wedding-music-etta-james-prince-harry-meghan-markle-service","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T05:53:26Z","webTitle":"Harry and Meghan's ceremony to feature Etta James and Ben E King songs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/19/royal-wedding-music-etta-james-prince-harry-meghan-markle-service","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/19/royal-wedding-music-etta-james-prince-harry-meghan-markle-service","fields":{"headline":"Harry and Meghan's ceremony to feature Etta James and Ben E King songs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will leave St George’s chapel at Windsor Castle as newlyweds to the sound of a gospel choir performing Etta James’s version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine, a favourite in African American churches. Kensington Palace has revealed details of the marriage ceremony, which puts a modern spin on traditional royal weddings. Markle will not promise to obey her husband, and Prince Harry will wear a wedding ring. Most male royals do not wear wedding rings. The Prince of Wales does; the Duke of Cambridge does not. The service will use words from the 2000 marriage service from Common Worship, which features contemporary language such as “you” instead of “thee” or “thou”. Music before the ceremony includes Ralph Vaughan Williams’s Fantasia on Greensleeves and Edward Elgar’s Chanson de Matin. The 600 guests inside the 15th-century chapel, including the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, will sing Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, a hymn associated with the Welsh rugby team, of which Prince Harry is a fan. As well as the James number, Karen Gibson and the Kingdom Choir will perform the soul classic Stand By Me by Ben E King. Other music includes the English baroque composer William Boyce’s Symphony No 1 in B flat. In keeping with royal wedding tradition, the UK’s national anthem will be played at the end. While Markle’s father, Thomas Markle, said two days prior to the event that he was unable to attend because of ill health, the order of service still makes reference to him escorting his daughter through the Quire, since there was insufficient time to reprint 600 copies of the 20-page A4 document. Markle’s soon-to-be father-in-law, Prince Charles, will walk her up the aisle. The late Princess Diana’s sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, will deliver a reading from the Song of Solomon, which stresses the strength and power of love. The couple wanted the family of the prince’s late mother to play a role in proceedings. Kensington Palace said the couple had thought carefully about the music, hymns and other parts of the ceremony, and had asked Prince Charles to advise on the selection of orchestral music that plays before the service. “Like any couple getting married, Prince Harry and Ms Markle have taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service,” the palace said. “This has been a collaborative effort led by Prince Harry and Ms Markle.” ‘Undercuts the pomp and circumstance’: the Guardian’s music critic comments Perhaps it says something about how staid and conservative the musical choices at royal weddings tend to be that Prince Harry and Megan Markle’s choice of two pieces of music with a collective age of 104 counts as racy and daring. While Prince William and Kate Middleton stuck strictly to classical music and hymns – Jerusalem, Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, work by Parry, Walton, Bach, Delius and Britten – William’s younger brother and his fiancee have broken with tradition. Ben E King’s 1960 hit Stand By Me, is, like Eric Clapton’s Wonderful Tonight or Elton John’s Your Song, the kind of music ordinary people have played at their weddings: a lushly romantic R&amp;B ballad on which the former Drifters vocalist pledges endless devotion to his inamorata. But the choice of a gospel choir singing a medley of Amen and This Little Light of Mine – which according to some news reports, the couple know from Etta James’s 1982 album The Heart and Soul of Etta James – is more striking, precisely because it’s a gospel song. The music of African American churches is not something one ordinarily hears at royal weddings, and it’s hard to avoid the suspicion that that may have had some bearing on their decision to choose it. Like the Ben E King track, it sends out a signal that slightly undercuts the pomp and circumstance associated with the event: we are not a standard royal couple, and we’re more like you than you think.

A French court found against Branco last week, but its screening here has been prefaced by a solemn lawyerly announcement respecting Mr Branco’s future claims. It’s a backstory of enormous drama, well told in Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe’s documentary Lost in La Mancha, all the way back in 2002, when it looked as if Gilliam’s Quixote film, like Orson Welles’, would never be made. Well, hooray for Gilliam’s energy and self-belief because now it has got made, co-scripted with Tony Grisoni, and although it doesn’t have the visually ambitious and even revolutionary style of Brazil and 12 Monkeys – nor the hard edge of my own favourite of his later films, Tideland from 2006 – it is a film of sweet gaiety and cheerful good nature, an interesting undertow of poignancy, and with a lovely leading turn from Jonathan Pryce as the chivalric legend himself and roistering action scenes pleasantly like Richard Lester’s Three Musketeers movies from the 1970s. It’s almost like a children’s movie, in fact – and there’s nothing wrong with that. This is a film with a sentimental respect for its source material – but Gilliam has new and vigorous insights to offer. It’s as if he is politely waving away our obvious view that he is a Quixote figure tilting indefatigably at movie-business windmills. No, the key player here is Sancho Panza: the servant, the enabler, the rational sceptic whose detachment is faltering, the sorcerer’s apprentice who doesn’t realise that he is being inducted into a mysterious art of creative self-delusion. As befits Cervantes’ daringly postmodern novel, in whose latter part Quixote is aware of being a famous figure because of the publication of the first part, Gilliam’s Quixote is multilayered. Adam Driver plays Toby, the arrogant and overpaid ad director who has been given the chance to make a feature and has opted for Don Quixote. We see him filming in Spain, shooting the giants/windmills scene and enduring those same nightmares of delay that famously tried Gilliam’s faith and have become mythic expressions of imagination and reality. The movie is being bankrolled by an obnoxious, racist businessman, played by Stellan Skarsgård, whose jaded wife, Jacqui (Olga Kurylenko), tries to seduce Toby. Skarsgård’s mogul is in hock to a sinister Russian oligarch, Alexei (Jordi Mollà), who has a huge castle and is given to throwing fancy-dress parties and staging various dramatic events. But in the midst of his ennui and cynicism, Toby is suddenly galvanised: he chances upon a bootleg DVD of his first film: a lo-fi, black-and-white indie that was an adaptation of … Don Quixote. He remembers his passion and idealism, and how he used local non-professionals to make it. His star was a kindly old shoemaker, played by Jonathan Pryce. While shooting is on suspension, Toby journeys to the nearby village to discover what has happened to his old star, and is astonished to discover that the experience of that film completely unhinged the man – or rather it gave him an energy and passion that he never had before. He now believes that he is Don Quixote, striding around looking for worlds to conquer and wrongs to right, his overwhelming vocational energy carrying him along. The bewildered Toby, overstressed and not used to the blazing heat, starts to become his Sancho Panza, losing his grip on boring old reality. It’s a nice premise – similar, perhaps, to Dennis Hopper’s 1971 cult film The Last Movie, about a film-shoot in Peru creating a new kind of ritualistic culture. Pryce has exactly the right daft pomposity and wide-eyed credulity, believing in his own publicity, his own mythology. Driver creates a pretty straightforward character, aggressive, sweary and without much in the way of nuance. As he starts to lose it, his arrogant Americanness starts to curdle and he begins to fantasise that Moroccan illegals are jihadi terrorists, and hallucinates a visit from the Spanish Inquisition (surely Gilliam was tempted to add a line on whether they were expected), antisemitic bigots whose prejudice affords Toby an insight into his own heatstruck paranoia. Joana Ribeiro is interesting as Angelica, herself ruined by being cast as a teenager in Toby’s movie, and who endured 10 long years of disillusionment in showbusiness before returning to her home town, where the poor shoemaker now thinks that she is his Dulcinea. It may not be Gilliam’s masterpiece, but it is a movie with sprightliness, innocence and charm and it is a morale boost to anyone who cares about creativity that Gilliam has got the film made at all. His own intelligence and joy in his work shine out of every frame, and his individuality is a delight when so much of mainstream cinema seems to have been created by algorithm. What a dull place the world would be without Terry Gilliam."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/19/sancho-an-act-of-remembrance-play-britain-first-black-voter-paterson-joseph","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T21:59:39Z","webTitle":"Sancho play portrays slave who became first black British voter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/19/sancho-an-act-of-remembrance-play-britain-first-black-voter-paterson-joseph","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/19/sancho-an-act-of-remembrance-play-britain-first-black-voter-paterson-joseph","fields":{"headline":"Sancho play portrays slave who became first black British voter","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It began as a quixotic project three years ago in local theatre. Now the story of the man who was born on a slave ship and became the first black Briton to vote has taken on new urgency, post the Windrush scandal, as it opens at London’s Wilton’s Music Hall after a run in New York. Paterson Joseph, a Royal Shakespeare Company actor and a familiar face in the TV series Casualty and Peep Show, wrote Sancho: An Act of Remembrance initially out of frustration, he says, at the lack of roles for black actors in period dramas. It has developed into something with much wider significance. And in the heat of the Windrush scandal, it’s become more poignant than ever before. The play tells the story of Charles Ignatius Sancho, who was born on a slave ship bound for New Granada (modern-day Colombia). His mother died at his birth and his father killed himself shortly afterwards. For years, the young Sancho battled servitude and the prejudice of 18th-century London. But he emerged to become a prominent actor and musician, befriending along the way the artist Thomas Gainsborough, who painted his portrait. It was seeing a grainy image of that painting in a book that began Joseph’s quest to find out who Sancho was. More than a decade on, he says that researching Sancho’s life has re-defined how he feels to be black and British today. Growing up in London in the 1970s, Joseph was “always defensive” about the colour of his skin. People would ask him where he was from and then chuckle when he replied “Willesden Green”, saying, “Yes – but where are you really from?” It dawned on him from an early age that people were not seeing him as a boy from the borough of Brent. “They were seeing a blackness.” That childhood memory has become a prologue to his play, much of which is now told through improvisation. “Sancho’s not a role I have to get into,” he says. “The character is already in me.” The historical facts of Sancho’s life are scant, and much of the story has had to be reimagined. “If you look at a man 250 years ago who looks like you, whose brothers and sisters were enslaved, beaten, crushed, killed – and yet he voted when most of the white population couldn’t vote, you think, wow, if he can do it, what the hell am I doing being apathetic?” Performing the play at the National Black Theatre in Harlem this month confirmed for Joseph what he had started to feel more and more: that the story has a powerful resonance today. At the end of the first night, in this famously intimate theatre in New York, an elderly African-American woman stood up in the audience and shouted, “Sonny, that ain’t no old story – that’s happening to us today!” “After that I was holding court every night like a sort of British Martin Luther King,” Joseph says. “I suddenly realised, this play is about America, it’s about Britain, it’s about the ‘now’.” It ran for two weeks in Harlem and after each performance the theatre organised a voter registration drive, giving people forms to take away and fill out. “We got a lot of takers,” Joseph says. It was so successful, in fact, that he has been asked to bring the play back to New York in 2020 in the hope of encouraging a stronger black vote in the run-up to the next presidential election. Despite the seriousness of its subject matter, Joseph insists the play – a one-man show, in essence – is at times “very funny”. “I can’t believe people could have survived hundreds of years of near-genocide and back-breaking work, and rape and all the awful things of slavery without having a sense of humour,” he says. Sancho was a forerunner, Joseph believes, of the struggle for freedom and the right to vote. “I now walk the streets of London knowing that probably 30,000 black people were walking these same streets 250 years ago,” he says. “Knowing that makes me feel solid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/may/18/lloyds-faces-shareholder-revolt-as-ceo-pay-is-95-times-that-of-average-worker","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T16:04:07Z","webTitle":"Lloyds faces shareholder revolt as CEO's pay is 95 times that of average worker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/18/lloyds-faces-shareholder-revolt-as-ceo-pay-is-95-times-that-of-average-worker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/18/lloyds-faces-shareholder-revolt-as-ceo-pay-is-95-times-that-of-average-worker","fields":{"headline":"Lloyds faces shareholder revolt as CEO's pay is 95 times that of average worker","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lloyds Banking Group is facing the prospect of a shareholder rebellion after giving its chief executive, António Horta Osório, a pay packet that is nearly 100 times larger than the average worker’s at the bank. The advisory group Institutional Shareholders Services (ISS) has recommended a vote against the bank’s remuneration report at the annual general meeting on 24 May, highlighting discrepancies between “pay and relative performance”. It turned attention to an “unduly complex” bonus structure and said there was a “lack of clarity in the company’s public disclosures on how bonus outcomes are actually determined”. Referring to the gap between executive pay and the rest of the bank’s staff, ISS added: “Although pay ratios have not been disclosed, ISS has calculated that the CEO’s pay is 95.0 times that of the average employee in the organisation.” Horta Osório took home a total pay package of £6.4m in 2017, up 11% from £5.8m in 2016. It came during what Lloyds called a “landmark year” for the bank, having seen bottom-line profits surge 24% to £5.3bn. Lloyds said in a statement it was “surprised” about the ISS recommendation, given that the advisory group backed the new remuneration policy at last year’s annual general meeting, which implemented the pay framework. “ISS does not challenge the quantum of the awards, which it states are aligned with the group’s strong performance, but raises concerns about the complexity of the framework,” Lloyds said. “We do not agree with the assertions made within the ISS report as the group makes a high level of disclosure on the framework it operates.” While ISS backed the policy, it did note some concerns around changes to deferred pay arrangements, which it said resulted in a “higher proportion of the total remuneration package delivered in cash as compared to the previous policy”. Around 98% of votes cast at at the 2017 meeting were in favour of the policy. Glass Lewis, another shareholder advisory firm, has recommended a vote in favour of the remuneration report. If shareholders follow the recommendations by ISS, Lloyds could be next in line following a string of shareholder rebellions over pay. The bookmaker William Hill saw more than 30% of voting investors cast ballots against the firm’s remuneration report at last week’s AGM. Consternation centred on a 9.1% increase in base salary for the chief executive, Philip Bowcock, which will see him take home a total of £1.3m. The gambling tech firm Playtech also suffered a bloody nose after 59% of shareholder votes were cast against its own remuneration report following plans to raise the pay of its chief executive, Mor Weizer, by 78%. Meanwhile, Melrose – which sealed a controversial £8bn hostile takeover of the engineering giant GKN – saw a total of 23% of shareholders reject its remuneration report following a decision to award four bosses at least £42m each in 2017.

But in focusing on this undoubted advantage he omits the overriding issue of energy storage at very much larger scales. It is this concern which has driven the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (not in the “gas industry’s pocket”, by the way) to take a serious look at hydrogen, which used to be a substantial component of our former “town gas”, derived rather filthily from coal, but which can now can be derived very cleanly from solar and wind power, directed through the water-splitting magic of modern electrolytic machinery. Such renewably generated hydrogen could supply energy storage at scales many times beyond which even the largest battery systems could attain, and could do so both in the UK and in diverse economies throughout the world. Batteries will always be needed for specific uses, but in order to displace the carbon-laden fossil fuels which now imperil climate, ocean and the whole biosphere something rather different must be adopted – something storable at all scales, transmissible, fully functional as a fuel, and climate-neutral. Only hydrogen fills this particular bill. Mike Koefman Director, Planet Hydrogen, Manchester • Professor Underwood correctly asserts that the efficiency of a Li-ion and heat pump system in terms of heat generation is far better than electrolysing water to make hydrogen. But the purpose of storing hydrogen was, it seems, to smooth out the supply of electricity from renewables in dead periods, not generate heat per se. Electricity generation is usually provided by turbines which are driven by steam at high temperatures. I may be wrong, but I thought heat pumps did not generally reach much above 80C and would not be suitable for electricity generation. There is a strong case for both. It is not difficult to imagine we could create a hydrogen storage system for electricity generation, preferably away from populated areas. Individual houses might well benefit from local storage and heat pump systems, but that raises two important questions: where will the supply of lithium and batteries needed come from (which is also infrastructure, I suggest), and will heat pumps operate from the air or ground? Recycling heat from the atmosphere seems appropriate (cooling the outside while warming the inside) but ground-based heat pumps may lead to unexpected consequences (frozen water pipes or cracks) when many might be employed. Surely it is time for joined-up thinking between government, organisations such as IMechE, universities and the public to plan our future energy strategy, not leave it, as usual, to those with vested interests.

The 57-year-old has been away from English football since leaving Derby in March last year, with his last role as a consultant for Maccabi Tel-Aviv in Israel. “It’s great to be back – and it’s a challenge that I’m excited by,” McClaren told the club’s website. “I’ve followed the club closely over the last five years, because of the three months I had here. From the outside I’ve seen the progress, work and changes that have gone on in streamlining the squad and getting the budget down. The board and owners deserve credit for that. “The introduction of younger players has been a breath of fresh air and it’s exciting for the future,” the former England manager added. “I like to play attractive, attacking football – and we’ve got young, hungry footballers here who can play that way.” Les Ferdinand, the club’s director of football, said McClaren is “the perfect fit” for QPR. “[Steve] has a fantastic reputation in the game for coaching and developing players,” he said. “When you look at the average age of our squad, and the exciting young talent starting to emerge, he is the perfect fit for us. We want Steve to use his expertise and experience to help our players grow.” QPR are the seventh club McClaren has managed in a nomadic coaching career. He won the Eredivisie with FC Twente and led Derby to the 2014 Championship play-off final – where they lost to QPR – but lasted only nine months at Newcastle and just 10 league games at Nottingham Forest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/shortcuts/2018/may/18/point-nemo-is-the-most-remote-oceanic-spot-yet-its-still-awash-with-plastic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T15:04:09Z","webTitle":"Point Nemo is the most remote oceanic spot – yet it’s still awash with plastic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2018/may/18/point-nemo-is-the-most-remote-oceanic-spot-yet-its-still-awash-with-plastic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/shortcuts/2018/may/18/point-nemo-is-the-most-remote-oceanic-spot-yet-its-still-awash-with-plastic","fields":{"headline":"Point Nemo is the most remote oceanic spot – yet it’s still awash with plastic","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: Point Nemo. Age: First discovered in 1992 by survey engineer Hrvoje Lukatela. Appearance: A load of water, surrounded by even more water. How do I get there? I wouldn’t bother: the trip would involve a tremendous amount of effort for very little in the way of return. So what’s the point of Point Nemo? It’s officially the oceanic pole of inaccessibility. What does that even mean? It’s the spot in the ocean farthest away from land in any direction – in effect, the middle of nowhere. And where is that, exactly? Point Nemo is located at 48°52.6′S 123°23.6′W, more than 1,600km away from three equidistant islands, including Easter Island. That does sound a faff to get to. So much so that often the closest humans to Point Nemo are aboard the International Space Station. What lives there? Is it teeming with deep-sea life? Not really. It sits within a current called the South Pacific Gyre, which steers away nutrient-rich waters, making it one of the most lifeless parts of the ocean. Does Point Nemo have anything going on? Yes. Plastics. Plastics? Up to 26 microplastic particles per cubic metre were found in seawater samples collected near Point Nemo by passing vessels taking part in the Volvo Ocean Race. Was it left there by the guy who discovered the place? No. Lukatela “found” Point Nemo not by visiting, but by calculating its position using computer software. It’s just general plastic. You mean the most remote point on the planet is polluted? I’m afraid so, although not as polluted as, say, the South China Sea, where they found 357 particles per cubic metre. Does Point Nemo have anything to recommend it as a destination? It’s home to a loud, ultra-low frequency noise known as “the Bloop”, which has been shown to be the sound of ice fracturing in Antarctica. Great. Anything else? Because of its remoteness, the surrounding water is where falling satellites are directed. The ocean floor round there is littered with space debris. I’m beginning to think it sounds like the perfect place to dump plastic. Maybe, but think of the shipping costs. Do say: “This sad discovery shows the need for immediate international action on microplastics.” Don’t say: “One star. Zero amenities, miles from anywhere. The plastic was the best bit. We won’t be visiting again.” • This article was amended on 21 May 2018.

In the end, she sold just 10,000 tickets at £25 each – totalling £250,000 – despite national newspaper coverage. The terms and conditions of the competition allowed her to delay the draw twice but she decided to keep her home and instead give away £188,000 in cash prizes. She also gave £50,000 to charity. Running the competition cost her £43,500, so she ended up with a net loss of £31,500. Pirie is one of a growing number of people who are trying to sell their homes through “win a house” schemes, where tickets are sold at a low cost and the sellers hope they can make up the sale price and pick one winner. The slowdown in the property market over the past year has led to an explosion in the number of properties being offered as prizes, particularly by homeowners who fail to achieve the asking price they want. “I have no regrets because I raised £50,000 for charity, but my advice to other people is: don’t do it. It’s difficult and costly, and the rules are complex,” said Pirie. There are currently more than 20 properties being raffled off across the UK, from Devon to Dumfries and Galloway. Competition listings website Loquax shows 13 others have closed in the past six months. “In slower market conditions, there is often an uplift in house raffles and competitions,” said Russell Quirk, founder of estate agent Emoov.co.uk. “This is mainly because homeowners are pricing emotionally, setting their asking price at what they think their house is worth and not what market conditions are dictating it is worth.” The scheme is simple: typically more than 100,000 tickets need to be sold, usually with a tight marketing budget. Ticket prices range from £2 to £25. Most have clauses in their small print allowing the organisers to merely award cash, less expenses and charity donations, if they do not sell enough tickets to achieve the target amount they want for their property. Of the competitions that have closed this year, it is not clear if any have awarded a property as a prize. As Pirie cautions, the bureaucracy can be anything but simple. If the raffle is deemed to be an illegal lottery by the Gambling Commission, it could attract a fine of up to £5,000 and a 51-week prison sentence for the raffle organiser in the worst circumstances. The taxman can also levy a 12% lottery duty on the ticket sales of unlawful lotteries and charge raffle organisers hefty penalties. The Gambling Commission shut down more than 100 unlawful property raffles when houses prices last dipped, in 2008. It has seen a resurgence in the popularity of these schemes this year, and has been alerted to a dozen potentially unlawful raffles. “We have intervened in schemes where we have had concerns that they are unlawful lotteries. These have either closed or been changed so they are compliant with the law,” a spokesperson said. “We will monitor the situation in the coming months and will continue to step in if we have concerns that any free draw or competition is in fact an illegal lottery.” PayPal has noticed a rise in the number of people setting up property prize draws recently and has banned competition organisers from using its service to process ticket payments. “These prize draws carry considerable risks, such as the possibility that the property is not accurately described, or that the draw is not conducted fairly, or that entries are made from countries where such prize draws are unlawful [such as the US],” a spokesperson says. “We have decided not to allow PayPal to be used to buy tickets for entry to house-prize draws in the UK to protect consumers, PayPal and the people running such draws from these risks.” The problem for organisers of property raffles is that, in general, the Gambling Commission and HMRC only allow “good causes” – such as charities, local authorities and not-for-profits – to lawfully sell tickets for raffles and lotteries where the result is purely based on chance and you must pay to enter. “Housing raffles promise a quick win for people trying to get on to the property ladder, but with several recent listings falling foul of gambling rules, the reality can be different,” said David Blake, spokesperson for Which? Mortgage Advisers. Even when entering the raffle involves an element of skill, such as taking part in a competition to answer a question, the Gambling Commission says a “significant proportion of people” must be prevented from taking part or receiving a prize. Otherwise, it may still be deemed an unlawful lottery and organisers will be subject to lottery duty, fines and possible imprisonment. “There is a fine line to be trodden to remain compliant and yet not to have a question so difficult that it significantly subdues ticket sales by putting off potential buyers from taking part,” says Janet Armstrong-Fox, partner at law firm Collyer Bristow. The raffle could also result in a seller’s tax return becoming more complex. Armstrong-Fox says HMRC might also consider the proceeds from raffle ticket sales as income, leaving the organiser liable to pay income tax and national insurance contributions, as well as capital gains tax if the property isn’t their main residence. The winner may also have to pay stamp duty, or risk being pursued by HMRC for going to extreme lengths to avoid paying tax on a property transaction. Alternative lottery investment company Zeal Investments has been approached by 20 startups in the past year seeking funding to set up a web platform for property raffles. “We have not invested in any,” says director James Oakes. “There are certainly homeowners wanting to sell their houses via this method, but we haven’t seen much demand for these prize draws - there hasn’t been a load of people buying the tickets.” Fiona Pullen, 36, has paid £15 in total to enter two property raffles over the past six months. “It was a fantasy thing because I’d never be able to afford to buy one of those properties.” She never received a ticket for the first raffle and, to her relief, her money was refunded a week later by PayPal. She is still waiting to hear the result of the second draw. “I did worry about whether the raffle was genuine and who would adjudicate the draw so you would know it was fair,” Pullen says. “But the odds were better than the lottery and it was a small amount of money, so I took the risk.” If you are keen to buy a ticket for a property raffle, Oakes recommends checking the terms and conditions on the raffle website to see if you can enter for free first. Free draws are not regulated by the Gambling Commission, reducing the risk for organisers that their raffle will be deemed unlawful and shut down. They can still charge for tickets as long as they also allow you to enter for free by post. Sam Mitchell of online estate agents House Simple thinks sellers simply need to lower their prices. “If you are finding it difficult to sell your property, rather than resorting to desperate measures, take a step back and find out why it might not be selling,”he says. “The market isn’t that bad at the moment but too many properties aren’t correctly priced.” ‘My dire financial straits struck a chord with the public’ When Dunstan Low decided to raffle off his home, Melling Manor, last year, he had no idea how difficult it would be. “It was incredibly stressful,” he says. “I didn’t take any legal advice because I had no money. I just sent a press release to my local newspaper. The next day it was on the front page [of a national newspaper] and I’d sold £103,000 worth of £2 tickets.” Low’s is a rare success story. His widely publicised success of the “win a country home” competition netted him £1m in ticket sales for his property, the east wing of an 18th century Lancashire manor house. He had initially tried to sell the property for £650,000 in 2016. The father of two had purchased the Grade-II listed property five years earlier for £435,000 and spent £150,000 refurbishing it. It cost £10,000 a year to maintain. “I was facing bankruptcy,” says Low. Raffling off his home was a last resort after he failed to sell it at a reduced price of £500,000. He found himself up to his eyeballs in debt of nearly £200,000, in addition to a £410,000 mortgage he could no longer afford. “I put my family through hell. I was a mortgage prisoner.” He believes one of the reasons he was able to sell 500,000 tickets was because his story resonated with people. “Exposing my dire financial straits struck a chord. People wanted me to beat the bank.” The house was eventually won by Marie Segar, a finance worker, who had bought £40 worth of tickets. She sold the house shortly afterwards for £305,000, despite the fact that in all of the newspaper reports that followed Low’s publicity drive, the six-bed property was repeatedly said to be worth more than £800,000. “We gave an estimated value because we don’t know what the property’s exact value was,” says Low. “It was hard to determine, because value involves consensus between a seller and a buyer. We did have estate agents value the property at £800,000.” After spending £20,000 on legal fees, he donated £40,000 to charity and used the remainder of his £1m to pay off his debts and buy himself a four-bed Edwardian home outright. “It’s a quarter of the size of Mellor Manor and more manageable. Raffling off my property saved not only my marriage, but also my mind. I wouldn’t want to be in a situation where I had to do it again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/18/royal-wedding-the-crown-meghan-markle","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T16:39:28Z","webTitle":"A Crown writer on the royal wedding: the next episode in the world's greatest soap opera","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/royal-wedding-the-crown-meghan-markle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/royal-wedding-the-crown-meghan-markle","fields":{"headline":"A Crown writer on the royal wedding: the next episode in the world's greatest soap opera","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“You couldn’t make it up!” is something writers like to say, usually referring to some kind of extraordinary real-life plot reversal that – if put into a fictional storyline – would be called out as unbelievable. That’s why writers love doing adaptations – especially from life. Fiction has to be plausible. It has to be gently teased out, carefully obeying its own rules. The audience must be coaxed into suspending their disbelief. Real life, on the other hand, does what it likes. Disbelief can go hang. And so the real-life dramas of Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle have not been found wanting. Her hapless father, Thomas, has scuppered his big day by allegedly staging photos with the paparazzi. He’s now in hospital doing well after repairs to a broken heart. A spiteful half-sibling is writing a book called The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister. A half-nephew is using the nuptials to promote a strain of cannabis that he sells. Uninvited relatives have turned up at Heathrow airport in casual clothing. There’s been a minor car crash. But wait! Doesn’t all this remind you of events in our recent royal past? A liberated young woman who dreams (fatally) of being a princess. A well-meaning family member who is something of an embarrassment (Charles). Ill-fated dealings with the press. Inadvisable confessions. Unwanted distant relatives. A car crash. The exact details might vary, but the theme remains. This is today’s kind of family, whether royal or otherwise. Splintered and dysfunctional, peppered with upset and divorce. When Peter Morgan rang to ask me to write for The Crown I said yes (actually, I said: Are you kidding me? Yes!) put down the phone and immediately Googled “abdication”. I was alarmed that my royal knowledge was far too hazy. A dim vision of Wallis Simpson, deathly in pearls and clutching a pug, just wasn’t going to make the grade. And what was the name of Elizabeth’s father again? Was he an Edward or a George? And exactly how many Edwards were there? And how many Georges? I wasn’t taught a word of modern history at school. And, as to recent royal shenanigans – my parents brought me up as a good republican and I was inclined to avert my eyes. I thought showing an interest in a bunch of upper-class jokers who didn’t have two A-levels to rub together deeply uncool. In fact, reading royal gossip used to make me feel queasy – like looking at porn. I even missed out on much of the glory years of Diana. For one thing, I read this newspaper which – if I remember rightly – eschewed royal stories in those days, unless they had some kind of constitutional significance. Now it’s two years on from that fateful phone call and – thanks to The Crown’s great team of researchers – I find myself an unlikely – patchy – royal expert! Invited to pronounce! What have I learned from my immersion in all things Windsor? What do I think when I hear about these latest events? Mostly I wonder: what do the royals tell themselves about their past? How does hope spring so eternal? Royal marriages struggle and fail because the crown must always come first. These marriages are made in the service of the crown and in the shadow of the crown. Wallis became pretty bored with David – and exile – by the time she got over the fact of his once being the Prince of Wales. The peripatetic Philip married Elizabeth because protocol demanded a palace – and he was without one. Margaret had to forsake the man she loved because he was divorced. She cast about desperately for a replacement, but found it difficult to mate among the British aristocracy who knew better than to enter the fray. She had to look elsewhere and was susceptible to being pursued for the wrong reasons. Would Tony Armstrong Jones have married someone like Margaret if she hadn’t been a princess? I don’t think so. And so the presence of the crown skews every relationship. I came to see Margaret’s story as a pitiful tragedy, in the end. She was understandably unable to extricate herself from her birthright, but also desperate to escape it. If she’d been sensible, she would have holed up in the country with children and dogs. But she wasn’t that kind of person. She wanted to be at shows and parties and hobnobbing with writers and artists. You can’t blame her for that. She was horribly caught between two worlds and never found her raison d’être. She became a counterpoint to her dutiful sister, a laughing stock of a sort, and died a sad death. The royal family are living in a fascinating and dreadful bind. They are born into slavery of a sort. A gilded cage, yes. But prisoners nonetheless. If born into poverty at least there’s some chance of escape, I don’t think you can ever escape being royal. With this understanding, I’ve come to respect our current Queen enormously. I don’t think any amount of hunting or jewellery can compensate for the sacrifices she has made. The woman is a powerhouse of duty, self-denial and small talk. As to this latest marriage between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, if anyone is going to make a success of marrying into the royal family, an actress is a good bet. Royals play a part. The whole fantasy of royalty is a construct. Any biologist will tell you, there’s no such thing as blue blood. It is always, always, without exception – red. A “king” is an invented idea. As invented as unicorns. The royals are simply the descendants of a man that gained land and power many, many years ago. Probably by being a bit unscrupulous. Probably by being a bit like an early version of Roman Abramovich – but British. Or German. But they have power no more. So, the way I see it, Meghan Markle has landed a role in the biggest soap opera of all time. It’s good that she’s American. She’ll think the whole thing is cute and quaint – and that will carry her through for a while. People worry about the exposure she will face. But I don’t think she’ll have a problem with that. She is set up for scrutiny. She’s got the figure and face to prove it. What I wonder is how she’ll handle the fact that, in the royal family, love does not come first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/18/exeter-ali-hepher-british-coaches-newcastle-premiership-semi-final-playoff","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T13:46:50Z","webTitle":"Exeter’s Ali Hepher: underestimate British coaches at your peril","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/18/exeter-ali-hepher-british-coaches-newcastle-premiership-semi-final-playoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/18/exeter-ali-hepher-british-coaches-newcastle-premiership-semi-final-playoff","fields":{"headline":"Exeter’s Ali Hepher: underestimate British coaches at your peril","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Within English club rugby there is increasingly little patience for the theory that the world’s most successful coaches all hail from the southern hemisphere. Saturday’s Premiership semi-finals reinforce the argument: all four of this season’s top the teams are overseen by British or Irish‑reared coaches who have dominated the domestic honours list for more than a decade. Exeter are one example, with Rob Baxter, Ali Hepher, Rob Hunter and Ricky Pellow seeking to guide the Chiefs to back-to-back titles. “History shows that English or home-based coaches have really dominated in the Premiership,” Hepher said. “There’s no question we produce absolute quality coaches. Our nous for the game shouldn’t be underestimated. People don’t always appreciate the quality coaching going on in the Premiership. There are plenty of coaches who have come in from outside but we’re still winning the league.” Eddie Jones appears to still require some convincing, having just recruited another Australian, Scott Wisemantel, to work as an attack coach on the tour to South Africa next month. Hepher, though, believes Premiership coaches would thrive if they worked in Super Rugby. “The style of rugby that our sides are playing would be competitive against any club side in the world. How far would we go? It would be very interesting if a group of English coaches went to the southern hemisphere.I’d back ourselves to win competitions and I’m sure Mark McCall, Dai Young and Dean Richards would be the same.” For now, though, Hepher and the Chiefs are fully focused on beating a potentially dangerous Newcastle side containing the powerful Vereniki Goneva and Sinoti Sinoti on the wings and Toby Flood at fly-half. Exeter lost against the Falcons at Kingston Park in January but, aside from the England prop Harry Williams and Dave Dennis, have virtually a full-strength squad available as they seek to reach a third consecutive Twickenham final. With Joe Simmonds again starting at fly-half ahead of Gareth Steenson and Thomas Waldrom making his farewell appearance in Devon off the bench, Exeter’s coaches have tweaked their players’ workload to ensure they are at their sharpest. “Mentally we’ve been trying to keep the guys right on it rather than just drifting into the game,” Hepher said. “They’re a good side and if we’re not in the right frame of mind we can be beaten by any side here. We’ve been putting in extra little blasts, almost like mini pre-seasons, to top up fitness levels. We’ve done the grunt and that’s allowed us to be short, sharp and intense this week, making sure the guys are in the right mental state for when the pressure comes on. Last year when we won it we were a young side and there is years more potential in this group. They work incredibly hard day in, day out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/may/21/have-you-been-affected-by-thameslink-timetable-changes","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T08:21:02Z","webTitle":"How have you been affected by the Northern and Thameslink train chaos?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/21/have-you-been-affected-by-thameslink-timetable-changes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/21/have-you-been-affected-by-thameslink-timetable-changes","fields":{"headline":"How have you been affected by the Northern and Thameslink train chaos?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hundreds of trains have been cancelled and many more delayed in disruption that has affected passengers in northern and south-east England the past two weeks.

Le Carré explored the gap between the west’s high-flown rhetoric of freedom and the gritty reality of defending it, in novels such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Night Manager, which gained him critical acclaim and made him a bestseller around the world. On Sunday, his family confirmed he had died of pneumonia at the Royal Cornwall Hospital on Saturday night. “We all deeply grieve his passing,” they wrote in a statement. His longtime agent Jonny Geller described him as “an undisputed giant of English literature. He defined the cold war era and fearlessly spoke truth to power in the decades that followed … I have lost a mentor, an inspiration and most importantly, a friend. We will not see his like again.” His peers lined up to pay tribute. Stephen King wrote: “This terrible year has claimed a literary giant and a humanitarian spirit.” Robert Harris said the news had left him “very distressed … one of the great postwar British novelists, and an unforgettable, unique character.” Adrian McKinty described Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as “quite simply the greatest spy novel ever written”, while historian Simon Sebag Montefiore called him “the titan of English literature up there with the greats … in person, captivating and so kind and generous to me and many others.” Born as David Cornwell in 1931, Le Carré began working for the secret services while studying German in Switzerland at the end of the 1940s. After teaching at Eton he joined the British Foreign Service as an intelligence officer, recruiting, running and looking after spies behind the Iron Curtain from a back office at the MI5 building on London’s Curzon Street. Inspired by his MI5 colleague, the novelist John Bingham, he began publishing thrillers under the pseudonym of John le Carré – despite his publisher’s advice that he opt for two Anglo-Saxon monosyllables such as “Chunk-Smith”. A spy modelled on Bingham, who was “breathtakingly ordinary … short, fat, and of a quiet disposition”, outwits an East German agent in Le Carré’s 1961 debut, Call for the Dead, the first appearance of his most enduring character, George Smiley. A second novel, 1962’s A Murder of Quality, saw Smiley investigating a killing at a public school and was reviewed positively. (“Very complex, superior whodunnit,” was the Observer’s conclusion.) But a year later, when his third thriller was published, Le Carré’s career surged to a whole new level. Smiley is only a minor figure in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, but this story of a mission to confront East German intelligence is filled with his world-weary cynicism. According to Alec Leamas, the fiftysomething agent who is sent to East Berlin, spies are just “a squalid procession of vain fools, traitors, too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives”. Graham Greene hailed it as “the best spy story I have ever read.” According to Le Carré, the novel’s runaway success left him at first astonished and then conflicted. His manuscript had been approved by the secret service because it was “sheer fiction from start to finish”, he explained in 2013, and so couldn’t possibly represent a breach in security. “This was not, however, the view taken by the world’s press, which with one voice decided that the book was not merely authentic but some kind of revelatory Message From The Other Side, leaving me with nothing to do but sit tight and watch, in a kind of frozen awe, as it climbed the bestseller list and stuck there, while pundit after pundit heralded it as the real thing.” Smiley moved centre stage in three novels Le Carré published in the 1970s, charting the contest between the portly British agent and his Soviet nemesis, Karla. In Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, he unmasks a mole in the highest echelons of the British secret service, while in The Honourable Schoolboy he goes after a money laundering operation in Asia, before piecing together Karla’s Swiss connections in Smiley’s People. The world of “ferrets” and “lamplighters”, “wranglers” and “pavement artists” was so convincingly drawn that his former colleagues at MI5 and MI6 began to adopt Le Carré’s invented jargon as their own. As the cold war came to a close, friends would stop him in the street and ask: “Whatever are you going to write now?” But Le Carré’s concerns were always broader than the confrontation between east and west, and he had little patience for the idea that the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled any kind of end either for history or the espionage that greased its mechanisms. He tackled the arms trade in 1993 with The Night Manager, big pharma in 2001 with The Constant Gardener and the war on terror in 2004 with Absolute Friends. Meanwhile, a steady stream of his creations made their way from page to screen. Actors including Richard Burton, Alec Guinness, Ralph Fiennes and Gary Oldman relished the subtleties of his characterisation even as audiences applauded the deftness of his plotting. Le Carré returned to Smiley for the last time in 2017, closing the circle of his career in A Legacy of Spies, which revisits the botched operation at the heart of the novel that made his name. Writing in the Guardian, John Banville hailed his ingenuity and skill, declaring that “not since The Spy has Le Carré exercised his gift as a storyteller so powerfully and to such thrilling effect”. After decades of being painted as a shadowy, mysterious figure, mainly for his uninterest in publicity or joining the festival circuit, Le Carré surprised the world in 2016 by releasing a memoir, The Pigeon Tunnel. Detailing his fractured relationship with an abusive, conman father and a lonely upbringing after his mother abandoned him aged five, Le Carré detailed the strange life of a spy-turned-author, being asked to lunches by Margaret Thatcher and Rupert Murdoch. Having spent four decades living in Cornwall, married twice and raising four sons, including Nicholas, who would write novels himself under the name Nick Harkaway, Le Carré conceded: “I have been neither a model husband nor a model father, and am not interested in appearing that way.” The consistent love of his life was writing, “scribbling away like a man in hiding at a poky desk”. “Out of the secret world I once knew I have tried to make a theatre for the larger worlds we inhabit,” he wrote. “First comes the imagining, then the search for reality. Then back to the imagining, and to the desk where I’m sitting now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/18/jose-mourinho-chelsea-fa-cup-final-romelu-lukaku","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T21:30:33Z","webTitle":"Romelu Lukaku’s fitness only cloud on José Mourinho’s horizon before final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/18/jose-mourinho-chelsea-fa-cup-final-romelu-lukaku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/18/jose-mourinho-chelsea-fa-cup-final-romelu-lukaku","fields":{"headline":"Romelu Lukaku’s fitness only cloud on José Mourinho’s horizon before final","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The fitness of Romelu Lukaku is José Mourinho’s sole matter of concern as the Manchester United manager prepares for the FA Cup final against Chelsea in unusually serene mood. Lukaku will be given until “the last moment” to prove his fitness, according to his coach, after the striker missed the last three games of the league season with an ankle injury. Mourinho also confirmed David de Gea will start in goal ahead of Sergio Romero in a break from the policy that meant the Argentinian started in Cup competitions. Mourinho will face off against his former club at Wembley after a season marked by vituperative exchanges between himself and his opposite number, Antonio Conte. But speaking from United’s FA Cup base in the Hertfordshire countryside, the Portuguese noted only that he was “curious” about Conte’s future. “Anthony Martial is fit and Lukaku – we will have to wait till the last moment,” Mourinho said of his injured players. “I don’t want to lie to you and say Lukaku doesn’t play, then he plays, or vice versa. We will have to wait on Lukaku. “De Gea starts. It’s not about my trust or confidence in Sergio. Sergio was injured for a long, long time. He didn’t play some matches that normally would be his matches, like his semi-final against Tottenham. He trained really only one week before the Watford match and that’s the reason. Last season I played the Europa League final with Sergio and that was a much more important match than this one because it gave us the possibility to play Champions League.” After finishing second behind Manchester City in the table United have guaranteed Champions League football next season. While winning the FA Cup would undoubtedly add lustre to a season that has met with mixed reviews Mourinho says it will not alter his own verdict of what his players have achieved. Chelsea come to Wembley in desperate need of a fillip after finishing outside the top four. Conte is almost certain to depart in the summer and it is perhaps this disparity between their positions that left Mourinho able to be diplomatic. “I honestly still don’t know what Antonio’s situation is,” Mourinho said when asked if he had sympathy for his opposite number. “I didn’t read him saying that he was leaving, and for me that’s the most important thing. So I don’t know if it’s Antonio’s last match. “Of course, sometimes I read that somebody is coming, Luis Enrique is coming, the other is coming, but until it is official that Antonio leaves I don’t know. I’m curious about it but whether tomorrow is his last match or not, it will not change his approach to the game and his desire to make it good.” On the subject of Chelsea’s fans, Mourinho praised their support of him during his two periods at Stamford Bridge. Chants of “Judas” were directed at Mourinho at Stamford Bridge in last year’s FA Cup, a match United lost 1-0. But the 55-year-old insisted he had never had a bad word to say about Blues fans. “You don’t have any quotes from me with negative words about Chelsea supporters, not one word‚“ Mourinho said. “The only thing I say in relation to them is that since my first day in 2004 until my last day when I was sacked a couple of years ago, they were with me unconditionally. They supported me every day. They supported me every match. I will never forget it because they did what I think great supporters do, which is to support their manager unconditionally until the last day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/live/2018/may/22/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-appears-before-european-parliament-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T18:50:24Z","webTitle":"Mark Zuckerberg appears before European parliament - live updates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2018/may/22/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-appears-before-european-parliament-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/live/2018/may/22/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-appears-before-european-parliament-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Mark Zuckerberg appears before European parliament – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If you’re looking for a handy guide to what, exactly, happened today (and even if you watched the whole thing, you may want that question answered), my colleague Jennifer Rankin has the wrap. Damian Collins, chair of the DCMS committee, repeats his frustration at the hearing: What a missed opportunity for proper scrutiny on many crucial questions raised by the MEPs. Questions were blatantly dodged on shadow profiles, sharing data between WhatsApp and Facebook, the ability to opt out of political advertising and the true scale of data abuse on the platform. Unfortunately, the format of questioning allowed Mr Zuckerberg to cherry-pick his responses and not respond to each individual point. I echo the clear frustration of colleagues in the room who felt the discussion was shut down. It is time that Mr Zuckerberg agreed to appear in front of the DCMS committee to provide Facebook users the answers they deserve. The European Parliament format is a terrible way to elicit answers from one of the most powerful people in the world. Zuckerberg would like to make it clear that he is very, very sorry about how his platform has been used for nefarious purposes. Facebook’s social media dominance is under threat from MEPs who made it clear that they consider it to be an uncompetitive monopoly. Nigel Farage is very concerned about the impact Facebook’s recent algorithm changes could have on his ability to reach the public. Zuckerberg lived to fight another day without making any substantial pledge to change the way Facebook operated. Reaction is coming in from observers, and, well, few of them think we witnessed a shining example of European democracy. Damian Collins, head of the DCMS committee: Lukusz Olejnik, privacy expert: European parliamentarians were left unsatisfied following a lengthy Q&amp;A session with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, as the chief executive took advantage of the odd format of the session – which saw each question asked back to back, before Zuckerberg answered them in one block – to avoid giving any specifics. More than two-thirds of the 90-minute meeting was spent on the questions, as the heads of each European party were offered their spot in the limelight, as well as a number of others from around the parliament. When the questioning finally ended, with just seven minutes to go until the scheduled end of the event, Zuckerberg responded in broad strokes, promising to cover the specific details of each question with follow-ups later on. Even angry interventions from some MEPs as the Facebook founder was preparing to leave couldn’t spark a substantial response, with the president of the EP, Antonio Tajani, eventually intervening to declare that time had run out, and that Zuckerberg would only be required to provide written answers at his leisure. And that’s it: Zuckerberg stands and leaves the room, as the MEPs huddle and commiserate with each other about the lack of a real debate. Procedural squabbles! A surprise final question, from Albrecht, asking again whether Facebook will commit to separating data from WhatsApp and Facebook; and another from Lamberts, the Green, asking again whether Zuckerberg will promise the ability to opt out from targeted advertising. But Zuckerberg refuses to answer the questions, promising to get to them in writing, and is backed up by Tajani, who ultimately cuts off the MEPs trying to get their specific questions answered. Zuckerberg is wrapping up with his standard promise to “follow up with each of you after … We’re going to have someone come to do a full hearing after.” On whether there will be more Cambridge Analyticas: “The good news with Cambridge Analytica is that the changes we made back in 2014 would prevent – it wouldn’t be possible for an app developer to get access to that level of data. “But because there were a lot of apps using the data in 2014, we think it’s good to go back and investigate the apps that got access to a lot of data before we locked down the platform. I do anticipate that there are going to be other apps that we’ll find that we want to take down. “This is part of our shift towards not just trying to manage the system reactively. Now what we’re doing is taking a much more proactive approach. We are going through and investigating ourselves up front.” On shadow profiles: “We just announced this ‘clear history’ feature. To your point earlier about separating out the security data, even if they’re not signed in, we need to know how they’re using the service to prevent bad activity. “On the security side, we think it’s important to protect people in our community.” On political bias: “I think that this is a very important topic. We are committed to being a platform for all ideas. That means we want to make it so that people can come to our service for everyone, across the political spectrum. “I can commit to you here today that we have not and will not make decisions about what content is allowed or how we do ranking on the basis of political orientation. On Nigel Farage’s specific point about distribution: “We’ve made a number of changes this year to ensure we’re showing people’s friends’ and family’s content more than content in general … It is not targeting any specific political ideology.” On GDPR: “A number of you asked when we expect to be fully compliant … We do expect to be compliant by May 25. One of the things that we learned is that people have to go through these extensive flows before they can be compliant on May 25. The last thing we want is people to go through the flows quickly. So we’ve been rolling out the flows for a while now, a large percentage of people have been going through them already. “We’ve gotten good feedback on that, and how we’ve implemented that so far.” On taxes: “Facebook has always paid taxes in all the countries where we have operations set up, and we invest heavily in Europe. We have two data centres, and we’re building another one in Denmark. “We’re making significant investments, to contribute to innovation and job growth here as well.” On monopolies and competition: “We exist in a very competitive space where people use a lot of different tools for communication. The average person uses eight different tools … so from where I sit, it feels like there are new types of media all the time.” (Zuckerberg doesn’t mention that four of those tools are owned by Facebook, and a number of the other eight are legacy technologies such as email, SMS and phone calls.) “One thing I want to add is that around the world there are 70m small businesses that use Facebook’s tools to grow and reach customers. “I think it’s important not to lose track that, when you’re talking about competition, there’s the extremely pro-competitive effect of allowing all these small businesses to reach customers in ways that previously only large businesses had the tools to do.” “There were a number of questions about regulation … The question is, what is the right regulation,” Zuckerberg says. “The important thing is to get this right, to make sure that we have regulatory frameworks that protect people, are flexible, don’t inadvertently prevent new technologies such as AI from being able to develop, and don’t prevent a student in their dorm room, like I was, from being able to develop the next great product.” Next up, Zuckerberg addresses elections. “This is one of our top priorities: making sure we prevent anyone from trying to interfere in elections, like Russians were trying to in 2016.” At this point, the format has largely allowed Zuckerberg to simply repeat his opening statement, and so we’re now hearing for the second time about the company’s new tools for transparency on political adverts. On fake news in particular, Zuckerberg notes a few reasons why it gets made. “The first is spam. The way you fight this is the same roadmap that companies have used to fight email spam: you take away the way to make profit. “The second category is fighting fake accounts. We took down about 580m in the last quarter. “The last category is people who are well-meaning but just happen to share something that is provably false. We don’t want to be in the position of saying who is true or false – we work with third-party fact-checkers, and we’re public about who they are, and if they say the story is provably false, we peg something to that and try to show it less.” On moderation, hate speech and censorship, Zuckerberg calls back to, yes, the days he started the company in his dorm room in college. “Our policy has been to have someone flag things for us to look at reactively. Now, here in 2018, we have the ability to get more AI tools to be able to flag more content up front. “So if you look, for example, at terror content, one of the things I’m proud of is that our systems can now flag 99% of the Al-Qaeda and ISIS content before anyone else flags them to us.” The company has also worked, he says, to improve its response to suicide and self-harm on Facebook Live, getting the response time down to 10 minutes. “We’ll never be perfect on this. Our adversaries, especially on the election side, will have access to the same tools we do. But our vision is moving from one of reactive management to us more proactively flagging things.” Now the questioning is over, Zuckerberg begins answering, with seven minutes left until the end of the session. This format is extremely odd. The last question, from Jan Philipp Albrecht, the GDPR rapporteur. “I welcome that Facebook is complying with GDPR,” he says. “In the US Senate you responded, ‘We collect some data for security purposes’ [from logged-out users]. Can you promise this isn’t used for other purposes? “Will you promise to me, and also to EU WhatsApp and Facebook users, that there won’t be any exchange of data from Friday onwards?” Claude Moraes, British Labour, is here as the chair of the civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee. He notes the big difference between congress and the EU: “We are here [gestures up] in terms of regulation, and the United States is here [gestures down]. I know you will say, ‘Of course we’re going to comply with GDPR.’ “The question I’ve been asked … is whether the question of the protection of privacy in Facebook apps is actually the tip of the iceberg, or is there a bigger iceberg?” Isn’t blocking 200 apps for potential infringements, he says, “a clear signal that Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users?” Finally, he asks if Facebook will give all its users access to their full marketing profiles. Another MEP appears, asking questions about Cambridge Analytica. “Does Facebook check compliance by companies?” she asks. “Which specific things will Facebook do to prevent another scandal?” The DUP’s Diane Dodds, as a member of a party that’s not in any political grouping, also gets to ask a question. She attacks Zuckerberg for failing to crack down on fake accounts created for bullying. “Can you explain to us, in light of this phenomenon, what you’re doing to work with third-party organisations to try and educate people in safety in using the internet? And would you tell us that you’re content that other families will have their children kept safe? “We live in a Europe, in the rise of anti-semitism, in the rise of terrorism, much of it conducted online. Can you tell us how you define acceptable comment on the site?” Nicolas Bay, of France’s National Front, next, on the same tack as Farage. Facebook, he says, creates a dependency in its users. “Facebook’s decisions are very important: it’s the same as banning a newspaper if you don’t agree with its opinions.” Generation Identity, a French far-right group, was banned from Facebook, he says. “If you prevent people from visiting the pages of legal groups, you’re preventing them from receiving the opinions that are legal in society. “The hunt for fake news has become fashionable right now, but hasn’t that become an excuse for shutting down freedom of expression?” Nigel Farage next, who describes himself as the EU’s largest Facebook user, before – as he teased – launching into an attack on Facebook as a biased, partial platform. “What is absolutely true is that since January this year, you’ve changed your algorithms, and it’s led to a substantial drop to views and engagements for those who’ve got right-of-centre political opinions. On average, we’re down about 25% over the course of this year. “I’m not talking about extremism,” Farage says. “What interests me is, who decides what is acceptable? Who are these third-party fact-checkers? Why is there no transparency in this process? “I’m beginning to wonder whether we need a social media bill of rights to basically protect free speech. Would you accept that Facebook is not a platform for all ideas, one that is not impartial?” Gabriele Zimmer, a German socialist, is the first to ask a question in a language other than English. She criticises Zuckerberg for the closed nature of the meeting, before turning to the way the site has, she says, degraded since it was formed. “These platforms have changed. There’s a lot more fake news, the communities have gotten smaller, you have a very narrow view of the world. “If we look at the situation in Germany, that can be compensated in public debate – but for people in other parts of the world, this can be deadly. We have seen these cases on Facebook that have lead to the deaths of people. Can the Facebook business model be changed and brought back to its initial mission as a communication platform?” She then cites Goethe as an example, somehow, before noting that Facebook’s verbal support of GDPR isn’t in concert with the company moving 1.5bn people out of the regulation’s remit. She adds that “Facebook was founded as a ‘hot or not’ platform,” before asking whether that means the company can really support women’s rights. (Tajani adds that Zuckerberg came when invited, and the meeting was public as agreed.) Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP, asks a string of yes/no questions: Will Facebook promise “systematic” and “public” transparency on all electoral campaigns? Will it allow all users to opt-out of targeted advertising? Does it produce content, or is it a neutral platform? Will it publish a list of people it employs and their salaries? Will Facebook publish its tax affairs in every country? Next, Guy Verhofstadt, who says he knows Zuckerberg through Dave Eggers’ “The Circle”, a book about a malicious, all-powerful tech company. The difference, he notes, is that Zuckerberg isn’t all-powerful. “I think this is your 14th, 15th apology … This year you’ve apologised three times already. Are you capable to fix it? There has to be clearly a problem. The only way I can see to fix it is to have public regulation. It’s a bit like the banks in ’07, ’08: they said, ‘Oh, we’ll regulate ourselves,’ but they didn’t.” On to questions: Verhofstadt picks up on the recent transfer of non-European users outside of the reach of GDPR, and asks if we can trust that Facebook will actually obey GDPR. “Will you compensate European Facebook users, as required by GDPR?” As for Facebook’s monopoly, he describes Zuckerberg pointing to Apple and Google as competitors as like a car company saying, “We don’t have a monopoly, you can take a train or a plane!” He asks whether Facebook would be willing to split off Messenger and WhatsApp, or keep Instagram. “I really think we have a big problem here. You have to ask yourself how will you be remembered – as one of the three big internet giants, with Jobs and Gates, or as an internet monster?” Britain’s Syed Kamall up next. He reassures Zuckerberg that they aren’t here to try and crush a successful business, but notes concerns, particularly around the company’s gathering of data on non-Facebook users. “I know that by having my own Facebook account, I take some responsibility … but if I don’t have a Facebook account, is the only way to stop Facebook collecting my data by staying off the internet altogether? Is it morally acceptable to collect non-Facebook users’ data without them knowing what you do with it?” Next, German social democrat Udo Bullmann. “Are you ready to completely comply with the new regulation in Europe within the next three days?” Bullmann asks. “Can you guarantee Facebook is in line with the new rules, and that Facebook won’t sell data to third parties without proper consent? “How can you guarantee that no manipulation of the forthcoming vote will happen? In which way will you adapt your business model to ensure that can happen?” Bullmann’s questions, he says, are about “the right of self-government of nations.” On to the questions: oddly, every MEP will ask their questions first, then Zuckerberg will answer them all at the end. “Is Cambridge Analytica an isolated case? Can you guarantee that another scandal will not happen in three, six, nine months’ time?” asks German MEP Manfred Weber. Then: “Did you personally make the decision in 2015 to not notify your users?” “Between Europe and America, we have a different understanding of what is allowed and not allowed to publish,” Weber adds. “I see a lot of member states at the moment asking Facebook to voluntarily ban messages [such as glorification of nazisim]”, he says, adding that “asking” should be “telling”. And finally, directly: can Zuckerberg name a competitor? Would he describe Facebook as a monopoly? “Can you convince me not to break up Facebook?” “Facebook plays a positive role in elections around the world by helping leaders like you connect directly with voters,” Zuckerberg says. “I am determined to keep building tools that bring people together in meaningful ways.” “We’re very committed to Europe,” he adds. Dublin is the international headquarters, London the largest non-US engineering corps, Paris a chunk of the AI workforce. By the end of this year, the company will employ more than 10,000 Europeans, he says. “Now let’s turn to elections,” Zuckerberg says. “In 2016, we were too slow to identify Russian interference on Facebook in the US presidential election. At the time we were more focused on traditional cyberattacks. “Since then, we’ve made significant investments to make this sort of attack harder to do on Facebook. We’ve done a better job since 2016, including in the French elections, the German elections, and the Alabama special election.” Zuckerberg cites the company’s tracking and removal of fake accounts, as well as its removal of the ways in which fake news spammers can make money, as examples of changes that have improved Facebook’s ecosystem. He also brings up Facebook’s recent creation of advertising transparency tools, promising that they will launch globally this summer. GDPR next. “We’ve always shared these values … and now we’re going even further to comply with these strong new rules. We’re making the same controls and settings available to people from around the world.” Zuckerberg teases the company’s forthcoming “clear history” setting, which will let users remove Facebook’s profiling and browser tracking. On to Cambridge Analytica, where Zuckerberg runs through the list of changes the company has already made or promised to make as a result of the scandal: limiting the amount of data apps can gather, advising users to check their app privacy settings, and investigating all apps that received significant amounts of personal data under the previous regime. “We’ve investigated thousands of apps, and suspended more than 200.” Zuckerberg is up with his opening statement. He highlights the company’s safety check tool, helping in the midst of terror attacks; refugees using Facebook to keep in touch with people at home; small businesses using Facebook’s tools to operate online. “But it’s also clear that we haven’t done enough to prevent those tools being misused, that was a mistake, and I’m sorry for it.” He commits to doubling the number of people working on the company’s security, and notes it will “significantly impact our profitability – but keeping people safe will always be more important than our profits.” For anyone hoping for more in-depth questions than we got from the US Congress, we’ve just heard that each MEP gets just three minutes to quiz Zuckerberg – 60 seconds less than the American senators got. Now we’re off for real. “This is an important mark of respect towards the European parliament and European citizens,” Tajani says in English to Zuckerberg – highlighting why the British parliament feels so snubbed by the Facebook founder’s continued refusal to cross the Channel and appear in London. Tajani notes that, in one year’s time, the European Union will vote in new MEPs, and warns that “democracy should never become a marketing operation, where anyone who buys our data can buy political advantage”. “We want the major digital companies to respect the rules for the harvesting and use of our data. In a few days, GDPR will enter in to force … Today’s meeting is just a starting point as we move towards a new form of governance for digital platforms.” Mark Zuckerberg is appearing in front of the European Parliament this evening – leaving British MPs looking on enviously. The House of Commons select committee investigating fake news has repeatedly asked the Facebook founder to attend one of its hearings, only to be rebuffed each time. In March Facebook sent a mid-ranking executive to answer questions from the digital, culture, media, and sport select committee. The committee said this was not enough and asked for Zuckerberg. In April a senior executive was flown in from California to answer hours of questioning. The committee said this was not enough and asked for Zuckerberg. Eventually, MPs ran out of patience and earlier this month threatened Zuckerberg with a formal summons. The problem is that Facebook called the committee’s bluff, pointed out that the law surrounding formal summons was fundamentally unenforceable, and said Zuckerberg had absolutely no intention of attending such a hearing. Instead, the select committee was reduced to asking Zuckerberg to appear via video link while on his trip to the European parliament, while publishing a list of questions they’d really like MEPs ask. “If Mark Zuckerberg chooses not to address our questions directly, we are asking colleagues at the European Parliament to help us get answers – particularly on who knew what at the company, and when, about the data breach and the non-transparent use of political adverts which continue to undermine our democracy,” said committee chair Damian Collins MP. What can we expect when the closed doors open? Around an hour of European politicians shouting at Mark Zuckerberg for various reasons. Aside from Farage, who has already previewed his angle of attack, expect three major themes to recur: Cambridge Analytica, GDPR, and Facebook’s monopoly. The first is the reason why Zuckerberg is speaking to the parliament today. The chief executive’s apology tour began the week after the news broke, in the pages of the Observer, that the social network had handed the personal data of millions of users over to a researcher who incorporated some of it into a model intended for use by the shadowy electoral consultancy. The second is the more pressing issue for Europe. The privacy mega-regulation, which sees the EU flex its extraterritorial might in an attempt to reshape the internet, has been welcomed by Facebook verbally, even as the company’s actions have left some wondering how seriously the company takes it. And the third is what’s looming over the whole relationship. Facebook hasn’t yet come under public scrutiny from the EU’s competition commission, which has been focused on Google as the key Silicon Valley monopoly. But that could change at the stroke of a pen from Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, who could make life very difficult indeed for Zuckerberg. Here’s the picture of Zuckerberg’s arrival that the EP thought was so important, it set up a whole second livestream to broadcast. Perfectly normal behaviour. It’s started – sort of. Zuckerberg arrived and posed for a handshake picture with EP president Antonio Tajani. Then the pair moved into an adjoining seminar room, where the livestream promptly ended with a door being closed in front of the camera. When this private one-on-one ends, at around 17.15 UK time, the real event will begin. Zuckerberg will be speaking to the European parliament’s “conference of presidents”, the committee made up of the leaders of the eight major political groupings of the parliament. Most recognisable to many readers will be the leader of the nationalist Europe of Freedom and Democracy party, one Nigel Farage MEP. Farage has already promised to use the hearing to attack Zuckerberg over perceived anti-rightwing wing bias on the site, repeating a talking point heard at length in the US congressional hearings: Conservative MEP Syed Kamall will also be present, as the chairman of the rightwing Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists group. Rounding out the British representation in the room will be Labour MEP Claude Moraes, who’ll be there in his role as chair of the civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee. Another familiar face amongst the politicians will be Guy Verhofstadt, the European Union’s representative on all matters Brexit. In this hearing, he’ll be attending in his role as the leader of the of the centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s liveblog of Mark Zuckerberg’s appearance in front of the European parliament. It’s been a fight to get here, with the president of the parliament finally announcing on Monday morning that he had secured an agreement that the previously closed-door session should be live-streamed to the public. If you’d rather watch than follow along here, you’ll find the stream on the parliament’s website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/24/every-star-wars-film-ranked-solo-skywalker","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T12:00:52Z","webTitle":"Every Star Wars film – ranked!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/24/every-star-wars-film-ranked-solo-skywalker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/24/every-star-wars-film-ranked-solo-skywalker","fields":{"headline":"Every Star Wars film – ranked!","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"14. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) What a disaster. Never was so much anticipation and excitement loaded into a single movie, which shortly after its release in 1999 became known as A New Crushing of Hope. This monumentally obtuse and dull prequel episode utterly failed to answer 15 years’ worth of what-happened-next? (or is that what-happened-before?) excitement, and featured the intensely annoying – and borderline offensive – character Jar Jar Binks. 13. Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984) Warwick Davis plays Wicket the Ewok on his home turf, the forest moon of Endor, in this TV movie. He helps two orphaned human siblings, Mace and Cindel, find their abducted parents. Burl Ives narrates. 12. Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985) A classy cast, including Siân Phillips, arguably gives this movie the creative edge over the first Ewok-centred film. Cindel, the orphaned girl from that film, reappears to help the Ewoks against marauders. 11. Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) An animated feature-length one-off that spawned six seasons of a TV series. Set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, this drama recounts the story of Jedi knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and their command of a clone army in the war with the Separatists. Lively appearances from Yoda and Jabba the Hutt. 10. Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005) The third in the prequel trilogy has its defenders, perhaps due to the fact that it brings the threads of a big, baggy story together and creates the origin-myth moment for Darth Vader. The flawed, unhappy Jedi, Anakin Skywalker, is drawn into the ambit of Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious, and a great villain is born. Anakin will often tilt his head down and look up, in an awful parody of coyness. 9. Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) This is the best of the prequel trilogy, due to the appearance of Christopher Lee. He plays the wicked renegade Jedi, Count Dooku, who has a mano-a-mano confrontation with Yoda, which is nothing if not very good value. There are some spectacular battle set pieces that still stand up, especially on the big screen. 8. The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) The invention of YouTube in 2005 gave an official recognition to the existence of the bizarrely misjudged one-off Star Wars variety “special” transmitted once in 1978 and then never again. For years, a sheepish George Lucas pretty much tried to manipulate fans into thinking they had dreamed it. Everyone hated the Holiday Special at the time, for its jarringly wrong humour’n’music approach – especially the bizarre beginning scenes with Chewie’s family. But it is now regarded with affection for its ingenuous enthusiasm, comedy and energy. These were, after all, the same factors that made the first film, released just a year previously, such a success. 7. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) Set just before the events of Episode IV, this shows a group of rebels on a mission to steal the plans for the Death Star, featuring Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso, a known anti-Empire activist sprung from incarceration by the Rebel Alliance. It is notable for using state-of-the-art technology to bring old characters back to life – and digitally refabricate the youthful look of the actors from the original. As well as, Rogue One features some acting heavyweights, such as Mads Mikkelsen, Ben Mendelsohn and Donnie Yen, giving it extra ballast. 6. Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) For pure spectacle, scale and giganticism, The Last Jedi scores heavily and it is a very enjoyable and watchable episode – although disliked by some fans for the way it treated the return of Luke Skywalker, whose cameo at the end of The Force Awakens had been so weirdly moving. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron and John Boyega’s reformed stormtrooper, Finn, are solid male leads and Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose is a scene-stealer. But the movie belongs to Adam Driver’s tremendous, mercurial villain, Kylo Ren. 5. Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) This excellent film, directed by Ron Howard, is shaping up to be one of the most underrated in the entire Star Wars series, an episode crammed with the spirit of the original trilogy. Alden Ehrenreich is excellent as young Han Solo; arrogant, secretly unconfident and idealistic. He faces off with another handsome nogoodnik: the dandyish Lando Calrissian, played with great style by Donald Glover. It is this confrontation that brings us into contact with the Millennium Falcon. It has a great meet-cute between the eponymous hero and Chewie, while Game of Thrones’s Emilia Clarke is fantastic as Qi’ra, who holds Solo under her spell. 4. Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983) The last of the original trilogy, a film with a mighty storytelling blast in which Luke struggles to bring his father back to the light side of the force, and in which Darth Vader’s famous black mask is finally removed, at the end of a climactic and redemptive battle scene, revealing the face of English actor Sebastian Shaw. This is the film in which Luke grasps the truth about his relationship with Princess Leia – and it’s when Leia wears her famous, or notorious, gold bikini. 3. Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) This episode is basically an inspired fanfiction remix of A New Hope, but none the worse for that; it was the film that redelivered the saga to its audience on a tidal wave of joy and love. And when Han and Chewie came back on the screen, I felt something I hadn’t experienced since childhood – not knowing whether to burst into tears or applause. 2. Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977) Here it is: the original and (almost) best – known, of course, then merely as Star Wars – a sci-fi spectacular that moved away from the dystopia and dissonance of movies such as Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey and instead drew on the all but forgotten memories of Saturday morning movie serials, westerns, The Dam Busters and Akira Kurosawa’s 1958 film The Hidden Fortress, whose landscapes the Star Wars saga went on to use, repeatedly, for almost 40 years. Alec Guinness was the Zen figure of Ben Kenobi/Obi-Wan, a young Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford were glorious as the romantic/action leads, and Mark Hamill was the movie’s innocent epicentre as Luke. 1. Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back (1980) This recreated the impact of the first movie, but built on it, revealing that George Lucas had in mind an epic, in fact potentially limitless narrative framework. It’s the movie in which the spirit of Obi-Wan tells Luke to pursue his great destiny by training under the Jedi master Yoda, whose eccentric grammar became one of the saga’s most endearing features. And this film contains the titanic battle between Luke and Darth Vader, climaxing in one of the most shatteringly Freudian moments in pop culture history, the much misquoted line: “No, I am your father.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/24/chvrches-love-is-dead-review-scottish-pop-stars-pull-their-political-punches","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T11:00:51Z","webTitle":"Chvrches: Love Is Dead review – pop rabble-rousers pull their political punches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/24/chvrches-love-is-dead-review-scottish-pop-stars-pull-their-political-punches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/24/chvrches-love-is-dead-review-scottish-pop-stars-pull-their-political-punches","fields":{"headline":"Chvrches: Love Is Dead review – pop rabble-rousers pull their political punches","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As a recent Observer profile noted, Chvrches’ career has a “strange trajectory”. The Scottish trio are a pop band who have achieved fame on both sides of the Atlantic through relentless touring, but who have never had a hit single. No shame in that, but it’s something their third album clearly seeks to rectify. The band themselves have shushed such an idea – “we aren’t really playing that game” – but frankly, you don’t call on producers Greg Kurstin and Steve Mac, the people behind Adele’s Hello and Clean Bandit’s Rockabye respectively, if you’re planning on making a 21st-century cross between the Faust Tapes and Diamanda Galás’s The Litanies of Satan. The sound of its predecessor, 2015’s Every Open Eye, rested on an appealing, time-honoured cocktail of edgy electronics, melodic pop smarts and plaintive, unforced vocals. Love Is Dead does with that sound exactly what you might expect a collaboration with big latter-day pop producers to do. The synths’ prickliness is toned down, the vocals are more strident and Get Out and Forever bear a cinematic, mid-80s sheen. Depending on your perspective, the hooks have either been honed down to streamlined, inescapable earworms, or simplified and repeated to the point where they pitilessly bludgeon the listener into submission. Sometimes this approach really works: the opening Graffiti and the closing Wonderland alike claim squatters’ rights in your brain on first listen. But with the best will in the world, if you release an album on which a song with the hook “deliver-iver-iver” is followed by a song with the hook “forever-forever-forever-and-ever”, which in turn is followed by a song with the hook “never-never-never-ever”, you’re going to run the risk of sounding formulaic. The lyrics, too, seem to court a vast audience. There are moments when they spark and deliver a powerful emotional punch (“I’m writing to ask you: did you achieve all you wanted to do?”, “Your jealousy is more blind than luck”) but equally there are moments where they seem a little woolly. Like Coldplay, they deal in the kind of generalities that anyone can project anything on to. The cliches pile up: “Ask me no questions, I’ll tell you no lies, careful what you wish for.” Their fans are wont to call Chvrches’ music “fearless” and “outspoken”, suggesting it reflects the kind of bold statements their interviews come peppered with. But when the topic turns to politics, the same problems abound. Graves doesn’t quite kick hard enough to rabble-rouse in the way it wants to: it ends up sounding like another addition to the precariously teetering slush-pile of vaguely woke pop. The hope that recent events might lead to the equivalent of that anomalous moment straddling post-punk and the rise of Thatcher, when the charts were alive with incisive, timely political hit singles, seems to have been supplanted by the gloomy realisation that we’ve skipped that phase and ended up with a re-run of what came afterwards. It’s what you might call the You’re About As Easy As a Nuclear War era, when everyone felt impelled to say something about the state of the world whether they had anything interesting or original to say about it or not. The frustrating thing about this is that Chvrches clearly do have a lot to say. Lauren Mayberry in particular has fearlessly taken a stand against the horrific misogynist abuse routinely doled out to female artists online. And it’s easy to attack Donald Trump in earshot of a sympathetic liberal press, but substantially less straightforward to do it on stage at a gig in the heart of Trump-supporting America, as she also did. You just wish some of that potency had made it into the studio. But if those are its drawbacks, it’s worth pointing out that Love Is Dead isn’t a bad album. It’s flawed but flecked with great moments: the thrilling bridge of Never Say Die, when the electronics start to growl and fizz; an oblique little instrumental called ii that sounds charmingly like a homage to the oblique little instrumentals on the Cure’s Seventeen Seconds. A little troublingly for whoever’s footing the bill for Kurstin’s services, a lot of those great moments arrive without his help. My Enemy, a bleak, careworn duet with the National’s Matt Berninger, and the desolate, minimal ballad Really Gone have precisely the kind of impact missing elsewhere, while the great God’s Plan features Martin Doherty’s vocal smeared over a bank of chattering synths. The whole thing might well make Chvrches far bigger than they already are. At risk of doling out a backhanded compliment, even the weakest tracks sound like something you’d hear Radio 1 playing to death, and there’s every chance they might gain some heft in front of a festival crowd. But it isn’t the big artistic step forward its creators might hope.

Prior to joining London’s Serpentine Gallery as director in 2005, he founded Berne’s Museum Robert Walser in 1993, then worked as a curator for the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. In 2009 and 2016 he topped the ArtReview Power 100 list. His book Somewhere Totally Else (JRP/Ringier, £16) is out now in paperback. The Serpentine Galleries COS Park Nights, a series of interdisciplinary events, runs from 13 July to 21 September. 1. Music Kamasi Washington He is a multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer from Los Angeles, and I think he’s one of the great visionary musicians of our time. I saw him perform live in Torino, at a festival, and it was a kind of gateway to a transcendental experience. He brings many things together, very complex emotions. He takes us on this journey: it’s amazing that through music, we can come from knowledge to perspective, and then the final stage we reach is integrity. He has an extraordinary roster of collaborations – Kendrick Lamar, Lauryn Hill, Herbie Hancock – but I think he deserves to be centre stage. 2. Film Happy Birthday, Marsha! (Dir Reina Gossett, Sasha Wortzel, 2018) This is a really extraordinary film about the trans activist Marsha P Johnson. Marsha was extremely involved in the beginnings of the 1969 Stonewall riots, and the film is about her life in the hours before then. It goes in and out of fiction to documentary, in the way it’s edited. In a way it’s a protest against forgetting – it’s an amazing project of remembrance. In a world where there continues to be transphobia, it’s a very important political statement to celebrate this pioneer of the transgender movement. 3. Architecture Lina Bo Bardi There are still not enough female architects that have visibility, so it’s important to celebrate Lina Bo Bardi. One of her masterpieces is the Glass House, which is one of my favourite houses in the world. It floats on stilts in a dense woodland on a hill above São Paulo – it almost seems to be defying gravity. It’s the perfect harmony of light and geometry. I lived there for many weeks and invited artists to do projects there – the house suddenly became alive. Since she died, something was missing, and the idea was to bring the spirit back. 4. Books Edouard Glissant For me Glissant is the most important thinker of the 21st century: I read him every morning for 15 minutes, like a daily toolbox. He was born in Martinique in 1928 and his key concepts include Creolisation – that blend of languages and cultures as a decisive characteristic of Antillean identity – and the idea of the archipelago. Continents tend to reject mixings, while the archipelago embraces them. He once told me: “I can change through exchange with the other, without losing or diluting my sense of self.” I think that’s a very important message for the current moment in the world. 5. Artist Ian Cheng I think Ian Cheng is really a game-changer for where art is going right now. What makes him so fascinating is that he invents artworks that have a different notion of time. When we see videos of films or animations in museums, they’re often on a loop. Ian wanted to make something alive, that keeps living and that changes with time, adapting to the environment. With his simulations and artificial intelligence characters, what you see is never twice the same – these works will always evolve, they will never double or repeat. It’s a new horizon for art. 6. Museum Emma Kunz Zentrum Her cave in Switzerland is a childhood memory which I revisit regularly. She was born in 1892 and was one of the great pioneers of abstract art. She came back heartbroken after a mysterious trip to Philadelphia, and channelled her sorrow into these amazing geometric drawings she made with a pendulum. It’s almost like a higher force, a magnetic force drew her hand. In 1942 she discovered the healing stone Aion: you find this product in Swiss pharmacies as a powder one can drink or apply on the skin. I think this idea of wanting to heal not only people but the planet is very relevant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/22/the-revolutionising-potential-of-medical-ai","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T17:02:21Z","webTitle":"The revolutionising potential of medical AI | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/22/the-revolutionising-potential-of-medical-ai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/22/the-revolutionising-potential-of-medical-ai","fields":{"headline":"The revolutionising potential of medical AI","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The news that Theresa May has urged the NHS and technology companies to adopt artificial intelligence techniques in order to diagnose diseases such as cancer is extremely positive for both the healthcare community and for patients (May to promise millions for AI tools to help fight cancer, 21 May). But to usher in an age of AI, there are several obstacles that must first be overcome. Beyond the prime minister encouraging greater adoption, increased investment into how AI can safely and successfully augment healthcare and research is needed. Far greater collaboration across different disciplines and geographies is also needed to fully realise AI’s potential. It’s important to remember that while AI has great promise, it’s not simply a case of “plug and play”. The use of AI in healthcare will necessitate purpose-built platforms that are not only technologically advanced but scientifically nuanced. Such platforms will require huge volumes of accurate, varied, multidisciplinary data, along with many years of training and algorithm-building by human “masters”. Together, AI and science can be a force for good. If the healthcare, research and technology industries can collaborate to overcome these barriers, then the future looks bright. But all parties involved must look past the hype around AI to put in place practical steps that make its widespread adoption a reality. Dr Jabe Wilson Consulting director, Text and Data Analytics at Elsevier • I welcome the investment into AI helping to save up to 22,000 more lives a year by early diagnosis of cancer. However, the more patients that enter the cancer treatment pathway, the more we will need extra clinicians (endoscopists are already in short supply), all of whom need to be trained. We will also need more scanners, drugs, pharmacists, outpatient clinics and administrative staff, theatres, hospital beds, wards and cleaners. Can Theresa May pledge the hundreds of millions of pounds that will be needed to make this scheme worthwhile and save lives? Debbie Cameron Liverpool • It is disappointing that the chief executive of Cancer Research UK has fallen into the trap of not taking into account lead-time bias when he states that the benefit of earlier diagnosis of cancer is that “fewer people each year would die within five years of their diagnosis”. Five-year survival is measured from time of diagnosis. It is self-evident therefore that the earlier the diagnosis, the better the five-year survival figures, even if there is no gain in lifespan. In the absence of effective treatment, earlier diagnosis will simply result in more patients spending longer with the worry and anxiety of having cancer and all that the diagnosis entails in terms of invasive investigations and therapy, and the adverse effects on the patient and their family. The fight to improve the lot of patients with cancer must continue, but the numerical information on which any improvement is based must be honestly and impartially presented. Peter Trewby President, Association of North of England Physicians • I applaud the prime minister’s pledge to use artificial intelligence to detect chronic diseases earlier and hence reduce premature mortality. Although the news coverage of the announcement focused mainly on cancer, the positive implications should reach people affected by countless other treatable illnesses, where late diagnosis is one of the biggest causes of avoidable deaths. Many rare diseases, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a poorly known disease more often seen in women, reduce life expectancy and seriously impact a patient’s everyday life. Early detection and initiation of effective treatment are key to optimising the chances of improved survival in people with PAH. Life is valued by all patients, regardless of their disease.

Researchers have found that adults under the age of 65 who get five or fewer hours of sleep for seven days a week have a higher risk of death than those who consistently get six or seven hours’ shut-eye. However the effect of short sleeps over a few days may be countered by a later lie-in. The research found that individuals who managed just a few hours’ sleep each day during the week but then had a long snooze at weekends had no raised mortality risk, compared with those who consistently stuck to six or seven hours a night. “Sleep duration is important for longevity,” said Torbjörn Åkerstedt, first author of the study, at the Stress Research Institute, Stockholm University, and Karolinska Institute, also in the Swedish capital. The study, published in the Journal of Sleep Research, is based on data from more than 38,000 adults, collected during a lifestyle and medical survey conducted throughout Sweden in 1997. The fate of participants was followed for up to 13 years, using a national death register. Åkerstedt said researchers had previously looked at links between sleep duration and mortality but had focused on sleep during the working week. “I suspected there might be some modification if you included also weekend sleep, or day-off sleep.” Once factors such as gender, body mass index, smoking, physical activity and shift work, were taken into account, the results revealed that those under the age of 65 who got five hours of sleep or under that amount seven days a week had a 65% higher mortality rate than those getting six or seven hours’ sleep every day. But there was no increased risk of death for those who slept five or fewer hours during the week but then managed eight or more hours’ sleep on weekend days. “The assumption in this is that weekend sleep is a catch-up sleep,” said Åkerstedt, though he noted the study did not prove that to be the case. However, people who slept for eight or more hours, seven days a week, were found to have a 25% higher mortality rate compared with those who kept to six or seven hours a day. The study also found that the link between sleep patterns and mortality disappeared for those aged 65 or older. That, Åkerstedt said, was perhaps because older individuals got the sleep they needed. Average sleep duration at weekends and the percentage of those saying they did not feel rested at waking, did fall with age. Across the week, older people had more consistent and more often sleep over a shorter time span. While the study did not investigate the link between sleep patterns and mortality rates, Åkerstedt said it was possible little sleep had a negative effect on the body, while consistently lengthy sleep could be a sign of underlying health problems. The study had limitations; participants were only asked about their sleep patterns at one point in time. But Stuart Peirson, an expert on the human “body clock” but who was not involved in the research, said the study offered a more nuanced view than previous research, which had suggested that both very little or a lot of sleep was bad for health and longevity. “It fits with what we do know about sleep – that sleep is regulated by the body clock but also regulated by what is called a homeostatic process, which means the longer you are awake the more you need to sleep.” Peirson, based at the University of Oxford, noted that sleep requirements varied from person to person according to genetics, but he added that “sleep debt” needed to be “paid off”. He said: “You can’t keep burning the candle at both ends. Well, you can, but you won’t live as long.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/may/25/dutch-speed-camera-stop-drivers-limit-helmond","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T06:30:39Z","webTitle":"Cash converters: could this Dutch scheme stop drivers speeding?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/25/dutch-speed-camera-stop-drivers-limit-helmond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/may/25/dutch-speed-camera-stop-drivers-limit-helmond","fields":{"headline":"Cash converters: could this Dutch scheme stop drivers speeding?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Dutch city is hoping to target speeding motorists by rewarding those who keep to the limit with cash for their community – car by car, and cent by cent. A “speed-meter money box” was installed earlier this month on a stretch of road notorious for speeding in Helmond, a city in North Brabant province in the Netherlands. Each vehicle that was observing Dijksestraat’s 30km/h (19mph) speed limit as it passed added €0.10 (£0.09) to the monetary figure displayed, to a maximum of half a euro per vehicle each day. Catelijne Thomassen, spokeswoman for North Brabant province, said the speedometer achieved its set fundraising target of €500 to upgrade a local playing field well before the end of its three-week trial. The speedometer is entirely mobile and the speed limit, amount collected per vehicle, and savings goal can be customised. It will be displayed throughout North Brabant throughout 2018 and 2019, with individual cities left to decide the fundraising target and the community project to benefit from it. Thomassen said the speedometer – which was devised and owned by the province’s traffic safety team – aimed to remind motorists to watch their speed and, in doing so, benefit their community. “The strength of the mobile version is that it’s only there for a few weeks, so people don’t get used to it. Every time they pass by, we hope that they are aware of the risk they take by speeding. “Most of these people are local drivers, they know they are contributing to the district, in this case the playing field. It feels really local.” Sander Hermsen, a researcher of behaviour change and design at the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, told Guardian Cities that the idea had potential to snap drivers out of bad habits. “Most people don’t consciously speed, they don’t want to endanger other people – it’s just the road sort of invites you to go fast. Others do it too, so you go with the flow and before you know it you’re going 45km/h. “What you need is some kind of trigger that breaks you out of your routine.” According to the Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, North Brabant has one of the highest rates of motor vehicle fatalities in the Netherlands, with 150 deaths in the five years to 2016. This year the province’s focus is on tackling speeding to bring down the toll with its “nul verkeersdoden Brabant” (zero fatalities Brabant) campaign. In Helmond, a city of about 90,000 people, Dijksestraat is a known speeding hotspot. Two speedometers on display there last year found 64% of passing cars to be over the speed limit. Cities around the world have struggled to get drivers to slow down, with lower limits suggested to be less effective than “traffic-calming features” integrated into the environment. “The fun thing about these traffic interventions is they don’t even need to work for everybody, they just have to work for a couple of people, and then the flow is going slower,” said Hermsen. Other initiatives have offered incentives to attempt to manage drivers’ speeds, including Sweden’s “speed camera lottery”, where law-abiding drivers were automatically entered for a chance to win cash prizes. In the trial, which concluded in Stockholm in November 2010, the average speed of 32km/h before the test dropped to 25km/h during the test – a 22% reduction. North Brabant’s speedometer will next appear in Eerde, a small town near Eindhoven. “We are fully booked for the next two years,” said Thomassen. Though Hermsen said a test of only weeks would be unlikely to affect drivers’ behaviour longer-term, Thomassen said that was not the speedometer’s intention. “It’s really to remind people to be aware of your own role in safety in traffic. In the long run we hope that people may change their behaviour, but it’s more like a reminder for now.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/22/tesco-shuts-its-online-non-food-website-tesco-direct","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T14:30:12Z","webTitle":"Tesco shuts its non-food website, Tesco Direct","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/22/tesco-shuts-its-online-non-food-website-tesco-direct","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/22/tesco-shuts-its-online-non-food-website-tesco-direct","fields":{"headline":"Tesco shuts its non-food website, Tesco Direct","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tesco is shutting down its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk.

As a result the retailer said approximately 500 staff were at risk of redundancy. “This decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,” said Charles Wilson who recently took over as boss of Tesco’s UK chain. “We want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that’s why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.” Tesco has been running two separate internet businesses in tandem: Tesco.com for for grocery home deliveries and the Direct catalogue-style website for household goods and clothing, including its own F&amp;F brand. Tesco said the website, which will cease trading on 9 July, had struggled with the high cost of fulfilling orders and online marketing. Tesco said the plan would mean the closure of the distribution centre at Fenny Lock, Milton Keynes, which handles Tesco Direct orders. Tesco Direct was one of the many pushes launched during the expansionist reign of Sir Terry Leahy in which the retailer became a jack of all trades, with side projects that included building flats, running a bank as well as selling groceries, clothing and household goods online. Current boss Dave Lewis, who took charge in the wake of the 2014 accounting scandal, has led a radical restructuring of the UK’s biggest retailer. He sold a number of businesses, including its South Korean chain Homeplus for £4bn, and pushed through a programme of large-scale domestic job losses. Last year Lewis did his first major deal with the purchase of the Booker cash and carry chain, led by Wilson, for £3.7bn. The complexity of bashing together the two businesses, which have combined turnover of nearly £60bn, means the loss-making Direct business was a headache neither executive needed. “I think this shows a renewed focus on the machine that is Tesco,” said Steve Dresser, retail analyst at Grocery Insight. “The days of going after markets with no realistic proposition of them adding value are long gone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/31/a-shadow-of-myself-the-home-office-lost-records-and-ruined-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T12:00:19Z","webTitle":"Woman left in limbo for a decade because Home Office lost her passport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/31/a-shadow-of-myself-the-home-office-lost-records-and-ruined-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/31/a-shadow-of-myself-the-home-office-lost-records-and-ruined-lives","fields":{"headline":"Woman left in limbo for a decade because Home Office lost her passport","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Imagine trying to get a replacement passport after your old one goes missing, only to be told that no record of you exists. Your home country says it cannot trace you; you are effectively stateless, with nowhere to call home. This is what Kate has endured for the past decade. Her nightmare began when she had to reapply for her passport because it was lost by the Home Office. When the 36-year-old, from a former Soviet state that she prefers not to specify, tried to renew her UK student visa in 2008, she sent off the passport and it never came back. The Home Office initially said it should be returned to her in three months, but years passed and she heard nothing. It took four years for the Home Office to explain that it had delivered her passport to the wrong address. “I was not told anything at first. It was only after an MP wrote to them for me that the Home Office explained what had happened, but I could have traced my passport if I’d known earlier,” Kate says. “When I realised it had gone to the wrong address, I assumed that, if not signed for, it would be returned to the Home Office, but a search by the department failed to uncover anything.” In 2012, Kate decided to enrol on a university course, but she was forced to drop out after two months because she lacked the right documentation. Life became much harder after 2012, she says, because of the hostile environment policy that involved a crackdown on illegal immigrants. Kate could not work in Britain legally and had no right to rent. The Home Office urged her to try to get a replacement passport, but when she attempted to do so, the embassy of her home country, which is plagued by war, said there was no data about her. “The consul at the embassy in my home country said there was a name but no picture, and without that they did not know who I was,” she says. “The photo may have been deliberately deleted, and even if that wasn’t what happened, it’s not my fault there’s no picture. “I was told I need to take it to the high court in my home country, but how could I do that when I wasn’t allowed to leave the UK without a passport?” She has survived over the past decade by being paid cash as a babysitter. “I have been staying with friends because the man I was renting from tried to evict me, and I cannot move as I have had no right to rent anywhere else,” she says. Despite multiple attempts to resolve her situation, including the Home Office writing to the embassy of her home country to explain that it lost the passport, nothing seemed to work. Kate has missed family funerals as a result. “My uncle was like a brother to me. He died in 2015 but I could not return home for the funeral,” she says. “My best friend died last year. It has been a nightmare. “It left me powerless for a decade, with no control of my life.” Kate says her family had had high hopes for her. “I came to Britain at 22. I was so excited to learn English. I wanted to do that and then return home to work for my uncle.” At that point she felt confident she would succeed. “I felt like I could move mountains.” Kate is now taking antidepressants and has had health issues brought on by stress. “I am a shadow of the person I was when I arrived here. I used to be bubbly and always smiling. I used to be really very confident, and people had hopes about me and what I could achieve, but now I am nothing. I feel like a failure.” Two days after the Guardian contacted the Home Office, the department admitted Kate had wrongly been treated as an illegal immigrant for a decade and had always had leave to remain. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We will work with [Kate] and her lawyers to support her in obtaining a new passport and in making an application for further leave to remain.” Johanna Bezzano of the University of Liverpool law clinic, who has been helping Kate, says: “I hope that now the case has been prioritised there will be someone to deal with and make things move.“This acknowledgement is welcome, though long overdue. Kate still needs a document showing her legal entitlement to live in the UK. I hope to hear from the Home Office about this over the coming days so that Kate can start to recover from her 10-year ordeal.” The news is a huge relief to Kate, but she still feels angry. “I have been tortured for 10 years,” she says. “I am now 36 and have no career and nothing, no life. I just hope I can start something now, although it may take time to resolve it all. I was at the bottom of a well and struggling day and night. I didn’t see a solution for so long. “I came to Britain because I thought it was an open and liberal country. It would be such a shame to kill that idea ... My message to the government: don’t treat people like numbers. My life was completely destroyed.” Ed: ‘The emotional strain was enormous’ Ed Linse was shocked when he received a letter from the Home Office saying it had lost all documents related to his wife’s case. The admission came days after the two-year appeal for her UK spouse visa was successfully upheld. “It was farcical,” says the 47-year-old. “The first thing they said in the letter was that they would be contesting the appeal and then they basically admitted they had lost documents linked to my wife’s case.” The Guardian has seen the letter from the Home Office, dated 3 May, which includes a paragraph that reads: “The respondent is regretfully experiencing difficulties in locating the Home Office file containing the respondent’s bundle and appellant’s appeal bundle before the first tier tribunal.” Ed, a British citizen, was appealing against a decision to refuse a settlement visa for his wife, Papaipit, who is from Thailand. During the two-year process, the Home Office lost the records of the initial appeal. “[The lost documents] didn’t stall things because they only conceded that in the last moment. The entire process was opaque ... they potentially lost the documents at the beginning,” Ed says. “It was a remarkable concession that told us they were ‘unable to locate’ pretty much all of the documents relating to every stage of our two-year-long appeal battle, which begs the question: how can they have continued to contest it for so long?” When the Home Office refused the spousal visa, the family had to remain in Thailand for about 14 months in order to stay together. Papaipit was pregnant with their second child, who was born in Thailand despite all the antenatal arrangements having been made at Macclesfield general hospital. The family finally returned to the UK on a visitor visa, to allow the children to see their grandparents. Eventually, after their savings ran out and the Home Office had miscalculated their funds, Papaipit had no choice but to overstay her visitor visa while they waited for the result of the appeal. The appeal was eventually upheld, although Papaipit is still waiting for the Home Office to issue her visa. The process has taken a toll on the family. “The main effect has been the enormous emotional strain,” Ed says. “We lived in a hotel and then rented accommodation. When we moved back to the UK we lived with my parents.” There have been significant financial implications. But more than anything, Ed says, “nothing can compensate for two years of our children’s childhoods”. The Home Office said Papaipit was not refused a visa to settle in the UK because of missing documentation, adding that she has since been granted a visa to visit the UK. Franklin: ‘I lost everything’ When eight enforcement officers burst into Franklin’s flat at about 7am and took him to a detention centre, he was terrified and confused. “They were going through all the flats looking for me. At first I thought it was a mistake, but then they took me away and said I would be deported in two days,” he says. The 36-year-old from London was only detained for a day, but after that his life became much harder: he could not work or claim benefits, despite not having any problems before. He had to report to an immigration centre every two weeks. Franklin came to the UK from Nigeria with his mother in 1989. He has never had a British passport, but was given a stamped letter from the Home Office saying he had indefinite leave to remain; he has a photocopy of it. He has held several jobs in Britain, including working for Transport for London and selling photos for O2. He has always paid his taxes and his entire family are naturalised. But when the enforcement officers came to take him away, they did a radio check and were told there was no evidence of this. They could not find any record of Franklin. He was released from detention but told he would have to go to Becket House, an immigration reporting centre, every two weeks. His benefits were stopped and he received no income for eight months. Last month, however, Franklin was told that records of him had been found and he had indefinite leave to remain. “They sent me a letter,” he says, “but there was no apology or anything. It took nearly a year for them to find the information about me they needed. “Being in the detention centre was scary. They were saying that my deportation date had already been decided and it was two days from then. They wanted to send me back to Nigeria, a country I have not set foot in since I left as a child.” The impact of the delay continues, with Franklin now in rental arrears and facing possible court proceedings. Worse still, he says, is the lack of an apology. “This should never have happened and I lost everything,” he says. “It’s taken its toll – it’s something I have had to deal with.” Franklin does not understand what happened to his records during that period, and why he was unsearchable. The Home Office told the Guardian it had not lost his documentation. When asked to clarify why it could not locate evidence of Franklin’s right to stay in the UK for eight months, the department did not respond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/07/mcqueen-directors-fashion-creates-icons-then-isolates-them","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T09:26:58Z","webTitle":"McQueen directors: 'Fashion creates icons, then isolates them'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/07/mcqueen-directors-fashion-creates-icons-then-isolates-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/07/mcqueen-directors-fashion-creates-icons-then-isolates-them","fields":{"headline":"McQueen directors: 'Fashion creates icons, then isolates them'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Before there was Sarah Burton’s Alexander McQueen, the chic, highly finessed and now financially successful fashion label, there was the Alexander McQueen of its namesake that – as this touching new documentary tells it – could barely sustain the creative dysfunction its creator and his companions wrought upon it. The man at its core, we know, killed himself aged just 40. What story is left to tell? McQueen left behind five distinct silhouettes, or reimaginings for the shape of clothing on a woman’s body: more than Givenchy, Dior, Chanel, Saint Laurent or any other designer, according to the film’s co-directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui. The pair spent a year refashioning existing film of McQueen and his protector-antagonist Isabella Blow, and threading it through with new interviews with McQueen’s family and surviving, if somewhat shell-shocked, collaborators. The result, in the opinion of Vogue international editor Suzy Menkes is “the most sensitive vision about a creative who never lost his rough edges, and who put his life – the bloody history of distant warriors in Scotland and childhood abuse within his family – on stage.” On this journey, we learn that fashion is probably best admired as a playground for creative people to exercise restless and highly stimulated imaginations. McQueen thrilled and terrified his models and clients: a perspiring, huffing beast coming at them with giant tailors’ scissors, wildly cutting at fabric as they stood in the designs. That such people should also swing between intense highs and lows – often to the bewilderment of those around them – should come as no surprise. “Lee [Alexander McQueen] and Lee’s quality of work needs a big canvas,” says Bonhôte. “This we hope is the first to emotionally inform people into Lee’s journey and his life.” Ettedgui says there were two questions to answer: how did he become the golden boy of the fashion industry; and why, when he was at the top of his game, did he decide life was not worth living? “We were deeply moved by that story,” he says. “The emotions that he created in us – the exhilaration of the early part of the story, or the tragedy toward the end – are what we wanted to put up on the screen.” It is not clear even that McQueen and Blow, who preceded him in death by mere months, should be mourned in the traditional sense; both are more successful and better understood from beyond the grave than they were ever this side of it. That is not to say they aren’t missed, intensely in some instances. In some ways, it may be a better way to enjoy the joyful, deluded follies of their adventures. In New York City, when McQueen came to show off his bumster collection – one of his first to gain widespread attention – a model was directed to lurch, mad-cow like, down the aisle in a Lower East Side synagogue. The designer also directed the PRs to slow Vogue’s Anna Wintour and her then sidekick André Leon Talley’s entry to the show. Blow admonished her rebellious protege: “You’ve got to make an effort with her.” Nonetheless, Wintour would later become a champion for McQueen. “As he said it himself, he loved having the opportunity to prick the bubble of the fashion world,” says Ettedgui. Nor is it hard to see why Blow so adored him, and why she was so devastated when he cast her off on signing with a more professional house, Givenchy, then under the direction of Tom Ford. It had, after all, been Blow’s wheeze to get Ford to buy McQueen for the Gucci Group. The deal financed McQueen but by then Blow was judged to be unsuitable and, aggrieved, reinvented herself elsewhere. As it turned out, in some ways, McQueen wasn’t so suited to the fashion life. Or perhaps he was too well-suited. Either way, the documentary speeds up here, as it should, and speeds lightly over his drug problem, his decadence, his efforts to change himself and his appearance, his rages and problematic relationships. He drove himself to work harder. “The fashion industry’s need to reinvent is relentless,” says Bonhôte. “It creates icons, and then isolates them.” McQueen, says Ettedgui, explained it himself. Asked by former Vogue contributing editor and novelist Plum Sykes why he conformed to the fashion system and its frenetic pace when he could, in his position, set his own agenda, the designer said simply “because I’m so fucking insecure”. “The person who put the most pressure on McQueen was McQueen,” says Ettedgui. “We certainly picked up on a lot of finger-pointing but the answer is not as passive as ‘Lee was a victim of the fashion industry.’ It’s much more nuanced than that.” Ultimately, his legacy must be the clothes. When you look at the impact of the V&amp;A and Met’s Savage Beauty exhibitions, which were record-breaking on both sides of the Atlantic, people really started to analyse him technically, Bonhôte says. “The five silhouettes he left behind are potentially more than Saint Laurent or Coco Chanel, and that puts him right at the top.” McQueen is in UK cinemas on 8 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/25/severn-and-wye-smokery-grace-dent-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T12:00:46Z","webTitle":"Severn and Wye Smokery – restaurant review | Grace Dent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/25/severn-and-wye-smokery-grace-dent-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/25/severn-and-wye-smokery-grace-dent-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"Severn and Wye Smokery, Gloucestershire: ‘Huge potential going to waste’ – restaurant review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Life is a journey, not a destination” may be the type of motivational spaff that imbeciles have on fridge magnets, yet within it there lies some truth. Several times recently, as I’ve traversed Britain sprinkling happiness, the journey to the restaurant has been much more fun than dinner. The Severn &amp; Wye Smokery in Gloucestershire sits between two of these islands’ most celebrated, salmon-abundant rivers, and details of the fishery here can be found in the Domesday book. As I sat in the upstairs restaurant, picking at fried salmon skin and smoked sprats while surrounded by men in red trousers and blazers dining with their genteel elderly aunts, I thought to myself: “This is a pleasant place to motor towards from Hereford or Chipping Norton. If you, well, need something to do.” I’m not sure this was anyone’s mission statement when the smokery’s ambitious recent renovation began. Upstairs is a vast, semi-formal seafood restaurant and downstairs a cafe. There’s a large farmshop, too, complete with an impressive, glass-fronted fish shop. The smokery supplies Harrods, Fortnum &amp; Mason and the Royal Chelsea Flower Show; it exports to Bahrain, Singapore and the Sudan. They chip their own oakwood for smoking. They release their own elvers back to wetlands, to nurture eel stocks. On paper, then, everything about the place screams all-new Petersham Nurseries meets a charming Countryfile segment on British freshwater fishing meets the type of place Lynda Snell off the Archers takes you for a scone in a bid to bribe you into playing Suzuki in a culturally insensitive Ambridge take on Madame Butterfly. We start with forgettable “King’s cured smoked salmon” that comes tossed on to a plate with a handful of capers, and lukewarm salmon skin crackling that’s spongy and tastes of oil. Instantly, I feel somewhat worried. But the intensely smoked sprats are fantastic. Our request to try some of their famous eel in a dish that isn’t a creamy stew containing pork is met with a puzzled: “No, the pork is all mixed in.” This is a venue with huge potential that’s going completely to waste. If this multimillion-pound project were in London, you’d be met at the door by half a dozen keen things with hospitality management diplomas. You’d be rattled through the basic tenets of historical smoking methods, then offered a menu featuring six different ways with eel and elver. It would be a single sheet, but it would trumpet the fact that they have crevettes, sea bass, gilt-head bream, south coast squid, yellowfin tuna and a dozen other fresh fish on site, alongside proper fishmongers and enthusiastic chefs. The eel turns up masked by lardons, field mushrooms, cream and croutons that taste like butter-embossed Hobnobs. Oh, and a runny poached egg. You could hide a chopped-up flip-flop in this concoction and not notice it. The rock oysters are exquisitely sourced, which shows. We ask for them without accompaniments, but are ignored. A generous main of kedgeree comes brimming with smoked haddock, but still gives me no compulsion to eat much of it, not least because there is no sane place for chickpeas in a kedgeree, or wet spinach leaves, for that matter, or too much tomato, if, indeed, any at all. This is experimental jazz fusion kedgeree. We order turbot, too, because we’re from London and turbot is incredibly hip, so we just like saying the word. Thankfully, it’s exemplary: roasted on the bone, crisp-skinned, moist and alluring. The best things at Severn &amp; Wye are those they’ve had little to do with. A side of samphire comes thick with butter and salt, and sits forlornly alongside a ramekin of dauphinoise potato that should have been removed from the oven at around the same time as those Domesday inspectors came to town. Pudding is one of those deconstructed foams, sponges and smears, riffing around the theme of rhubarb, that I like making MasterChef contestants cry about. As is the case with this type of gubbins, the sum of its parts doesn’t add up to one decent pudding, plus it comes out of the kitchen within minutes of ordering. There is so much potentially to adore about this venture, but right now it feels like a gargantuan, directionless space that will please passers-by and locals, but won’t lure the foodie hordes from Bristol, Cardiff and London. They’ve spent a ton of money, yes, but right now it’s a fish out of water. • Severn &amp; Wye Smokery Chaxhill, Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire, 01452 760191.

Arriving at our friends’ house, we found that it, too, was a single room deep and extremely long. “Did this style of house have a name?” I asked over a cup of tea and the best slice of jam-and-buttercream-filled Victoria sponge I’ve eaten since my granny passed away (recipe requested: it is from Annie Rigg). “Welsh long houses” was the satisfying reply, at which a book by Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peate was put on the table. House plans are the next best thing to having a nose-around and, even in a teatime chat about Welsh architecture, it is hard not to slip into potential buyer mode looking at them – assessing size, light and the best bedroom. Peate’s book – decades of work documenting this important part of Welsh history – is full of plans illustrating these houses, often with a stall for animals at one end (possibly a dairy) and the human living quarters at the other. As in life, my eyes end up on the kitchen, at the heart of which is always a large fireplace or hearth. In Welsh, the word for hearth is aelywyd, in Latin focus, which comes from the Italian fuoco (fire), the same root as the English word “focus”. Before ovens, bread was cooked on the hearth, the dough laid on the stone, maybe covered with hot ashes, and baked. In Italy, hearth bread was called panis foculis, which is the origin of the word “focaccia”, a yeasted dough cooked quickly. Over time, focaccia has taken on different forms and, depending on where you are in Italy, it now means different things. In Liguria, it is about 2cm high with childlike dimples, glistening with olive oil and crystals of salt. Focaccia Pugliese is much deeper, often with tomatoes pressed into the cushion-like dough, which then bake into it like deeply set red buttons. Hearth breads are also the ancestors of pizza; the difference – usually – is that pizza has less yeast, which makes it flatter. But this is not the case in Rome: the pizza bianca of my local bakery is plumper than the flaky, cracker-like focaccia of a nearby pizzeria. Not that I am fussing about size or semantics – I am happy when either is brought to me hot from the oven, glistening with olive oil and strewn with salt that clings to lips and fingers. For me, focaccia is inextricably linked to my teacher Carla Tomasi, because when she gives a lesson or makes you lunch, there is inevitably one baking in the oven when you arrive – a warm, yeasty welcome that seems to sum her up. Her recipe makes a focaccia that is just the right point between tender and chewy. It calls for 200g ‘00’ flour, 200g strong bread flour, a teaspoon of fast-action dry yeast, a teaspoon of fine salt, a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and 300ml of tepid water mixed into a soft, slightly sticky and shaggy ball in a bowl, which is covered and left to rest for at least 15 minutes. You then turn the dough on to an oiled worktop and knead it gently for a few minutes before returning to the oiled bowl for an hour. By now, the dough should be as soft and pliable as warm putty, and ready to be pressed into a large bread tin – or two smaller ones. Then it is left to rest for another hour, before being given deep dimples with oily fingers and baked at 190C/375F/gas 5 for 25 minutes, or until puffed up and the colour of a polished cymbal. To finish, brush with more olive oil and sprinkle with salt and chopped rosemary, then serve while still warm. True, this all demands time, but not from the cook, as most of it is resting, which – because we know – is when good things happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/may/25/maxed-out-nhs-pharmacists-doctor-ordered","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T08:55:42Z","webTitle":"In the maxed-out NHS, pharmacists are just what the doctor ordered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/25/maxed-out-nhs-pharmacists-doctor-ordered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/25/maxed-out-nhs-pharmacists-doctor-ordered","fields":{"headline":"In the maxed-out NHS, pharmacists are just what the doctor ordered","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’re all familiar with the routine of collecting a prescription from our GP, taking it to the local chemist and then waiting patiently while the pharmacist makes up our medication. But these days, says Thorrun Govind, a pharmacist for Sykes Chemist in Bolton, that’s the exception rather than the rule – pharmacists now receive the majority of prescriptions electronically from the GP surgery. In the 70 years since the NHS was founded, the role of pharmacists has been transformed. Simon Nelson remembers taking over a pharmacy in Tredegar, south Wales, in 1984: “When we first came here, doctors were still handwriting their prescriptions and we were still handwriting the labels that we stuck on the bottles.” Today, the pharmacy Nelson now owns in Caerphilly has a dispensing machine, which picks the medicines and then delivers them to the pharmacist. It’s faster, says Nelson, and results in fewer errors. Pharmacists have a broader set of responsibilities than ever before, and as the NHS starts to creak under the strain of a GP shortage, it is increasingly pharmacists who shoulder some of the burden. They can check medications for people who have recently come out of hospital, talk to patients to make sure they’re taking their medicines correctly and answer any queries the patient has about the medication. When people suffer from minor ailments, such as eye infections or thrush, says Nelson, but are entitled to free prescription, the pharmacist can provide the medication without the patient needing to see a doctor. “That takes the pressure off the GP and allows the GP to see people who have more serious illnesses,” he says. His own pharmacy offers a range of other services, including a smoking cessation clinic, palliative care (which can involve being called out in the middle of the night to dispense drugs for terminally ill patients) and a needle exchange. Many pharmacists now have consulting rooms where they can provide blood pressure checks and offer advice to patients suffering minor injuries or ailments. They have the skills to spot whether a patient needs referring to counselling or other service. This all helps to reduce a GP’s workload, but it’s also good for patients, says Govind: “The average time to see a pharmacist if you just walk in is about eight minutes. For people who want to see their GP, it can be a considerable length of time in comparison.” Because of their pharmacological expertise, pharmacists understand the interactions between different drugs, which can be particularly useful in an age when many patients have multiple long-term conditions. “Some people might want to try an over-the-counter remedy, so if they went to a petrol station and picked something up, they might not know how that drug interacted, but if they come to a pharmacy, there’s that wealth of advice available,” she says. And not all pharmacists work behind the counter. Govind points out that some pharmacists work in GP surgeries, while others work in the pharmaceutical industry or in academia. In many hospitals, she adds, they are an essential part of a multidisciplinary team, making sure patients receive the appropriate medication for their needs. Govind thinks that over the next few years, the professional responsibilities of pharmacists will continue to increase so that anyone who is managing a long-term condition will be having regular check-ups with their pharmacist rather than their GP. Despite their growing portfolio of skills and services, however, she believes that many people still don’t realise just how much pharmacists can offer. “We’re not a profession who shouts about what we do, but I think we’re getting better at that.” Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.

The search-suggestion feature, and a similar feature that offers “related searches” at the bottom of the results page, could be helping to compromise the right to anonymity of complainants in UK rape and sexual assault cases. Type in the defendant’s name with a little extra information and the search engine may suggest related searches that include the victim’s name. It’s not the first time that Google, or one of its competitors in big tech, has been caught out after handing control to AI-driven, crowdsourced suggestions. • In 2016, Google was slammed for its search suggestion and related searches proposing hateful material. “Are Muslims …” offered up: “Are Muslims bad”. One search for that, and the next suggested search proposed simply: “Islam must be destroyed”. • In February this year, the company faced similar criticism: “Hitler is ...” led to “my hero”; even hyper-sanitised results, such as “Blacks are ...” – which has been manually scrubbed of almost any automatic suggestions – still offered “not oppressed” as an option. • Elsewhere in Google’s empire, YouTube’s search suggestions (the same technology, but operating on very different content) has had its own problems. For a brief period in November, “How to have ...” offered “s*x [sic] with your kids” as one option. These suggestions seem to be the modern equivalent of Googlebombs, joke search phrases created by thousands of people linking to a site with misleading text (for a long time, for instance, searching for “miserable failure” on Google led to the official biography of George W Bush). Enough people searching for one term can trick the algorithm into thinking it’s a real thing. • When the learning systems go wrong, they can sometimes go really wrong. Apple’s autocorrect changes every standalone lowercase “i” to an uppercase one – but for a while in 2017, the company instead “corrected” the letter to “A[?]”. Worse, if you accidentally texted the new strange autocorrect to someone else, their phone caught the bug, resulting in a short period where social media was essentially unreadable to large proportions of the iPhone-using world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/she-prayed-she-would-be-martyred-gaza-parents-mourn-their-dead","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T17:13:05Z","webTitle":"'She prayed she would be martyred': Gaza parents mourn their dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/she-prayed-she-would-be-martyred-gaza-parents-mourn-their-dead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/she-prayed-she-would-be-martyred-gaza-parents-mourn-their-dead","fields":{"headline":"'She prayed she would be martyred': Gaza parents mourn their dead","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At 14 years old, Wesal Sheikh Khalil had already made plans for her funeral. If Israeli troops were to shoot her during protests on the Gaza border, the Palestinian teenager had told her mother, she should be buried at the spot where she died or in the plot next to her grandfather’s grave. “She thought death was better than this life,” said Reem Abu Irmana a day after she lost her youngest daughter. “Every time she went to the demonstrations she prayed to God that she would be martyred.” Wesal was one of more than 60 people killed in Gaza on Monday as Israeli snipers fired on gatherings of tens of thousands along a perimeter fence surrounding the blockaded enclave. According to Gaza’s ministry of health, the dead included an eight-month-old baby who reportedly died after inhaling teargas. A double amputee who was photographed throwing stones from a wheelchair was also killed. Several of the dead were members of Hamas, the group that runs Gaza and has fought three wars with Israel. At least 1,300 people were wounded by live fire, Gaza’s health ministry said. Funerals on Tuesday coincided with the anniversary of the Nakba, or catastrophe, commemorating the more than 700,000 people who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. For six weeks, demonstrators have rallied in the “great march of return”, a movement symbolising their desire to return to their ancestral homes. Monday’s protest, the bloodiest to date, was focused on fury over the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on the same day. Wesal, who turned 14 in December, had been inspired by the marches and started to think intensely about “martyrdom”, her mother said. For a decade, Israel and Egypt have imposed tight restrictions of the movement of goods and people into Gaza, and Abu Irmana said life had become unbearable for her seven children, with the family having to move every three or four months as they could not afford the rent. “May God help the people who are living here,” she said, speaking surrounded by friends and family all crammed into a tiny room under a corrugated iron roof. The family say they are from a small village they have never visited in what is now Israel. Three generations have lived in Gaza’s cramped al-Bureij refugee camp, in a section of the neighbourhood that residents call Block D. Wesal never left Gaza, Abu Irmana said, recalling a girl she described as “full of joy”. Wesal had written a song for her mother’s upcoming birthday, which she had memorised and sung around the house in her last days. Her 21-year-old brother had warned her not to go to the protests, threatening – as a joke – that he would break her legs if she tried. But she was steadfast, her mother said. “She said: ‘If I had one leg I would go. If both were broken, I would crawl.’” Wesal’s 11-year-old brother Mohammed was with her when she was killed. He said she had been given wire cutters by other protesters and was shot in the head near the fence. Israel’s military said on Monday that Hamas planned to “carry out a massacre in Israel”. However, no one pushed through, and since the weekly protests began on 30 March no Israeli has been harmed, except for one soldier lightly wounded in an unspecified incident. Mohammed wanted to return to Tuesday’s protests, which were much smaller, but his mother forbade it. “My life is the same,” Abu Irmana said when asked about her plans for the future. “The only change is I don’t have a daughter.” In Gaza City on Tuesday, shops selling snacks and fresh watermelons stayed open and children played football. Streets of the enclave were quieter than usual. “It feels like wartime again,” said one resident. A road was blocked off by a blue tarpaulin tent. Dozens of men, old and young, sat on plastic chairs to mourn the death of Yazen al-Toubasi, another casualty from Monday. The 23-year-old cleaner had a son under the age of two. Toubasi’s father, Ibrahim, sat among neighbours. “All the world is squeezing this small place called Gaza,” he said in a soft, fractured voice. He too had been protesting. He said it was a “national duty” for all Palestinians to continue. Toubasi had not approached the fence but had stayed in one of the tents set up several hundred metres back for a sit-in. “Even if he tried to throw a stone, it wouldn’t reach them,” his father said. Green flags belonging to Hamas had been positioned in the road, and a poster with Toubasi’s name embossed on it also showed photos of the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam. Hamas has paid for funeral services and donated money to the families of the dead and wounded, a move Israel condemns. Toubasi’s father said his son was not affiliated to one political group but supported “all the factions”. As he spoke, people walked up and hugged him, often whispering condolences into his ears. “Thank you,” he replied politely to each one. “The Palestinian cause was abandoned and it is back to the forefront,” he said, promising to return to the frontier with Israel for further demonstrations. “I will be in Yazen’s place tomorrow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/16/facebook-lets-advertisers-target-users-based-on-sensitive-interests","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T04:00:38Z","webTitle":"Facebook lets advertisers target users based on sensitive interests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/16/facebook-lets-advertisers-target-users-based-on-sensitive-interests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/16/facebook-lets-advertisers-target-users-based-on-sensitive-interests","fields":{"headline":"Facebook lets advertisers target users based on sensitive interests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook allows advertisers to target users it thinks are interested in subjects such as homosexuality, Islam or liberalism, despite religion, sexuality and political beliefs explicitly being marked out as sensitive information under new data protection laws. The social network gathers information about users based on their actions on Facebook and on the wider web, and uses that data to predict on their interests. These can be mundane – football, Manhattan or dogs, for instance – or more esoteric. A Guardian investigation in conjunction with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation found that Facebook is able to infer extremely personal information about users, which it allows advertisers to use for targeting purposes. Among the interests found in users’ profiles were communism, social democrats, Hinduism and Christianity. The EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect on 25 May, explicitly labels such categories of information as so sensitive, with such a risk of human rights breaches, that it mandates special conditions around how they can be collected and processed. Among those categories are information about a person’s race, ethnic origin, politics, religion, sex life and sexual orientation. The information commissioner’s office says: “This type of data could create more significant risks to a person’s fundamental rights and freedoms, for example, by putting them at risk of unlawful discrimination.” Organisations must cite one of 10 special dispensations to process such information, such as “preventive or occupational medicine”, “to protect the vital interests of the data subject”, or “the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes”. Facebook already applies those special categories elsewhere on the site. As part of its GDPR-focused updates, the company asked every user to confirm whether or not “political, religious, and relationship information” they had entered on the site should continue to be stored or displayed. But while it offered those controls for information that users had explicitly given it, it gathered no such consent for information it had inferred about users. The data means an advertiser can target messages at, for instance, people in the UK who are interested in homosexuality and Hinduism – about 68,000 people, according to the company’s advertising tools. Facebook does demonstrate some understanding that the information is sensitive and prone to misuse. The company provides advertisers with the ability to exclude users based on their interests, but not for sensitive interests. An advertiser can advertise to people interested in Islam, for instance, but cannot advertise to everyone except those interested in Islam. The company requires advertisers to agree to a set of policies that, among other things, bar them from “using targeting options to discriminate against, harass, provoke or disparage users, or to engage in predatory advertising practices.” In a statement, Facebook said classifying a user’s interests was not the same as classifying their personal traits. “Like other internet companies, Facebook shows ads based on topics we think people might be interested in, but without using sensitive personal data. This means that someone could have an ad interest listed as gay pride because they have liked a Pride-associated page or clicked a Pride ad, but it does not reflect any personal characteristics such as gender or sexuality.” The company also said it provided some controls to users on its ad preferences screen. “People are able to manage their ad preferences tool, which clearly explains how advertising works on Facebook and provides a way to tell us if you want to see ads based on specific interests or not. When interests are removed, we show people the list of removed interests so that they have a record they can access, but these interests are no longer used for ads.” It added: “Our advertising complies with relevant EU law and, like other companies, we are preparing for the GDPR to ensure we are compliant when it comes into force.” The findings are reminiscent of Facebook’s previous attempts to skirt the line between profiling users and profiling their interests. In 2016 it was revealed that the company had created a tool for “racial affinity targeting”. At the time, Facebook repeatedly argued that the tool “is based on affinity, not ethnicity”. Discussing a person who was in the African American affinity group, for instance, the company said: “They like African American content. But we cannot and do not say to advertisers that they are ethnically black.” Almost a year later, after it was revealed that advertisers could use the ethnic affinity tools to unlawfully discriminate against black Facebook users in housing adverts, Facebook agreed to limit how those tools could be used."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/18/politician-gammon-racist-stupid-steven-poole","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T05:00:51Z","webTitle":"Is ‘gammon’ racist or just stupid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/18/politician-gammon-racist-stupid-steven-poole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/18/politician-gammon-racist-stupid-steven-poole","fields":{"headline":"Is ‘gammon’ racist or just stupid?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This week’s lexical meat-fest was gammongate, or perhaps Armagammon: a row about whether calling people “gammon” was racist or just stupid. For certain leftwingers, “gammon” is a contemptuous label for middle-aged white men with pink faces and (presumably) less than purely Momentum-esque political views. Pork-based insults are of course very old. “Gammon-faced” is an insult from 1604, and no actor likes to be called a ham. In 18th-century thieves’ cant, a “gammon” was an accomplice who distracted the victim’s attention. And “gammon” could also mean nonsensical talk or ideas – it is used by Dickens in The Pickwick Papers, but had existed for decades. In John Liddiard Nicholas’s 1817 travelogue, Narrative of a Voyage to New Zealand, our doughty explorer, visiting Maori chiefs, decides that their customs are “all gammon”: they retort, not unreasonably, that the preaching of his missionary friend is “gammon” too. Two hundred years ago, Nicholas explains, to say that something was “gammon”, or nonsense, was “the language of vulgar ridicule”.

Lieutenant BF Pinkerton, a naval officer from the USS Lincoln, is posted in Nagasaki. While there, aided by Goro, an unscrupulous Japanese marriage broker, he lures the fatherless, impoverished 15-year-old Butterfly into a temporary union. Thinking she is legally married, Butterfly abandons her Buddhist faith for Christianity and is renounced by her family and friends. Despite his strong attraction to her, and the warnings of the local US consul Sharpless, Pinkerton then deserts Butterfly, but tells her he will return to take her back to America. Three years of waiting pass, during which time Butterfly secretly gives birth to his child with no one but her servant and companion Suzuki for support. When Pinkerton finally returns to Japan it is with his “real” American wife, Kate. On discovering the existence of his son they decide to take the child from Butterfly and back to America. Butterfly agrees to what she sees as a better life for her son and kills herself so he is not tormented in his adult years by his mother’s abandonment. How do we as a modern audience of the #MeToo era experience this musical masterpiece, written by a white European man about the sexual exploitation and death of an Asian woman? How do we reconcile our enjoyment of this opera while acknowledging that it is an iconic example of Orientalism by a composer who never set foot in Japan? And how do we honour a desire to be true to the realities of the story when the Japanese characters are so often performed by western singers, an issue in an industry that must now confront its notable lack of diversity? None of these issues can be solved by one production – but never has it been more important for a director to grant Madama Butterfly a clear-eyed examination of the unpalatable realities of its libretto. And what a libretto it is. Puccini went through five versions of the piece with his writers Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica until he achieved what we have today: a precise, ruthless exploration of how a near-powerless woman is bought and sold to a pleasure-seeking westerner. It is significant that Puccini, who could not speak English, first saw the play (by David Belasco) that inspired his libretto in London. The piece inflicts on Butterfly a patronising and infantilising cod-English dialogue that would be unacceptable on a modern stage and would have been alienating then. Puccini’s lack of English meant he could transcend the indignity of her speech to see the inherent humanity of Butterfly. As a result, he defended her from any accusation of collusion in her own misfortune by creating an original Act 1 to flesh out the deliberate detail of her deception. Consequently, in Pinkerton they created one of the most morally bankrupt characters in opera – so unpleasant that Puccini had to be persuaded to sympathetically expand the role or risk having tenors reject the part as too small and seedy to perform. He was determined that his audience should see the seduction and corruption of the innocent Butterfly as a conscious choice by Pinkerton. We hear that Butterfly is only 15 years old three times over, as she, Sharpless and Pinkerton drive the point home relentlessly. “The age of playthings,” Sharpless says. “And of sweetmeats,” replies Pinkerton shortly after toasting “the day on which I’ll wed in real marriage, a real wife from America”. Faced with such an unequivocal libretto, it is a directorial duty not to be squeamish about presenting the story of this opera. In order to make as vivid as possible the disparity in the power dynamic between Pinkerton and Butterfly, the production I have created for Glyndebourne is set in the early 1950s. In the aftermath of the second world war, the War Brides Act allowed American servicemen who married abroad to bring their foreign wives home, thus enabling Japanese women to go to America in large numbers. This meant lucrative business for marriage brokers such as our Goro, in whose bustling and obviously profitable office Act 1 is set. Butterfly’s wish to go to the US to start a new life with Pinkerton comes across particularly strongly when he is only one of many men who were facilitated by Japanese society to marry young local women. Some of these relationships had happy outcomes; some not. Our protagonists are part of a bigger story that validates and reinforces Pinkerton’s unthinking, sometimes callous behaviour. We use original footage from 1950s newsreels showing Japanese women “learning to be an American wife” to illustrate how Butterfly might have been manipulated into imagining such a future. Watching these films and directing this story from the perspective of a privileged modern woman is sobering. It’s easy to be seduced into thinking of Madama Butterfly as a story from the past, a melodramatic opera that can be approached as a period piece. But this is a story that still manifests itself in many different reports in newspapers across the world today: the same pattern of western exploitation of vulnerable women can be seen in places such as Haiti. And yet the opera is filled with moments of glorious, uninhibitedly romantic music, and this ecstasy is as much an integral part of this production as the dark subject matter. The near-mythic status this piece has in the operatic canon is due to its amazing combination of brutality and beauty, and that is both its strength and its weakness. This musical allure must never dull the unpleasantness of the story – it must be remembered that the first audience who heard Madama Butterfly in La Scala in 1904 ridiculed the piece, and shouted obscenities at the character of Butterfly. As a modern composer who was as equally a man of the theatre as he was a man of music, Puccini refused to let the piece fail, even in the face of a disgusted first-night audience who greeted the onstage revelation of the child with what biographer Mosco Carner described as “an uproar of hisses, obscene sneers, [and] laughter”. They jeered at Butterfly’s perceived sexual licentiousness despite an unequivocal first act that establishes that she has understood herself to be legally married. This chaos continued in the theatre even during the stunning orchestral music accompanying Butterfly’s silent vigil for Pinkerton’s return. But despite the extremity of these reactions – which came as a shock for Puccini after a very successful dress rehearsal at which the orchestra had applauded him – the composer refused to dilute the brutality of the tale. Therefore, to wallow in his orchestral beauty and ignore the hard truth of the libretto that inspired it is to disrespect both Puccini and the many real, anonymous Butterflies past and present who haunt every bar of this savage masterpiece. Puccini’s opera joins the long list of works of art that after years of unquestioning admiration are now problematic in our more enlightened modern times. But to continue to grapple with the story of Madama Butterfly, much as Puccini did himself, is to honour the empathetic impulse that inspired its creation: the strange and wonderful connection between an Italian opera composer and his imaginary geisha. Annilese Miskimmon’s production of Madama Butterfly is in rep at Glyndebourne until 18 July. It will be broadcast live in cinemas and streamed on the Glyndebourne website on 21 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/may/30/investment-scandal-russia-defrauded-coinvestors","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T06:15:43Z","webTitle":"'We’ve lost all hope': the investment scandal wrecking Russian lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/30/investment-scandal-russia-defrauded-coinvestors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/may/30/investment-scandal-russia-defrauded-coinvestors","fields":{"headline":"'We’ve lost all hope': the investment scandal wrecking Russian lives","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Among the red banners and copies of Trudovaya Rossiya (Working Russia) being passed around at a Communist party rally in Moscow, you could see a new kind of uniform: orange shirts bearing the slogan “Defrauded Co-Investor”. “We’ve lost all hope,” says Valery Ryabkov, who is wearing one of the shirts. “We’ve gone to the Kremlin. We’ve gone to the mayor. Nothing happens. We get the same run-around everywhere.” In Russia there are anything between 40,000 and 120,000 “defrauded co-investors” – people who paid money for new apartments but were unable to move in because construction never finished. The problem has persisted for more than a decade. In 2012, Ryabkov took out a mortgage on a two-bedroom unit in the Tsaritsyno residential complex, which had been under construction for six years. Another six years on, his family still live in a rented apartment while Rybakov pays the mortgage on an unfinished home. “Nobody can force the developer to finish building the house – the developer has gone bankrupt,” he says. “Now we’ve got three children, a co-investment contract, we’ve won seven lawsuits and we’re registered formally as defrauded co-investors. And nothing. We bought this apartment ourselves. The government didn’t give it to us. We didn’t receive it for our three children, like it used to be in Soviet times. I’d gladly support the Communists!” The head of the Nastyushka conglomerate that owns Tsaritsyno is awaiting trial on fraud charges after the developer went bankrupt before finishing the job. After co-investors complained to the district attorney, the construction ministry, the Kremlin and the courts, a new developer was eventually appointed. The latest promise is to finish the building by late 2021 – a full 15 years after the project began. Last year, Vladimir Putin issued an executive order giving the country three years to abandon shared-equity construction (also known as buyer-funded development). Even if that happens – and it is a big if – it will be too late for Ryabkov and tens of thousands like him. ‘People have died before getting their apartments’ Shared-equity construction arrived in Russia in the wake of the 1989 fall of communism, a time when private construction companies were springing up like weeds. The model came from struggling mid-1980s Argentina, where it helped ordinary people get their foot on the housing ladder; the number of property owners in Argentina rose almost tenfold. Russia’s first defrauded co-investors started appearing in the 90s. “There weren’t really any organised protests back then,” says Nadezhda Kosareva, the president of the Urban Economics Institute, which helped develop the federal law that now regulates shared-equity construction in Russia. “It was more local associations of people. There wasn’t a political [component], but the problem was visible.” The legislation emerged, she says, in response to the country’s defrauded co-investors eventually forming a mass movement in the early 00s. In 2003 and 2004, a whole series of laws were adopted on affordable housing that included new town-planning and housing codes, as well as regulations on shared-equity construction. As of the start of this year there are 836 “problem sites” in 69 regions across Russia, according to the construction ministry. Mikhail Men, the head of the ministry, estimates 38,000 people had bought homes at these sites – although a working group in United Russia’s general council put the country’s defrauded co-investor population at over three times that. In the southern city of Krasnodar, Vitaly Kiselyov, head of the local co-investors’ union, says his family is one of 15,000 still waiting on their apartments. In 2016, his mother bought an apartment that had supposedly been on the rental market for four years. The building remains uninhabitable. “Nobody does anything. I can’t even look at it. The whole thing just kills me,” says Kiselyov. His grandmother also bought an apartment in a new complex. “The paperwork says the building is finished, and she was issued a deed and all the necessary documents,” he says. “But in reality, it’s just an empty field. There’s no construction whatsoever. Now she has to live in a tent. There are people who have died before getting their apartments.” In the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, the lawyer Alexander Bakaev joined the defrauded co-investors’ movement after buying a home that was never finished. He says both the public and the government thought of co-investors as “losers at a casino” who “willingly handed over their money to scammers”. In the city of Saratov, Alexey Abasov and his construction company, Grad-S, sold apartments in the unfinished Breeze housing complex and another 13 high-rise buildings at various stages of completion. Today, Abasov is in a jail, and his wife, Galina Chernova, is under house arrest. They deny the charges. The case is so notorious that their victims wrote a poem: Абасов сидит, ЖК «Астраханский» стоит! Дольщики маются, А власти не парятся! They’ve put Abasov in jail, But his apartments still retail! We’re worn to the bone, And the state’s left us alone. When activists tried to organise a series of pickets along central roads in major cities last May, local officials around the country staged outdoor festivals to crowd them out. The conflicts are not always gentle. In Yoshkar-Ola, anti-extremism police investigated a picket by defrauded co-investors; in Ryazan, the authorities used tractors to disperse a crowd; and in November 2017, the attorney general’s office banned a website operated by co-investor activists in Gelendzhik. In St Petersburg Alexander Golovko, who heads the Homeless Co-Investor movement, says he was defrauded by the construction company Lenspetsstroi. In 2014, he signed a co-investment agreement on a new home in a housing complex on Leningrad Prospect. The building was supposed to have 18 floors, but so far only nine have been finished. Golovko first sensed something was wrong when they demanded a tour of the construction site in 2015. He says they were shown an empty field with a foundation pit and several piles of earth. “Then, in order to imitate some kind of activity, Lenspetsstroi started hiring workers according to this strange scheme,” Golovko claims, recounting what he says he heard from one of these labourers. “A construction worker shows up and works for two or three weeks, and then asks for his pay cheque. He finds out that instead of paying him, they’re going to offer him square footage in the housing complex that still isn’t finished. He asks them, ‘Guys, have you gone fucking insane?’ and walks out.” In March 2018, police opened a fraud investigation against the company. Golovko believes the state should monitor construction projects at every stage and respond quickly to any reported delays. He’s not optimistic about the protests: “Everybody is decisive online, but nobody wants to freeze their butts off at rallies, fight with the police, take it to court, and file a report with the district attorney. They pay the mortgage for their unfinished homes and they rent apartments. Some people drop everything and leave St Petersburg altogether. We had one suicide, and two families broke up. The elderly aren’t living this one out.” Golovko claims Lenspetsstroi even created fake social media communities where accounts imitate dialogues in which people visit construction sites and discuss improvements being made to the buildings’ grounds. These groups publish videos showing workers moving pillars and concrete blocks at unfinished construction sites. Sometimes they lift something with a crane. He alleges that almost all apparently feature the same four workers. Desperate defrauded co-investors often appeal directly to Putin. Late last year a message reading “Putin SOS” appeared atop one of the high-rise buildings in the Tsaritsyno complex. A few days later, representatives from 35 other troubled housing complexes made a joint appeal to the president. Sometimes Putin answers – in November 2016 he phoned the leader of a civic action group in Chelyabinsk – but the effectiveness of these calls is unclear. “We wrote to Putin. We sent a messenger to the president’s administration. To be honest, we were disappointed,” says Irina Denisova, the head of a co-investors’ civic action group in Saratov. “It was just the typical clerical stuff. They recorded our statement, stamped a receipt and that was about it.” “Appealing to Putin helped,” says Vitaly Kiselyov, a Krasnodar activist, “but not for long. At first, Moscow was calling the management companies that were supposed to connect our communication lines. They called me and started asking how things were going, but nothing more happened.” Following Putin’s call for Russia to abandon shared-equity construction projects, the construction minister says the state intends to switch to a procedure where banks allocate money for specific sites and the people buying homes transfer the money to escrow accounts, only to be released on completion. Nadezhda Kostyreva, president of the Institute for Urban Economics, says the proposed scheme would merely mean that banks, not developers, assume the construction risks. “The funds on the escrow accounts wouldn’t be protected completely because the cost of apartments exceeds the maximum deposit insurance,” she explains. “We’re still a long way from times without shared-equity agreements in housing, when everything is just a straightforward contract of sale.” The construction ministry says it has received government blueprints for resolving Russia’s problems with defrauded co-investors, and lieutenant governors around the country have been tasked with implementing the plans. Last year, regional governments finished 140 stalled housing projects, and officials say they will oversee the completion of another 360 this year. The government has also created a special registry: in theory, any homeowner can apply to be added once their housing is nine months overdue.

Wolfe died in a Manhattan hospital on Monday, his agent confirmed on Tuesday. He had been hospitalised with an infection. With his literary flair and habit of placing himself as a character in his nonfiction writing, Wolfe was regarded as one of the pioneers of New Journalism. Works like the 1965 essay collection The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby, 1968’s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test – a firsthand account of the growing hippy movement, particularly novelist Ken Kesey’s experiments with psychedelic drugs – and 1979’s The Right Stuff – an account of the pilots who would become America’s first astronauts – established Wolfe as the face of a new style of reportage that could be read for pleasure. He even helped define the term New Journalism – with his publication of a 1973 essay collection of the same name, which placed his own writing alongside the likes of Truman Capote, Joan Didion, Gay Talese and Hunter S Thompson. “He was an incredible writer,” Talese told the Associated Press. “And you couldn’t imitate him. When people tried it was a disaster. They should have gotten a job at a butcher’s shop.” His gleeful use of punctuation and italics, along with entertaining asides and neologisms that often quickly cemented themselves into the English lexicon, helped Wolfe stand out from other journalists. Pursuing colourful tales of excess and status-seeking with a ruthless eye and freewheeling energy, Wolfe championed what he called “saturation reporting”, where a journalist shadows and observes a subject over a long period of time. “Nothing fuels the imagination more than real facts do,” Wolfe said in a 1999 interview. “As the saying goes, ‘You can’t make this stuff up.’” Philip Kaufman, who wrote and directed the screen version of The Right Stuff, told the Guardian: “We’ve lost a great American writer. I spent about five years making the film and trying to listen to Tom’s voice, getting that rambunctious, amazing, energetic quality that he had in his journalism. [But] it was beyond that.” Kaufman said Wolfe was one of the first to see a private screening and immediately wanted to see the film all over again. “He particularly loved the idea of Sam Shepard, as the Chuck Yeager character, on horseback, riding across the high desert and, in a sense, carrying the spirit of the west,” he said. Wolfe’s iconic sartorial style was almost as famous as his writing: he almost always sported a three-piece white, bespoke suit (he had around 40), a look that he once described as “Neo-pretentious”. The get-up, reminiscent of a southern gentleman, disarmed people, he claimed – it made him look like “a man from Mars, the man who didn’t know anything and was eager to know.” Born in Virginia in 1930, Wolfe went straight into reportage out of university, beginning at the Springfield Union in Massachusetts. He later left for Washington, then New York, arriving there in 1962 to work for The New York Herald Tribune. He’d never leave, making a home there with his wife Sheila Berger, the former art director of Harper’s Bazaar, and their two children, until his death. Jonathan Galassi, Wolfe’s editor at his New York publisher Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux in the 1980s and 1990s, a prolific period for the author, called him a reporter-as-mythologizer. “His characters were all outsized, himself included ... [but] penetrating Tom’s gentlemanly reserve was not something anyone I knew ever managed,” he told the Guardian. Of Wolfe’s fashion, Galassi added: “Not only his suits but even his socks were bespoke – I always assumed in silent homage to that other ‘disrespecter’ of pomposities, Mark Twain. I always imagined he got dressed to write, because everything he did was a performance.” After the success of The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby in 1965, Wolfe built a career writing about popular culture, politics and American life, particularly how money and prosperity had shaped the country since the second world war. The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, regarded by many as the definitive book about the roots and growth of the hippy movement, placed him in the public consciousness as somewhat of an authority on psychedelics – though, he later told the Observer in a 2008 interview that he had never used LSD, despite some gentle encouragement from Kesey (“I thought hard about it for about six seconds,” he claimed). Taking on what he called “the big challenge” – the novel – Bonfire of the Vanities was published in 1987, to huge commercial success. A satirical portrait of greed and money in 1980s New York, the novel followed bond trader Sherman McCoy’s journey from Wall Street to a court in the Bronx, after hitting a black man with his car. His second novel, A Man in Full was also a bestseller, but his success attracted critics; in the New York Review of Books the author Norman Mailer wrote: “Extraordinarily good writing forces one to contemplate the uncomfortable possibility that Tom Wolfe might yet be seen as our best writer. How grateful one can feel then for his failures and his final inability to be great — his absence of truly large compass. There may even be an endemic inability to look into the depth of his characters with more than a consummate journalist’s eye.” However, Wolfe was well-known for giving as good as he got, engaging in public battle with his most passionate literary critics – namely, Mailer, John Updike, John Irving and Noam Chomsky, who he dubbed “Noam Charisma”. In a 2000 essay titled My Three Stooges, Wolfe took on Mailer, Updike and Irving, writing, “It must gall them a bit that everyone — even them — is talking about me, and nobody is talking about them.” He also had his fans. “He knows everything,” author Kurt Vonnegut once wrote of Wolfe. “... I wish he had headed the Warren Commission. We might then have caught a glimpse of our nation.” Eventually the author of 17 books – 13 works of nonfiction and four novels – Wolfe wrote well into his eighties, publishing his last book in 2016: The Kingdom of Speech, a controversial critique of Charles Darwin and Chomsky. “John Maynard Keynes said the people who are successful are the people with animal spirits who refuse to acknowledge the risks they are taking in the same way that the healthy young man ignores the possibility of death,” Wolfe told the Observer in 2008, when asked about his work ethic. “I’m not a young man, and I do have a pulse, but when it comes to mortality, mostly I choose to ignore the subject.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/best-bangers-for-your-buck-supermarket-sausages-rated","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T13:00:01Z","webTitle":"Best bangers for your buck?

The egg and cheese sandwich has arrived","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A few years ago, a Kickstarter project emerged in New York trying to raise money to create formal, instructional leaflets on how to make the NYC egg sandwich. This list of requirements, to be delivered to “all Midtown egg-sandwich makers”, included “cheese in every bite” and “not-stale bread”. I don’t know if the campaign was successful – at last check it had raised just over $700 – but it did spark a debate on the significance of the egg sandwich, also known as a breakfast sandwich, to New Yorkers. A 2015 essay in the New York Times gave the impression that it was nearing Unesco heritage status. A response article on Gawker said the piece’s nigh on masonic reverence was “stupid”. That the breakfast sandwich, which is often eaten on the hoof, is being described as a fad may confuse some. For one, they aren’t new and are often referred to by their acronyms (BEC is bacon, egg and cheese) – but they don’t really exist in the same way in the UK. I am British so am coming to this cold, and the closest thing I have had is McDonald’s egg McMuffin. Though it is possible one begat the other, the rise of New York-style delis in the UK, designed in the same vein as Katz’s, Mile End and Frankel’s, means they are becoming breakfast staples here. Monty’s Deli in Hoxton, east London, is about to launch its version of egg and cheese (no pronoun) at its deli and market stalls. In the test kitchen, the deli’s co-owner and chef Owen Barratt, whose usual breakfast is “just coffee”, is busy perfecting the recipe. Into a sous-vide machine go two eggs, butter and mustard to create a loose scramble. The egg is cooked to just over 73C, put in the oven, then transferred to a fridge, where the little egg-pucks will sit in their tart tins to await assembly. The hardest part seems to be controlling the ooze of the egg. Previous testers have asked Barratt to “dial down the squirt” – past versions having ranged from the erotic to the comic. But it is a work in progress. Barratt started out adding parmesan to make a cheesy custard, but it was “too much, too rich”. Now he uses pre-sliced emmental, which he melts on a griddle then places atop the egg like a cheeseburger. It’s then served in cholla buns. I usually have a “no double dairy” rule, but this (which contains cheese and butter) is rich, decadent, filling and worth it. My sample version provides a well-managed squirt that is easily contained in the wax paper wrap, though I would still recommend eating alone. I keep it simple – just egg and cheese – but Monty’s will also offer it with pastrami (a PEC), while Eat New York in Manchester offers a BEC bagel and Zobler’s at London hotel The Ned does a PECT (pastrami, eggs, cheese and tomato), a CCT (cheese, cheese and tomato) and the standard BEC. Just FYI. This article was amended on 17 May to clarify that the Monty’s Deli egg and cheese sandwich contains both cheese and butter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/may/15/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-han-solo-origins-film-is-boistrous-bromance","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T21:06:43Z","webTitle":"Solo: A Star Wars Story review – Han Solo origins film is boisterous bromance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/15/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-han-solo-origins-film-is-boistrous-bromance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/15/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-han-solo-origins-film-is-boistrous-bromance","fields":{"headline":"Solo: A Star Wars Story review – Han Solo origins film is boisterous bromance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a crackingly enjoyable adventure which frankly deserves full episode status in the great franchise, not just one of these intermittent place-holding iterations. Ron Howard was born to direct it. Who’s next for the saga? Zemeckis? Spielberg? There’s a terrific ensemble cast-dynamic and an effortless channelling of the spirit of Episodes IV to VI from father-and-son screenwriting team Lawrence and Jonathan Kasdan who should really be allowed to get their teeth into the stories’ daddy issues and Freudian anxieties. Solo: A Star Wars Story moreover has a glorious origin myth meet-cute to set up one of cinema’s greatest bromances: the stoic wookiee Chewbacca and the insolently handsome freebooting rebel pilot Han Solo – and Alden Ehrenreich absolutely crushes the role to powder, swaggeringly reviving the memory of the young Harrison Ford’s romantic gallantry. And there’s another meet-cute, come to think of it: the love that flowers between man and machine, between the reckless pilot and the sleekly iconic Millennium Falcon. Ehrenreich’s Han is a handsome scallywag and cute no-goodnik who is oppressed like everyone else on a tyrannised planet. He is in love with beautiful Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke) and they plan to bribe officials with a stolen phial of ultra-valuable fuel crystal Coaxium to get smuggled out. Han makes it, Qi’ra doesn’t and Han swears to come back and find her someday. A few years later he’s a brilliant pilot who has been booted out of the imperial fleet for insubordination, and has made common cause with a notorious thief, Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson) who with his associate Val (an underused Thandie Newton) works for a terrifying crime boss, Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany). That’s right: the two intergalactic male robbers are called Beckett and Dryden. I like to think the Kasdan screenwriting team also experimented with Pinter and Davenant, and Stoppard and Marvell before settling on those. And Han also chances across a charismatic dandy-ish smuggler, gambler and flier called Lando Calrissian, a very funny performance from Donald Glover. It is Lando who is the owner of the Millennium Falcon, but sporting man that he is, Lando is willing to bet his beloved craft on a hand of cards with the wily Han. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has an entertaining voice role as Spartacist droid L3-37. Most importantly, Han has his first encounter with the prototypical Allied resistance against the Empire. But wait. To his astonishment, Han is to come face-to-face with Qi’ra again at one of Dryden’s sophisticated parties. Of all the interplanetary cocktail events in all the galaxy she had to walk into this one. There’s a spark between them still. But she’s no longer the fresh-faced girl he knew. Now she’s a beautiful, formidable woman – and the kept girlfriend of Dryden. Can Han save her from this? But the main event is of course the meeting of Han and Chewie, at this stage 190 years old and condemned in this movie series to a Dorian-Gray-type eternal youth. Han has been thrown by an angry army officer into a muddy pit, there to die at the hands of a chained “monster” – Chewie. Of course Han speaks the language: that extraordinary gargling groan, that bestial vocal fry that makes Chewie’s voice so unmistakable. Their wacky staged fight is a beguiling moment as Han fixes to break Chewie free to become his pal and wingman in so many senses. Solo: A Star Wars Story reshuffles the accepted component myth-parts in a way that some find overfamiliar: there are desert scenes, weirdo cabaret acts. But I found it purely lovable. With Howard at the controls, the movie is a fun-fuelled entertainment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/16/glyphosate-shown-to-disrupt-microbiome-at-safe-levels-study-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T08:30:43Z","webTitle":"Glyphosate shown to disrupt microbiome 'at safe levels', study claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/16/glyphosate-shown-to-disrupt-microbiome-at-safe-levels-study-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/16/glyphosate-shown-to-disrupt-microbiome-at-safe-levels-study-claims","fields":{"headline":"Glyphosate shown to disrupt microbiome 'at safe levels', study claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A chemical found in the world’s most widely used weedkiller can have disrupting effects on sexual development, genes and beneficial gut bacteria at doses considered safe, according to a wide-ranging pilot study in rats. Glyphosate is the core ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide and levels found in the human bloodstream have spiked by more than a 1,000% in the last two decades. The substance was recently relicensed for a shortened five-year lease by the EU. But scientists involved in the new glyphosate study say their results show that it poses “a significant public health concern”. One of the report’s authors, Daniele Mandrioli, at the Ramazzini Institute in Bologna, Italy, said significant and potentially detrimental effects from glyphosate had been detected in the gut bacteria of rat pups born to mothers, who appeared to have been unaffected themselves. “It shouldn’t be happening and it is quite remarkable that it is,” Mandrioli said. “Disruption of the microbiome has been associated with a number of negative health outcomes, such as obsesity, diabetes and immunological problems.” Prof Philip J Landrigan, of New York’s Icahn School of Medicine, and also one of the research team, said: “These early warnings must be further investigated in a comprehensive long-term study.” He added that serious health effects from the chemical might manifest as long-term cancer risk: “That might affect a huge number of people, given the planet-wide use of the glyphosate-based herbicides.” Controversy has raged around glyphosate since a World Health Organisation agency – the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) – judged it to be a “probable human carcinogen” in 2015. However, US and European regulators subsequently deemed it acceptable for use, a move campaigners condemned because of regulators’ use of secret industry papers and experts with alleged ties to Monsanto. The US firm, which recently merged with Bayer in a deal worth more than $60bn, argues that it is being unfairly targeted by activist scientists with ulterior motives. Scott Partridge, Monsanto’s VP for global strategy told the Guardian: “The Ramazzini Institute is an activist organisation with an agenda that they have not disclosed as part of their crowdfunding efforts. They wish to support a ban on glyphosate and they have a long history of rendering opinions not supported by regulatory testing agencies.” “This is not about genuine research,” he added. “All the research to date has demonstrated that there is no link between glyphosate and cancer.” In 2017, the Ramazinni Institute was criticised by members of the US Congress, which has provided it with funding. US congress members have also probed funding for the IARC. The new crowdfunded pilot study which the Ramazzini Institute compiled with Bologna University, the Italian National Health Institute, George Washington State University and the Icahn School of Medicine observed the health effects of glyphosate on Sprague Dawley rats, which had been dosed with the US EPA-determined safe limit of 1.75 micrograms per kilo of body weight. Two-thirds of known carcinogens had been discovered using the Sprague Dawley rat species, Mandrioli said, although further investigation would be needed to establish long-term risks to human health. The pilot research did not focus on cancer but it did find evidence of glyphosate bioaccumulation in rats– and changes to reproductive health. “We saw an increase in ano-genital distance in the formulation that is of specific importance for reproductive health,” Mandrioli said. “It might indicate a disruption of the normal level of sexual hormones.” The study’s three peer-reviewed papers will be published in Environmental Health later in May, ahead of a €5m follow-up study that will compare the safe level against multiple other doses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/16/universities-racism-racist-incidents-bad-pr-black-students","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T08:00:42Z","webTitle":"Universities need to tackle racism head-on, not deny it exists | Shakira Martin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/16/universities-racism-racist-incidents-bad-pr-black-students","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/16/universities-racism-racist-incidents-bad-pr-black-students","fields":{"headline":"Universities need to tackle racism head-on, not deny it exists","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Racism is rarely seen as “our problem” in the UK – in contrast to, say, the US where laws, states and legislation were used to exclude African-Americans from public spaces. The very word and its connotations are unsettling. People would rather not talk about it. Nowhere is this more evident than in universities. Brochures, websites and the Department for Education would have you believe that our institutions are beacons of equality and diversity. And while some may appear to be on paper, the reality is very different. The past year alone has seen a string of cases involving black students faced with abuse and vile treatment at their universities. The media may be slowly waking up to the fact we have a race problem, but it has been a huge problem in educational environments for decades. A product of widening participation has been that more than 40% of young people now go on to university. So if our institutions are the most diverse they have ever been why are black students having such a tough time? It’s not just physical, overt forms of racism that plight the lives of black students, a recent poll found that half of students have witnessed racism during their studies, the majority being verbal, offhand or “casually” racist comments. Not so private WhatsApp groups seem to be the choice destination for many to espouse hateful and derogatory views. However, it doesn’t really matter where the offence takes place, the fact it has is burden enough. Universities are struggling to deal with incidents and the reason for that is pretty stark: each individual case brings them bad PR and bad PR weakens their chances of student uptake and good table scores. But that can’t go on. Racial discrimination isn’t something to be brushed under the carpet because it makes institutions look bad, nor is it something that will be solved with a fancy communications strategy and jazzy brochures. Bad PR really starts when institutions fail to support and protect students after terrible ordeals and they have no choice other than to take to social media. Cases of being ignored, not treated with dignity or not being consulted throughout the investigation process are common. This year has also seen black students fighting back, rising up, taking to the streets, starting campaigns and writing powerful letters, like the three brave students from the University of Exeter, to say enough is enough. However, the onus should not be on them to tackle discrimination. The sector is pretty good at sharing best practice. This is one area where distinct, hardline initiatives are needed in abundance. Institutions must be bold. It only takes one or two to get serious about dealing with the issue head-on and others will follow suit. • Shakira Martin is the president of the NUS"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/labour-mp-rachel-reeves-slaughter-may-gender-pay-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T17:24:51Z","webTitle":"Labour MP blasts law firm's 'meaningless' gender pay gap report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/labour-mp-rachel-reeves-slaughter-may-gender-pay-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/labour-mp-rachel-reeves-slaughter-may-gender-pay-gap","fields":{"headline":"Labour MP blasts law firm's 'meaningless' gender pay gap report","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The chair of the Commons business select committee has accused top City law firm Slaughter &amp; May of masking the true extent of its gender pay gap with “bogus” data. Rachel Reeves said the law firm’s decision not to voluntarily publish the data of its partners – who are the most well paid and senior members of the firm – meant that its reported pay gap was “meaningless”. This year, for the first time, all companies and public bodies with more than 250 employees were legally obliged to publish the gap between the average amount paid to a man in their business compared with the average for a woman. In evidence to the select committee on Tuesday, Louise Meikle, director of human resources at Slaughter &amp; May, said the firm had not published partners’ pay as it was not part of the statutory duty and it was unclear how it should be calculated to ensure fair comparison with similar firms. She said: “We’re not trying to hide the statistics about gender balance at the top.” Meikle added that law firm would happily publish data if it had clear guidance on how to do so. But Reeves suggested Slaughter &amp; May was not revealing the true proportion of women at the top of its organisation and had published “bogus numbers”. “What is being masked is the true gender pay gap,” Reeves said “Data you’ve published shows that in the top quartile of your organisation 46.7% are women. We know that is just not true at Slaughter &amp; May because you’ve just told us that 76% of partners are male so that’s pretty meaningless isn’t it?” The gender pay gap data compares men in all roles with women in all roles, rather than those in similar jobs, in a bid to highlight the prevalence of men in high-paid management roles and to encourage change. Companies are also obliged to provide data on the proportion of men and women in the best and least well paid roles. Legally, they did not have to include partners’ pay, but two of the other four “magic circle” big City law firms, Clifford Chance and Linklaters, did so voluntarily.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/may/20/billy-howle-theres-definitely-something-in-me-that-is-a-bit-broken-and-poetic","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T06:00:50Z","webTitle":"Billy Howle: ‘There’s definitely something in me that is a bit broken and poetic’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/20/billy-howle-theres-definitely-something-in-me-that-is-a-bit-broken-and-poetic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/may/20/billy-howle-theres-definitely-something-in-me-that-is-a-bit-broken-and-poetic","fields":{"headline":"Billy Howle: ‘There’s definitely something in me that is a bit broken and poetic’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When Billy Howle was a boy, he auditioned for an all-singing, all-dancing version of Babe, the Sheep-Pig. The production was set to show at the Oxford Playhouse and when Howle got to the casting, he was met with an auditorium overrun with Stagecoach kids. “It was really quite brutal,” he recalls, wide-eyed. “All these jazz-handsy kids and their pushy parents. Needless to say, I was ejected mid-song.” At this point, Howle remembers running off-stage bawling to his mum. When their eyes met, she grabbed him by the scruff of the neck. “I just remember the gritted teeth,” he says, with a slight guffaw. “And the words: ‘Don’t you dare.’” When they got home, his mum sat him down. “She said: ‘Look, Billy, if you’re going to do this, you need to grow an exoskeleton.” Howle scratches his head. “So obviously I spent the next day going: ‘What the fuck’s an exoskeleton?’” On the surface of things, it sounds very much like a scene from Billy Elliot. “I was completely out of place,” agrees Howle. We are sitting in a west London bar, having the first of many conversations about his mother, who I’m now picturing as a no-nonsense Julie Walters type. “She’s an interesting one, my mum,” he grins. “She’s northern, very working class – her father moved around the country working for Tarmac and she mostly grew up in caravans with travelling communities. She’s the kind of person you meet and just know has lived a lot in a past life.” Though still in his 20s, Howle himself has been described as an “old soul”. As a 2013 graduate of the Bristol Old Vic, it’s not long since he started out, but in the past few years he has gained a reputation for his ability to handle emotionally complex characters. His breakthrough role came in Jack Thorne’s E4 series Glue, but it was Richard Eyre’s Broadway adaptation of Ibsen’s Ghosts in 2014 that put him on the radars of international casting directors. In person and in his work, he has an interesting combination of qualities: intense and introspective, witty and, at times, wildly charismatic. “There’s definitely something in me that is a bit broken and poetic,” he says. During the Ghosts run, the ease with which he could underscore tragedy with lightness seemed to take audiences by surprise: “People were laughing at parts they never expected to and I loved that. But I seem to find humour in the darkest of places,” he adds, raising an eyebrow. “I think my girlfriend is sometimes shocked.” Howle is here to promote his first lead film role, On Chesil Beach, the long-awaited adaptation of Ian McEwan’s Booker-nominated novel. For Howle, starring in literary dramas seems to be becoming a “thing”. Before On Chesil Beach there was the book-to-film outing of Julian Barnes’s The Sense of an Ending and, in the not-too-distant future, Howle will appear in a big-screen version of Chekhov’s The Seagull. It’s a happy coincidence that both new films see him play opposite Saoirse Ronan, an actor he’d never crossed paths with until a couple of years ago. “When you work with someone twice in a short space of time it sort of becomes like a dysfunctional marriage,” he says. “I mean, at one point in On Chesil Beach, we had to take it in turns to use a tent on the beach as a toilet.” To win the role, Howle had to face out stiff competition. According to Nina Gold, the casting director, Ronan was a shoo-in, but finding the right actor to play Edward, the angrier half of a warring couple on their wedding night in the early 60s, was much more difficult. Howle thinks they saw probably hundreds of actors, and then at least 20 finalists before they picked a shortlist of five to go to New York and film a screen test with Ronan. When he was told the news, Howle was “shocked”, but it was when he eventually got on set that he had his mind blown. “For me, it was like being given a whole new set of toys to play with, like going from Duplo to Meccano. It was the first time I was playing the lead role so I was constantly going, ‘Wow! Look at this! Look what I can do!’ And, actually, I think it started to piss Saoirse off,” he laughs. “There’s me, the new kid, wanting to experiment and completely oversharing. And then on the other side of the room the other kids are going: ‘We’ve been playing Meccano for ages.’” Growing up with liberal parents, Howle describes his childhood as “feral”. One of four sons raised by a schoolteacher mother and a music professor father, he was mostly brought up in Scarborough. Despite his birth certificate saying William Walter Douglas Howle, from a young age it was the name Billy that stuck. “My mum had me the day the Berlin Wall was pulled down, so originally she wanted something German-sounding, like Wilhelm,” Howle says, smiling. Billy seemed to suit him better: “Billies are always a bit naughty – you rarely get a Billy who’s a nasty piece of work.” He was around 13 when he started “misbehaving. Drinking, drugs, most of the stuff you can get up to in a seaside town.” On top of that, there were minor offences like graffiting and partying in holidaymakers’ empty chalets. School was not a happy place. “I just couldn’t see how most of the stuff they taught us could be applied to anything, so I spent most of the time challenging the teachers,” he says. “In maths, they were going, 1+1=2, and I would say, ‘Well, why does it?’” When he was done with education, he applied for every drama school going. “Every one apart from Rada”, he says. Why’s that? Howle chuckles: “Probably because it had Royal in the name. ‘I’d Rada go to Lamda’ is what we used to say.” Actually, he hated the way the school had been so long associated with the upper-middle classes. “It’s something that still bugs me about acting,” he says. “The number of auditions I go to where they ask where I went to secondary school, it’s crazy. That really gets my back up. Just because you went to Eton, it doesn’t make you a better actor.” A couple of years ago, Howle was selected as one of the new faces of Prada, a job that saw him join Eddie Redmayne in becoming a poster boy for the brand. One journalist even noted that Howle bore an “unnerving resemblance” to the actor; in reality, the likeness is probably just handsome good looks. Still, Howle – a huge fan – was encouraged by Redmayne, and once he got going, was surprised to find it “quite fun”. Before he’d done fashion, the extent of his modelling CV was posing for life-drawing classes. “I ended up doing it for six months. It was actually quite freeing. Although there was one weird occasion where the girl I was seeing turned up. It suddenly got very hot in the room…” He’s currently dating, though “not an actor. Actors are always at loggerheads with each other in relationships. I found that out the hard way.” It’s a relatively new romance that tends to go on between her place in London and Margate, where Howle recently bought a house. Ever since he was a teenager, he has dreamed of buying his own place by the sea: “I think it’s just a nostalgic thing. There’s a film by Werner Herzog [Encounters at the End of the World], about all these philosophers and artists who go to the Antarctic because they want to find the ends of the earth. They say: ‘I’ve thought everything there is to think in the world, so now I’ve come here.’ I’m not saying that Margate is the end of the earth, but it’s a similar thing. Like, ‘I need to find the edge of this island.’ The house, a four-bedroom Edwardian terrace, is currently in the process of being renovated. “At the moment it’s a mess,” he says, “I’ve got moodboards. My girlfriend has given me all these copies of Elle Deco so I’m tearing stuff out.” Progress is slow, mostly because he’s never there. When we meet, Howle is prepping for MotherFatherSon, an eight-part TV drama in which he’ll star as the son of a media tycoon played by Richard Gere. “It’s all about adverse circumstances that alter their relationship,” he explains, “and there’s someone quite exciting that they’re trying to sign off to play the mum.” It’s his second TV production this year: in the autumn, he’ll appear in Outlaw King, an epic Netflix film that sees him and Chris Pine go head-to-head as rival kings of Scotland. On Chesil Beach is going to change things, I say. Howle nods. “It kind of already has,” he admits, explaining that the pay cheque he received for the film pretty much funded Margate. As for fame, he hasn’t really thought about it. What will he do if a legion of fans suddenly announces itself? At the rate he’s going, there’s every chance a fan site will open up and he’ll have an equivalent of the Redmayniacs and Cumberbitches. For the first time, Howle looks puzzled. “The Howlers,” he says, trying it out for size. “It sounds like a football team. I quite like it.” On Chesil Beach is in cinemas now"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/16/killed-negatives-review-america-great-depression-photojournalists-suppressed-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T23:01:33Z","webTitle":"Killed Negatives review – uncovering the dark heart of the Depression","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/16/killed-negatives-review-america-great-depression-photojournalists-suppressed-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/16/killed-negatives-review-america-great-depression-photojournalists-suppressed-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Killed Negatives review – uncovering the dark heart of the Depression","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Great Depression inhabits modern memory like a malign shadow, always at the edge of our anxieties. Could things ever be that bad again? Are they, perhaps? The cataclysmic poverty and unemployment that swept the world after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 is a nightmare from history that warns that modernity does not always mean progress. “There’s no way like the American way,” proclaims an upbeat poster photographed by Arthur Rothstein in 1937. Behind it stretches out an ashen wasteland strewn with beaten-up industrial sheds, a battered car and a facade far too sad for Edward Hopper to paint. Yet what finally kicks the last lethal shade of irony into Rothstein’s picture is a black hole that floats in the empty pale sky next to the poster. This deathly disc looks hungry, as if about to swallow the poster, the car, the sheds. It might be the Depression itself: a cancer in time, wasting hope away. Killed Negatives is an inspired display of accidental surrealism that simultaneously analyses how history is made, and transfigures it into myth. When we picture the Great Depression we see rural America, even though its effects reached to Wigan Pier and Weimar Berlin. That is because a daring initiative of Roosevelt’s New Deal created some of the most haunting photographs of poverty ever taken. Roy E Stryker of the Farm Security Administration commissioned a small army of photojournalists to travel America portraying the poor, their shattered homes, and a bereft American landscape. The unforgettable results include Walker Evans’s famous portrait of Allie Mae Burroughs and Dorothea Lange’s Migrant Mother. This small but outstanding exhibition reveals the brutal cropping of history behind those iconic images. Only a minority of photographs satisfied the FSA. Stryker did not simply put the rejects in a filing cabinet. He and his staff punched holes in the negatives so they could not be printed without the defacing presence of a big black hole. They literally “killed” the unwanted pictures. And what pictures. Stryker had very high standards. What on earth was wrong with Ben Shahn’s compassionate 1935 portrait of a man whose face is full of hunger, not just literal but spiritual, as he drowns in despair? The FSA punched a hole in his chest. It looks as if his heart has been irradiated. It is hard not to see censorship in some of Stryker’s choices. Many images of black Americans were excluded. In a 1938 shot by John Vachon, a street sign saying “Colored” warns that unemployment was not America’s only problem. In another rejected Rothstein picture, an African-American girl has a hole punched right through her. Did the FSA fear that black faces would fail to elicit compassion? Yet Stryker seems more like a very sharp picture editor than a shifty censor. His extremely frank letters to the photographer Theodor Jung criticise him for taking too many shots of the same thing, failing to use a tripod and possibly not knowing how to focus his Leica. This is all said in very polite but damning language. The enduring power of the photographs Stryker published proves he knew what he was doing - and he never “killed” a single negative by Lange. The modern prints made from the FSA’s rejected and damaged negatives bring a new and ghostly vision of history to light. These are not fabrications or jokes. They are real records of a wasted decade. In a 1936 picture by Jung of a farmer breaking down as he discusses his accounts with a man from the FSA, a black hole has materialised between the two men. It seems to represent the gulf between them, the loneliness of the farmer’s despair. In a 1936 picture by Paul Carter the black disc floats near a wooden house that has tumbled sideways into floodwaters. In a photograph of uncertain date that might be the work of Evans, it hovers between a troubled-looking African American couple on a muggy day as if embodying their worries, stresses and uncertainty. It’s a great photograph, whoever took it – and the circular void adds to its power. If this archive did not exist, conceptual art would have to invent it. As it is, contemporary artists in the exhibition offer their own takes on these images. Their pieces are a redundant, however, compared with the overwhelming strangeness of the originals. In the same years that Max Ernst and Magritte were trying to release what they called “the marvellous”, the Farm Security Administration created a dream archive of sorrow and anguish, a harrowing and beautiful bluegrass song heard on the 20th century’s lost highway.

The company, which managed huge construction projects and provided government services ranging from school meals to prison maintenance and NHS cleaning, slumped into insolvency in January. More than 2,000 people have since been made redundant. A damning 100-page report compiled by two select committees, published today, found that directors prioritised senior executive bonus payouts and dividends for shareholders even as the firm neared collapse, while treating pension payments as a “waste of money”. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pension committee, said: “Same old story. Same old greed. A board of directors too busy stuffing their mouths with gold to show any concern for the welfare of their workforce or their pensioners.” In a joint statement with business committee chair Rachel Reeves, the pair called for a complete overhaul of Britain’s corporate governance regime, saying the government had “lacked the decisiveness or bravery” to do so. “Government urgently needs to come to parliament with radical reforms to our creaking system of corporate accountability,” Field said. “British industry is too important to be left in the hands of the likes of the shysters at the top of Carillion.” The report warned that without corporate governance reforms, “Carillion could happen again, and soon”. The committees also accused the so-called big four accounting firms – PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY – of operating as a “cosy club”. It claimed that KPMG had been “complicit” in signing off Carillion’s “increasingly fantastical figures” and internal auditor Deloitte had failed to identify “terminal failings” in risk management and financial controls, or “too readily ignored them”. Reeves said the big four, who took £72m in fees in the decade leading up to Carillion’s failure, enjoyed a “parasitical” relationship with companies whose books they were meant to scrutinise. “They are guilty of failing to tackle the crisis at Carillion, failing to insist the company paint a true picture of its crippling financial problems,” she said. The report recommends that the competition regulator now considers whether the big four accountancy firms should be forcibly broken up to increase competition. Labour’s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable backed calls to break them up. Long-Bailey-said: “Millions racked up in debt, thousands of workers losing their jobs and pensions, and supply chain business at risk of collapse, because not only did the corporate auditors fail to hold Carillion’s misbehaving managers to account, but because the government looked on in ignorance at the same time, proceeding to award contract after contract to a firm which had issued numerous profit warnings. “The breakup of the big four is only the first step. There needs to be a root-and-branch reform of the law in this area.” Cable said it was time to “shatter this cosy club to create a more competitive, truly diverse market”. A KPMG spokesperson said: “We believe we conducted our audit appropriately. However, it’s only right that following a corporate collapse of such size and significance, the necessary investigations are performed. Auditing large and complex businesses involves many judgments and we will continue to cooperate with the FRC’s ongoing investigation. “We welcome any future review of our profession. If we consider how the profession has changed in the last decade […] it is clear there is a need for us to look closely at our business models.” Deloitte said it was “disappointed with the conclusions of the committees in regard to our role as internal auditors” adding that it would take on board any lessons that could be learned from Carillion’s collapse. More than 2,000 of Carillion’s 19,500 UK staff have lost their jobs since its demise, although the Insolvency Service has found new employment for 11,618 people. The company’s failure also saddled the government’s Pension Protection Fund with an £800m liability, its largest ever, while 30,000 suppliers and subcontractors are waiting in vain for £2bn in bills owed by the company. Creditors have been told they are likely to get back less than 1p for every £1 they are owed. Taxpayers face at least £150m in clean-up costs, while multimillion-pound hospital projects intended to alleviate pressure on NHS services – the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Birmingham – are on hold indefinitely. The report by the two committees placed most of the blame on the company’s “myopic” board, and says the government’s Insolvency Service should consider recommending that they be banned from holding directorships in future. The committees singled out Carillion’s finance chief, Richard Adam, chief executive Richard Howson and chairman Philip Green for particular criticism. The trio presented themselves as “self-pitying victims of a maelstrom of coincidental and unforeseeable mishaps” including contracts in the Middle East that went sour. In fact, the committees found, the company’s problems were far more deep-rooted. “Carillion’s rise and spectacular fall was a story of recklessness, hubris and greed,” the report said. “Its business model was a relentless dash for cash, driven by acquisitions, rising debt, expansion into new markets and exploitation of suppliers. “It presented accounts that misrepresented the reality of the business, and increased its dividend every year, come what may,” the report said, adding that the company’s pension scheme was “treated with contempt”. “Even as the company very publicly began to unravel, the board was concerned with increasing and protecting generous executive bonuses,” MPs on the committees added. The report named Adam as the “architect of Carillion’s aggressive accounting policies”, which disguised the firm’s financial woes until July last year, when it admitted that £729m of revenues it had previously accounted for were unlikely to be obtainable. MPs accused him of considering pension payments a “waste of money”, adding that pension trustees who sought increased contributions were “outgunned” by directors. They also criticised Adam’s sale of nearly £800,000 of shares shortly after retiring, a decision they described as “the actions of a man who knew where the company was heading”. “Despite retiring over a year before Carillion went into insolvency, I am deeply saddened by the events that have since overtaken the company,” Adam said. But he rejected the “unwarranted conclusions” of the committees regarding his role in the company, saying comments had been “misattributed to me”. Green, a boardroom veteran and former adviser to David Cameron on corporate responsibility, said he and the board had “always strived to act in the interests of the company and all its stakeholders”. “Whilst much of the commentary in today’s report fails to understand and accurately reflect the true, more complex picture of events, the committee has highlighted lessons which can be learned by the board, the government and the wider industry.” Howson declined to comment. The government also came in for criticism for failing to address failures in corporate governance rules that allowed Carillion to become a “giant and unsustainable corporate timebomb”. The report called for an “ambitious and wide-ranging set of reforms” to overhaul the UK’s system of corporate accountability. Theresa May promised to “change the way big business is governed” in 2016 during the first major speech of her campaign to lead the Conservative party and the country after Cameron’s resignation. She has since been accused of watering down planned reforms to corporate governance. It emerged after Carillion’s collapse that the government continued to award large contracts to the firm even after it knew it was in financial trouble. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that the government knew in December last year of a plan that could have retrieved £364m from the company but did not push directors to adopt it. A government spokesperson said: “Our priority has been the continued, safe running of public services and to minimise the impact of Carillion’s insolvency. The plans we put in place have ensured this. The government wants to see a strong and varied supplier base where companies of all sizes benefit from long-term and stable government contracts. “That’s why we have recently announced a number of measures to support government suppliers – strengthening our commitment to prompt payment; protecting staff, businesses and small suppliers from irresponsible directors. “We welcome the report from the joint select committee and will respond fully in due course.” MPs also lashed out at regulators the Financial Reporting Council and the Pensions Regulator, branding them “chronically passive”. They said the two bodies were “too timid to make effective use of the powers they have” and should be given greater power, although they warned that this would require significant cultural change. In the case of the Pensions Regulator, they said this might require new leadership. Chief executive Lesley Titcomb was criticised by MPs for an unconvincing showing during an evidence session with the two committees earlier this year. The FRC said it was making “good progress” with an investigation into Carillion, one of the largest cases it has ever taken on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/15/marseille-misfits-atletico-madrid-europa-league-final-lyon","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T18:00:26Z","webTitle":"Marseille’s misfits shape up in the face of Atlético and a Europa League final | Jonathan Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/15/marseille-misfits-atletico-madrid-europa-league-final-lyon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/15/marseille-misfits-atletico-madrid-europa-league-final-lyon","fields":{"headline":"Marseille’s misfits shape up in the face of Atlético and a Europa League final","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One photograph encapsulated Florian Thauvin’s time at Newcastle. It captures him, cheeks plump and sleek, a Louis Vuitton washbag clasped in his right hand, walking through a sunlit St James’ Park. His hair is impeccably swept back, he is wearing a bow tie and a slight smirk – he is clearly aware of the camera – gives his face an unfortunately smug aspect. Just behind him is a sign: “Please keep off the grass.” Thauvin was sadly obedient. He started only three games in 2015‑16, his one season on Tyneside. He had cost £15m, plus the season-long loan of Rémy Cabella and came to embody everything that was wrong with Steve McClaren’s side. He was overpaid, overhyped and overindulged, an indictment of the policy of recruiting in Ligue 1 that had been lauded. When Chancel Mbemba had turned up in black tie in August, it had provoked amusement. Thauvin’s decision to repeat the stunt a month later, drew only scorn, not helped by the fact he went on to lose possession 33 times during the game. “He turns up in a tux!” Alan Shearer moaned on Match of the Day. “This is a serious business we’re in here. It was funny on the first day of the season. It’s not funny any more.” Thauvin’s protestations that he had not been the only one wearing a bow tie and that Shearer’s criticism had damaged his confidence did not help the impression he was cut out for the extremely serious business of playing for Newcastle. In 13 desultory league appearances, he managed neither a goal nor an assist. He had one shot on target. He returned to Marseille and was sent off against Montpellier on his second debut for them. At that point, it was hard to argue against the former France goalkeeper Jean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes’s comment, after he had abandoned Lille for Marseille without playing a game for them, that he “had chickpeas for brains”. Under Rudi García, Thauvin, now 25, is living up to the promise he showed at Bastia. He has scored 22 goals in Ligue 1 for Marseille this season and set up a further 11. His role on the left of a 4‑2‑3‑1 will be vital if they are to defeat Atlético Madrid on Wednesday and become the first French club to win the Europa League. Against Atlético’s narrow 4‑4‑2, his spark from wide, against a full-back in Lucas Hernández, who can seem a little clumsy, is the most likely means for Marseille to trouble their more experienced opponents. Thauvin is important not just for his stats or the specifics of this game. He is somehow representative of Marseille as a whole, as a club who give players another chance. For two decades they have seemed a club in limbo, cursed by their illustrious past into expectations that outstrip their resources. For clubs a tier or two below the superclubs, there are not many options. Marseille went the eccentric genius route with Marcelo Bielsa in 2014-15 and although they glimpsed glory, they suffered some dismal refereeing in a vital game against PSG and then the late-season fatigue that has so often undermined the Argentinian’s sides. The loss of André-Pierre Gignac, Dmitri Payet and André Ayew that summer effectively undermined any hope of a second challenge and Bielsa quit one game into the season. Marseille slumped to 13th and there were further departures that summer. But then the US businessman Frank McCourt bought the club and with the finances stable Marseille began a more traditional programme of rebuilding. They are not a superclub, far from it, but they had the resources to begin patching a side together from misfits and malcontents. Thauvin has been the most striking success but on the other flank is Lucas Ocampos, who arrived at Monaco from River Plate as an 18-year-old in 2012. He never came close to living up to expectations and has spent his career in Europe shuttling between Monaco and Marseille, while being loaned to Genoa and Milan. Finally settled he has begun to thrive, scoring nine league goals and a further four in the Europa League this season. Between the two wingers is Payet, a player who seems always to be either scoring brilliant free-kicks or sulking, with not a whole lot of grey area in between. His form suddenly has improved in the past month and there is talk, once again, of him forcing his way into the France squad. Marseille are littered with Premier League rejects – Jordan Amavi, Steve Mandanda, Clinton N’Jie, Kostas Mitroglou – while the centre-forward Valère Germain was the forgotten man of Monaco’s run to the Champions League semi-finals last year. There is something absurd in thinking of the 10-times French champions, the 1993 European champions, as underdogs, but that is the reality of football’s modern economics. Their progress may not be sustained but their quilt of players who have fallen through the cracks at least offers hope there is life beyond the elite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/15/send-us-a-tip-on-uk-coastal-cafes-pubs-and-restaurants-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T14:55:19Z","webTitle":"Send us a tip on UK coastal cafes, pubs and restaurants for the chance to win a £200 hotel voucher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/15/send-us-a-tip-on-uk-coastal-cafes-pubs-and-restaurants-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/15/send-us-a-tip-on-uk-coastal-cafes-pubs-and-restaurants-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","fields":{"headline":"Send us a tip on UK coastal cafes, pubs and restaurants for the chance to win a £200 hotel voucher","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It could be a modern restaurant perfectly designed to blend with the cliffs or an ageing sand-blasted family-run cafe.

Christopher Kelly’s sprawling documentary, filmed over six years, is an honest and engrossing portrait of three grassroots activists, a trio of Davids taking on the might of Goliath. There’s gripping human drama here, but the absence of a voiceover limits the film’s accessibility to those already interested in Cambodia; there are just a few snippets of background information on intertitles. One of those Kelly follows is Luon Sovath, a Buddhist monk nicknamed “the multimedia monk”, well-known for filming police intimidation and violence on his smartphone, dressed in saffron robes. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, two young mothers, Tep Vanny and Toul Srey Pov, become leaders of the “housewife activists” of Boeung Kak, a lake community battling forced evictions from their homes on valuable real estate. As the diggers move in, filling the lake with sand and flooding houses, the city’s governor pays a visit; he barely bothers to hide his boredom. Kelly charts the evolution of the women from shy, embarrassed pubic speakers to activist warriors pulling off media-grabbing stunts. Unshrinkingly, he keeps the camera rolling as the two women bitterly fall out, their solidarity in tatters. Vanny, as the only one of the group who speaks English, becomes their figurehead, travelling to New York to receive an award at a ceremony attended by Hillary Clinton, causing jealously and resentment. There is an uncomfortable truth here about how protest movements divide and splinter. In the end this is a film more about activism than Cambodian politics: how ordinary people find their voices and learn to use them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/18/allure-review-gloomy-psycho-drama-is-only-skin-deep","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T05:00:51Z","webTitle":"Allure review – gloomy psycho-drama is only skin deep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/18/allure-review-gloomy-psycho-drama-is-only-skin-deep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/18/allure-review-gloomy-psycho-drama-is-only-skin-deep","fields":{"headline":"Allure review – gloomy psycho-drama is only skin deep","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The title says it all: Allure. So good it’s already the name of a perfume and a US beauty magazine. Now comes the movie, a gloomy unconvincing drama about a woman who manipulates a teenage girl into a sexual relationship. Evan Rachel Wood does her level best, giving a committed intense performance as the predator, matched by Julia Sarah Stone as her girlfriend/victim; together they outclass a film that perhaps doesn’t deserve their commitment. Wood is Laura, who’s around 30 and cleans houses for her dad’s company. When she’s feeling low, she picks up random men for rough sex – one walks out after she throttles him. You can spot that she’s emotionally damaged by her chipped nail varnish. (While a week-old manicure is the norm for women in real-life, it’s a dead giveaway for a self-destructive streak in the movies.) At work, Laura takes a shine to the 16-year-old daughter of a client, overachieving and under-loved Eva (Stone), a talented pianist with a controlling mother. What Canadian writer-directors Carlos and Jason Sanchez get creepily right is the insidious seduction stage as Laura worms her way in. She flatters Eva, treating her like a adult, getting her drunk and finally nudging her to run away. The film comes alive in these moments in between Wood and Stone. In a genuinely shocking scene after Laura has persuaded Eva to crash at her house, she locks her in the basement. It only gets unsatisfying from here. The suggestion is that Laura is herself a survivor of childhood abuse, which is never fully spelled out but is used as a shortcut to some fairly hokey showdowns. Eva, meanwhile, goes from average teenager to Stockholm syndrome victim in a matter of days. Despite its stellar performances, this feels like a psychological drama without much basis in actual human psychology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/putin-opens-bridge-between-crimea-and-russian-mainland","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T15:09:20Z","webTitle":"Putin opens 12-mile bridge between Crimea and Russian mainland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/putin-opens-bridge-between-crimea-and-russian-mainland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/putin-opens-bridge-between-crimea-and-russian-mainland","fields":{"headline":"Putin opens 12-mile bridge between Crimea and Russian mainland","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has opened a bridge between the Russian mainland and Crimea, tightening Russia’s hold over the contested peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The 12-mile (19km), $3.7bn (£2.7bn) bridge is Moscow’s only direct road link to Crimea. Russia expects it will carry millions of cars and rail travellers and millions of tons of cargo each year. Previously, all car traffic passed over the Kerch strait by ferry or by passing through Ukraine. Relations between Russia and Ukraine remain extremely fraught as a simmering conflict continues between Kiev and Moscow-backed separatists in Ukraine’s south-east. In 2016 the US imposed sanctions on Russian companies that were helping to build the bridge across the Kerch strait. Ukraine has said the construction of the bridge shows blatant disregard for international law. On Tuesday Putin drove an orange Kamaz truck across the bridge as he opened the road to car traffic. “In different historical epochs, even under the tsar priests, people dreamed of building this bridge,” Putin told workers at the ceremony. “Then they returned to this [idea] in the 1930s, the 40s, the 50s. And finally, thanks to your work and your talent, the miracle has happened.” Russian state media touted the bridge as the “construction of the century”. The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany had considered and then scrapped plans to build a bridge over the Kerch strait. Ferry traffic is often halted because of bad weather. Construction was led by Stroygazmontazh, whose owner, Arkady Rotenberg, has close connections to the Kremlin. Rotenberg was Putin’s judo sparring partner. He was hit with sanctions by the US for his proximity to Putin and by the EU for being among those accused of undermining Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The bridge was completed six months ahead of schedule, according to Russian state news agencies. “I’ve got goosebumps,” Rotenberg told the Russia-24 channel during a live, nationwide broadcast from the bridge. The bridge can reportedly carry up to 40,000 cars per day, its span is greater than that of the Vasco da Gama bridge in Portugal, previously the longest in Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/french-court-upholds-ex-budget-minister-jerome-cahuzac-tax-conviction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T15:18:27Z","webTitle":"French court upholds ex-budget minister’s tax fraud conviction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/french-court-upholds-ex-budget-minister-jerome-cahuzac-tax-conviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/french-court-upholds-ex-budget-minister-jerome-cahuzac-tax-conviction","fields":{"headline":"French court upholds ex-budget minister’s tax fraud conviction","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jérôme Cahuzac, the disgraced French former budget minister who led a crackdown on tax avoidance while secretly hiding millions of euros of his own money from authorities, has had his conviction for tax fraud upheld by an appeals court. The case – in which the leftwing campaigner for a more honest tax system was found to have been personally cheating tax on a vast scale – was one of France’s biggest political scandals of the decade and increased public mistrust in the political class. Cahuzac, 65, a former cosmetic surgeon, was sentenced on Tuesday to four years in prison – with two years suspended – for tax fraud and money laundering. The sentence was less severe than after his first trial in 2016, when he had been given three years in prison. It is up to a sentencing judge to decide whether Cahuzac will serve time in jail or whether the two-year term will be reduced. He was also fined €300,000 (£263,000) and banned from running for office for five years. Cahuzac was appointed by François Hollande in 2012 to lead the socialist president’s drive against wealthy tax-avoiders and make the rich pay their share of dragging France out of its economic woes. But, within months, the investigative website Mediapart revealed that Cahuzac had been hiding his own money. He denied it, lying to parliament before admitting in 2013 that he had hidden money in an account in Switzerland for 20 years. Cahuzac and his ex-wife, Patricia Ménard, who was also convicted of tax fraud, had jointly run a lucrative hair-transplant business treating some of France’s biggest celebrities. They hid millions of euros from the tax authorities for two decades, moving their money across the world from Switzerland to Singapore and the Isle of Man. After the Cahuzac scandal broke, Hollande reinforced measures on financial corruption, ethics and transparency in political life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/may/15/police-mishandling-digital-evidence-forensic-experts-warn","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T18:29:20Z","webTitle":"Police mishandling digital evidence, forensic experts warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/may/15/police-mishandling-digital-evidence-forensic-experts-warn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/may/15/police-mishandling-digital-evidence-forensic-experts-warn","fields":{"headline":"Police mishandling digital evidence, forensic experts warn","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police officers are trampling over vital forensic evidence, are under-trained, and often do not know what they are looking for, MPs investigating digital disclosure problems have been told. Giving evidence to a justice select committee inquiry into failures to hand over material that have led to multiple court cases collapsing, leading digital forensic experts warned of funding shortfalls and inadequate skills. “One of the problems is the sheer amount of digital evidence the police have to look at,” said Dr Jan Collie, of Discovery Forensics, who specialises in defence work. “You have to consider the cloud [for digital storage], too. There’s evidence everywhere. With cuts in funding, officers don’t have the time to do all that. “When I first started, the police had their own digital forensic units and knew what they were about. Now you are getting very sketchy evidence. People give me screenshots of pictures of a phone. I need to see [a copy of the] original, be able to repeat and verify tests.” Police forces do not have sufficient resources, she added: “When they have the people, they haven’t got the money to send them on courses.” Officers do not always understand the context of where digital information is found – whether it has been inadvertently hoovered up through a browser or purposefully searched for, Collie said. “A lot of police stations have [mobile phone extraction kiosks] where they put a mobile phone in and press a couple of buttons, but it’s not enough analysis. A police officer who has been trained for about a day can use the equipment. He can click it in and handle the buttons, [but] often they spoil the evidence by mishandling. It’s like they have trodden on the evidence. Interpretation of data is being carried out by ordinary officers – they are not trained to do it.” Many recent cases that collapsed involved rape charges where crucial text message exchanges were either missed by investigators or only released belatedly. Prof Peter Sommer, an expert witness in digital forensics cases, told MPs: “These kiosks are designed for preliminary inquiry, to see if it is worth pursuing. They don’t really produce reliable evidence. “It’s cherry picking. The posh phrase is confirmation bias. It’s got worse because the volumes you have to deal with have got much greater. These tools have deskilled [people]. Unless you know what you are looking for, the results can be very misleading.” He also pointed out that underfunding of the criminal justice system was leading to many digital forensic experts to quit. “People are ceasing to do it because it’s uncompetitive,” he said. “In criminal work, it’s £72 an hour. If you work for civil case clients, it’s £250 an hour.” Dr Gillian Tully, who is the official forensic science regulator, told the committee: “Police digital forensic units are quite good at extracting information and making copies. They then pass copies to the general police, and investigators don’t necessarily have the tools to search the information or make good use of it.” Tully has called for additional funding for forensic science, adding: “When it comes to legal aid funding, it’s largely awarded to the business with the lowest quote – which is not helpful for quality.” Sommer suggested one way to solve disclosure failures would be for all the digital material to be handed over to the defence. But Rebecca Hitchen of charity Rape Crisis, told the committee that disclosure of highly personal evidence often leads to victims refusing to testify, particularly in sexual assault cases. “When a complainant learns of the level of intrusion into their lives, they often decide it’s not in their best interest to continue,” she said. “There’s incredibly high levels of withdrawal [from police investigations] around the issue of personal history, for example if someone had an abortion at an earlier stage and the police can’t give an assurance that it won’t be revealed. The sensation of sex crime survivors is often that they are being put on trial.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2018/may/22/notes-queries-populist-demagogue","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T13:00:55Z","webTitle":"What is the difference between a populist and a demagogue?

We stage stuff every day!” Thomas Markle has been publicly humiliated – and may yet miss his daughter’s wedding – after it was revealed the 73-year-old had worked with an LA-based paparazzo to stage photographs of him looking at pictures of his daughter in an internet cafe and being measured for a suit. But the story also shines a light on the extent to which many of the apparently natural photographs of celebrities that fill newspapers, gossip magazines and sidebars-of-shame around the world are in reality the result of financial deals between the subject and the photographer. Talk to anyone in the industry and one thing quickly becomes apparent: very little in the world of celebrity photography happens by chance. “We’re in a landscape where staged photos are the norm,” says Danny Hayward, who runs a leading picture agency in the UK. He says increasingly strict privacy rulings in UK courts mean publishers are reluctant to take the risk of using a traditional, “snatched” paparazzi shot. “They [staged photos] are safer and there’s no legal comeback or repercussions.” Hayward takes the credit for pioneering staged paparazzi photos during the early 2000s, saying the catalyst was the growth in the number of reality TV stars – such as Jade Goody in the UK – who were famous for simply being themselves, rather than having a TV or new album to promote. “This was the catalyst that motivated the style of photography where the subject would get paid for a set of pictures that – this is critical – looked candid but were actually staged.” In an ideal world, according to Hayward, such an arrangement gives the celebrity control over how they look, allows them to control their PR, and also provides a handy revenue stream by giving them a percentage of any sale. The initial set of photographs featuring Thomas Markle – shot in the Mexican town where he now lives by the British photographer Jeff Rayner – initially aroused little suspicion. But doubts were raised when the same photographer was able to provide another candid set of pictures featuring Prince Harry’s future father-in-law, prompting the Mail on Sunday revelation that the pictures had been staged. Industry insiders cast doubt on press speculation that Rayner, who is originally from Canterbury but now runs the LA-based Coleman-Rayner business (“the news agency that prides itself on its reputation for integrity, accuracy and dependability”), could have sold the photos for £100,000. Some suggested the real figure could be around half that amount. It is unknown whether Markle was paid for participating in the shoot, but someone in his position could negotiate around a 50% cut, given the interest in the story. Perversely, earnings from syndication rights to the pictures could now increase, as news outlets license the pictures in order to appear alongside stories questioning their veracity. Bamby, who agreed to discuss the industry on the proviso that he was described as “the UK’s number one paparazzi”, is unashamed about staging photos, having previously admitting sending the TV presenter Judy Finnigan a bottle of wine in order to capture a picture implying that she had a drinking problem. “You get some soap star, take them on holiday, then the first day they’re ours,” he said, describing a typical setup. “You get them in as many different outfits and bikinis as possible; hair up, hair down. Then you release a set [of photos] after four weeks saying they’re in Dubai, another set after six weeks saying they’re in Tenerife. You can sell a set every month for a year.” While the royals have always officially maintained their distance from the media, there’s nothing new about tipoffs to friendly photographers. Even Princess Diana, who was killed in 1997 while trying to escape paparazzi on motorbikes in Paris, was known for telling photographers when she would be on holiday. “I was always nearby, ready to capture these historic images, and that suited us both,” said one celebrity photographer of the era. The trend for staged celebrity pictures shows no sign of going away. Picture agency owner Hayward said that in the last 12 months celebrities had begun offering to pay him to take their apparently candid photo and then distribute them to news outlets, in a bid to gain publicity rather than income. In the process, the paparazzi agency is slowly being subsumed into the wider celebrity-industrial PR complex. “The narcissism of these stars is at a level we can’t comprehend,” he said. “All they want to do is see themselves at the top of Google News.” Diana’s death led the Daily Mail’s publisher to issue a front-page declaration that the newspaper would never again use paparazzi pictures. Two decades later the organisation’s MailOnline is one of the largest outlets for celebrity photographs in the world and carried the staged Thomas Markle photographs until its sister publication exposed the apparent fraud. Jonathan Hartley, a media consultant who regularly deals with tabloid newspapers, said there was nothing inherently wrong with staged photographs, so long as they did not overstep the mark. “Just because a photo is staged, doesn’t mean it’s untrue or disingenuous,” he said. “In this case is was disingenuous because they were presenting something as fact which wasn’t true. Staged photos aren’t in themselves inherently bad as long as they’re not deliberately misrepresenting a situation. That’s where he’s gone wrong.” He suggested there should have been more support for Meghan Markle’s relatives from the royal press team. “The Markle family really have been thrown to the wolves. When you’ve got people following you after stories, it’s very difficult to make the right decisions without any advice. Whether they wouldn’t accept the advice or not, I don’t know. It just felt like it was always going to happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/taliban-launch-large-scale-assault-on-western-afghan-city","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T18:43:37Z","webTitle":"Taliban launch large-scale assault on western Afghan city","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/taliban-launch-large-scale-assault-on-western-afghan-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/taliban-launch-large-scale-assault-on-western-afghan-city","fields":{"headline":"Taliban launch large-scale assault on western Afghan city","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Taliban fighters armed with captured weapons and night vision goggles have flooded into the capital of Afghanistan’s western Farah province, forcing the governor to flee and driving security forces and officials into a handful of besieged compounds. Insurgents launched their attack on Farah city, near the Iranian border, around 2am, city residents said. Within hours they were within a few hundred metres of police and intelligence headquarters and had set up checkpoints on roads in and out of city, local officials said. “Fighting is currently ongoing inside the city and we do not know about the condition of civilians,” said Dadullah Qane, a provincial council member for Farah, who said insurgents were trying to spring fellow militants from the provincial jail. “They are trying to break into the prison.” Another senior official who asked to remain anonymous said the provincial governor had fled soon after the attack began. Farah province is a key drug trafficking corridor that borders Iran and the opium-growing heartlands of Helmand. Hundreds of fighters based in Farah, Helmand and neighbouring Nimroz joined together to launch Tuesday’s attack. The Taliban last month announced the start of its annual spring offensive – fighting ebbs and flows with the seasons in Afghanistan’s long war – by formally renouncing government calls for peace talks. By late afternoon on Tuesday communications with the city had been cut. Afghan security forces said they were rushing reinforcements to Farah city, which Nato claimed was still under government control. A spokesman tweeted a photo of an A-10 fighter plane “on the offensive against the Taliban”. The Guardian tried to contact nearly a dozen local security officials to verify the situation on the ground but was unable to reach any of them. However, videos tweeted by Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid showed Taliban insurgents walking freely through Farah, including one area that residents identified as “Provincial Square”, at the heart of the city. Desperate civilians who fled the fighting, terrified both of Taliban violence and being caught up in counter-attacks by government forces, were stranded in the desert around nine miles (15km) outside the town. “My family and Farah residents including women and children are here with no water and food. There is nothing,” said Abdulqader Karimi. “People here are sitting in their cars and those who do not have cars are here under intense sun.” “[Everyone] left their properties behind. We could only save our lives by fleeing … the government is not telling us anything.” Despite a Taliban promise not to kill or loot if civilians “remain in your homes and pray”, at least one resident said fighters had killed elders and Farah civilians with ties to the government and security forces. He saw bodies in the street as he fled, and family members weeping over their dead. Farah residents who did stay in the city said they also worried about being caught up in fighting or being hit by airstrikes. “Most people left the city before dawn. But some including me and my family are trapped. We want to leave but it’s so dangerous,” said one resident, who asked to give only his first name Rohulla. “As I’m talking to you, I can hear heavy gunfire.” Tuesday’s attack is the first assault on a provincial capital this year, but analysts and politicians say the city should have been better defended, after three similar attacks by insurgents last year. Insurgents have regularly tried to take provincial capitals, in attacks that serve both as a show of strength, and a chance to gather weapons and equipment. In 2015 the insurgents briefly seized control of Kunduz, the fifth largest city in Afghanistan. The militants were ousted with days, but it was the first time the group had controlled a provincial capital since they were toppled from power in 2001, and a major shock to the government and its backers.

The renewable energy industry hailed the milestone as a sign the UK was well on its way to an electricity system powered by cheap, domestic green energy. Across the first quarter, wind power produced 18.8% of electricity, second only to gas, said a report by researchers at Imperial College London. At one point overnight on 17 March, wind turbines briefly provided almost half of the UK’s electricity. Wind power helped during the cold snaps, too, supplying 12-43% of electricity during the six subzero days in the first three months of the year. Two nuclear plants were temporarily offline for routine maintenance, while another was shut because of seaweed in the cooling system. While wind together with solar supplied more power than nuclear in the final three months of 2017, thiswas the first time wind has managed the feat alone. Dr Rob Gross, one of the authors of the Drax Electric Insights report, said: “There’s no sign of a limit to what we’re able to do with wind in the near future.” The opening in December of a new power cable between Scotland and north Wales also helped unlock electricity from Scottish windfarms, some of which would normally be turned off to help National Grid cope. The Western Link connection has drastically cut the amount of money paid by National Grid to windfarm owners for that curtailment. The company paid £100m in 2017 for curtailment. This year payments are already down by two-thirds. Emma Pinchbeck, the executive director at industry group RenewableUK, said: “It is great news for everyone that rather than turning turbines off to manage our ageing grid, the new cable instead will make best use of wind energy.” News of the quarterly milestone came as MPs said UK emissions targets were threatened by government policy changes, which had caused a collapse in clean energy investment since 2015, including a 56% fall in 2017. Mary Creagh, Labour MP and chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Billions of pounds of investment is needed in clean energy, transport, heating and industry to meet our carbon targets. But a dramatic fall in investment is threatening the government’s ability to meet legally binding climate change targets.” Separately, the spending watchdog concluded that £23bn spent on a government subsidy scheme for low-carbon heating had been poor value for money and did not deliver its aims. The public accounts committee said the renewable heat incentive had “wildly optimistic” goals and that the government failed to understand what consumers wanted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/belgian-clown-kevin-lapeire-livestreams-rooftop-police-standoff","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T14:52:45Z","webTitle":"Belgian clown accused of murder livestreams rooftop police standoff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/belgian-clown-kevin-lapeire-livestreams-rooftop-police-standoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/belgian-clown-kevin-lapeire-livestreams-rooftop-police-standoff","fields":{"headline":"Belgian clown accused of murder livestreams rooftop police standoff","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of Belgium’s leading children’s entertainers broadcast himself live on Facebook during a rooftop standoff with armed police before being arrested over the alleged murder of his former girlfriend. Kevin Lapeire, who appeared on Belgium’s Got Talent and won an award for the best clown in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, waved a pistol and threw a gas canister at police before finally surrendering. The 31-year-old, who entertained children in hospitals under the pseudonym Doctor Aspirin and managed the careers of 15 other entertainers, had separated from his partner a few days before. She was named in local media only as Caroline D, 47. The couple had three children. Lapeire – one of only five professional clowns in Belgium – is alleged to have visited the family home in Oudenberg, a town between Ostend and Bruges, on Sunday night, which was Mother’s Day in Belgium. He allegedly tied up and gagged their children, aged 12, 15 and 17, and left them in an attic before killing their mother in the garage with a knife, according to Belgian news reports. Officials at the children’s school were not aware of anything untoward on Monday morning as Lapeire reportedly had called in to say they would be late. He had also sent a text to his former partner’s employer. On Monday afternoon, Lapeire was spotted on top of a 13-storey apartment building in Bredene, close to his parents’ home, waving a pistol. He broadcast himself on Facebook Live as he threw a gas canister from the roof, and starting firing into the sky. Lapeire surrendered four hours later to police snipers, throwing down his coat, pulling his sweater over his head and placing his hands in the air."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/shortcuts/2018/may/16/what-are-all-these-gdpr-emails-filling-up-your-inbox","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T15:55:00Z","webTitle":"What are all these GDPR emails filling up your inbox?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/may/16/what-are-all-these-gdpr-emails-filling-up-your-inbox","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/may/16/what-are-all-these-gdpr-emails-filling-up-your-inbox","fields":{"headline":"What are all these GDPR emails filling up your inbox?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘Hey there Field Left Blank. So listen, budski, my man, my main man ... I know we’ve been sending you spammy emails about cheap holiday deals five days a week. For the last five years. Yeah, maybe we took a few liberties with that. Mistakes were made. IDK. But I’m here, today, to tell you we value you as a customer, Field Left Blank. So .... um, was wondering, would you be interested in maybe opting in? Please. Please?” So goes every third email in your inbox this week, as a change in the law heads towards its final 24 May deadline, with even such well-established email beggars as the Guardian getting in on the act. But what exactly is GDPR? The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the EU’s biggest personal data shake-up since 1995. And the US tech giants are not exempt, which is why Facebook quietly decided to move 70% of its global users’ data back from its Irish headquarters to the US, outside the reach of GDPR. The regulation has been billed as a gamechanger in rebalancing consumer rights. The emails are the front door to that. Companies that have an “existing relationship” and valid consent with you might not need to reaffirm consent (there’s a measure of grey here), but all those half-dormant relationships are about to get a massive spring clean. Click the opt-in button, or hear only silence, for ever. With opt-in rates apparently running at about 10%, many companies are resorting to prizes or draws to incentivise those consumer clicks. From 25 May, pre-ticked boxes can no longer be used to indicate consent to a company’s terms and conditions. Plus, a request for consent cannot be buried under pages and pages of terms. You can request a copy of any personal information held, and you can ask a company to delete all the data they have on you. The law also promises users “data portability”, which is designed to force operators to allow you to take your old data to the new company you prefer, preventing lock-in. If it works (many are sceptical), it could hugely boost competition, loosening the vast data monopolies of the big players. After a phase of hacks against everyone from LinkedIn to Ashley Madison, regulators have demanded “pseudonymisation” or “tokenisation” of user accounts. Meaning that even if user data leaks, it shouldn’t be personally identifiable. It might be good for the consumer, but businesses are already grumbling about the cost of enforcement, with companies of more than 250 employees required to hire a data protection officer. That may prove to be money well spent. The maximum fine for non-compliance with the new rules is €20m (it was £500,000 under the old system) or 4% of annual global turnover – whichever is bigger."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/16/stan-lee-sues-former-company-for-1bn-in-damages","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T19:35:57Z","webTitle":"Stan Lee sues former company for $1bn in damages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/16/stan-lee-sues-former-company-for-1bn-in-damages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/16/stan-lee-sues-former-company-for-1bn-in-damages","fields":{"headline":"Stan Lee sues former company for $1bn in damages","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Famed Marvel superhero creator Stan Lee is seeking more than $1bn (£740m) in damages from his former company POW! Entertainment, alleging that he was tricked into signing a document giving away rights to use his name and likeness. The comic-book legend, who is 95, is suing POW!, its co-founder Gill Champion and CEO Shane Duffy, alleging they brokered a “sham deal” to sell POW! to a China-based company, Camsing. Duffy is also the vice president of Camsing Entertainment. The lawsuit also claims Champion and Duffy “conspired ... to fraudulently steal Lee’s “identity, name, image and likeness as part of a nefarious scheme to benefit financially at [his] expense”. The claim states that since 2015 Lee has been suffering from advanced macular degeneration, meaning he has been unable to read or drive on his own. The deal with Camsing went through when Lee’s wife of almost 70 years, Joan Lee, was dying, say his lawyers, and the comics writer was “in a state of total devastation”. “Duffy and Champion were incentivised to get a deal between POW! and Camsing done because each of them would benefit financially,” claims the suit, and that the pair “never disclosed the actual terms of the deal to Lee before closing it”. Lee, it is argued, would not have knowingly signed a document providing the exclusive right to use his identity. “Lee did not even grant an exclusive licence to his identity, image, name and likeness to the Walt Disney Company in a multibillion dollar deal, let alone give his name and likeness away for free to a company in China,” says the lawsuit, going on to allege that his signature on a document doing so was either forged, or that he was tricked into signing it, believing it to be another document. The lawsuit, filed in California, also says that POW! took control of Lee’s personal social media accounts, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. On 13 May, Lee’s Twitter account bore the message: “Today was the first day I ever did a tweet myself. Before today, my account was done by others. I still do not have control of my Facebook. Someone else is doing it, NOT me.” On Tuesday, he posted a video to fans thanking them for their support, and tweeted: “Help! Someone has hijacked my Facebook and Instagram. I want everyone to know whoever is writing them is a fraud and is impersonating me. How do I get them back? Can you guys help?” The suit comes one month after Lee posted an emotional video online in response to allegations that he was the victim of elder abuse at the hands of his daughter, JC Lee. In April, the Hollywood Reporter published a notarised document dated 13 February 2018 and purportedly signed by Lee, that contained claims his daughter had been verbally abusive to him. In a video, Lee called the document’s contents “totally incorrect, inaccurate, misleading and insulting”, but his then-attorney Tom Lallas alleged he had gone through the document with Lee “word by word, line by line”. In a statement to the Guardian, POW! Entertainment said: “We have seen the copy of Mr Lee’s complaint posted on Deadline Hollywood. The allegations are completely without merit. In particular, the notion that Mr Lee did not knowingly grant POW! exclusive rights to his creative works or his identity is so preposterous that we have to wonder whether Mr Lee is personally behind this lawsuit. There is no question Mr Lee – who, along with his daughter, was and remains a substantial POW! shareholder – clearly understood the terms of the agreements he signed. The evidence, which includes Mr Lee’s subsequent statements and conduct, is overwhelming and we look forward to presenting it in court.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/16/the-fiver-everton-sam-allardyce-west-ham-david-moyes-england-world-cup-squad-a-lively-one-if-you-were-asking","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T14:56:14Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Thousands gambol, cavort, frolic and prance all around Merseyside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/16/the-fiver-everton-sam-allardyce-west-ham-david-moyes-england-world-cup-squad-a-lively-one-if-you-were-asking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/16/the-fiver-everton-sam-allardyce-west-ham-david-moyes-england-world-cup-squad-a-lively-one-if-you-were-asking","fields":{"headline":"Thousands gambol, cavort, frolic and prance all around Merseyside","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A BRAND NEW DAY Under normal circumstances, the announcement of the England squad for Russia would be our lead story. But Tranmere have just been promoted back to the Football League, while Liverpool are in the final of Big Cup. So it’s only fair that Evertonians should get the chance to trumpet some good news too. And they finally have some, as thousands gambol, cavort, frolic and prance all around Merseyside, to the tune of A Brand New Day from The Wiz, in celebration of Sam Allardyce’s sacking. Now admittedly England only name a World Cup squad once every four years, while lately Everton have been binning managers at such a lick, they’re in danger of making Mike Walker’s stint look like the era of Harry Catterick. But folk at Goodison have been really suffering for the last five months, give them their moment will you. They deserve this. Yes, on Wednesday morning Big Sam was bundled out of the door marked Do One and sent bouncing down the road on the seat of his trousers. He came to a halt on the corner of Gwladys Street and Bullens Road, not far from the stadium’s trade exit, which was just as well as he’d left something in his desk. “You forgot this!” screamed majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, launching what appeared to be a large tin bucket down the street. As it deflected off Big Sam’s noggin with a dull clank, it became clear in the bright morning sun of a glorious new epoch that it was in fact his personal silver jigger. Sam – whose 24-match interregnum gives Ronald Koeman that Thomas H McIntosh sheen – sighed, upturned the bespoke beverage-measuring device, and sat on it to sulk awhile in the style of Oor Wullie. Help Sam’s boab! “Sam was brought in at a challenging time last season to provide us with some stability and we are grateful to him for doing that,” began a statement later issued by Everton’s incoming chief suit, Professor Denise Barrett-Baxendale MBE, whose stately handle registers an impressive 8.7 on The Fiver’s patented Sir Chips Keswick-o-meter. “However, we have made the decision that, as part of our longer-term plan, we will be appointing a new manager this summer and will be commencing this process immediately.” That process would appear to involve reclaiming the scrunched-up bit of paper from the waste bin with Marco Silva’s name on it, and employing the man they wanted in the first place back in November, if only Watford hadn’t gotten so shirty about it. So in absence of an interesting list of alternative candidates, let’s conclude this story with a roll-call of something else: Butland (Stoke), Pickford (Everton), Pope (Burnley); Jones (Man Utd), Cahill (Chelsea), Walker (Man City), Trippier (Tottenham), Rose (Tottenham), Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Young (Man Utd), Stones (Man City), Maguire (Leicester); Dier (Tottenham), Henderson (Liverpool), Delph (Man City), Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea), Morris-Dancing Fiver (Fiver Towers), Lingard (Man Utd), Alli (Tottenham); Kane (Tottenham), Rashford (Man Utd), Vardy (Leicester), Sterling (Man City), Welbeck (Arsenal). CAN’T YOU FEEL A BRAND NEW DAY? (REPRISE) The cull of superannuated British managers continues apace: West Ham have decided against extending the contract of 2005’s David Moyes. As breaking news goes, it’s all a bit meh, given this outcome was pretty much expected back on 7 November, which was the day Moyes was given the job in the first place. Still, he kept them in the Premier League, which is an improvement on his performance at Sunderland. Sigh. It’s a long time since he could be spotted, bronzed and gleaming, swanning down the stairs of the Hotel Maria Cristina, his palatial digs in San Sebastián, isn’t it. Anyway, unlike at Everton, a long list has been cobbled together in search of a successor. And here it is: Manuel Pellegrini, Rafa Benítez, Sean Dyche, David Wagner and Paulo Fonseca of Shakhtar Donetsk. Good luck, Gollivan! Good luck, everyone!

I first met Sinclair at the Faculty of the Psychology of Older People conference in Birmingham in 2000, where he was giving a talk on frontotemporal dementia. This was in the days before PowerPoint and Sinclair was struggling with a projector, but it quickly became apparent that he was more than able to talk about the subject without the slides. His expertise was recognised by the faculty, which forms part of the Division of Clinical Psychology of the British Psychological Society. He was made editor of Psychology of Older People: The FPOP Bulletin (2004-07) and chair of the FPOP (2007-09). There will be a Sinclair Lough memorial lecture at this year’s FPOP conference at Churchill College, Cambridge, on 2 July, delivered by Professor John Hodges, on frontotemporal dementia. Born in Glasgow, Sinclair was the son of Anne (nee Gourlay) and Samuel Lough. He and his sister grew up in Glenrothes, Fife, where he went to high school, before heading to Edinburgh University to study for a BSc in biology (psychology), then a PhD (1982). Following postdoctoral research at the Medical Research Council’s applied psychology unit in Cambridge, Sinclair obtained his clinical qualification from the University of Leicester (1989). He returned to Cambridge to work for the health authority and Addenbrooke’s hospital as a clinical psychologist until 2003. His final role there was as head of services for older people. After separating from his first wife, Fiona, a physiotherapist, Sinclair moved to Dorchester as head of Dorset’s clinical psychology service for older people. There he met Pam White, who was running the library services. Sinclair had previously suffered from cancer, which returned. He continued to work, but did the things that were important to him, such as travelling and asking Pam to marry him. They wanted me to perform the ceremony, so I was ordained over the internet and the marriage took place in 2007 in Topanga Canyon, in Pam’s home state of California. Sinclair took medical retirement two years ago and moved to Herne Bay, Kent. He was soon working again, as a locum and as an inspector for the Care Quality Commission. At the time of his death, Sinclair was due to relocate with Pam to Hawaii.

Biggleswade Common has form: at the turn of the millennium, a detectorist unearthed a gold Saxon coin there that fetched a third of a million pounds at auction. Dawn Lawrence sent me in search of more riches, with precise instructions that took me across the road from the bulk of the common to an offshoot of the meadows that I had not even realised was open public land. A week after my first visit, I swung back the kissing gate to find this newly discovered meadow both unchanged and transformed. Even though it was still a dazzling sight, the yellow remembered sea of buttercups seemed more unevenly spread: they were absent from the damp hollow of an ancient dew pond, absent from the raised mounds of anthills past and present, and inexplicably scarce or abundant elsewhere. Each buttercup was a determined sunseeker, tilting its head at a precise angle to catch its rays. Piercing shafts seared the insides of each bowl of petals to give them a molten heart. The tubular flowers of cowslips had shrunk, hermit-crab-like, into their seedheads, whereas mats of speedwell glowed blue and brilliant. Understated, umbelliferous pignut was more evident than before, and so too its understorey of near-prostrate field woodrush. Random drifts of meadow saxifrage on the slopes and dips caught my eye with their snow-white, pleasingly rounded petals. Low-crowned common daisies are white-petalled too, but only in our imagination – within that galaxy of wild flowers, they showed off the exquisite extra detail of petal tips dipped in lipstick pink. Whitest and brightest of all, by dint of sheer quantity, were the may blossoms, tumbling out of the scattered hawthorn bushes, spray on spray sending heady wafts of vanilla scent into the air. During the intervening week, a small herd of bullocks had been brought on to graze the common. I found them bunched nervously in and around the stream at the very back, cowering behind the bushes as if afraid to show their doleful faces.

The announcement came after Novartis was dragged into the scandal over Cohen’s payment of $130,000 to US adult film actor Stormy Daniels just days before the 2016 presidential election. US special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the payments as a strand of his wider investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and allegations of collusion and obstruction of justice by the Trump campaign. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, who has stated she prefers to go by her stage name rather than her real name of Stephanie Clifford, more than a decade ago. But one of the newest members of Trump’s legal team, former federal prosecutor and New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, has acknowledged the US president reimbursed Cohen for the hush money. Last week, Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti wrote on Twitter that Novartis and US telecoms giant AT&amp;T had used the services of Cohen’s firm Essential Consultants – the same company used to make the payment to Daniels. Cohen is currently under federal investigation in New York, separately from the Mueller investigation but triggered by advice from the special counsel. On 9 May, Novartis said it had signed a one-year contract for $100,000 a month with Cohen’s firm in February 2017, seeking advice on the new administration’s public health policy. Following a meeting with Cohen, the company changed its mind, although Novartis was contractually obliged to pay Cohen the full $1.2m. Telecoms giant AT&amp;T, which has acknowledged paying about $600,000 to Cohen and was also named by Daniels’ lawyer, has also said it was a “big mistake” to hire Trump’s lawyer, even as it maintained its actions were legal. On Wednesday, Novartis’s general counsel Feliz Ehrat apologised for making the deal in the first place. “Although the contract was legally in order, it was an error. As a co-signatory with our former CEO, I take personal responsibility to bring the public debate on this matter to an end,” Ehrat said in a statement issued by the firm. Novartis has insisted that its current chief executive, Vas Narasimhan, was “in no way involved” with the agreement with Cohen’s firm, which pre-dated his leadership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/21/breaking-the-silence-are-we-getting-better-at-talking-about-death","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"Breaking the silence: are we getting better at talking about death?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/21/breaking-the-silence-are-we-getting-better-at-talking-about-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/21/breaking-the-silence-are-we-getting-better-at-talking-about-death","fields":{"headline":"Breaking the silence: are we getting better at talking about death?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bereavement is ragged.

Death is the most private and personal of our acts, our own solitariness is total at the moment of departure. But the ways in which we talk about death, the registers of our expressions of grief or our silences about the process of dying are part of a complex public space. Some are explorations of the rituals of mourning, how an amplification of loss in the company of others – the connection to others’ grief – can allow a voicing of what you might not be able to voice yourself. The actor and writer Natasha Gordon’s play about her familial Jamaican extended wake, Nine Night, is coming to the end of a successful run at the National Theatre. The nine nights of the wake are a theatre of remembrance, a highly codified period of time shaped to allow the deceased to leave the family. Julia Samuel records in Grief Works, her remarkable book of stories of bereavement, a woman who “asked friends and family to sit shiva [the Jewish mourning tradition] with me at a certain time and place”. And that there was anguish when these particular times were ignored: two friends came at times that were “convenient for them rather than when she was sitting shiva, thus ‘raising all the issues I was temporarily trying to keep contained’”. As an academic writes in the accompanying notes to artist Taryn Simon’s performance An Occupation of Loss, recently staged in London, “communication between the living and the dead is possible only in mediated forms”. There are obligations we have to fulfil to those who have died. Simon gathered professional mourners from 15 countries (Ghana, Cambodia, Armenia and Ecuador, among others). The mourners wailed and sobbed and keened, the intensity of their expression, their sheer volume, a challenge to the idea that there has to be a silence that surrounds bereavement. There are silences. Contemporary books on death often take as their premise that to be writing in the first place is a breaking of a taboo. “It’s time to talk about dying,” writes Kathryn Mannix in her book about her work in palliative care, With the End in Mind. “There are only two days with fewer than 24 hours in each lifetime, sitting like bookmarks astride our lives: one is celebrated every year, yet it is the other that makes us see living as precious.” These books record the silence that we in the west have created. By removing dying into a medical context, where expertise and knowledge lie so emphatically with others, we have made death unusual, a process clouded by incomprehension. And by novelty. So one kind of language we need is that of clarity. A lucidity that allows for the involvement of family and friends alongside healthcare professionals. Clarity, writes Mannix, around the questions such as “when does a treatment that was begun to save a life become an interference that is simply prolonging death? People who are found to be dying despite the best efforts of a hospital admission can only express a choice if the hospital is clear about their outlook.” Conversations about palliative care need extraordinary skill and empathy. These are skills that can be learned. But for someone writing about their own grief, there are no guidelines. You might have read Thomas Browne’s Urn Burial, or the poems of John Donne, the theories of John Bowlby or Donald Winnicott, Freud’s Mourning and Melancholia, but it simply doesn’t register. Being well read doesn’t help when someone who matters dies. Part of this attempt to start again, to find a form out of the formlessness of grief, is a reluctance to take on the generic language of sympathy, the homogeneous effect of cliche. Bereavement is bereavement, not a masterclass in being well read in the classics. “The death of a loved one is also the death of a private, whole, personal and unique culture, with its own special language and its own secret, and it will never be again, nor will there be another like it,” writes David Grossman in Falling Out of Time, his novel about the death of his son. A death needs a special language. The language of loss and the framing of sympathy in everyday life is so impoverished, so mired in cliche and euphemism, that deep metaphors of “passing” become thinned to nothing, to sentimentality. The iterations of “losing the battle” and the valorising, endlessly, of “courage” is a way of making the bereaved feel they need to enact a particular role. And then there is the “being strong”. If you are told how wonderful you are for not showing emotion, or for continuing as before, where does that leave being scared? How about denial? Or anger, terror, desolation, loneliness? How about confusion? Why only endurance, resilience, strength? In this need to name, to find precision, accuracy is a measure of love. I think of Marion Coutts’ book The Iceberg, on her dying husband Tom Lubbock’s language, Joan Didion’s The Year of Magical Thinking, charting everything, weighing her responses to her grief. This is different, they say, writing this is a work of mourning. The greatest of these books find a language that encompasses the sheer confusion of bereavement. In her forthcoming book Everyday Madness: On Grief, Anger, Loss and Love, Lisa Appignanesi writes that “Death, like desire, tears you out of your recognisable self. It tears you apart. That you was all mixed up with the other. And both of you have disappeared. The I who speaks, like the I who tells this story, is no longer reliable.” This is the other loss, that of selfhood, of control, of a forward momentum, of certainty. Appignanesi’s grief at the untimeliness of her husband’s death makes time itself deranged. Her days and weeks and months go awry. Her sense of the past is also called into question. It is excoriating: “My lived past, which had been lived as a double act, had been ransacked, stolen.” Bereavement, she notes, has a deep etymology of plunder. It tears you apart. Where all these registers go wrong, you oscillate between kinds of behaviour that are disinhibited, a derangement of self. It can be physical, a falling, a losing your way. I think of the crow in Max Porter’s Grief Is the Thing with Feathers as the deranged, ransacking presence in a family where the mother has died. These are images that go deep into history. In the Book of Lamentations we read that God “has made me dwell in darkness … he has walled me in and I cannot break out … He has weighed me down with chains … He has made my path a maze … He has forced me off my way and mangled me.” The Hebrew word eikh (how) opens the Book of Lamentations and then reappears throughout the text. This how is not a question, more a bewildered exhortation. You are beyond questions. All you can do is repeat. In Anne Carson’s poem Nox, a response to the death of her brother, she refused to accept any conventional form. So the poem comes like a box, a casket, of fragments, attempts at definitions, parts of memories. This seems appropriate. The shape of grief is different each time. That is why the shard – the pieces of broken pottery that are ubiquitous across all cultures – is often used as an expressive image of loss. Think of Job lamenting to God, sitting on a pile of broken shards. In my own practice as a potter, whenever I pick up pieces of a dropped vessel I notice that each shard has its own particularity. Each hurts. In her study of the deaths of writers, The Violet Hour, Katie Roiphe writes that “moving on, as a concept, is for stupid people, because any sensible person knows grief is a long-term project. I refuse to rush. The pain that is thrust upon us let no man slow or speed or fix.” Bereavement takes a pathway that is different for each and every one of us. It takes different registers, different words. And that is what I take away from this very particular nine months of reading and reflecting on mortality. That there is change in the public space around death. This change is remarkable and wonderful when it comes to end-of-life care: the hospice movement and the training in palliative care are one of the greatest and most compassionate changes to occur in the last 30 years. And, more slowly, it is happening outside the hospitals and clinics and hospices. People do want to read and talk about grief. For this we have to be grateful to those writers who are trying to find their own shard-like languages to express their own bereavements. • Edmund de Waal will deliver the Wellcome book prize lecture Memory and Memorial: Writing About the End of Life at Hay festival on 30 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/16/freddie-mercury-biopic-trailer-queen-bohemian-rhapsody-queerwash","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T14:30:42Z","webTitle":"Freddie Mercury biopic trailer: killer Queen or queerwashed cop-out?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/16/freddie-mercury-biopic-trailer-queen-bohemian-rhapsody-queerwash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/16/freddie-mercury-biopic-trailer-queen-bohemian-rhapsody-queerwash","fields":{"headline":"Freddie Mercury biopic trailer: killer Queen or queerwashed cop-out?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Is this the real trailer? Is this just fantasy? A film once caught in a landslide, after disagreements with cast (Sacha Baron Cohen departed acrimoniously) and crew (director Bryan Singer was fired earlier this year), looks like it has finally managed to get back on track. And here to prove it is a shiny Queen-approved trailer, which would appear to belie Freddie Mercury’s assertion that there’s “no escape from reality”. When Baron Cohen quit the film, he made sure to shoot it in the foot, by going public with the fact that certain people wanted the film to be more about the great successes of the still very current band Queen than about the extraordinary and non-PG-friendly life of the guy who was their frontman before Adam Lambert. The trailer would seem to support his claims. It opens on footage of Freddie Mercury in concert at various moments in his career with Queen, singing a call-and-response refrain that’s chanted back to him by a rapturous audience. There’s no opportunity to focus particularly on the face of Rami Malek as Mercury in these opening moments: we’re in the business of witnessing the guy as rock star, in a quickly spliced montage with lots of costume changes, waving arms and our first glimpse, on the drumkit, of the word “Queen”, which will appear a grand total of five times in the trailer. Next we get a change of music, title cards, and our second look at the word “Queen”, this time in glossy closeup. At this point, I don’t know about you but I’m beginning to get the distinct impression that Freddie Mercury may have been in Queen. The trailer then merges into a mashup of Bohemian Rhapsody and Another One Bites the Dust, over a succession of images including a sexy exchange of looks between Freddie Mercury and a woman in the audience, whom we see again near him a couple of frames later. A glancing touch of hands between Mercury and a man follows a little later still. Quick gender recap at the 0:30 mark: women two, men one. Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go. A caption comes up in big letters – this is going to be good. “The Only Thing… More Extraordinary … Than Their Music … Is His Story” More extraordinary than? Surely that should be “as extraordinary as”. The montage ends, and there follows some guff about the writing of the song Bohemian Rhapsody, which we are told contains an operatic section (in the only line in the trailer spoken by Freddie Mercury) and is over six minutes long, which proves displeasing to a music executive. A band member who isn’t Brian May or Freddie Mercury (Dave … Bridges? Mike … Benton? Alan … Jones?) makes a 4/10, heterosexist wisecrack at the boring exec, then the trailer is back on music business, closing out with the Brian May-written We Will Rock You, in order to signal to the audience that Queen will rock us. To misquote Freddie Mercury: do stop this now, I’m having such a bad time. Not a word of dialogue is spoken in the trailer that doesn’t pertain to the music of Queen: nothing of Mercury’s love life, no illness, no emotion, nothing dangerous or overtly queer to offend anyone. To quote Brian May: big disgrace! The whole thing has the flavour of something strenuously queerwashed, which has removed everything wild and interesting about Mercury. This trailer would appear to presage a film with no interest in sounding the ambiguities of his life, the abrasive queerness of his perspective, the virulence of the homophobic press in their attacks on him – what, in a word, made him tick. If the film remains true to this trailer, it represents a truly tragic lost opportunity to celebrate an ambiguous and excitingly transgressive figure, whose tragically short life was filled with incident. Mercury deserves to be celebrated as a queer icon quite beyond the machismo and daddishness of Queen fandom. From his origins as a Parsi man of colour to his underexamined private life, via his struggle with Aids at the height of the epidemic that claimed so many LGBTQ lives, we need to know more about this figure. Not for nothing has Bryan Fuller already attacked the film for these seeming omissions. On the other hand, there is a proud tradition in the queer community of reclaiming cultural artefacts such as this, and the film could become a true camp classic a la Mommie Dearest, with queer audiences screaming along to all the bowdlerised bits. We await it with feverish excitement. • This article was amended on 17 May 2018.

Each insect species has a calendar slot for emerging from hibernation. For many bees good timing ensures that they emerge when their favourite flowers are opening. For the chocolate mining bee (Andrena scotica), a large, shiny, dark bee that nests in Benefield lawns and banks, success is awaking when the blackthorn blossom bursts. The thaw triggered an explosion of flowers and insects that in warmer years would have emerged in March and early April, all arrived at once. My car windscreen accrued a sparse smattering of ex-insect life, and others reported similar. It is odd to celebrate pointless high-speed fatalities, but they represent an echo of the richer aerial plankton of past decades, and thereby a flicker of hope for the future. Our chocolate mining bees are accompanied by flavous nomad bees (Nomada flava), not that it is immediately obvious that these animals are bees. Nomad bees have shiny, waspy, yellow-striped abdomens and their orange-brown bodies are not conspicuously hairy. Only under the microscope do the branched hairs, the feature that separates bees from their wasp ancestors, become apparent. Just as the cuckoo lays her eggs in the nests of certain birds, so the nomad bee lays her eggs in the nests of particular bees. The chocolate mining bee will dig a deep burrow in loose, open soil, into which she stores balls of nectar-laden pollen on which she deposits an egg. The task of the flavous nomad bee is to sneak in and also lay an egg on the pollen. When the two eggs hatch, the nomad’s sickle-shaped jaws make short work of the mining bee larva. The complex fine attunement of parasites is amazing, and a few years ago I enthusiastically explained the lifestyles of mining and nomad bees to an attentive three-year-old as we peered at bees swirling around burrows in a dry lawn. I returned a little later to find him with a hammer and a jam jar containing dozens of mangled nomad bees, recipients of summary justice.

Beginning the debate in the island’s parliament, Gavin St Pier argued that increasing rights of autonomy and self-determination – including choosing one’s manner and time of death – was the “right thing to do”. He called for Guernsey to follow the example of US states such as Oregon, where adults with mental capacity and who have only six months to live are able to opt for assisted dying. Should the 40-strong parliament, called the States of Deliberation, back the proposal, a detailed consultation will be carried out. The Channel island would become the only place in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying if the bill passes into law. As a British crown dependency, Guernsey makes its own laws. St Pier’s proposal is a requête, which is similar to a private member’s bill in Westminster. There were demonstrations from groups both in favour of and against assisted dying at the start of the debate, which is likely to carry on into Thursday and even Friday. There were howls of protest from supporters of assisted dying when one member of the parliament, deputy Jan Kuttelwascher, confronted them: “If you want to kill yourself you can do so now. I just don’t agree with the idea of involving a third party, who happens to be a medical practitioner.” He added: “There’s a number of people I’d love to assist in dying, but they’d object.” The start of the debate, which is being watched around the world, was more sober. St Pier said: “We have medicalised the dying process. Very few of us will experience a natural death. Most of us will have a managed death. In most cases there will be a point in which healthcare providers will make key decisions on our behalf with or without prior input from our families or ourselves. One of those decisions may have an impact on the time of our deaths.” He added: “It is often said that this is an immensely complex moral, ethical and legal issue. But at its heart is a very simple principle – that of autonomy and the right to self-determination.” St Pier said laws around divorce, same-sex marriage and contraception had given people more right to self-determination. Each change had been resisted and branded a “slippery slope”. “Increased rights of autonomy and self-determination is self evidently the right thing to do even if we disagree with the choices made and never choose to exercise those rights ourselves. So it is with assisted dying.” If euthanasia is made legal in Guernsey, the move is likely to reignite the debate in the UK, three years after Westminster MPs decisively rejected a bill that would have allowed doctors to help terminally-ill people end their lives. Similar legislation to that in Oregon has been passed in six other US states, as well as in Canada and the Australian state of Victoria. New Zealand is also considering legislation. The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have more permissive laws, based on applicants’ suffering but not requiring a terminal diagnosis. If the law is passed, there would be a report and further votes before assisted dying became legal, with the process probably taking at least three years, according to St Pier. Any law would need privy council approval and, possibly, legislative change in Westminster to avoid medical professionals practising in Guernsey being prosecuted under UK law. Opposition to the proposal has been led by churches, the British Medical Association and the Guernsey Disabilities Alliance. In his speech to parliament St Pier also mentioned the case of Noel Conway, from Shrewsbury, who has motor neurone disease and has been fighting in the UK for the right to enlist help from doctors to bring about a “peaceful and dignified” death. Care for Life Guernsey, rebutted St Pier’s arguments from outside the chamber in a string of tweets. It said the most important issue was that assisted suicide would hurt those whose physical or mental condition leaves them the least autonomous. The group said: “Even if ... public opinion is in favour of assisted suicide, a lot of people have historically been in favour of death penalty too, at least for extreme violence. This is never argument for legalisation.” During the debate, deputy Jane Stephens called assisted dying “a most extreme measure”. She said: “I would far rather our island be celebrated for the excellent palliative care than the provider of assisted dying, assisted suicide or euthanasia. There are no safeguards that I can think of that are safe enough.” Supporting assisted dying, deputy Rhian Tooley spoke about her own mother’s plight. “She does not cling to life, it has snagged her,” she said. “It is not death which is undignified, but living after what you love in life is stripped away.” The debate continues on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/16/syria-chlorine-probably-used-in-attack-on-saraqeb-opcw-chemical-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T12:37:30Z","webTitle":"Syria: chlorine probably used in attack on Saraqeb – OPCW","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/syria-chlorine-probably-used-in-attack-on-saraqeb-opcw-chemical-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/16/syria-chlorine-probably-used-in-attack-on-saraqeb-opcw-chemical-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Syria: chlorine probably used in attack on Saraqeb – OPCW","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An investigation by the chemical weapons watchdog has found that chlorine is likely to have been used in an attack on a Syrian town in February. In what is likely to be seen as a dry run for a more controversial report later this month, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found that the February attack on the neighbourhood of Saraqeb was caused by the dropping of two cylinders that had contained chlorine on to a field in the town. The OPCW is to report soon on whether chemical weapons were used on a larger-scale attack in Douma, eastern Ghouta, in May. Aspects of the evidence gathered at Saraqeb and Douma are very similar, weapons experts said. The OPCW does not have the power to attribute responsibility for attacks, and the UN body that did have the power to attribute blame has been closed after Russia used its veto to block the renewal of its mandate. Russia will not allow the mandate to be renewed unless the UN security council – on which Russia has a veto – is empowered to reject or endorse the body’s findings. Moscow has also become increasingly critical of the OPCW’s neutrality and working methods, especially after its experts found that a military-grade nerve agent had been deployed in the Salisbury attack on Russian former double-agent Sergei Skripal. The fact-finding mission by the OPCW on the Saraqeb attack determined that “chlorine was released from cylinders by mechanical impact on 4 February,” it said on Wednesday. The team’s conclusions were based on finding two cylinders that were determined as previously containing chlorine. In addition, the OPCW said environmental samples had demonstrated the unusual presence of chlorine in the local environment. Its team had also interviewed witnesses, and found that a number of patients at medical facilities shortly after the incident showed signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to chlorine. The incident is by no means the worst chemical weapons attack during the seven-year civil war, but it led to 11 people being treated for breathing difficulties. Western observers said the use of helicopters in the attack suggested Syrian government involvement since the opposition did not have access to helicopters. The Syrian government produced a three-page denial of responsibility, and failed to answer a further set of OPCW questions sent on 14 March. In a brief statement Ahmet Üzümcü, the head of OPCW, said: “I strongly condemn the use of toxic chemicals as weapons by anyone, for any reason, and in any circumstances. Such acts contradict the unequivocal prohibition against chemical weapons.” Medics have claimed the Douma attack on 7 April led to 40 deaths. The scale of the attack prompted the UK, France and the US to mount cruise missile strikes on what it said were Syrian government chemical weapons sites. Following delays, the OPCW was allowed to access the Douma site where it gathered more than 100 environmental samples. Last month, Russia held a press conference close to the OPCW headquarters in The Hague, at which it produced witnesses that claimed no chemical weapons attack had occurred, and that any choking had been due to dust inhalation. Russia said the whole attack was faked on video footage by UK intelligence-funded Syrians. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has been working privately to bridge the differences between Russia and the west on how to reform the OPCW so that it has powers to attribute responsibility. The French government is due to hold a ministerial-level conference in Paris on Friday to build an alliance of countries determined to reconstruct an accountability mechanism for chemical weapons use, if necessary outside the confines of the UN."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/16/court-rules-against-conspiracy-theorist-in-bid-to-release-kurt-cobain-death-photos","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T12:35:18Z","webTitle":"Court rules against conspiracy theorist in bid to release Kurt Cobain death photos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/16/court-rules-against-conspiracy-theorist-in-bid-to-release-kurt-cobain-death-photos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/16/court-rules-against-conspiracy-theorist-in-bid-to-release-kurt-cobain-death-photos","fields":{"headline":"Court rules against conspiracy theorist in bid to release Kurt Cobain death photos","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Seattle court has ruled that photographs from the scene of Kurt Cobain’s death will remain sealed from the public. In 2014, conspiracy theorist Richard Lee had sued the city over the release of the images, believing them to support his long-held view that Cobain was killed by government officials. Cobain’s death on 5 April 1994 was ruled suicide. Court documents state that the images depict “Cobain’s body as it lay in the family residence after he was shot in the head”. The court of appeals ruled in favour of Cobain’s widow, Courtney Love, and daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, who had sought a ruling “permanently enjoining the City from disclosing, disseminating, releasing, or distributing any death-scene photographs not previously disclosed”, the Blast reports. Lee lost his original suit in 2015 and filed an appeal in 2017. Cobain’s next of kin have previously testified in the case. Love has described his death as “the most traumatic experience of my life. It left me physically distraught, and I continue to suffer emotionally from the loss of my husband to this day.” His daughter testified that she had no memory of her father, but “has had to deal with the trauma of his death her entire life”. In April 2016, Love gave a statement accusing Lee of trying to exploit Cobain’s death, which he claims to have been investigating for more than 23 years. Love claimed that Lee “stalked and harassed me, my family and my friends for many, many years … On one particular occasion, Mr Lee even filmed himself chasing a limousine for several miles that he thought I was a passenger in. Mr Lee’s actions make me fear for my safety.” Seattle police have previously made available photographs of the gun that Cobain used to kill himself along with less explicit photographs of the death scene and its aftermath. On the 20th anniversary of Cobain’s death in 2014, detective Mike Ciesynski reviewed the case files and said he found no new information to change the police conclusion that Cobain took his own life. He did find four rolls of undeveloped film from the suicide scene. After releasing two of the images in 2014, police released 34 additional photographs taken at the scene following numerous public disclosure requests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/16/burberry-posts-rise-in-profits-revitalisation-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T10:28:38Z","webTitle":"Burberry profits from 'belt bag' and Christopher Bailey swan song","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/16/burberry-posts-rise-in-profits-revitalisation-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/16/burberry-posts-rise-in-profits-revitalisation-plan","fields":{"headline":"Burberry profits from 'belt bag' and Christopher Bailey swan song","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The success of an expensive new Burberry handbag and an acclaimed final collection from Christopher Bailey helped the British brand beat analysts’ expectations as it posted a 5% rise in annual profits. The improvement in performance came after Bailey received rave notices for a rainbow-hued collection in February and Burberry launched a casual fashion collaboration with the hip Russian designer Gosha Rubchinskiy. The new design chief, Riccardo Tisci, will present his first collection this autumn. Bailey’s swan song as chief creative officer coincided with an improved domestic performance towards the end of the financial year as pretax profits rose to £413m in the 12 months to 31 March and revenues rose 2% to £2.66bn. Marco Gobbetti, the chief executive of Burberry, who took over the leadership role from Bailey last year, said his strategy to revitalise the brand was showing “promising early signs”. He said buyers would now be tempted with much more frequent productions of new designs throughout the year. Gobbetti has pledged to make Burberry more luxurious by introducing products at higher price points. One of the first experiments in that strategy appears to have gone well. Sales of the brand’s new “belt bag”, which sells for up to £1,790 – the upper end of the price spectrum for Burberry apart from bags in specialist leathers such as alligator or python – had been “encouraging”. “It can become a classic,” Gobbetti said. Mamequa Boafo, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: “Reigniting consumer appetite for the British luxury fashion house is ever more important in order to hold its appeal … The wider trading backdrop remains challenging.” Shares in Burberry closed up 3.6% at £18.68p. Gobbetti said that Bailey had left the company with an “incredible legacy” and that his last collection had been “very strong”. The company more than doubled sales per item from Bailey’s final catwalk collection, although this was partly because it cut the number of items available immediately after the show. Bestsellers included a vintage check cap and a rainbow check tote bag. Gobbetti said Bailey’s full final collection would go into shops over the summer. But the company admitted that its profit margins had taken a hit in the second half of the year as it set aside an additional £14m to cover clearing old stock designed by Bailey and his team before the first collection by Tisci. The future of another Bailey-led project, the set-up of a new £50m trench coat factory in Leeds, also remains unclear. The company declined to comment on whether the facility would go ahead as Gobbetti said Burberry’s existing factories in Castleford and Keighley in Yorkshire were “critical services” for the company. Last week, Burberry announced the acquisition of Italian leather goods manufacturer CF&amp;P, a long-term partner, which Gobbetti said gave control of key skills such as pattern cutting and product development. He hinted that Burberry would look for vertical integration in other “strategic areas”, but added “We don’t think of controlling a certain percentage of production directly.” On Wednesday Burberry joined Nike, H&amp;M and Gap in signing up to an initiative that aims to improve the industry’s record on sustainability after a study found that less than 1% of clothing is recycled.

Inquiries by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman revealed that councils were paying special guardians at less than the legal rate, often incorrectly calculating allowances, then changing and cutting them without consultation. After one case investigated by the ombudsman, a local authority agreed to make backdated payments to more than 170 carers after systematically and unlawfully underpaying them over a six-year period, despite being alerted early on to their error. Campaigners, who say the chaotic and inconsistent nature of state support too often leaves carers in poverty, welcomed the report and called on ministers to take action to ensure that councils were able to ensure that special guardians were fairly and consistently treated. “Special guardians are relatives and friends who have done the right thing by children who would otherwise be in care system … Too often local authorities ride roughshod over their and the children’s needs, taking advantage of these carers’ good nature and lack of knowledge of the system,” said Cathy Ashley, chief executive of Family Rights Group. The ombudsman, Michael King, said: “It is imperative that these children and their guardians get the right support available to them – and without having to fight the system to get what they are entitled to.” Special guardianship orders are an alternative to foster care and adoption, under which children unable to be looked after by their birth parents are legally put into the care of grandparents, older siblings or friends, often known as “kinship carers”. Around 200,000 children in the UK are looked after in this way. Councils are expected to help meet the needs of special guardians, including providing financial support, counselling and advice. They are supposed to pay means-tested allowances to carers in line with fostering fees, and meet any extra costs relating to the special needs of the cared-for child. However, the ombudsman’s report, based on 322 detailed investigations into complaints during 2017-18, two-thirds of which were upheld, has confirmed that too often councils were not only underpaying carers, but were failing to provide promised support and giving inaccurate advice. An intervention by the ombudsman forced North Tyneside council to agree to make backdated payments to at least 172 carers after it emerged that its financial support for special guardians was just 25% of the rate it paid to foster carers. It had been alerted to this breach of the law in 2011, but failed to change its policy until 2017. The council subsequently tried to limit the backdated payments to 2016, but the ombudsman successfully insisted that they be backdated to November 2013, saying that it was impossible that it could not have known of the error after this date. North Tyneside refused to say how much the total bill for back pay would be, but council documents estimate the future added cost of paying special guardians at the legal rate to be an extra £900,000 a year. A spokesperson for the council said: “We have fully revised the way in which we calculate allowances and are writing to all special guardians to explain the changes that we have made in light of the findings of the ombudsman.” Last month the government scrapped its policy of withholding benefits from kinship carers who fall foul of the two-child limit, weeks after a judge declared it to be “perverse and unlawful”. Lucy Peake, chief executive at the charity Grandparents Plus, said: “We know special guardians across the country face a postcode lottery when it comes to trying to get support from local authorities, as well as opaque policies and huge variation in practice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/16/labour-hostile-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T11:52:55Z","webTitle":"If Labour is to truly end the ‘hostile environment’, policy is just the start | Ellie Mae O’Hagan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/16/labour-hostile-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/16/labour-hostile-environment","fields":{"headline":"If Labour is to truly end the ‘hostile environment’, policy is just the start","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2013, I interviewed a Nigerian man called Isa Muazu, who had come to the UK because he was fleeing Boko Haram. He wound up at Harmondsworth immigration detention centre, where he began a three-month hunger strike. He lost vision in both eyes, experienced chest pain and shortness of breath, and eventually became too weak to sit up unaided. At the time I thought he would die alone on a mattress on the floor of his cell. In the end, he was flown to Lagos by the British government and I never heard from him again. He told me: “I have never committed any crimes; nothing like this has ever happened to me before.” A recent YouGov poll showed that the British public is mostly in favour of the “hostile environment” policies for immigrants, categorised as the requirement to show documents before accessing a GP, accepting a job, renting property or opening a bank account. Do the public also realise that Muazu’s experience is also a consequence of the hostile environment? That we lock up innocent people for indefinite periods of time and treat them worse than animals in a zoo? Only today, distressing footage emerged of Zixuan Qu, a woman who was encouraged by a British college to come here and study, being raided by six immigration officers. Qu has been waiting for the Home Office to sort her visa and has tried several ways of speeding up the process. In our names, her house was raided at 5am, and she was threatened with removal from the home she shares with her fiance. This is why Diane Abbott’s announcement that Labour will end the hostile environment is so welcome: the grotesque mix of incompetence and cruelty from the Home Office has led to the most abject and degrading treatment of migrants, ostensibly for the benefit of British people. Finally, Labour would close the detention centres that have been a stain on the national conscience for so long, rightfully recognising that people often come to this country seeking asylum because they are escaping war, violence or abuse. Labour would redirect the funds used to run detention centres to the services these asylum seekers desperately need. But the announcement should also come with political awareness. When 10 countries – including Poland, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania – joined the EU in 2004, the Labour government made little attempt to engage with the public about what the effects might be. As a result, that vacuum was filled by the rightwing press, which responded to the change in the most aggressively xenophobic way possible. Lessons must be learned from that, and now Labour – with the support of civil society – needs to join the dots for the public about what the reality of UK immigration policy has been. Alongside this announcement should come a drive to reverse the frankly rabid rhetoric that habitually accompanies debates about immigration in this country. We can’t pretend descriptions of migrants as “swarms” and “cockroaches” have not set the tone on immigration, and will not have influenced the public in terms of what kinds of attitudes and behaviours are deemed permissible. This kind of rhetoric must be confronted head-on wherever possible, by all of us who want a more humane country. Labour’s announcement is fantastic, but the hostile environment extends further than policy. • Ellie Mae O’Hagan is a freelance columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/28/taliban-commander-orders-closure-of-opium-labs-in-towns-and-cities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T04:00:43Z","webTitle":"Taliban commander orders closure of opium labs in towns and cities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/28/taliban-commander-orders-closure-of-opium-labs-in-towns-and-cities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/28/taliban-commander-orders-closure-of-opium-labs-in-towns-and-cities","fields":{"headline":"Taliban commander orders closure of opium labs in towns and cities","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Taliban commander in the Afghan province of Helmand has ordered all drug labs to be moved out of the urban areas the insurgency controls as US airstrikes targeting the facilities are killing a rising number of civilians, according to a recorded conversation obtained by the Guardian. In a walkie-talkie conversation with his secretary shared on a Taliban WhatsApp group, the Taliban’s shadow governor of Helmand, Mullah Manan, said “due to one factory hundreds of the public are at risk from bombings and missiles” and called for facilities to shift to “mountains and valley sides” instead. The recording, which was verified by experts on the Taliban, provides a rare insight into their operations, and shows how the Trump administration’s looser rules of engagement in Afghanistan are shifting dynamics in the 17-year-old war. Although America’s “mini-surge” has made little progress against the Taliban, according to a report from the US’s own watchdog released on Monday, Mullah Manan’s message suggests the Islamist movement fears local discontent as airstrikes target drugs labs in built-up areas. The Taliban control most of the opium trade in Afghanistan, the world’s major source of the drug, where production rose a record 87% last year, according to UN figures. After years in which the US airforce avoided hitting opium labs for fear of alienating local populations, it has targeted them for the last six months as part of a campaign to choke off the estimated $200m (£148m) in yearly revenue they earn for the Taliban. Bombing raids nearly tripled in the first three months of this year, compared with 2017. In the message, Mullah Manan said: “Drones are roaming in the air and they have made men, women and children scared because of bombing. We must strictly explain to people that if they do not stop drugs factories in public houses they will go to jail.” Any Taliban who permitted such facilities would also be punished, he added. Airstrikes have flattened several houses in Baram Shah, a border town famous for its bazaar where the drug trade flourishes. “My uncle was a nightwatchman [and not a Taliban member] in the bazaar, when it came under US bombing and he was killed,” Jan Muhammad told the Guardian. “He left seven kids behind.” Another strike in Musa Qala, a town in Helmand, killed heroin producer Hajji Habibullah but also his wife and six children – one of them a year old – generating local publicity and outrage. In 100 strikes on drug labs since November 2017, the US claims not to have killed any civilians. “To date, US Forces Afghanistan has not found a credible allegation of civilian casualty,” a spokesperson for the US military emailed the Guardian. Yet that may reflect a shifting definition of the term, notes David Mansfield of the London School of Economics, a world authority on opium in Afghanistan. “Those working or residing in these labs [are] no longer viewed [by the US] as civilians involved in a criminal activity but as enemy combatants and subject to lethal force,” he wrote in a recently published paper. Questioned on civilian deaths last year, the US Forces Afghanistan’s commanding officer, Gen John Nicholson, said killing people who work in drug-processing was legal due to “new authorities that allow me to go after revenue streams of the enemy”. Officially, the Taliban deny involvement in the drugs trade. But they collect taxes of 10% on poppy crop, increasingly run facilities that cook the plant into heroin, and have started to charge an additional tax to bring poppy seed to public markets, locals say, partly because a collapse of the Iranian currency has hurt the market."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/16/liu-xia-paul-auster-and-jm-coetzee-lead-renewed-calls-for-chinese-poets-release","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T13:09:37Z","webTitle":"Liu Xia: Paul Auster and JM Coetzee lead renewed calls for Chinese poet's release","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/16/liu-xia-paul-auster-and-jm-coetzee-lead-renewed-calls-for-chinese-poets-release","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/16/liu-xia-paul-auster-and-jm-coetzee-lead-renewed-calls-for-chinese-poets-release","fields":{"headline":"Liu Xia: Paul Auster and JM Coetzee lead renewed calls for Chinese poet's release","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Paul Auster, JM Coetzee, Alice Sebold and Khaled Hosseini are among dozens of major writers issuing an urgent call for the Chinese poet and artist Liu Xia to be freed after almost a decade under house arrest. Liu, 50, has been under house arrest in China since her late husband, the human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, was given the Nobel peace prize in 2010. Chinese authorities insist Liu “enjoys all freedoms in accordance with the law”, but supporters say her movements have been severely restricted and she lives under constant surveillance. Liu Xiaobo, who championed non-violent resistance as a way of overcoming “forceful tyranny” in China, died of liver cancer in 2017 at the age of 61 after spending almost a quarter of his life in prison. Last month, in a phone conversation with her friend the exiled writer Liao Yiwu, Liu said she herself was ready to die. “If I can’t leave, I’ll die in my home. Xiaobo is gone, and there’s nothing in the world for me now. It’s easier to die than live. Using death to defy could not be any simpler for me … If I’m dead, it’ll all be done with.” Liao posted a recording of the conversation online, on which Liu is heard crying for minutes at a time. Activists have repeatedly called for the release of Liu, who has never been accused or convicted of any crime. Now, big-name writers including Auster, Nobel laureate Coetzee, The Lovely Bones author Sebold, The Kite Runner author Hosseini, author Michael Chabon, Pulitzer-winning poet Rita Dove and the Chinese author Hu Ping have issued a public display of solidarity with the imprisoned writer. Reading excerpts from Liu’s poetry in a video made for Amnesty International, the authors are calling for the lifting of all restrictions on her movements. “Artists who are free to speak must do so on behalf of other artists whose voices are being stifled,” said Hosseini. PEN America’s chief executive Suzanne Nossel said the Chinese government’s claim that Liu “enjoys all freedoms in accordance with the law” was hollow. “As efforts to allow [her] to travel abroad for medical treatment stall, literary and human rights communities renew and amplify their call to release a poet who has been accused of no crime,” said Nossel. “We are proud to stand with Liu Xia’s literary peers to celebrate her work and challenge the Chinese government’s relentless campaign to erase her voice.” Amnesty International’s East Asia campaigns director Lisa Tassi called the Chinese government’s “efforts to silence” Liu “despicably cruel … Liu Xia’s poetry inspires so many who are now united in calling for her to be free.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/may/21/poem-of-the-week-they-may-forget-their-names-if-let-out-by-vahni-capildeo","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T08:00:20Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: They (may forget (their names (if let out))) by Vahni Capildeo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/may/21/poem-of-the-week-they-may-forget-their-names-if-let-out-by-vahni-capildeo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/may/21/poem-of-the-week-they-may-forget-their-names-if-let-out-by-vahni-capildeo","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: They (may forget (their names (if let out))) by Vahni Capildeo","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"They (may forget (their names (if let out))) petcitement incitement of a pet to excitement petcitement incitement into the excitement of being a pet petcitement incitement to be a pet a fed pet a fleece pet incitement to be a floorpet a fleapit a carpet a polkadot blanket pet blanket pet answer brass doorbell what name tin waterbowl what name thrilled vomitfall polkadot padded on patted on turded on welcome mat name turns to no-one’s reminder walks wilder walks further downriver from calling calling owner predator who that who tagalong meaner whose canines further from food fleece floor flea cloth car poll card dot blank bit door no no owner owns in nomine domini pet outruns petfetch petcome will wild default reset. This week’s poem is a polka-dot pet blanket of a sonnet – the sonnet as a very gifted, Latin-learned pet might worry at it. Vahni Capildeo’s second book for Carcanet, Venus as a Bear, reviewed by the Guardian here, builds confidently and rangily on its predecessor, Measures of Expatriation. To quote the publisher’s blurb for Venus as a Bear, Capildeo writes “on animals, art, language, the sea, thinghood, metaphor, description and dance”. In fact, all her poems represent her engagement with language: it’s one of the reasons they form such a stimulating “reader space”. The idiosyncratic dialect of the current poem is atypical, though. The poem starts off with a set of variations on the word “pet” (there are 10 pets, if you include the word as prefix, in the first six lines), producing a softly crisp percussion of doggy sound effects, resembling panting and paw-patter. But “pet” is a loaded word, and it also asserts the distance of speaker from subject. S/he is only to a degree the pet’s ventriloquist. There’s a touch of irony, to say the least, in the idea of “the excitement / of being a pet” and even the repetitive vigour hints at a little human tedium attached to the “incitement to petcitement”. There’s no tedium in the poem itself: it generates constant energy. Canine syntax and rhythm are suggested by the exuberant and pervasive parataxis. The flurry of excitement, the sheer bounce of words on the line and off the page, captures at first the essence of affable, tail-wagging pet-dogginess and, later on, the dog’s liberating, unleashed flight from domestic obedience. The vocal range of the creature is not directly quoted: there are no predictable woofs, yips or growls. Capildeo mixes a Latinate lexicon with words of earthier, more local vintage, words whose root is citare (to move) contrasting with the solid “thinghood” of nouns and compounds such as “floorpet”, “fleapit”. It’s enormous fun, especially when the pet answers the door (“What name?”) Yes, dogs, like poets, enjoy a bit of naming. The fun shades off into “vomitfall” and excrement “turded on welcome mat” (still fun for the dog, no doubt). Lack of domestic manners has been signalled, and, outdoors, the dog, without resentment, reveals itself as a walker on the wild side. S/he “walks wilder walks further / downriver from calling calling owner predator”. The syntax deliberately blurs agency, and to paraphrase is to simplify, but among the possible interpretations, the perspective of the pet on its owner is a changed, mistrustful one. The circumscribed domestic-democratic space of “food fleece floor flea cloth car poll card dot blank bit door” has disappeared like a language learned but never truly spoken. The inner dog has never been tamed, and now, in an agreeably anthropocentric metaphor, the creature’s default is reset to “wild”. So the animal becomes a means of self-interrogation for its owners, and for us. What humans have done and still do to the “animal kingdom” is a shaming record of exploitation that we insufficiently acknowledge. Even the poem’s title recognises this: the virtues of obedience are interrogated in the parentheses. Servitude and imprisonment are almost visually captured. The pets’ names are not really theirs, the domesticity is enforced. The title’s “(if let out)” allows that they might be chained. The dog that finds its own open field, and “outruns petfetch petcome,” has sniffed enslavement; by reverting “to nature” it becomes politically exemplary. In the tumbling quadruped-biped dance of Capildeo’s sonnet, in the swirl of multiple meanings and moods, the ambivalence and falseness of animal/human relations are undoubtedly registered. There is no right to pet ownership, no God-given authority, even if the power is scaffolded by Latin formulae such “in nomine domini” (in the name of the lord). When the dog gets wind of its own feral nature, and moves with the sonnet’s major “turn” into a free being, there’s a sense that an injustice has been put right. Is there also a lingering question as to whether the simple reversal of power can deliver justice? This article was adjusted on 23 May 2018 to correct the impression that Vahni Capildeo’s Venus as a Bear was only her second book."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/16/under-the-silver-lake-review-david-robert-mitchell-andrew-garfield-cannes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T13:13:55Z","webTitle":"Under the Silver Lake review – It Follows director bellyflops with ghastly noir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/16/under-the-silver-lake-review-david-robert-mitchell-andrew-garfield-cannes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/16/under-the-silver-lake-review-david-robert-mitchell-andrew-garfield-cannes","fields":{"headline":"Under the Silver Lake review – It Follows director bellyflops with ghastly noir","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When David Robert Mitchell brought his sensationally good It Follows to the critics’ week section of Cannes in 2015, the effect was immediate. Mitchell had already gained respect with his first film, The Myth of the American Sleepover, and his electrifyingly scary movie made him, as they say, hotter than Georgia asphalt. But now he has been upgraded to a competition slot with latest film Under the Silver Lake: a catastrophically boring, callow and indulgent LA mystery noir. As so often in these situations, it doesn’t feel like a progression, but a regression, a revival of an old project that he now has the clout to get made. It looks horribly like a screenplay he might have written when he was 19 and which has been mouldering in an unopened MS Word file on his MacBook Air ever since. Grizzled Cannes veterans were having flashbacks to 2006, to when Richard Kelly – creator of the woozy cult classic Donnie Darko – had been permitted huge amounts of money and leeway for his next picture and arrived in competition with the interminable and chaotic Southland Tales. Under the Silver Lake stars Andrew Garfield as Sam, a totally unemployed guy: not even an unemployed screenwriter, just unemployed, although his pop-culture cinephile credentials are presented with loads of archly framed classic movie posters dotted about his place, along with comic books, on whose shiny covers he at one stage gets his hand yuckily stuck. Sam hangs around smoking, taking calls from his mom, indolently watching through binoculars his older female neighbour walk around on her balcony semi-nude, jerking off, sometimes having sex with an actor friend-with-benefits who occasionally stops by in a cute audition costume. But then he sees and totally falls for a mysterious young woman in the next apartment called Sarah (Riley Keough), who is two parts Marilyn to one part Gloria Grahame. She sashays about looking great in a white two-piece bathing costume. She has a dog, which makes her interestingly vulnerable: there’s a dog killer going about the city. But then Sarah disappears, and of course Sam conceives an obsession with her – an obsession that becomes more maniacal when he realises what appears to be her dead body has been recovered, along with that of a billionaire LA mogul. But is she actually dead? Is there something else going on? Is it all an occult conspiracy of wealthy and influential people vested with unimaginable power and cultural reach, modern-day potentates so far above ordinary folk that their world constitutes a society within a society, or mysteriously and unknowably below it: under LA’s Silver Lake neighbourhood. From then on, Sam wanders around with a stoner’s sense of both bewilderment and aghast certainty, piecing together the clues that appear in old copies of Playboy, on cereal packets, in a macabre fanzine called Under the Silver Lake and the lyrics of a quaint goth band. And Sam gets to look at an awful lot of beautiful, unclothed women – this seems a bit of a pre-Time’s Up sort of a film, incidentally – who may be the mysteriously sensual initiates or vestal non-virgins of the conspiracy. Under the Silver Lake always looks good, and the soundtrack is great. There is an interesting scene when, in the course of his Lynchian odyssey, Sam chances across an ageing composer who reveals he personally has composed all the pop songs that everyone has loved over the past 60 years: all those melodies that everyone fondly believes are authentic popular expressions of rebellion or love, all of them churned out cynically by him. But this scene is to end in a horribly misjudged moment of violence. There is another, earlier moment of violence actually, when Sam brutally attacks the kids who had vandalised his car. Interestingly, that didn’t seem quite as crass; it actually seemed as if it might be leading somewhere. This is one of those movies that serves as an unnerving proof of what can happen when film-makers are hot enough to get anything they want made – when every light is a green light. Under the Silver Lake is uncompromisingly long, as if doubling down on any conceivable objections on the grounds of boredom, and reaffirming its claim to something inspired. But this film just wades into a murky lake of self-consciousness and sinks inexorably to the bottom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/16/feel-the-beat-deaf-fans-fight-for-access-to-live-music","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T15:23:45Z","webTitle":"Feel the beat: deaf fans fight for access to live music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/16/feel-the-beat-deaf-fans-fight-for-access-to-live-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/16/feel-the-beat-deaf-fans-fight-for-access-to-live-music","fields":{"headline":"Feel the beat: deaf fans fight for access to live music","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Growing up among the reggae soundsystems and pirate radio stations of 1980s Hackney, Troi Lee was surrounded by music, “speakers on the street corners blaring”. After getting a Walkman for his 14th birthday, he would wander through his neighbourhood playing songs by Public Enemy on repeat: “It was pure joy,” he says. This passion led Lee to follow in the footsteps of his cousin John and become a DJ. It’s a common enough path – except that Lee was born severely deaf. With his hearing aids on the telecoil setting, he could hear certain frequencies of his Walkman – the bass vibrations from the percussion and glimpses of lyrics – through a magnetic wireless signal. When DJing, Lee, now 44, uses digital software to visualise the instrumental elements that he mixes together. “We need to reverse the myth that deaf people can’t enjoy music,” Lee says. “I don’t let my deafness affect me. I want to show the world that deaf people can play music just as well as our hearing peers.” The idea that deafness impedes the appreciation of music is gradually being debunked. In 2013, sign language interpreter Amber Galloway Gallego went viral in the US for her animated performance for rapper Kendrick Lamar at the Lollapalooza festival. Rather than merely signing the words, she embodies musical textures with her face and movements, showcasing a unique technique that she describes as “showing the density of sounds visually”. To represent bass, she places her arms in front of the lower part of her body and inflates her face, replicating the sign for “fat”, while higher frequencies are placed at head height and above. After her performance, US talk show host Jimmy Kimmel took notice, inviting her and fellow interpreters Holly Maniatty and JoAnn Benfield on his show for a “sign language rap battle” in 2014. Despite some progress, a report by accessibility charity Attitude Is Everything recently stated that in the UK over 80% of deaf and disabled music fans have experienced problems when booking tickets to live music events. The UK’s live music census in February also found that only 30% of surveyed venues have dedicated disabled-access areas and only 7% of surveyed promoters have a policy to provide PA (personal assistant for deaf and disabled customers) tickets as standard. Yet it’s estimated that more than 3.3m deaf and disabled fans attend live music events every year, with a 70% rise in disabled-access ticket sales reported in 2016. With one in six people suffering from hearing loss in the UK and around one in 1,000 children born profoundly deaf, the lack of accessibility to live music for deaf people is a significant challenge, and deaf fans believe too little is being done to serve their needs. “I don’t go to live shows very often as they’re not that accessible,” says writer Rebecca Withey, who is profoundly deaf. “There is absolutely not enough provision for us, and ironically when some venues do host accessible shows, they don’t promote them well enough for us to find out about them.” For some fans, difficulties around access can put an end to nights out altogether. “Being ignored by the music industry has made me disengage from live music,” says deaf journalist and film-maker Charlie Swinbourne. Fans say specialist provisions are crucial: interpreting should be as readily available in the UK as it appears to be in the US, says student Liam O’Dell, while Lee believes that “all promoters should allocate a certain number of tickets for deaf and disabled people”. Small steps are being made towards inclusivity: festivals such as Glastonbury and Festival Republic events Reading, Leeds and Latitude all provide BSL interpreting on request. Still, the provision can face obstacles. “When access is permitted it is often done so reluctantly – it is not widely advertised, left unregulated and is often of an inadequate standard,” says Marie Pascall, director of Performance Interpreting, which provides the service for Festival Republic. She describes one instance where “an act refused to have the interpreter on stage, and then refused for the interpreter to sign any of their performance”. Troi Lee has taken matters into his own hands. In 2003 he founded Deaf Rave, a quarterly event in London designed specifically for deaf clubbers. The inspiration came from his experiences at illegal warehouse parties in the early 1990s, where the speakers amplified the vibrations he had once enjoyed through his Walkman. “It’s something I can’t quite describe,” he says, “the lasers blazing up the place and the biggest soundsystems I have ever seen or felt, shaking the entire warehouse.” From that moment in 1991, he set out to convince the deaf community that clubbing was as much a part of their culture as the hearing world’s. Through heightened bass levels and the use of new technology such as SubPac – a wearable speaker that intensifies vibrations – Lee can make his events immersive. The organisation celebrates its 15th anniversary this year, but Lee says there is still much to be done. Deaf people are twice as likely to suffer from depression as hearing people. Withey says: “There’s still a huge stigma attached to being a deaf music fan.” Says Lee: “We are one of the most marginalised groups in society, owing to our isolation, unemployment, lack of BSL in mainstream schools and the daily frustrations of communication barriers. We organised Deaf Rave because we have empathy for our community.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/25/which-drinks-go-with-which-barbecue-dishes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T14:00:29Z","webTitle":"Which drinks go with which barbecue dishes? | Fiona Beckett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/25/which-drinks-go-with-which-barbecue-dishes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/25/which-drinks-go-with-which-barbecue-dishes","fields":{"headline":"Which drinks go with which barbecue dishes?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Best for burgers Co-op Irresistible Bio Bio Valley Malbec 2016 £6.99, 13.5% Can’t go wrong with a malbec these days Best for barbecue fish Sunday Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2017 Marlborough £12.99 Laithwaites, or £11.49 by the case, 12.5% Zesty Kiwi sauvignon blanc is just the thing for big, spicy flavours Best for jerk chicken Old Jamaica ginger beer 38p-40p per 330ml can, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, or £1.20 per 1.5-litre bottle Waitrose Spicy, but not too spicy to take on jerk Best bubbly Jacob’s Creek Sparkling Shiraz £8.99 drinksupermarket.com, £10.75 Ocado and Waitrose, 12.5% Cherry-red Australian sparkling shiraz is a cracking barbie pick Best budget red Pinot Noir Vignobles Roussellet NV £4.49 Aldi, 13% A decent pinot for under a fiver?

The 19-year-old joins a squad with only 11 previous appearances at the finals and only five survivors from Roy Hodgson’s party who failed to emerge from the group stage in Brazil four years ago. Gary Cahill, recalled after his omission for the friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March, is one of that quintet and now finds himself the most experienced member of the travelling party with 58 caps. With an average age marginally over 26, this will be the third youngest squad selected by England for a World Cup. There are places for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who was capped twice in November and enjoyed an impressive year on loan at Crystal Palace from Chelsea, and Manchester City’s Fabian Delph, whose last cap came in November 2015. Adam Lallana, who managed a solitary Premier League start for Liverpool all season and whose 16-minute cameo on the final afternoon represented a first involvement in six weeks, has only been selected among five standby players. As anticipated, there is no place for Joe Hart, Ryan Bertrand or Jack Wilshere, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez are injured. “I believe this is a squad which we can be excited about,” said Southgate, who will welcome all but the contingent from the FA Cup finalists, Chelsea and Manchester United, and Liverpool, as Champions League finalists, to St George’s Park on Monday to begin preparations for Russia. “It is a young group but with some really important senior players, so I feel the balance of the squad is good, both in terms of its experience, its character and also the positional balance. “We have a lot of energy and athleticism in the team but players who are equally comfortable in possession of the ball and I think people can see the style of play we’ve been looking to develop. The selection process has been over months really, it’s not just been the last few weeks. We feel the team are improving and we want to continue that momentum.” Only in 1958 and 2006 did England travel to a World Cup with a younger squad and 11 of the 23 have fewer than 20 caps. Alexander-Arnold, who has made three appearances for the under-21s, had been invited to train with the senior squad in the buildup to the games against the Dutch and the Italians and has enjoyed an impressive season at Anfield. He has made the most of the absence through injury of Nathaniel Clyne and Gomez for long periods and played a key role in the Liverpool’s Champions League knockout victories over Manchester City and Roma. Southgate has monitored his progress closely. “The first call-up for Trent Alexander-Arnold is well deserved,” he said. “When we pick young players, it’s not just because they are young, it’s because their performances deserve it. We’ve also had a couple of injuries with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez, which is a huge blow for them personally and disappointing for us.” Alexander-Arnold offers back-up to Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker at right wing-back and could be utilised in midfield if required, having featured there for Liverpool. The teenager, along with his club-mate Jordan Henderson, will link up with the squad after the friendly with Nigeria next month, as Southgate is insistent his players enjoy a week’s break after the end of their club seasons. The Football Association’s medical staff are confident the knee injury sustained by Trippier, which sidelined him on the final day of the season, will not hamper him in Russia, and they will assess him again when he joins the squad with the squad. Southgate has spent time speaking to those players who did not make the final cut and while Wilshere has not played for his country since the Euro 2016 defeat to Iceland, there were difficult conversations with Bertrand and Hart, who had played significant parts in qualifying and would have expected to be involved. “Ryan and Joe have played a lot over the last two years, so they’re not decisions we took lightly,” the manager said. “I could’ve had easier conversations by keeping them involved. With Joe, we’ve got three other goalkeepers who have had very good seasons and the decision I was faced with was: ‘Do I keep Joe in and have experience around the group? Or give the three guys who have basically had a better season a chance?’ We felt the players all needed to be in on merit. “Ryan is also very unfortunate in that it’s probably one of the strongest positions we have. Ryan has had a decent season but I just felt the others were ahead of him. Both calls were really tough. They’re both good guys and have contributed a lot throughout qualification, so it wasn’t an enjoyable part of the job and I feel it’s important to acknowledge their contribution in getting us to Russia.” Neither has been included on the five-man standby list, with Lallana joined by Burnley’s Tom Heaton and James Tarkowski, Lewis Cook of Bournemouth and West Brom’s Jake Livermore. They will join the squad at the training camp next week in the hope an opportunity presents itself, with Lallana to be promoted to the 23 if any of the forward options succumbs to injury in the next few weeks. “History tells us that one of those standby players may end up in the squad, as it’s very unusual for us to get through the end of the season and our two preparation games without any issues,” Southgate said. “All of the guys on standby have been really professional in their approach to this. They recognise there’s still an opportunity and we’ve had a lot of conversations over a period of time about their situation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/16/peter-byrne-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T11:16:49Z","webTitle":"Peter Byrne obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/16/peter-byrne-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/16/peter-byrne-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Peter Byrne obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dixon of Dock Green, one of British television’s longest running and most popular police dramas, starred Jack Warner as the dependable, friendly London bobby who welcomed viewers to each episode with the cheery greeting “Evening, all”. It ran for 21 years from 1955, and is remembered for its cosy, nostalgic world of petty theft and tickings-off delivered over cups of tea. Although there is much truth in this recollection of the programme, from the early 60s – in a changing Britain where crime was rising, and with the launch of the much grittier series Z Cars – there was some attempt to bring the drama up to date. The ageing Dixon – promoted to sergeant in 1964 – eventually became deskbound and stories focused on the younger detective Andy Crawford, played by Peter Byrne, who has died aged 90. Byrne had joined Dixon of Dock Green at its inception, as a wet-behind-the-ears police constable. PC George Dixon had previously featured in The Blue Lamp, the most popular film in British cinemas in 1950. Although the character was shot dead little more than 20 minutes in, he was brought back to life in a 1952 stage version of The Blue Lamp that featured Gordon Harker as Dixon, Byrne as PC Andy Crawford and Warner as Chief Inspector Cherry. Ted Willis, co-writer of both the film and play, then turned it into the television series, with Warner as star and Byrne reprising his stage role. In later years, Crawford married Dixon’s daughter, Mary (played successively by Billie Whitelaw, Jeanette Hutchinson and Anna Dawson), and moved to CID, rising to the rank of detective inspector, and gradually did more of the legwork for Dixon – astonishingly, Warner was 80 by the time the programme finally ended in 1976. Two years before that, in an example of how it made an effort to catch up with other police dramas and the modern world, a tougher and more cynical Crawford ended up being investigated after leading a raid on suspected robbers that resulted in one of the unarmed suspects being shot by a police gun. However, with modern cops-and-robbers sagas such as The Sweeney complete with screeching cars and violence as standard, Dixon of Dock Green still looked anachronistic, and Byrne decided to leave in 1975, after 21 series. A year later, the programme was laid to rest. Born in Forest Gate, east London, to James Byrne, a musician who later played in Jack Hylton’s band, and his wife, Elizabeth (nee Massey), Byrne was brought up in Hendon, Middlesex, and educated at Finchley grammar school. He then trained at the Italia Conti Stage Academy and, at the age of 16, alongside fellow students, made his professional debut as the third elf in Clifford Mills and John Ramsay’s fantasy play Where the Rainbow Ends, at the Knightstone theatre, Weston-super-Mare (1944). The following year, Byrne made his radio debut in The Will Hay Programme and appeared as a schoolboy alongside the star in the revue For Crying Out Loud, produced by Hylton at the Stoll theatre. He was also with Hay in the Victory Royal Variety Performance at the London Coliseum shortly after the end of the second world war. Following national service, Byrne performed with repertory theatre companies across England. Hylton then cast him in The Blue Lamp and as Phil, one of the children of Dan (Warner) and Doris (Joyce Barber) in a 1954 stage version of The Archers radio serial. Byrne’s West End roles included the Honourable George D’Alroy in She Smiled at Me (St Martin’s theatre, 1956), Robert Castin in Boeing-Boeing (Duchess, 1966) and Robert Danvers in There’s a Girl in My Soup (Globe, 1968-69, and Comedy, 1969). He also acted in and directed tours of Agatha Christie plays, later appeared with Bill Kenwright’s touring Christie company between 2009 and 2013, and did stints as actor or director in her murder-mystery The Mousetrap, the West End’s longest-running show, at St Martin’s theatre. He made his television debut in 1953 as David Mason, with Whitelaw as his wife, in The Pattern of Marriage, a four-part drama-documentary series written by Caryl Doncaster and Willis that was instructional in guiding viewers on how to re-establish “happy family” life at a time when divorce was on the increase. It was the BBC in its traditional “Auntie” role, in the vein of what was to follow with Dixon of Dock Green. Byrne became friends with Paul Elliott, who played a police cadet in the series, and in 1964 they formed E&amp;B Productions, staging up to 30 pantomimes a year across the UK, directing and starring in some themselves. Eventually, Byrne sold his shares to Elliott but continued to act in some of the shows. He had a guest role in a 1981 episode of the TV sci-fi serial Blake’s 7 as Justin, a scientist who genetically engineers animals as slaves for humans, and a run in the sitcom Bread as Derek (1988-91), a widower who befriends Nellie Boswell (Jean Boht). He played an ageing Tony Blair relocating to the Middle East in the satirical 2006 series Time Trumpet, set 25 years in the future, and appeared in episodes of Doctors (2006) and Holby City (2006 and 2012). His cinema appearances included small roles in Reach for the Sky (1956) and Watch Your Stern (1960), as well as one as a bridegroom in Carry On Cabby (1963). When BBC Radio 4 revived Dixon of Dock Green in 2005, Andy Crawford was played by David Tennant, alongside David Calder as Dixon. Byrne’s 1956 marriage to Vera Dalgleish ended in divorce. In 1980, he married Renée Goldschmidt, who died in 2011. He is survived by his two stepchildren, Anthony and Vivienne. • Peter James Byrne, actor and director, born 29 January 1928; died 14 May 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/16/uk-missing-deadlines-for-post-brexit-nuclear-safeguards-leak-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T11:03:38Z","webTitle":"UK missing deadlines for post-Brexit nuclear safeguards, leak shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/16/uk-missing-deadlines-for-post-brexit-nuclear-safeguards-leak-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/16/uk-missing-deadlines-for-post-brexit-nuclear-safeguards-leak-shows","fields":{"headline":"UK missing deadlines for post-Brexit nuclear safeguards, leak shows","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brexit deadlines have put the supply of nuclear raw material for power stations at risk, a leaked government document has suggested. The document, obtained by Sky News, shows that the UK is already missing critical deadlines to put full safeguards in place to keep the flow of components and raw material needed to fabricate nuclear fuel after Brexit. The UK does not produce uranium. It must have its own safety measures in place, including a governing body to regulate the safe transport of the raw material, once it leaves the European safeguarding body Euroatom after Brexit. Five “high-level risks” in setting up this government body have been identified by the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation, according to an internal “risk register” paper obtained by Sky. Work on a new IT system, which should have started by the end of March, is already behind and the deadline has already been “irretrievable lost”, the document says. The other four areas categorised as “red” on a red, amber, green (RAG) project management ranking including recruitment, lack of training for inspectors and funding. Failure to arrange the “comprehensive handover” of hardware from Euratom are also cited in the document. The document was leaked just days after the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, Tom Greatrex, warned that Britain could have a period with no nuclear fuel unless the safeguards were in place in time. “Whilst you may have a stock of raw material to be able to produce fuel. Eventually, you are going to be in the position where you use that up,” said Greatrex. He told Sky News the Brexit decision had created “a very exacting timetable” to set up the independent British body and there was “no shortcut” to achieve it. Scientists have warned that British power stations may not be able to source nuclear fuel if it cannot be legally transported across borders. There have also been reports that shipment of medical isotopes used in scans and cancer treatment could be jeopardised. “We could end up in a situation where you have got a perfectly well-functioning fleet of nuclear power stations but we haven’t got enough fuel ... We don’t want to end up in the position where we have got power stations and haven’t got fuel,” Greatrex told reporters on Monday. The government said the UK’s ability to import medical radioisotopes from Europe and the rest of the world would not be affected by Brexit as they are not subject to international safeguards. A spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it had made “significant progress in preparing to leave Euratom to ensure safeguards are in place from day one”. “The nuclear safeguards bill is making good progress through parliament and we continue to work closely with the Office for Nuclear Regulation to ensure we continue to have a robust regime in place.” The spokesman added that the UK had signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US, which it was hoped would be the first of a series of deals to ensure no disruption to the nuclear supply chain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/16/wodehouse-prize-for-comic-fiction-withheld-after-judges-fail-to-laugh","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T10:57:32Z","webTitle":"Wodehouse prize for comic fiction withheld after judges fail to laugh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/16/wodehouse-prize-for-comic-fiction-withheld-after-judges-fail-to-laugh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/16/wodehouse-prize-for-comic-fiction-withheld-after-judges-fail-to-laugh","fields":{"headline":"Wodehouse prize for comic fiction withheld after judges fail to laugh","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This year’s new novels are not much of a laugh – at least according to the judges of the UK’s only prize for comic fiction, who have taken the unprecedented decision to withhold the award after failing to be sufficiently amused by the books submitted. The Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize for comic fiction, which has been running since 2000, goes to the novel deemed to best capture the comic spirit of the late PG Wodehouse. In another blow to a year that has already suffered from its fair share of doom and gloom, judges revealed on Wednesday morning that they had not found a book they felt worthy “to join the heady comedic ranks of PG Wodehouse” or of previous winners such as Marina Lewycka or Alexander McCall Smith. None of the 62 novels submitted for the prize this year “prompted unanimous, abundant laughter”, they said, instead only managing to provoke “wry smile[s]”. “My fellow judges and I have decided to withhold the prize this year to maintain the extremely high standards of comic fiction that the … prize represents,” said judge David Campbell, the publisher of Everyman’s Library. “Despite the submitted books producing many a wry smile amongst the panel during the judging process, we did not feel than any of the books we read this year incited the level of unanimous laughter we have come to expect. We look forward to awarding a larger rollover prize next year to a hilariously funny book.” The prize’s winner is usually presented with a case of champagne and a rare breed pig named after their winning novel at the annual Hay literary festival. Next year’s bumper prize will include a methuselah of bubbly and a particularly large pig. Organisers would not reveal the titles of the books submitted this year for the prize, whose previous winners include Helen Fielding’s Bridget Jones’s Baby, which won in 2017; Ian McEwan’s Solar, which won in 2010; and Terry Pratchett’s Snuff, which won in 2012. Campbell, whose fellow judges included broadcaster James Naughtie and standup comedian Sindhu Vee, admitted that writing a genuinely funny novel was a difficult task: “Wodehouse is so incredibly great, he really does make you laugh out loud. But that’s not an easy thing to do at all. There were lots of very good novels, but nothing outstandingly funny … Nothing stood out this year. There were a lot of witty submissions, bloody good novels, but they weren’t comic novels. The alchemy was not there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/21/deadpool-2-strange-deaths-and-supercharged-irony-discuss-with-spoilers","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"Deadpool 2: strange deaths and supercharged irony – discuss with spoilers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/21/deadpool-2-strange-deaths-and-supercharged-irony-discuss-with-spoilers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/21/deadpool-2-strange-deaths-and-supercharged-irony-discuss-with-spoilers","fields":{"headline":"Deadpool 2: strange deaths and supercharged irony – discuss with spoilers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first Deadpool changed the face of comic book movies almost overnight. Would Taika Waititi have been able to get away with the son of Odin’s reinvention as a wisecracking, fourth-wall-breaking god of thunder in Thor: Ragnarok without Tim Miller’s freewheeling splash of superhero irreverence? Almost certainly not. Even more vitally, it established that the audience for these films is maturing, that there is room in the comic-book pantheon for some R-rated, amusingly puerile buffoonery, and that Ryan Reynolds (against all previous evidence) really does have the star power to lead his own superhero franchise. And yet sequels, as Deadpool 2 notes, are notoriously difficult beasts. Moreover, as Miller was replaced by David Leitch, the director of Atomic Blonde, for the follow-up, there is no guarantee the same chemistry flows through the potty-mouthed mutant’s veins this time around. The critics, however, have largely pulled Leitch’s film into an embrace and gently cupped its buttock. The sequel currently boasts a rating of 86% “fresh” on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, which is slightly better than the score posted by its much-praised predecessor in 2016. What did you think of Deadpool 2? Here’s your chance to get suitably loquacious on the movie’s key talking points. Putting Marvel and DC to shame on diversity The X-Men comic books were a natural place for Marvel to begin introducing LGBT superheroes in the 1990s, starting with Northstar’s coming out in 1992 as the publisher’s first openly gay costumed titan. On the big screen, both DC and Marvel have ignored the pleas of campaigners to introduce non-heterosexual characters, despite the best efforts of Waititi and Tessa Thompson in Ragnarok. Given Deadpool’s own fluid sexuality on both the big screen and in the comics, it makes sense that part two sees the (pleasingly casual) revelation that Brianna Hildebrand’s Negasonic Teenage Warhead is dating fellow X-Man Yukio (Shioli Kutsuna). But that’s not the only place where Deadpool 2 wins brownie points for diversity and subverting stereotypes: we are also introduced to a self-described “plus-size” version of Firefist, in the form of Julian Dennison’s troubled young mutant Russell Collins. In the comics, the character is usually depicted as a typically muscular blond. The strange death of Vanessa Carlysle Does Deadpool 2’s self-reflexive irreverence and supercharged irony excuse its writers from indulging in the infamous “fridging” trope, whereby the death of a female loved one is used to propel the male-centric narrative forward? In the comics Morena Baccarin’s Vanessa Carlysle has her own superpowers, as the shapeshifting mutant Copycat, but on the big screen she is once again little more than a foil for Deadpool to showcase his serious, emotionally wrought side for a moment or two – a Patsy Kensit in Lethal Weapon 2 for the Marvel generation. Is that satire, or just lazy writing? A very short-lived X-Force Much has been made of Deadpool launching his own superhero team in Leitch’s movie, but even here the writers succeed in overturning our expectations to wonderfully comic effect. The appearances by Terry Crews’s Bedlam, Lewis Tan’s Shatterstar and Bill Skarsgård’s Zeitgeist turn out to be little more than gruesome cameos, as they fall victims to Deadpool’s spectacularly poor planning skills during that disastrous parachute drop. Rather fittingly, it turns out to be a rather less ostentatious figure, taxi driver Dopinder, who ultimately plays a far more vital role in taking out Eddie Marsan’s abusive orphanage headmaster. Proof that time travel really is cheating Killed off a character and later regretted it? Planning a reboot of an old sci-fi favourite with a brand new cast? Time travel is the obvious solution to any Hollywood screenwriter’s creative dead end, but never has it been used to such impressive effect as at the tale end of Deadpool 2. Wade Wilson cheerfully brings Vanessa back from the dead, wipes his earlier appearance as Deadpool in the execrable X-Men Origins: Wolverine from the Hollywood history books and even shoots Ryan Reynolds before his alter ego is able to sign up for Green Lantern. Oh, and he brings back all those dead members of X-Force for good measure. Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated? Deadpool can never join the MCU or any other universe With Marvel rights holder Disney and X-Men studio Twentieth Century Fox now well on the way to being one company, it’s long been suggested that big-screen crossover events are inevitable. But if Deadpool 2 achieves anything, it’s to establish that Wilson exists in a place so tonally idiosyncratic that he should never be allowed to visit other movie universes. Deadpool’s inclusion in an X-Men movie would only serve to highlight the dull, grey and insipid nature of the super-serious Fox franchise. Put him in the MCU and he would probably try to hump Spider-Man’s leg. Nope, all in all, Deadpool is best off staying single."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/15/unusual-suspects-the-writers-diversifying-detective-fiction","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T08:49:39Z","webTitle":"Unusual suspects: the writers diversifying detective fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/15/unusual-suspects-the-writers-diversifying-detective-fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/15/unusual-suspects-the-writers-diversifying-detective-fiction","fields":{"headline":"Unusual suspects: the writers diversifying detective fiction","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Take a look at any list of the greatest detectives in fiction – say, this one – and it’s hard to ignore the fact that they’re overwhelmingly white and male. Some of them may be intellectuals, while others prefer to solve a tricky case with their fists, but one thing Sherlock Holmes shares with Sam Spade, Jack Reacher and Kurt Wallander is the colour of his face. A quick flick through my copy of Peter Haining’s survey The Golden Age of Crime Fiction reveals only two characters who aren’t white: a Thuggee assassin in a Victorian penny dreadful and the Earl Derr Biggers private eye Charlie Chan. Biggers was something of a sucker for inscrutable, “eastern” wisdom, but the character was this Ohio-born, Harvard-educated author’s attempt to find something new. “Sinister and wicked Chinese are old stuff,” Biggers said. “But an amiable Chinese on the side of law and order had never been used.” In the wake of Charlie Chan, publishers employed other white writers to bring a bit of oriental exoticism to crime fiction, such as John P Marquand with his secret agent Mr Moto, and Hugh Wiley with his detective Mr Wong. But crime fiction in the golden age continued to reflect the times. According to Professor Maureen T Reddy, “whiteness and heterosexuality are fundamental elements” of the hardboiled crime of the 1940s and 50s. In her 2003 study Traces, Codes and Clues, Reddy argues that “the central white/male/heterosexual consciousness is sacred, unchallengeable, which in turn emphasises the great degree to which the fiction is about that consciousness. It seems clear that racism (and sexism and heterosexism) is a necessary element of hardboiled detective fiction and is in fact a cornerstone of that fiction’s ideological orientation.” Writers such as Chester Himes, who began writing crime fiction featuring African American detectives in the 1950s, and Robert Beck (AKA Iceberg Slim), who started writing gritty novels drawing on his own experiences as a pimp in the 60s, blazed a trail continued by writers such as Walter Mosley, Attica Locke and Paula L Woods. But as the world has become steadily more globalised, 21st-century detective fiction has become more multinational as well, with writers such as Alex Segura drawing on their own heritages and experiences to diversify the genre. Segura’s Pete Fernandez series follows a Cuban American investigator working the beat in the author’s home city of Miami. When he first started to read crime fiction as a child, Segura recalls “a sense of: ‘Where are the people like me?’ I read a lot of Sherlock Holmes, and comic books, but the book that kind of crystallised it for me was Mario Puzo’s The Godfather, which I read way too young, maybe eight or nine. It was steeped in the ceremony and traditions of Italian families, and while I’m not Italian I connected to that … the main characters weren’t just white.” It’s an experience shared by Amit Dhand. Growing up in Bradford, West Yorkshire, Dhand says there were “no characters for Asian readers. If you were white you could see Bond, or Bourne or Bauer on the bookshelves or on the screen, but there was nothing if you were British Asian.” For Dhand, who writes as AA Dhand, the turning point was reading Tess Gerritsen’s 2001 novel The Surgeon. “I think it was the first time I’d read a crime novel by someone who wasn’t white and I thought to myself that I wanted to do something like that,” he explains. That something turned out to be a British Asian Sikh detective, Harry Virdee. There’s plenty of crime fiction set in LA, but Steph Cha found that the city that is home to the largest Korean population outside Korea was not making room for them on the page. When she started reading crime fiction in college, she recognised two crucial things about the genre right away: “It was an excellent tool for exploring place and community, and it was dominated by straight, white, male protagonists who could only take readers so far.” Cha has written three novels featuring the Korean American PI Juniper Song. “I wanted the heritage and identity stuff to be in the background, as it is in my day-to-day life,” she says. “My Korean-ness is important to me, but I don’t walk around thinking about how Korean I am in any given situation. There are readers who expect non-white protagonists to go around feeling their differences on every page, but that is not true to my experience. At the same time, being Korean American – and a woman – means I don’t have the same defaults as a white dude, and that’s reflected in Juniper Song.” Dhand shares this supple approach to questions of heritage and identity. “Harry Virdee is a Sikh and a British Asian,” Dhand says. “But that’s not what defines him for every second. What defines him is what he will do in any given situation, how he feels about right and wrong. He’s a complicated character … he has a Muslim wife, his family have disowned him because of this. He’s uncompromising in his job. It’s more about being British than anything else.” Segura’s Fernandez may be nothing extraordinary in 21st-century Miami, but he’s still a little unusual in the world of detective fiction. “The Cuban American perspective, politically, is very unique and different from the two parts that make it up,” he says. “While the Pete books are not soaked in politics, I don’t shy away from him having an opinion, or reflecting the Miami that I know – the people, their opinions and showing how they might be different from the rest of the country. I think it’s important, even if it just gets people thinking about it from a different perspective. “I can’t speak for all Cuban Americans, but for me, growing up, there was always this feeling of being apart – of this different, distant land that held such sway over everything we did or thought, and that’s a powerful feeling.” Song, Fernandez and Virdee are all detectives who represent the migrant populations of the cities they work in – but non-white detectives remain a rarity. “For every PI novel with a protagonist of colour, there are about 10 books about gruff white cops falling in love with murdered white women, 10 ‘girl’ books about murderous white women, and 10 more about serial killers in Scandinavia,” says Cha, who also edits the noir crime section of the Los Angeles Review of Books. “I’ve been going to crime conferences since 2013, and I’m regularly on panels where I’m the only woman and the only person of colour, speaking to rooms full of white people. [The genre] may be improving little by little, but it’s probably premature to declare that the landscape has changed in any meaningful way.” While Dhand’s Virdee books have been optioned for TV, no contemporary Asian detective has made the transition on to western screens as yet. “Perhaps everyone’s waiting for the glass ceiling to break,” Dhand says. “But in the three years since I published the first novel, there’s hardly been a deluge of Asian crime authors coming on to the scene.” Crime fiction is beginning to discover that non-white, non-male, non-heterosexual characters don’t have to be the “other”, don’t need to be the villain or the colourful cameo. But until more writers with a broad variety of backgrounds and experiences step forward and more publishers take them on, crime – or at least the solving of it – will still be something of a white man’s game."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2018/may/16/marseille-v-atletico-madrid-europa-league-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T21:09:23Z","webTitle":"Marseille 0-3 Atlético Madrid: 2018 Europa League final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/may/16/marseille-v-atletico-madrid-europa-league-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/may/16/marseille-v-atletico-madrid-europa-league-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Marseille 0-3 Atlético Madrid: 2018 Europa League final – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Our man Jonathan Wilson was in Lyon. Here’s his match report. With that, this MBM wishes you goodnight. Congratulations to Atletico Madrid, the 2018 Europa League champions. Commiserations to Marseille, for whom the stars never looked like aligning. Spanish teams have now won eight of the last nine Europa League and Champions League trophies on offer. This victory puts Atletico into joint second place on the Uefa Cup / Europa League roll of honour: 5: Sevilla 3: Juventus, Internazionale, Liverpool, Atletico Madrid 2: Borussia Monchengladbach, Tottenham Hotspur, Real Madrid, Goteborg, Parma, Feyenoord, Porto Though if you add in the old Fairs Cup, which Uefa doesn’t, Barcelona and Valencia would be up there on our multiple winners list with three, while Leeds United would join the group on two. And here come the 2018 Europa League winners: Atletico Madrid! Having lost a couple of Champions League finals in recent seasons, this is a huge release of emotion for quite a few of these players. Fernando Torres, of course, but this is the first trophy Antoine Griezmann has won for Atletico too. Gabi takes possession of the trophy and raises it ... generously allowing Torres to share the moment! The red-and-white ticker tape showers down, as the players bounce like they’ve never bounced before. A few of the Marseille players in tears, as you’d expect in these circumstances. But they’re magnanimous in defeat, too, embracing their opponents and offering congratulations. Plenty of smiling Atletico men, though, as Eric Abidal carries the trophy to the presentation plinth. They form a guard of honour as the officials walk up to receive their medals, but mainly so they can applaud the 2018 Europa League runners-up Marseille. Bittersweet scenes. Poor Dimitri Payet, tears still stinging his eyes, takes off his medal the second it’s draped around his neck. In addition to tonight’s disappointment, his World Cup chances now hang in the balance. Atletico cavort around the pitch, their fans singing their praises. Though it’s difficult to hear them, because Uefa are blasting some very intrusive music over the PA. Has somebody let Ofenbach back in? Joyous scenes nonetheless! Sad ones for Marseille, though. Atletico were deserved champions, having bossed that match since the 21st minute, when they were gifted the lead by Andre Zambo Anguissa’s terrible mistake. Antoine Griezmann scored two clinical goals, and that was pretty much that, Gabi embellishing the scoreline right at the end. But 0-3 doesn’t tell the whole story: Valere Germain missed a golden opportunity in the early exchanges, Dimitri Payet was forced off injured, and Kostas Mitroglou was so close to scoring with a towering header. It just wasn’t their night. And that’s it! Atletico Madrid are the Europa League champions for the third time! 90 min: And to huge, emotional cheers, here comes Fernando Torres! The one-time teenage captain of Atletico replaces the two-goal hero Griezmann. He’s finally going to win a major trophy with the club he’s supported since the age of five! This puts the tin lid and pretty bow on it. Atletico stream forward, Marseille having committed too many men forward. Grizemann spreads a pass wide left for Costa, who cuts back for Koke. Koke switches play towards Gabi, coming in from the right. Gabi lashes low and hard, across Mandanda, and into the bottom right. What a goal! What a performance by this wonderfully relentless Atletico Madrid side. 88 min: Atletico make their second change of the night. Partey comes on for Correa. Will we see Torres? 87 min: Not sure how this is still 0-2. First up, Sarr and Rami take turns to gift possession to Atletico, just outside their own box. Diego Costa’s eventual shot is no good. Then up the other end, Njie is teed up just inside the area, but shanks an awful effort out for a throw. 85 min: Marseille’s fans, to their eternal credit, are giving it plenty. It just hasn’t been their team’s night. Unless a story for the ages is about to be written. 83 min: Space for Sarr down the right. But his cutback isn’t all that. The ball’s half cleared. Amavi decides to have a thrash from 25 yards. He sends a sweet fizzer goalwards, through a thicket of players. But Oblak is a model of concentration, and gathers a very difficult low bouncer. 81 min: And the luck’s with them, too. Because Marseille are an inch away from getting back into this final. Sanson curls a cross in from the right. Mitroglou rises highest, ten yards out, and plants a downwards header towards the bottom left. Oblak is beaten all ends up, but the ball bounces off the bottom of the left-hand post, across the face of goal, and is hacked clear. That’s so unfortunate, it was a beautiful header, a combination of power and precision, perfectly timed. It deserved a goal. 80 min: But their heads have gone. A loose pass in the midfield allows Griezmann to scamper goalwards. Nothing comes of that move, but Lucas takes up possession and is barged to the floor by Njie. A free kick, and a chance for Atletico to allow the clock to run down some more. They’ve been ruthless and rather brilliant since being gifted the opener. 78 min: Njie is booked for rather petulantly flicking a hand towards the face of Lucas. Marseille need to calm down if they’re to have any chance of a dramatic comeback. 77 min: Griezmann sends Costa scampering with intent down the inside-left channel. For a second, it looks like he’s shaping to hit a screaming, dipping, diagonal volley towards the right-hand portion of the goal. But he decides against it, and the chance to do something, anything is gone. 76 min: Gustavo is booked after blocking Gabi as the Atletico captain hugs the right touchline. It’s a foul, nothing more, but he’s talked himself into the book for arguing the toss with the linesman. The resulting free kick is wasted. 74 min: Germain, who passed up that early chance for Marseille, is sacrificed for Mitroglou. The last throw of the dice. 73 min: But there’s another one coming along soon enough, as Correa busies himself on the right. This one leads to an extended period of ball-hogging, the highlight of which being a glorious crossfield pass by Diego Costa. Atletico have seized back total control. 71 min: Griezmann curls the set piece into the box. Saul tries to guide a header into the top left. it comes off Gustavo for a corner, from which Koke crosses deep from the left. Mandanda is forced to tip an unpredictable dipper over. Another corner, then, this time on the right. And that one’s nothing to write home about at all. 69 min: Gustavo has a good old hack at Griezmann’s ankles. He should go in the book, but doesn’t. A free kick to Atletico, though, just outside the Marseille box on the left. 67 min: After a very quiet period, Marseille are giving this one last shot. Sanson fights his way down the right and tries to hook into the centre from a tight spot. Not quite: the cross sails over the crossbar. But at least Atletico have been given something to think about. 66 min: From the corner, Njie has a crack, but it’s blocked by Griezmann. And then another phase of attack, as Lopez dinks into the box from deep. The ball drops to Sanson, who leans back and hoicks over. 65 min: This is better from Marseille. Lopez makes space down the right and hooks inside. Thauvin’s header isn’t all that, and Oblak should claim, but Juanfran slices out for a corner instead. A rare miscommunication in the Atletico defence. 63 min: Sanson tries to strip Saul of his trousers in a midfield tussle. He doesn’t quite succeed, though he really should be going in the book. 61 min: Ocampos has ranted himself out, and is now slumped on the bench in Quiet Fume mode. His fume serves as a decent metaphor for Marseille themselves: totally spent, they don’t look as though they have a comeback in them. Still, stranger things have happened. But they need to do something soon. 60 min: Lucas dribbles with great purpose down the left. He nearly breaks clear for a shot, but settles for a corner. His determination wins a high five from Koke, who nearly knocks him over backwards with the gesture. The corner is a complete waste of time, mind, but there’s a picture of a team who aren’t planning to take their foot off the gas just yet. 58 min: Atletico are bossing it in every department right now. They’re pinging the ball around in very pretty triangles, Griezmann, Costa and Koke at the heart of everything. Marseille by comparison are struggling to string two passes together. 56 min: Ocampos takes up his position on the Marseille bench, ranting in the expressive style. He’s really not happy. 55 min: A disgruntled Ocampos - who has been one of Marseille’s better performers - is hooked. Clinton Njie, once of Tottenham Hotspur, comes on in his stead. 53 min: And from this one, Godin flashes a header wide right from close range. He should probably have wrapped this up, right there. Marseille are clinging on for dear life. 52 min: From the set piece, the ball’s worked to Griezmann, who has the smell of a hat-trick in his nostrils. His shot, from the right-hand edge of the D, is deflected wide right for another corner. 51 min: Marseille are on the rack now. They need to clear their heads, because when Costa tries to break into the box from the left, Rami comes across and nearly slices a clearance backwards and over his own keeper, into the top right. Corner. This was so simple. A huge hole in the Marseille midfield. Koke romps into it, and slips a ball down the inside-right for Griezmann. The striker buzzes into the box, draws Mandanda, and half-dinks, half-strokes the ball past the keeper and into the bottom left. What a gorgeous finish! 48 min: Correa cuts in from the right, having exchanged passes with Costa. Sarr does very well to stop him when, for a second, another goal looked on the cards. But it’s a futile gesture, because ... 47 min: A slow start to the second half. On the touchline, Atletico assistant coach German Burgos pulls on an extra gilet as the rain comes down in stair rods. Right now, Diego Simeone will be pleased he’s banned from the touchline and banished to the dry stand. So here we go again! Atletico get the party restarted, having swapped off the already-booked Vrsaljko for Juanfran. Taking no chances. It’s tipping down in Lyon. Half-time eulogy. One of England’s heroes of 1966 passed away today. Here’s Richard Williams on the unassuming but brilliant Ramon Wilson. And that’s that for the first half. It couldn’t have gone much worse for Marseille, who spurned an early gilt-edged chance, gave up the cheapest of goals, and lost their influential captain Dimitri Payet to injury. Atletico are 45 minutes away from their third Europa League trophy. 45 min: Thauvin is down now. He’s taken a deflected clearance flush in his trouser arrangement. Ooyah, oof. 44 min: Griezmann drops deep, and very nearly threads a pass down the left to release Costa into the Marseille box. Sarr does extremely well to spot what’s going on and intercept. For a second, there was very real danger on the cards. 42 min: Marseille have totally lost their rhythm since the loss of Payet. Atletico look in control of this game now. Ocampos tries to Garrincha his way into the Atletico box from the left; it’s a nice run, but there’s simply too many red-and-white shirts to diddle his way past. No way through. 40 min: There’s loads of smoke billowing across the pitch again. Either a fan has let off a flare, or Ofenbach have returned with their decks. Those house DJs are a menace to society. 38 min: And it’s a free kick, of course. It’s basically a corner from the right. Koke whips it in, and Godin clanks a header miles over the bar from close range. 37 min: Amavi and Correa contest a 50-50 with a couple of dainty high-kicks. Correa goes down and rolls around quite a bit. There’s nothing in that, but Amavi is clearly frustrated because, as play restarts and Vrsaljko romps down the right, he comes across and clatters him to such an extent that a yellow card is a no-brainer. 35 min: Sanson looks to break quickly upfield with Atletico light at the back. He bursts past Gabi, but the Atletico captain is brushed and goes down cutely to win a free kick that puts a stop to Marseille’s gallop. The crowd - the majority supporting Marseille - go wild. 34 min: Lopez is immediately in the action, chasing after a pass slipped down the right by the impressively relentless Sarr. There’s too much juice on the ball and it flies out of play for a goal kick. 32 min: Yep, he’s taking his armband off. The poor chap is in floods of tears as he limps off. Maxime Lopez comes on in his stead. That’s a huge blow for Marseille, whose world has fallen apart in the last ten minutes. 31 min: The game’s paused, as Payet is down, holding that troublesome thigh. Oh no. This could be terrible luck for the Marseille captain. 29 min: Sarr clatters into the back of Lucas Hernandez. Free kick in the middle of the park. Atletico take an age over it, withdrawing a little of the sting from the game. They’re streetwise all right. 27 min: Thauvin finds a bit of space on the right and loops into the Atletico box. Oblak rises and gathers with confidence. This game is nothing if not end to end. 26 min: And now a free kick for Atletico, out on the right. Koke takes, and finds Correa on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. He swivels and shoots first time. Mandanda collects, and the flag’s up for offside anyway. 24 min: Payet lifts the resulting free kick into the Atletico mixer. There’s a game of head tennis, and then from the middle of the melee, Ocampo tries to loop a header into the top right. It forces Oblak to scamper back in panic, but it’s always going over. Goal kick. 23 min: Ocampos tries to respond by bombing down the left. He’s shoulder-blocked by Vrsaljko, who is booked for his cynicism. So having said that, naturally Atletico take the lead. And what a mistake in the Marseille defence. Mandanda rolls a pass out to Zambo Anguissa, who takes a horrible swipe at the ball and shanks it to Gabi. He immediately, and very cleverly, slips it forward to Griezmann. The striker has a clear run at goal from 30 yards. He’s not looking this gift horse in the mouth, and slips a low shot into the bottom left. And after Marseille starting so well, too. 20 min: Thauvin, deep on the right, looks to find Ocampos in the Atletico area with a curler towards the far post. He’s not far off. Oblak claims, but Marseille are causing Atletico quite a few problems here. 19 min: Payet tries to Le Tissier a dropping ball into the net from 30 yards, with a lazy waft of his wand-like leg. Not quite as easy as the old Southampton legend used to make it look, that skill. 17 min: Ocampos bursts down the left. For a second, it looks as though he’ll make it all the way to the box, but he’s ushered inside into traffic and the move breaks down. In the middle, the heavily involved Koke ensures the lurking Germain doesn’t get anywhere near a speculative cross. 15 min: But Atletico come straight back at Marseille. This time a half-clearance falls to Koke, who acrobatically leaps high and flicks a volley towards the top left from distance. It’s always going wide, but that’s their first shot in anger. 14 min: ... and loops it harmlessly into the area. Luiz Gustavo clears. 13 min: Zambo Anguissa clumsily bundles Correa to the ground, just to the right of the Marseille area. A chance for Atletico to load the box. Koke stands over the set piece ... 12 min: Sarr strides forward down the inside-right channel and unleashes a creamy low diagonal drive inches wide of the left-hand post. Oblak had that one covered, though. 11 min: Marseille are enjoying the lion’s share of possession so far. Atletico, the more experienced European campaigners, look strangely out of sorts. They can’t string more than a couple of passes together at the moment. 9 min: Diego Costa clatters into Rami, having glanced at the Marseille defender with intent before making the hit. It’s a foul, nothing more, a good old-fashioned clump to let someone know what’s what. But the referee gives him a bollocking anyway, perhaps pointing out that there are limits, and the notoriously cheeky striker would do well to stay within them. 7 min: Atletico launch their first meaningful attack of the match, Correa and Griezmann combining down the inside-right to half-decent effect. But Marseille hold their line and Atletico can’t break through it. Meanwhile here’s Thomas Jenkins: “I can understand why one would want to give one’s younger self a bit of a slap on the back for choosing Atletico over the big bad Real, but it must be a bit much for fans of Getafe, Rayo, Leganes and the other lesser Madrid teams to hear Torres name a massive club like Atletico the difficult choice. Not to be a meanie, it’s a sweet story. He said, being a meanie.” 6 min: Koke brings down Saar out on the Marseille right. The free kick’s hoicked into the mixer, and only half cleared by an uncharacteristically shaky Atletico. Rami meets the ball, 20 yards out, and sends it whistling wide of the right-hand post. Not far off, and had that been on target, Oblak might have been in a little trouble. 4 min: What a chance for Marseille to take an early lead. Payet and Thauvin play a long-distance one-two in the midfield. The former bursts towards the Atletico box, and slips a pass down the inside-right channel to release Germain into the area! He’s only got Oblak to beat, but leans back and blooters a wild, panicky effort miles over the bar. That really should be 1-0 to the French side. 2 min: The smoke is still billowing across the field of play. This is a complete nonsense. Through the 1940s London pea-souper, you can just about see both teams booting long balls up and down the pitch in the 1980s style. Finally, we’re off! With smoke from the pre-match DJ/dance display still wafting across the pitch, Marseille boot the ball out of play straight from the kick-off. Atletico deal with the resulting throw, deep in their own half, easily enough.. The teams are out! No they’re not. Both sets of players are in the tunnel, champing at the bit. But they can’t go anywhere, because out on the pitch, a set by sub-Eurovision DJ duo Ofenbach is overrunning. The Uefa suits really like the Super Bowl, don’t they. What a fiasco. But finally the musicians and dancers make way for the footballers. And despite it all, there’s a cracking atmosphere at the Stade de Lyon, as you’d expect for a major European final, both sets of supporters giving free rein to their hopes and dreams. And while we’re on the subject of Uefa’s organisational genius, here’s Kári Tulinius: “I will miss tonight’s game, having thought it would be played tomorrow. The one thing that people know about the Europa League is that it’s on Thursday nights. That’s pretty much the extent of its ‘brand’, as far as I can tell.” Atletico may be the favourites tonight, but here’s a stat that will give them a little pause for thought nonetheless. The man with the most assists in all competitions in Europe’s top five leagues this season is ... Dimitri Payet. The Marseille captain has racked up 22, one more than Kevin De Bruyne of Premier League champions Manchester City, and four more than a certain Lionel Messi. Also, just one behind Messi on the list with 17: Florian Thauvin, also of Marseille. That is some mighty fine footballing. But can they prise open Atletico’s famously parsimonious defence? While we wait for the big kick-off, a reminder of how these teams got to the final ... Some lovely words from the aforementioned Fernando Torres, who has been telling BT Sport why he is Atletico through and through. “When you grow up in Madrid, there is an easy choice of becoming an Real Madrid supporter, and then you have the difficult way, which is to support Atletico Madrid. When I was five years old I did not really like football, but my grandpa was a huge Atletico fan so he was trying to explain the story of why he supported the club, what it means, the workers’ club. And when I was ten, I was able to do the trial to become an Atletico player. And since then I support this club. My dream was to be able to come from the stand to the pitch to score one goal. So in front of me is the dream final: a chance to win a trophy with my club. This might be the last chance I have.” Both sets of fans seem to be enjoying themselves in Lyon’s Groupama Stadium as kick off approaches. Some pre-match reading courtesy of our man Jonathan Wilson. He’s been reacquainting himself with Florian Thauvin, who endured a tough time at Newcastle but has blossomed at Marseille. Marseille had been worried about the fitness of Dimitri Payet. But their captain (and erstwhile West Ham schemer) shrugs off a thigh complaint to make the starting XI. Bouna Sarr also makes the team, despite recently dislocating his shoulder. Atletico had been hoping to recall Vitolo. But the winger’s hamstring problem sees him miss out on the big match. Diego Costa, once of Chelsea, leads their attack ... though what price another former Blue, Fernando Torres, coming on to score the winner? Torres scored in Chelsea’s 2013 final victory over Benfica, but he’s never won a major prize with his boyhood club. A fairytale in the making, right there. Marseille: Mandanda, Sarr, Rami, Gustavo, Amavi, Zambo, Sanson, Thauvin, Payet, Ocampos, Germain. Subs: Pele, Sakai, Kamara, Rolando, Mitroglou, N’Jie, Lopez. Atletico Madrid: Oblak, Vrsaljko, Gimenez, Godin, Lucas, Correa, Gabi, Saul, Koke, Griezmann, Costa. Subs: Werner, Filipe Luis, Thomas, Torres, Savic, Juanfran, Gameiro. Referee: Bjorn Kuipers (Holland). The Europa League doesn’t count for much these days; that’s what some keep saying, anyway. But tell it to fans of Liverpool, who watched horrified through slits between their fingers as their side let a lead slip in the final against Sevilla in 2016. Or of Manchester United, who wildly celebrated the completion of their European curriculum vitae this time last year against Ajax. Or of Arsenal, who would have moved heaven and earth to give Arsène Wenger an appropriate send-off tonight. Yeah, it still counts for something all right. Don’t let the naysayers prevail. The 2018 final will be contested by between two clubs with a proper European pedigree. Marseille conquered the continent in 1993, the very first victors of the Champions League era. Atlético Madrid by comparison don’t have a European Cup to their name, despite coming within a minute of victory in 1974 and 2014, and losing a penalty shoot-out in 2016 ... but they do have the 1962 Cup Winners Cup plus two Europa League triumphs in 2010 and 2012 to soften the blow. Atlético start as favourites tonight in Lyon. They currently stand as the number-two team in La Liga; started their campaign this season in the Champions League; and have significantly the better record in Europe in recent times. Diego Simeone has already won this trophy with Atlético, during the infancy of his reign in 2012, and his team have been serious contenders for more continental silverware ever since ... but let’s not open the wound of those near misses in the Champions League again. A third Europa League title would erase a lot of that pain; their calm, patient, ruthless dispatching of Arsenal in the semis suggests some European redemption is very much on their minds. Marseille by contrast stand fourth in Ligue 1, and stuttered a little en route to this final. Having taken a 2-0 first-leg lead in the semis against Salzburg, they gave it up in the return, but squeaked through thanks to a late extra-time goal against the run of play, scored from a corner that never should have been awarded. They’ve never beaten Atlético (though admittedly the sample is only two matches, a 0-0 draw and a 2-1 defeat in Madrid in the Champions League groups back in 2008). They’ve only won one of their nine matches in Europe this season away from the Stade Vélodrome. They’ve only won four of 15 games against Spanish opposition, while Atlético by comparison have only lost once in 12 matches against French clubs. Oh, and a team from France has never won the Fairs Cup, Uefa Cup or Europa League. But then nobody expected Marseille’s 1993 vintage to beat the Milan of van Basten, Baresi, Maldini and Papin. And look what happened there. Will Diego Simeone’s brilliant battlers win the trophy their recent efforts on the continent have deserved? Or will Rudi García’s talented but unpredictable team shine on the big day and finally bring another major European title back to the Stade Vélodrome? It’s perfectly poised. It’s Olympique de Marseille versus Club Atlético de Madrid. It’s the 2018 Europa League final ... and it is, very much, unquestionably, oh yes, on! Kick off: 8.45pm local time at the Stade de Lyon; 7.45pm in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/17/the-sound-of-music-review-julie-andrews-christopher-plummer","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T08:00:24Z","webTitle":"The Sound of Music review – the hills are still alive with joyous energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/17/the-sound-of-music-review-julie-andrews-christopher-plummer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/17/the-sound-of-music-review-julie-andrews-christopher-plummer","fields":{"headline":"The Sound of Music review – the hills are still alive with joyous energy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Sound of Music is now rereleased in cinemas and now almost everyone – certainly me – has surrendered to the radioactive dairy cream of its power. Unlike with Abba, though, that conquest is not entirely complete. There is one person who still reportedly holds out against The Sound of Music and that is the 88-year-old Christopher Plummer, the actor who played Baron Von Trapp, and who has called the film “awful and sentimental and gooey”. I agree with the third adjective and a little with the second. The title is so familiar it’s possible to overlook its existentially pedantic weirdness. The comic Katherine Ryan recalled that she once had a much younger boyfriend who asked if it was true that the movie Titanic was based on a true story. The same incredulity almost applies to The Sound of Music, based on the true story of the Von Trapp Family Singers, who toured a good deal in the late 1930s and finally left Austria for America quite openly. The movie version was adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical, itself inspired by the 1956 German film Die Trapp Familie, whose screenwriter George Hurdalek created this essential romance, and is credited here. His story has a kind of transcendent, mythic status, over and above anything that might have happened in actuality. And it often does seem to challenge expectations. (Wait. Austrian Catholic nuns who were … anti-Nazi?) Julie Andrews is Maria, first seen singing and spinning, arms spread wide, on the Untersberg near Salzburg. She is the headstrong novitiate whose childlike impulsiveness is looked on with kindly indulgence by the wise old Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood). The Abbess is to lead the classic number How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? The answer to that question is tacitly provided by the fact that it is reprised as Maria walks up the aisle on her wedding day. The implication is indelicate. The Mother tells Maria that she is to take a job (salary not discussed) with a grumpy and yet swoon-worthily handsome widower, decorated naval officer Captain Von Trapp, who has seven children and orders them about with his bosun’s whistle. In this role, Plummer wears a chi-chi tailored suit that doesn’t look very 1930s: it’s the sort of outfit Brian Epstein would have bought for one of his clients from a shop in Carnaby Street. Maria teaches the children to sing and of course falls in love with their father. Bad news for the elegant and worldly Baroness (Eleanor Parker) with whom the Captain had an understanding, but good news for their amusing friend, the dapper, cynical bohemian Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn), a music promoter who wishes to sign up the whole family as an adorable singing act. The film has its own Judenfrage: is Max supposed to be Jewish? Or gay? (Effectively a distant cousin to Joel Grey’s MC in Cabaret?) If he is, this means that one of the film’s most heroic lines looks naive and patronising: when Von Trapp rebukes Detweiler for his shrugging unconcern in the face of Austria’s imminent Anschluss by the Nazi Germans. “You know I have no political convictions. Can I help it if other people do?”; “Oh yes, you can help it. You must help it.” There is also “Professor Kohner”, the off-camera toyshop owner who at Max’s request sells the family the puppet theatre that they use for their sensational number The Lonely Goatherd. But the film is never clear on his point. Well, who can doubt its heart is in the right place, or doubt the sledgehammer punch and power of its musical numbers? Perhaps especially Edelweiss, a tune that really does sound as if it is an authentic folksong. The way in which child actors are directed has evolved a fair bit since 1965, but even the children’s quaint performances have their charm, and there is incidentally real tension in Von Trapp’s final confrontation with the creepy telegram boy Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte). The location work in Salzburg has an ineffable charm and it’s all performed with such zinging, joyous energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/18/a-love-that-never-dies-review-parents-grief-explored","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T10:00:56Z","webTitle":"A Love That Never Dies review – parents' grief explored","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/18/a-love-that-never-dies-review-parents-grief-explored","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/18/a-love-that-never-dies-review-parents-grief-explored","fields":{"headline":"A Love That Never Dies review – parents' grief explored","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Here’s an especially tricky film to assess. To see it is to risk feeling as though you are intruding upon some wounding, deeply personal loss. To rate it risks invalidating the participants’ grief. The plain facts are these: this is an independently funded and released documentary by Jimmy Edmonds and Jane Harris, a British couple whose son Josh died, aged 22, in a car accident while touring Ho Chi Minh city in 2011. In the ensuing years, the pair have travelled America, reaching out to fellow parents who’ve ended up in the unnatural position of having to bury their children, and inviting them to speak about the unspeakable. Responses from tearful defeat to unending rage are collected and assembled, offset by those rituals of remembrance that the subjects find consoling: Jimmy, touchingly, clings to his son’s vast photo archive. The interviewees, however, come from a limited spectrum. Though the film-makers make a brief stop-off to mourn the passing of a teenager who volunteered in poorer neighbourhoods, there is a glaring shortage of input from communities that have suffered disproportionately from burying their young; it would have meant venturing beyond the comfortably appointed suburban homes Edmonds and Harris gravitated towards. The road movie framing lets some west coast sunshine in on these dark, depressing topics, but equally opens the film-makers to accusations of grief tourism: there’s often more scenery – the Grand Canyon, desert highways – than real clarity or insight. There’s one compelling encounter with the parents of a boy slain by his father’s gun, and we shouldn’t discount the project’s inbuilt cathartic value. Yet these 75 minutes keep raising questions the directors don’t have the time, distance or editorial rigour to answer satisfactorily. Can privilege help cushion death’s hammer blow? Does money make it easier to outrun grief? The film’s honesty goes only so far."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/28/honduran-villagers-take-legal-action-to-stop-mining-firm-digging-up-graves-for-gold","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"Honduran villagers take legal action to stop mining firm digging up graves for gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/honduran-villagers-take-legal-action-to-stop-mining-firm-digging-up-graves-for-gold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/28/honduran-villagers-take-legal-action-to-stop-mining-firm-digging-up-graves-for-gold","fields":{"headline":"Honduran villagers take legal action to stop mining firm digging up graves for gold","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nothing is sacred in the path of gold miners in northwestern Honduras – not even the dead. A transnational mining company, Aura Minerals, has been digging up graves in the 200-year-old cemetery near the community of Azacualpa, La Union, to clear the way to dig for gold. As many as 350 bodies have reportedly been exhumed by the company’s Honduran subsidiary, Minerales de Occidente (Minosa) since the process began last fall. The issue has divided Azacualpa, a coffee-producing community perched near the edge of the decades-old San Andres open-pit gold mine, and opened up rifts within families. Some residents fear the graveyard is the last line of defence before the Canadian-listed company will eye the community as its next extraction site. Genaro Rodriguez, a 60-year-old construction worker and coffee producer who lives in Azacualpa, hopes a legal challenge will put a stop to the debacle – a court has ordered a temporary halt to exhumations pending further investigations. “What we want is for the cemetery not to be touched,” Rodriguez said. In the cemetery, about 50 meters from where the carved-out mountainside plummets into the mine, damaged tombs indicate that some coffins have already been removed. Floresmira Lopez recently stood at her father’s grave and blocked workers from taking his remains. She blames the mining company for stress-induced health problems as well as family conflicts that have erupted over the grave-digging. The exhumations have roots in a 2012 agreement between Azacualpa and Aura Minerals’ Honduran subsidiary, Minerales de Occidente (Minosa). The agreement promised a housing relocation project for 400 families in exchange for permission to mine a handful of sites, including the hill where the cemetery sits. An addendum to the agreement gave individuals the right to agree to the graves of their relatives beings dug up, allowing the company to exhume remains with a single relative’s consent. Entire families are said to have wound up at odds with each other. Miguel Lopez, president of the Azacualpa Environmental Committee, accused the company of taking advantage of poor residents and exploiting the “love of money” to manipulate and divide the community. Some residents who have consented to exhumations have received letters setting a date and promising a cheque if they show up at the cemetery to “accompany the process”. One Azacualpa resident, who declined to give her name, confirmed she received a second instalment of compensation the day her husband’s remains were carried out of the cemetery. Payments are described as being in lieu of the housing project, not redress for digging up the deceased. The addendum sets February 2019 as the deadline for the third and final instalment, but also says payment will be contingent on clearing the cemetery. Bersy Rivera, a single mother and one of the plaintiffs listed on the recent legal action, believes the company aims to negotiate “packages of the dead” to exhume as many corpses as possible in exchange for a single housing compensation deal. 85-year-old Salvador Garcia, for example, faces pressure to authorize exhumation for his three children and parents-in-law. But he is only willing to sign off on his children’s remains, saying he doesn’t want to spark problems with his in-laws’ grandchildren, who oppose exhumation. Mayor of the municipality of La Unión, Victor Hugo Alvarado, who in last year’s election unseated the mayor who had cut Azacualpa out of the municipal budget, believes both sides failed to clarify the details, leaving the agreement “very open” to confusion and conflict. Aside from the exhumations, local residents accused the mine of having adverse health and environmental impacts. Minosa declined to comment on the suspension of the exhumations and allegations of manipulation and non-compliance with agreements. The parent company Aura Minerals did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In recent months, the exhumations have taken place against a backdrop of a worsening state crackdown on social movements, amid protests against alleged election fraud, including evidence of extrajudicial killings, according to the United Nations. President Juan Orlando Hernández’s re-election solidified an economic model, ushered in through the 2009 military coup, that champions pro-extractive industry policies. Minosa paid over CAD$12m (£7m) in taxes and fees in Honduras in 2016. Plaintiffs in Azacualpa are pursuing further legal action to protect the cemetery by seeking to nullify the 2012 and 2016 agreements. Ramiro Lara of the Association of Non-Governmental Organisms of Honduras (ASONOG) expects the case to expose “irregularities” in the signing of the accords and the exhumations. “Demonstrating the human rights violations will allow us to prevent the continued exhumation of (relatives) of people who adamantly oppose this action,” Lara said. “The exploitation of the Cemetery Mountain, which is one of the company’s strong intentions, would be avoided.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/16/carmichael-rail-line-engineering-firm-says-it-has-demobilised-from-adani-project","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T09:28:31Z","webTitle":"Carmichael rail line: engineering firm says it has 'demobilised' from Adani project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/carmichael-rail-line-engineering-firm-says-it-has-demobilised-from-adani-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/16/carmichael-rail-line-engineering-firm-says-it-has-demobilised-from-adani-project","fields":{"headline":"Carmichael rail line: engineering firm says it has 'demobilised' from Adani project","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The global engineering company AECOM, the firm that had been designing Adani’s $2.2bn rail line to its Carmichael coalmine, says that it has “demobilised” and is no longer working the project with the Indian conglomerate – but Adani says it is still “100% committed to the Carmichael project”. Engineering design contracts often have several milestones at which point the design is reviewed and the project then moves to another phase. The AECOM contract was ended at such a milestone with all contracts honoured. But sources have told Guardian Australia the expectation had been that AECOM would shepherd the rail project to its conclusion. Adani remains silent on its attempts to finance the Carmichael project, having missed two deadlines, the most recent in March. AECOM’s departure from the project comes amid increasing uncertainty around Adani’s ability to finance the Carmichael coalmine. The company had sought assistance for its rail project through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) but the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has vetoed a federal loan. Adani has also put part of its Townsville office up for rent. A spokesman from AECOM told Guardian Australia the company was no longer working on the Adani rail project. “Our people have demobilised,” he said. “We’ve handed over our design to the client. It’s up to them what happens after this.” A spokeswoman for Adani said: “Adani’s commercial relationship with AECOM continues. The current phase of their engineering and design for the rail project is now complete. “AECOM remains an important partner for Adani and we appreciate the quality of work they have completed to date and look forward to continuing to work with them. “It is normal for contractor numbers to change through the life of a project as milestones are reached and stages of work are completed ... a new phase of activity on the project has begun, this involves working with other consultants and advisors to prepare for mine infrastructure construction and operation. “We remain 100% committed to the Carmichael project.” Guardian Australia understands AECOM stopped working on the project after the engineering design company was unable to gain access to key sites in order to progress its design work. The reasons for that are unclear. The executive director at Market Forces, Julien Vincent, said it was another setback for the project. “In the past six months, Adani has lost its mine construction partner in Downer EDI, while Queensland rail company Aurizon has withdrawn its Naif application to build an alternative rail line to the Galilee basin,” he said. “It’s time Australian governments and Adani both realise that coal is the past and instead focus on the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/may/16/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-uk-wont-benefit-from-free-trade-deal-with-us-say-harvard-academics-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T16:55:24Z","webTitle":"May loses 15th Lords vote on Brexit bill as peers vote to keep EU environmental standards - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/may/16/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-uk-wont-benefit-from-free-trade-deal-with-us-say-harvard-academics-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/may/16/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-uk-wont-benefit-from-free-trade-deal-with-us-say-harvard-academics-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"May loses 15th Lords vote on Brexit bill as peers vote to keep EU environmental standards - Politics live","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May has suffered her 15th defeat in the House of Lords on the EU withdrawal bill after peers voted to create a body to enforce EU environmental standards after Brexit. The bill is due to complete its third reading in the Lords later, and will then return to the Commons where the government will try to overturn some or all of the defeats. For a helpful list of all 14 other defeats, read this blog on the Labour Lords website. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, has urged MPs to reject a Labour motion saying the government should have to publish its internal papers on its Brexit customs plans. Speaking in the debate he said: It would not be in the national interest to release information that would form part of our negotiating position, and in order to ensure good governance, it is in all our interests, including the interests of those who might have the ambition at some very distant date to serve in a Labour government, to preserve the system of cabinet government that allows for good and well thought through decisions. MPs will vote on the motion at 7pm, but there is no indication that the government faces a rebellion on this and that Labour is likely to win. The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has a greater “depth and breadth of support than is recognised in the west”, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has said. Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to appear before the European parliament at a closed-door meeting possibly as soon as next week, according to the parliament president, Antonio Tajani. Peter Chapman has resigned as the Scottish Conservatives rural affairs spokesman in the Scottish parliament after backing a planning application without declaring an interest. That’s all from me for day. Thanks for the comments. Greener UK, a coalition of 13 environmental organisations, has welcomed the Lords vote. Its chair, Shaun Spiers, said in a statement. The government has promised world-leading protection of the environment after Brexit. The defeat today shows that parliamentarians of all parties believe that it is failing to live up to this ambition. It was encouraging to see the prime minister launch a 25-year plan for the environment and promise a strong environmental watchdog. But these announcements and pledges amount to little more than words on paper without the power to hold government to account. It is imperative that the government now gives the promised green watchdog power to initiate legal action and ensure that vital environmental principles are put into primary legislation. Until it does, it is clear that our environment will have weaker protection when we leave the EU than it does now. Far from being ‘world-leading’, we will be in the environmental third division. Here are some extracts from the Lords debate. I’ve taken the quotes from the Press Association wires. Lord Krebs said his amendment was necessary because existing environmental protections in the bill were too weak. He said: We have heard many times that the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that everything is the same the day after Brexit as it was the day before. Yet for environmental protection things will not be the same. We’re talking about the protection of our air quality, our water quality, rivers, oceans, habitats and biodiversity. Although the rules protecting our environment will be translated into UK legislation, crucially the environmental principles underpinning those rules will not and the current mechanisms for enforcing the rules will disappear and not be replaced. Lord Framlingham, a Conservative, said peers voting against the bill were “wreckers” who were damaging the reputation of the Lords. He said: I believe I am speaking up for this House and for the country. To set ourselves up in such a disreputable way as guardians of wisdom and the common good when so many of the amendments we have passed have simply been an attempt to wreck the Bill and thwart the will of the people is both false and dangerous. John Gummer (Lord Deben), the Conservative former environment secretary, backed the amendment. He said: This is a chance for us to vote seriously for the future, to do here what we have done 10 years ago with the Climate Change Act, which this House would never dream of saying was other than a success. If the prime minister is right and we want a world-class watchdog and we want to set standards for the whole world there is no better way than taking the lessons of the Climate Change Act and putting them here on the face of this Act as the Government actually promised it would. And Chris Smith, a Labour former environment secretary, also spoke in favour of the amendment. He said: The irreparable damage that may be done is damage to the environment and our health in the future if we lose the safeguards and protections that we have for our environment ... We are only taking action on these issues because of the prospect of infraction from the EU. If we lose that lever, then we lose the ability to tackle these major environmental issues. It is essential that we insist not just as part of the consultation, but we insist now that part of the powers of a new environmental watchdog must include the ability to take that sort of legal action. The government has suffered its 15th defeat in the Lords on the EU withdrawal bill. Peers voted by 294 to 244 - a majority of 50 - in favour of an amendment to create a watchdog to enforce EU environmental standards after Brexit. Meanwhile there are reports that Sajid Javid, the home secretary, had a rather chaotic encounter with the press in Brussels today after a meeting with Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman. These are from the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge. Lord Krebs, the zoologist and crossbencher who tabled the environmental protection, has just wrapped up the Lords debate. He said he was not satisfied by Callanan’s assurances and that he would be pushing his amendment to a vote. And peers are voting now. Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister, is now wrapping up the Lords debate for the government. He says the government has published its plans for a new post-Brexit environmental watchdog. And it is a consultation, he stresses. The proposals could change. He says, for that reason, the Krebs amendment is premature. In response to a question, Callanan says current EU environmental rules would continue to apply during the transition. John Gummer, the Conservative peer and chair of the committee on climate change, asks if that means people will be able to take an environmental protection case to the European court of justice right up to the end of the transition. Callanan says there will be further legislation. Another peer intervenes. Will EU environmental legislation be enforceable in the UK right up to the end of the transition? Callanan says the UK will be bound by EU law during the transition. But there will be further legislation enacting the transition. In the Lords Maggie Jones, the shadow environment minister, is wrapping up the debate now for Labour. (See 4.21pm.) She says the amendment is the only way to protect the environment for future generations. And in the Commons MPs are now debating the Labour motion saying the government should publish the cabinet papers explaining its plans for a customs partnership and “maximum facilitation”, the alternative post-Brexit customs option. If passed, this would be binding because Labour is using the “humble address” mechanism. Here is the Labour motion. That an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the following papers be laid before the House: all papers, presentations and economic analyses from 1 January 2018 up to and including 16 May 2018 prepared for the European Union exit and trade (strategy and negotiations) cabinet sub-committee, and its sub-committees, on the government’s preferred post-Brexit customs arrangements including a customs partnership and maximum facilitation. Last year Labour had two good hits with “humble address” motions. It used them to demand the publication of the government’s Brexit impact assessment and universal credit project assessments. Government whips thought they would lose if the motions were put to a vote and so Tory MPs abstained, with the result that the motions were passed and the documents were handed over to select committees. But last month Labour tried to use a “humble address” to get the government to publish confidential government papers about Windrush - but failed when it lost by almost 100 votes. And again the Tories must be confident of winning again. There are a dozen or more Conservatives willing to rebel over Europe. But most MPs accept the convention that the government should be able to keep some policy advice private, Tory MPs have been briefed in outline on what the customs plans are and a white paper has been promised for next month. This is not analogous with the Brexit impact assessment situation, where some Tory MPs felt there was a cover-up. There is no evidence we’re going to see a Tory revolt tonight. In the House of Lords peers are now debating the third reading of the EU withdrawal bill. Unlike in the House of Commons, peers vote on amendments to the bill at third reading. There are various amendments tabled for debate today (see here - pdf) but the main one is one that has been tabled by Lord Krebs, a crossbencher, with Labour and Lib Dem support. It says the government must set up a body to maintain EU standards of environmental protection. The government is expected to lose when it gets put to a vote. Maggie Jones, a shadow environment minister, defends the amendment in a Labour Lords blog. Here’s an excerpt. A cross party amendment, tabled by crossbencher Lord Krebs and with formal support from myself, Conservative Lord Deben and LibDem Baroness Bakewell, seeks to set out the environmental principles that should underpin UK law post-Brexit. It should not be necessary. Last November, Mr Gove acknowledged the need to set out such principles and the remit for the statutory body which would hold public bodies to account. Then, late last week, we had first sight of a much delayed consultation document addressing these issues. Meanwhile, rumours abound that Gove has lost a battle with Cabinet colleagues on the proposed powers of the watchdog. It certainly seems that way. The document out for consultation is a bitter disappointment to NGOs and individuals concerned about our environment standards post Brexit – particularly when we have relied on Europe to deliver for us in the past. For example, it makes it clear that the application of any principles would be subservient to other government priorities. The environment is portrayed as the enemy of growth rather than complementary; and there is no understanding of the advantages of an environmental net gain principle in wider government policies. During his Commons statement Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, and a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, repeatedly said that Labour would not be able to implement its plans to nationalise the railways under EU rules. After one Labour MP challenged him to renationalise the rail network, he replied: What they [Labour] are proposing is illegal under European law. But is he right? Until recently the firm consensus was no, although new EU regulations would certainly make blanket nationalisation much harder to enact. Five years ago the TSSA transport union was highlighting a thinktank report saying “European rules do not dictate that railways must be fully privatised”. Last year an academic assessment of 26 Labour policy proposals concluded that EU would only have a “negligible” impact in terms of preventing a Corbyn government implementing its plans. The report was written up in a Guardian story at the time, and here is an extract from our report. The EU has a policy that prevents a national railway monopoly, but this is to make sure a pan-European freight network thrives, which is something Labour supporters would probably back. Most European countries have a nationalised railway system. French president Emmanuel Macron recently nationalised a shipyardjointly owned with an Italian rival to prevent the domestic firm losing control. He was able to press ahead with his protectionist measure under Maastricht and Lisbon Treaty rules that leave room for policy objectives for which state aid can be considered compatible. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications director, came to the same conclusions in an article he wrote last year for the New European. He said: As a cursory glance at state-owned railways all over Europe will confirm, ownership is not a problem. Most European countries have state-owned railways. The UK is the exception, not the rule. It is true that EU law requires that infrastructure (rails, stations, etc.) be separate from the train services using them, but both can be publicly-owned or controlled, as they are in many EU countries. Railway companies from other EU countries, such as those operating services between Ireland and Northern Ireland or to and from the continent through the Channel Tunnel, are also entitled to offer services within the UK if they meet certain conditions. There is no reason why the UK could not bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expire. Recently Sabine Weyand, who is deputy to Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, made the same point on Twitter. According to Grayling’s aides, these assurances do not take into account that EU regulations have changed. Previous rules required separation of track and train. New rules, the fourth railway package, says franchises have to be put out to tender. Here is a summary of the fourth railway package. Here is the key regulation, regulation (EU) 2016/2338, and here is an extract. Public service contracts for public passenger transport services by rail should be awarded on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure, except for those cases set out in this Regulation. In a recent article for the House magazine Andy Tarrant, an EU and competition lawyer and an adviser to the Labour party, said that even this would not stop Labour implementing its nationalisation plans. Tarrant said: The UK’s island geography does make the merits of cross-border passenger rail services far less obvious than they can be on the continent. Nonetheless, the EU’s fourth rail package requires companies to competitively tender for rail passenger services everywhere in the EU, including in the UK. However, this does not prevent a bidder from being state owned. There are likely to be substantial economies of scale and scope which mean that a nationalised company would usually have a bidding advantage. In addition, the state can set quality, social and labour standards that state owned companies may in practice be better able to meet. Competitive tendering began in German passenger rail in 1996, twenty years earlier than required by the EU rules, but Deutsche Bahn, the state owned rail operator, still has over 75% market share (and its main competitors are regional operators owned by local German government). There is also nothing to stop a British government from nationalising any company winning a bid if it turned out not to be the already state owned company. But Brexiters argue that, in practice, it might not be that simple, because EU state aid rules could get in the way. This is from an article by David Scullion, deputy editor at BrexitCentral. Under the new rules, it will be technically possible to have a state monopoly on rail, if rail franchises are subject to competition and state-controlled bodies manage to win every contract. But under this system, the government could comply with the new legislation but be caught out by EU state aid rules, which happened to the French government when it tried to maintain a state monopoly on rail. In order to comply with the 4th Railway Package the French split up their state-owned railway SNCF into separate entities, SNCF Mobilités (operations and trains) and SNCF Réseau (infrastructure manager), both of which were wholly owned by the state railway SNCF (EPIC). But the plan failed to comply with EU rules on state aid and a recent ECJ judgement found similar structures in France were not compliant. Subsequently, a review commissioned by the French government recommended that both companies (Mobilités and Réseau) should be privatised. In the Commons MPs are now debating a Labour motion on the Grenfell Tower fire which, among other things, calls upon the government to honour its promise to permanently rehouse all the survivors by 14 June, the first anniversary of the disaster. James Brokenshire, the new housing secretary, told the Commons that not all survivors would be rehoused within 12 months. As the Press Association reports, he said of the 210 households in need of a new home, 201 have accepted offers of temporary or permanent accommodation. Of this number 138 have moved in, 64 into temporary accommodation and 74 into permanent accommodation. Brokenshire said: While progress has been made, there is no question that this has been too slow. As a result, some households will still be in emergency accommodation in June. It was always going to be a challenge to respond to an unprecedented tragedy on this scale, it has taken time to purchase suitable homes, adapt and refurbish them to meet people’s needs and the higher safety standards, but this is clearly not good enough. It is understandable the community will feel disappointed and let down. I too am very concerned, especially to see people who accepted an offer of a permanent home still living in emergency accommodation. I am therefore establishing at pace what further action can be done by the government or by the council to speed up this process. The council now has over 300 properties available to those who need them, and my department will continue to work with the council to ensure people are given whatever support they need to be rehoused as swiftly as possible. Jeff Silvester, the chief operating officer of AggregateIQ, is giving evidence to the Commons culture committee as part of its fake news inquiry. AggregateIQ worked for Vote Leave during the EU referendum campaign and has been implicated in the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook data and referendum spending controversy. My colleague Carole Cadwalladr wrote about the firm here. You can watch the hearing here. And here is the written evidence to the committee submitted by the firm (pdf). The east coast rail line will be temporarily renationalised, the government has decided, after operators Virgin and Stagecoach could no longer meet the promised payments in the £3.3bn contract. Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of being “in compete disarray” over its Brexit negotiations, using prime minister’s questions to warn that delays and uncertainty caused by cabinet divisions were risking jobs and investment. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, has said the cabinet may need weeks to thrash out the two customs options that have divided ministers, as it emerged the government is taking legal advice on both models. The government will commit around £400m to cover the cost for councils and housing associations of replacing potentially dangerous cladding from high-rise blocks in the wake of the Grenfell tower disaster, Theresa May has announced. Labour would end the “hostile environment” immigration policy and close the Yarl’s Wood and Brook House detention centres, Diane Abbott has pledged, saying the party should not be “running scared of the Daily Mail and the Daily Express” on the issue. The Scottish secretary has accused the Scottish government of manufacturing an “unnecessary row” over Brexit after Holyrood voted to reject the EU withdrawal bill. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, has told MPs that the government’s customs partnership proposal would make it easier to deal with the Irish border question. Giving evidence to the Northern Ireland affairs committee she said the customs partnership proposal and the alternative “maximum facilitation” (max fac) model both had “defects”. (See 11.31am.) But she went on: Both of the customs options that are on the table could potentially be made to work. There is no doubt that a customs partnership hybrid model makes the Irish border situation easier, there is no doubt that the question of the Irish border is resolved by the customs partnership in an easier way than maximum facilitation. Britain is the largest contributor to security collaboration in the EU, a former spy chief has said. As the Press Association reports, the ex-MI5 director general Lord Evans of Weardale told a Lords committee that Britain was a “net contributor” in terms of the “information flows and expertise” that it provided, adding that the country was “very good at security”. He went on: We have been investing in terms of money, legal powers and capabilities for a long time. That means that we are able to contribute heavily to the security of our European friends. We benefit from that as well but we contribute a great deal. Probably, I would say, the biggest contribution of any of the countries in the European Union. Conservative MPs will be whipped to vote against Labour’s Commons motion demanding the release of cabinet documents relating to the government’s two proposed options for post-Brexit customs arrangements, the Press Association reports. A Downing Street source said: We will be opposing the motion. It is a long-held and important principle that cabinet ministers are able to receive candid advice from civil servants and it is important that the confidentiality of that advice remains. Here is the full text of Chris Grayling’s statement. And here is the news release from the Department for Transport. Aslef, the train drivers’ union, has welcomed Chris Grayling’s East Coast announcement. This is from its general secretary, Mick Whelan. We welcome the decision by the secretary of state for transport today to bring the East Coast back into public ownership – at least temporarily, using the vehicle of directly operated railways ltd – and hope that he will now bring the rest of our railways back into public ownership, too. Because this is the third time in ten years that a private company has messed up on the east coast main line. When it was run in the public sector, it returned more than £1bn to the Treasury. It’s important that staff, and passengers, are properly protected while, once again, the transport secretary tries to patch up a failing franchise system that everyone knows doesn’t work. Britain’s railways should be run, successfully, as a public service, not for private profit. Because they cannot do it. It’s only sad that Tory dogma – wedded to the failed model of privatisation – means they will return this line to the private sector, doubtless to fail again, in the not too distant future. Labour’s John Mann says when people in his constituency voted for Brexit, one of the advantages was the government would be able to renationalise the railways. Why won’t Grayling take advantage of that? Grayling says if you take the rail service into public control, and starve it of capital, passengers will be worse off. Labour’s Jenny Chapman challenges Grayling to stand up and say, ‘My name’s Chris Grayling and I’ve just renationalised a railway.’ Grayling says he does not think nationalisation is the long-term answer. He says if you look at the rail service in France you’ll see why. Labour’s Hilary Benn asks why Grayling did not just say he was renationalising the East Coast mainline. Grayling says the operator of last resort will be a publicly run service. But he does not use the term renationalisation. Here is my colleague Gwyn Topham’s story about Chris Grayling’s announcement. Grayling says the rail network gets more investment under a public/private partnership than it would if it were state-owned. He says Labour does not realise that, under its plans, rail would have to compete for public money with other services. Grayling is responding to McDonald. He says he could have made an announcement to the stock exchange at 7am, but decided to make a statement to MPs instead. He says McDonald’s proposals would be illegal under EU law. Yet Labour wants to keep the UK close to the EU, he says. Grayling says Labour’s rail policy would be illegal under EU law. He says there is no bailout. The rail line will still make a substantial contribution to the taxpayer. This is the best way of taking this forward, he says. On the millennial railcard story, he says McDonald should not believe everything he reads in the papers. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, says he was given sight of the statement half an hour in advance. But he was not given an electronic copy. He says Grayling has done this before. He is treating the opposition and the Commons with contempt, he says. He says today’s story about the rollout of the millennial railcard being delayed shows how the government has nothing to offer young people. He says it is wrong not to put restrictions on what Stagecoach and Virgin can do next. He says franchising is at the heart of the proposed partnership. But the partnership model is flawed, he says. He says every announcement is “a smokescreen to divert attention from the failings of his policy”. He says the it is ridiculous to talk about a ownership of last resort. This is public ownership, he says. He says Grayling is only opposed to public ownership when Labour proposes it. He says the answer is obvious. He says Grayling should accept that an integrated railway in public ownership would be best. Grayling is still speaking. He says Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands and former John Lewis boss, will be advising the government. He says the companies have paid a high operational price for what happened. He says he is not minded to put further restrictions on them. But that is only a provisional decision, he says. He says 92% of passengers on the East Coast mainline say they are happy with the service. Today is he recreating one of the UK’s most iconic rail brands, and starting the process of creating a regional service, he says. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is making his statement now. He says the East Coast line is not a failing rail service. But Stagecoach and Virgin will lose £200m from the service, he says. He says in February he said he was considering two options: letting Stagecoach continue to run the service under a not-for-profit basis, or taking the service back under government control. His department has been looking at this. Today he will publish his assessement. The conclusion was that it was finely balanced. Neither option was obviously best. But he is also taking into account the desire to create a longterm East Coast partnership. Virgin Trains East Coast partnership to be terminated in June. A new operator of last resort will take control under the London and North Eastern Railways brand. An interim chair will be appointed shortly. The new LNER service will be a partnership between public and private sectors, he says. He says he does not want to disrupt services for passengers. Politics Live has just had a name check. The Conservative MP Crispin Blunt quoted from the post about the East Coast mainline at 12.46pm. He says there should be an investigation into a broken embargo. Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip, is rising to make a point of order. There is a convention that, when ministers make a statement, the opposition gets to see a copy in advance. Commercially sensitive matters can be redacted. But today Labour has not seen the text of the statement. And it is also the convention not to have statements on days set aside for opposition day debates. But that is happening too today. Brown says this is the third time this has happened. He says the intention is to take away time from the opposition. It is a “constitutional outrage”. John Bercow, the speaker, says he has been told Labour got a copy of today’s statement half an hour in advance. On the timing of the statement, he says this has happened before. But it should not, he says. He says it could be seen as “an abuse”. He says he hopes the message has got through to those at the top who are responsible. If it happens again, he will speak out again. Bercow accuses government of an “an abuse” of procedure by scheduling the rail statement today. Labour’s Siobhain McDonagh asks about plans to cut pay for people working night at Sainsbury’s. May says these are commercial decisions, but she will look at them. Kevin Hollinrake, a Conservative, says regulators are not willing to take action against those responsible for scandals at Lloyds, RBS and HBOS. May says the Financial Conduct Authority has reported on RBS. And events at HBOS constituted criminal activity. It is right that these matters are investigated. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem former leader, asks about the rail service in his Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency. May says Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is aware of these problems. May says she wants the Northern Ireland executive to return. The government will work with all parties to get it reinstated, she says. The Press Association has just snapped this. Rail services on the East Coast Main Line will be brought back under public control following the termination of the franchise agreement with Virgin Trains, Stagecoach Group said today. Andrew Jones, a Conservative, asks about broadband. Does May agree fibre is gold standard broadband. May says access to superfast broadband is important. Labour’s Karen Buck says time is running out to negotiate a bespoke Brexit deal. Why won’t May give MPs the earliest opportunity to vote on staying in the EEA. May says MPs will get many opportunities to vote. Labour’s David Drew asks about support for the mortgage interest scheme, that has now been abolished. Some parents used this to help their adult children who needed support. The withdrawal of the scheme has created problems, as Mencap has argued. May says the government will look into this. Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative, asks about a constituent whose son committed suicide after failing to get the right mental health support. May offers her condolences. The government is committed to improving mental health services, especially for children and young people. She says ministers will look into the detail of this case. May says when the UK leaves the EU it will negotiate trade deals in its own interests. She says she spoke to a number of African leaders about this at the Commonwealth conference. May says the government has not forgotten about Erasmus. It is one of the EU programmes the UK may want to remain part of after Brexit. But that will be part of the negotiation. PMQs - Snap verdict: Corbyn is starting to make it look easy. It isn’t easy, of course (winning PMQs is about the hardest task for an opposition leader), and Corbyn isn’t a natural as a parliamentary performer, but for the second week in a row, on a subject that for months he avoided at all costs, he managed to knock May all over the place. He was also more versatile than usual, combining real humour (ie, a joke that actually made people laugh, not synthetic, parliamentary humour - the laughter after his first question went on so long they will probably have to edit it out in the radio bulletins), deadly specifics (the question about HMRC staff), good attack quotes (the ones from car manufacturers), but also questions that accurately and harshly summed up the government’s failings (primarily, the absence of a Brexit negotiating position only five months before the deal is supposed to be completed). Tories who have been withering about Corbyn’s abilities should start asking themselves what it is about the government’s record that has made a Brexit PMQs such a doddle for him. May did her best to retaliate, but attacking Labour over the EU referendum sounded irrelevant and, even though she has a point about the contradictions in Labour’s Brexit policy, it is a second order issue compared to the problems with her own position. Her claim that Labour said wrongly there would never be a deal before December is a standard bit of Downing Street spin but I’m not sure it has any basis in fact (I can’t recall anyone saying on the record there would be no December deal - only a few off-the-record comments about how it looked 50/50). About the only life raft left to May was to cling to the buoyant employment figures. But, with the growth rate looking dismal (as Corbyn pointed out), that wasn’t particularly effective either. Corbyn says there are record numbers of people on zero-hour contracts, and record numbers of people in poverty. He congratulates May on dividing her cabinet into two factions (the two customs working groups) - as if that needed doing. He says the Dutch have already started training new customs officers. How many HMRC extra staff have been recruited to deal with Brexit? May says the government is making preparation for all contingencies. But she wants to correct him. Almost two thirds of the rise in employment has been from full time work, she says. And 70% of the rise in employment from 2010 has been from high-skilled work. Corbyn says he asked about extra HMRC staff. The claim they are hiring more staff won’t make up for the staff lost since 2010. The Dutch government is better prepared. The government is not ready. Jobs are at risk. The government is so busy talking to itself it cannot negotiate with the EU. If it can’t negotiate a good deal, why won’t it step aside and make way for a party that will? May says more jobs are being created. From Labour you cannot trust a word they say. They want to strike new trade deals, but they would be in a customs union that does not allow that. They have also broken their promise on student debt. Only the Tories can deliver a Brexit for all. Corbyn says the UK has the slowest growth of all major economies. Last week Airbus said its space contract would move abroad because of Brexit. How many other businesses are considering their future in this country? May says Corbyn’s position was to trigger article 50 after the referendum, with no work being done. Labour would have sold Britain out. Corbyn says the PM’s own position is not supported by the cabinet. He quotes Rolls-Royce, Ford and Vauxhall all warning about the future of trade. Michael Gove said this week there were question marks over the PM’s customs model. But at least he did not call it crazy, as Boris Johnson did. If May can’t persuade her cabinet, then how can she persuade the EU? May says Corbyn said there wouldn’t be a deal before December. But there was. British businesses are creating more jobs than ever. Jeremy Corbyn starts by praising the two officers. The police do great work. He wishes Harry and Meghan the best, and pays tribute to what Harry has achieved in talking about mental health. When the PM wrote at the weekend she wanted as little friction as possible, was she talking about EU trade or the next cabinet meeting? May says Corbyn knows she has a policy of leaving the customs union, and having as frictionless trade as possible, no hard border in Ireland and an independent trade policy. She says a shadow minister in the Lords voted for a second referendum, and a shadow aid minister tweeted in favour of one. Will he rule it out? Corbyn says there has been no progress in cabinet for five months. It is more interested in negotiating with itself than with the EU. Her latest line is in contrast to the claim would be friction free. How much friction will she accept? May says she wants to be able to trade in as frictionless way as possible. The claim trade is entirely frictionless now is wrong. Some want the UK to forget about having an independent trade policy. And some say don’t worry about the Irish border. Neither of those positions are positions of the government. There will be a white paper, she says. Theresa May starts by offering Prince Harry and Meghan Markle the best wishes of the Commons for their wedding. Simon Hoare, a Conservative, asks if food security and food production will be at the heart of future faming policy. May agrees. She says the government wants a policy that reflects the reality of life for farmers. British food has a high reputation. John Bercow says the two police officers who apprehended the killer of Jo Cox are in the gallery to watch PMQs. He tells the officers MPs honour their service and offer them the warmest welcome. There is a long, loud round of applause. Bercow says the presiding officer of the Welsh assembly is here too. But she does not get a round of applause. PMQs is starting soon. There will be one statement after PMQs. This is what Grayling, the transport secretary, is expected to announce. And here is the story we ran on this topic on Monday. Sir Bill Cash, the committee chair, is winding up. He says the Irish government and the EU are both showing “intransigence”. Bradley says people say things during negotiations. In the past the government has overcome obstacles, she says. Q: Would you rule out any extension of the transition period? Bradley says she will not be drawn on this. The implementation period will end in December 2020. The hearing is now over. Kate Hoey urges Bradley to rule out the backstop (using regulatory alignment as the means of resolving the border issue if other solutions don’t work). We can’t have it, she says. Bradley says the government does not want the backstop option. It is always wise to be sceptical of “Benedict Cumberbatch to play X” stories about political drama. Remember the one about how he was going to play Nigel Farage? The story hasn’t survived the test of time. So when I saw this on Twitter a few minutes ago, I assumed it was a spoof. But it is true. My colleague Jim Waterson has the story. Here it is. And here is how it starts. Benedict Cumberbatch is to portray the mastermind of the Brexit campaign in a new Channel 4 drama about the EU referendum. The star of Sherlock and Patrick Melrose will take on the role of Dominic Cummings, the former Michael Gove adviser who led Vote Leave to victory in 2016. The film, due to air early next year shortly before Britain leaves the EU in March, will be written by James Graham, who has won awards for his political plays such as This House and Ink. The TV production, partly based on books written by the Sunday Times political editor, Tim Shipman, and the former Downing Street director of communications Craig Oliver, is likely to examine how Cummings led Vote Leave to victory against the odds while having a sometimes tempestuous relationship with those around him. Cumberbatch has certainly grabbed a choice part because Cummings is one of the most extraordinary characters in the referendum story - clever, abrasive, and once described by David Cameron (one of his many enemies in Whitehall) as ‘a career psychopath”. Cummings also has a good turn of phrase. One of the many revelations in Shipman’s book was that Cummings called Tory Brexiter MPs (remember, these were the ones on his side) the “flying monkeys”. Shipman wrote: After Michael Heseltine’s attack on Boris Johnson, [Paul] Stephenson [VL’s communications director] remembered a conversation he had had with Cummings weeks before about how some of the more hotheaded Eurosceptics would have their uses at points in the campaign. Cummings, with his usual delicacy where MPs were concerned, had said, ‘We just need to kick the flying monkeys in the cage and release them at the right point.’ Now Stephenson went in search of a flying monkey to turn up the pressure on Cameron. He called Steve Baker [chair of Conservatives for Britain, now a Brexit minister] ... Kelvin Hopkins goes next. Q: Which customs option do you prefer - the customs partnership or the “max fac” model? Bradley says she thinks both could be made to work. But she is looking at both. She goes on: There are defects with both. She says there is no doubt that the customs partnership model, or the “hybrid model” as it is called, would make the border issue easier to solve. Q: On the Andrew Marr Show Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, said any infrastructure at the border would be unacceptable? Bradley says she will not comment on that. The UK’s position is that there should be no new infrastructure. Q: You are going to have to face them down. This is preposterous. Bradley says she has stated the government’s position. Sir Bill Cash goes next. Q: When you say ‘no new infrastructure’, do you mean at the border, near the border, or anywhere? Bradley says the government has been clear there will be no new physical infrastructure of checks at the border. There are 270 crossings over the border, she says. Some are unmarked roads. The government has been clear it will not change anything at the border. And it is clear why there won’t be new infrastructure at the border. There are a small number of people who would destroy that new infrastructure, she says. She says it would not be right to speculate now on where new infrastructure might go when decisions about customs arrangements have not been taken. Q: So the government is refusing to put up infrastructure because of blackmailing threats by dissidents? Bradley says she does not accept that characterisation. Q: Are you concerned about the negativity of the Irish government? Bradley says it is important to respect the fact that politicians speak to different audiences. The Irish are speaking to their own electorate, she says. Labour’s Kate Hoey goes next. Q: Is a camera a hard border? Bradley says the government has been clear that there will be no new physical infrastructure. Q: There are cameras there already. Bradley says the government does not want to see change. Q: What about GPS? Bradley says the government is looking at all options. Andrew Lewer, a Conservative, goes next. Q: What will happen if the EU do not agree to recognise UK regulations after Brexit? Bradley says the government is in a negotiation. But the Irish do not want a substantive border. There is the will to find a solution. Q: But the commission has already said mutual recognition of regulations is not acceptable. Bradley says this is a negotiation. Labour’s Darren Jones goes next. Q: How will the government maintain regulatory equivalence between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit? Bradley says this is something being looked at within government. Q: There has been some suggestion that the border checks won’t be at the border. If they are not at the border, where would they be? Bradley says the government is looking at this. Q: Are there are examples in the world that give you hope for what might work in Ireland? Bradley says there are many examples in the world. But this is a unique situation - Northern Ireland having a land border with the EU, but not with the rest of the UK. So there will have to be unique solutions. Q: Are you not concerned about undermining the Good Friday agreement? Bradley says she is working hard to find a solution. Richard Drax, a Conservative, goes next. He says it is “disgraceful” that people are claiming thugs could return and pose a threat in the event of a hard border going up. Bradley says there are a small number of people in Northern Ireland who are still committed to violence. But she says she does not think using threats about the possibility of a return to violence is the right way to deal with this issue. Q: Do you accept that there has been deliberate obfuscation on this? People are saying there must be no infrastructure on the border at all. Bradley says the government’s position is that there should be no new physical infrastructure, and no new checks or controls at the border. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter who chairs the committee, opens by referring to a Sun column suggesting that Karen Bradley is currently the most powerful person on the government. Bradley says Cash should not believe everything he reads in the papers. Q: There is unrealistic thinking about what a hard border means. Some of this seems to be deliberately stoked up to preclude a solution. People are defining a hard border as including cameras. But cameras are already present on the Irish border. The location of these cameras are not disclosed. And if they are attacked, they are relocated. He says the EU’s own guidelines show flexible solutions to the border arrangement are possible. But Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has torpedoed these ideas. So would I be right in thinking you agree with this analysis, and that there are technical solutions to the border problem. Bradley summarises the commitments given by the government. It is committed to no hard border in Ireland, she says. That means no new physical infrastructure. She says options have been put forward to address the issue. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, is about to give evidence to the Commons European scrutiny committee. You can watch the hearing here. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative pro-European and chair of the Commons Treasury committee, has joined those saying that some form of post-transition transition may be necessary. In a wide-ranging interview with Prospect, she said: Undoubtedly we are not going to be ready by the end of the transition period, I would say for quite a number of things. I mean particularly policing our customs. I asked the PM that question at the end of a committee in March and she said, I think, to paraphrase, ‘as we know more on these things we discover that we need more time’. Britain is at risk of missing the deadlines it should meet to ensure nuclear industry safeguards are in place after Brexit, Sky’s Faisal Islam reports. When the UK leaves the EU, it will also leave Euratom, the civil nuclear energy regulator. A replacement system is being put in place. But Islam has seen the government’s internal risk register showing that there are five high level risks - marked red on a green/amber/red scale. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has been giving a big speech on immigration policy this morning, prompted by the Windrush scandal. Here are the key points. Abbott said Labour repeal all the immigration legislation underpinning the government’s “hostile environment” policy. When Theresa May was home secretary in 2012 she said she wanted to create “a really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants. The Home Office subsequently abandoned that phrase, and Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, has explicitly rejected that language. But he has not proposed to reverse any of May’s legislation. Abbott said: The Windrush scandal goes to the very heart of Theresa May’s hostile environment policy – it was not accidental – it is a direct consequence of government policy. The next Labour Government will repeal all those parts of the immigration legislation that were introduced to support it. We will rescind all Home Office instructions to carry it out, and we will remove all obligations on landlords, employers and others to enact it. She said Labour would close the Yarl’s Wood and Brook House immigration detention centres. She said Labour would end indefinite detention, limiting detention to 28 days. She said Labour would use the £20m a year saved from the closure of the two detention centres to fund measures helping survivors of modern slavery. Under the Tories, services for the most vulnerable women in society have been slashed again and again. So today I am announcing that Labour will take the millions that are used annually to fund Yarl’s Wood and Brook House immigration detention centres, and put this directly back into services to support the survivors of modern slavery, trafficking, and domestic violence. Yarl’s Wood in particular has caused so much pain to vulnerable women that we should have been protecting. Diverting these resources directly to them is not only essential, but the right thing to do. She said Labour would stop private firms running immigration detention centres. This government and its predecessors have long had an obsession with enriching the private sector from the public purse. This is despite the costs, either financially, in shoddy service or in human misery. So now we have the grotesque spectacle of G4S being rewarded for failure at Brook House. A firm which oversaw the appalling, brutal treatment of detainees, and was exposed by Panorama, continues to be rewarded for their cruelty. It beggars belief. Labour will end this rotten system. Private firms have no business in detention. In the Irish parliament yesterday Leo Vardakar, the Irish prime minister, said that the British government’s “maximum facilitation” customs proposal - the one favoured by Tory Brexiters - would be less useful than a deodorant. He made the comment after alluding to its “max fac” nickname, and it was partly a joke - although one that also reinforced how unimpressed he is by London’s thinking on customs. He told TDs (members of the Dail): The customs partnership proposed by the United Kingdom last June would not be workable. That is very much the view of the task force and the EU27 and it has been rejected. I believe the customs partnership is closer to being made workable than the maximum facilitation proposal or max-fac which, as Deputy Joan Burton pointed out, I had thought was some form of make-up or deodorant. I have certainly not seen to date any detail that indicates that such a solution would be as functional as make-up or a deodorant. We are not drawing up any plan for a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, full stop. There is not going to be one. I have made it very clear to my counterpart in the United Kingdom and the other EU Prime Ministers that under no circumstances will there be a border. The full report is here, and the quote comes from Varadkar’s reply to Sean Haughey. Here’s the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Vardakar’s comparison. This is what Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor, told the Today programme about the Harvard report he has co-authored (see 9.25am) saying the UK would not benefit from a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. We’ve talked to many people on the record, but of course the senior negotiators at the USTR [US trade representative], the trade negotiator in America, in the Brexit department here, are more cautious about being on the record. But they were very clear with us that, first of all, the chances of doing a deal quickly are very low. Secondly, if we are outside the EU, our power to negotiate with the US is much lower. But also the kind of things that America would want, in terms of tariff reductions and changes in regulation, would be extremely difficult for British business and consumers to deal with. And the general view was, actually, it’s not really going to happen. So if the idea is you leave the customs union and get the free trade agreement and that will be better, our conclusion is that is a complete fantasy. Balls was also asked if he thought the UK should stay in the EEA after Brexit - the so-called Norway option, backed by the Lords and to be voted on by MPs in the Commons. He replied: What David Cameron failed to deliver, and what we need, is a deal which allows Britain to trade with our main trading partner but to have control over the way in which we manage our borders and migration. That is the only way in which we can have a proper deal. And an EEA-style deal which allows that to happen would be a step forward. Brexiters argue that the UK has to leave the EU customs union so that it can benefit from striking its own free trade deals with other countries and they generally argue that the biggest prize would be a juicy trade deal with the US. This led Michael Gove, in his rather sycophantic interview (paywall) with Donald Trump in January last year (when Gove was out of government) to ask for an assurance that the UK would be “at the front of the queue”. The UK was “doing great”, Trump replied elliptically, although Gove concluded that overall Trump was very positive about a deal. But a new study, published by the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, says the UK won’t benefit from such a deal. It may well never happen, and even if it were to be signed, the UK would have to make so many concessions it could become politically unacceptable. Six authors have contributed to the report but one of them will be very familiar to readers - Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor and now a research fellow at Harvard. You can read the 57-page report in full here (pdf). Here is the conclusion: Despite the enthusiasm expressed by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, officials directly involved, and experts with experience of such negotiations, express scepticism that a deal of any significance can be achieved ... We can summarise the prospects and potential benefits of a US-UK FTA [free trade agreement] across five dimensions – strategic interest; timeline and capacity; tariffs; non-tariff barriers and regulations; and politics and negotiability – as in table 1 below. The conclusion is clear: a US-UK FTA is only going to happen if the UK makes concessions that are unlikely to be politically acceptable and in any case, promises relatively limited upside for UK business. However, the importance of such a deal to the overall Brexit narrative (and specifically, to the case for leaving the customs union) means that the Government is likely to continue to behave as if negotiating an attractive deal with the US remains a realistic possibility. Here are three quotes from sources quoted in the conclusion. Senior UK government official: “Personally, I am very doubtful about the ability of both governments to work through the domestic politics and political challenges of this deal.” Senior US trade negotiator: “we already have a bilateral trade and investment working group with them [the UK] which means open and strong trading relations already exist, so it is unclear how much more there is realistically to gain.” Professor Larry Summers, former US Treasury secretary: “It is delusional to think that a US-UK trade deal will happen anytime soon. It is simply not possible.” And here is table 1, the chart from the report setting out the reasons why a good free trade deal is highly unlikely. Balls was on the Today programme talking about this. I will post some of his quotes soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, gives a speech on immigration. 10am: Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, launches the Lib Dem campaign in the Lewisham East byelection. 10.30am: Former MI5 director general Lord Evans of Weardale and former GCHQ director Robert Hannigan give evidence to a Lords committee about post-Brexit security cooperation. 10.45am: Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, gives evidence to the European scrutiny committee about Brexit. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2.15pm: Jeff Silvester, chief operating officers for AggregateIQ, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee as part of its fake news inquiry. After 3.30pm: Peers have their final debate (the third reading) on the EU withdrawal bill. Around 4pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion that, if passed, would force the government to publish all its internal papers on its two proposed customs options. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Campaigners from the Netherlands, the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001, interviewed to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia on Thursday, suggested marriage equality increases social acceptance, but more targeted action is needed to protect LGBT youth. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The director of LGBT rights group COC Nederland, Koen van Dijk, told Guardian Australia that according to official statistics in the Netherlands some 90% of people now have a positive attitude of LGBT people, up from 53% in 2006. In that time the proportion of people who wanted to repeal marriage equality fell from 22% to just 6%. Asked what Australian LGBT organisations should do after marriage equality was legalised in December, Van Dijk said he was “sure that in Australia full equality has not yet been reached”, citing the fact the Netherlands still has a “long way to go on trans and intersex rights”. “Since marriage equality, we’ve had to work on equal rights for rainbow families,” he said. “And we still have to do a lot of work on social acceptance.” Van Dijk said the movement in the Netherlands had pushed for “compulsory gender and sexuality education in schools” and mobilised LGBT youth to improve safety in schools and combat bullying. In Australia the Safe Schools anti-bullying program has struggled, with federal funding lapsing in mid-2017 and New South Wales replacing it with a new anti-bullying program. Although the Victorian government still runs Safe Schools through its education department, the Liberal opposition has vowed to scrap it. Debate was sparked this week by former prime minister John Howard suggesting the federal government should defund any schools that did not allow parents to remove their children from classes that clashed with their values. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, brushed off the concern by arguing it was a right parents already possess. Van Dijk said “all bullying is bad” but LGBT-specific programs are needed because bullying on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity is the most common form in the Netherlands and around the world. “It’s very intrusive, it directly attacks people where they feel very vulnerable, just as they are starting to recognise their own identity,” he said. He said that in the Netherlands LGB children are aware they are “not straight” on average at age 11, but wait three years before telling anyone, meaning “for the better part of high school they walk around lonely with a very big secret they feel vulnerable about”. Van Dijk said the Netherlands had largely escaped backlash against marriage equality and other attempts to reduce LGBT people’s rights, which he attributed to the fact it was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage and opposition was not yet organised. “We’ve seen a strong mobilisation and increased financing in religious movements to oppose the LGBTI movement around the world since then,” he said. Discrimination and the Ruddock review Although same-sex marriage was legalised in 2001, it took until 2012 before discrimination laws were tightened in the Netherlands to prevent civil celebrants from refusing to conduct same-sex weddings and to remove the right of religious schools to expel students or fire teachers if they expressed that they were of a different sexual orientation. In Australia exemptions to discrimination law that allow religious schools to do this are a central ground of contention in the Ruddock religious freedom review, due to be handed to the government on Friday. Religious groups, including the Catholic church, the Anglican diocese of Sydney and Christian Schools Australia, have fought to retain these powers, while submissions from LGBT rights groups have called for them to be repealed. The Human Rights Watch LGBT advocacy director, Boris Dittrich – a former MP who first proposed marriage equality in the Dutch parliament 1994 – said the campaign had concentrated on marriage equality because it was “seen as the ultimate form of equality and non-discrimination”. After that, they moved to issues such as the legal status of the female partner of a woman who gives birth to a child. Dittrich said “people got used to a same-sex couple celebrating their marriage”, which “helped make LGBT people visible in a positive way”. But he noted the same statistics that show the overwhelming majority of people now support marriage equality also show “the figures drop when people are asked if it is OK for two men to be seen kissing each other in public”. Both Van Dijk and Dittrich said cases of private service providers, like bakers and florists, being sued for refusing to serve same-sex weddings had not materialised, rejecting one of the central arguments for further protection for “religious freedom” made by conservatives in Australia. Asked how Australia should help strike the balance between religious freedom and the right to non-discrimination, Dittrich said “data collection is very important”. “My suggestion would be to frequently collect cases of discrimination based on religious freedom and based on sexual orientation/gender identity and debate these results,” he said. The NSW MP and Australian Marriage Equality co-chair, Alex Greenwich, said this International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia was “a really important one because on the back of achieving marriage equality, it again shows how effective the LGBTI community are in making positive change happen – to the law, in their workplaces and local communities”. “There needs to be a new priority on anti-bullying programs for LGBTI youth,” he said. Greenwich said Safe Schools had sought to support LGBT young people and the children of same-sex parents – two groups “targeted by the no campaign” during the postal survey. “The damage of that is still very much real,” he said. “Governments, state and federal, need to have a renewed focus on what support can be given in schools, especially after the bruising postal survey.” The battle for LGBT protections Under Bill Shorten, federal Labor has taken a strong stand against watering down discrimination laws in a way that would allow discrimination against LGBT people, including voting against all the conservatives’ substantive amendments to the marriage law. But it has not committed to removing existing religious exemptions that allow the firing of LGBT staff or expulsion of students. On Tuesday Shorten equivocated on the future of Safe Schools, noting that the program “applied in different states and some of it already exists”. “The way I approach Safe Schools programs, and indeed other anti-bullying programs, is keeping our kids safe should be paramount,” he said. “I hear from parents every day their kids are getting bullied at school.” The Greens’ federal LGBT spokeswoman, Janet Rice, said Safe Schools was “an incredible example of how education, support and acceptance can positively impact the lives of LGBTIQ young people, and whole school communities”. “We need programs like this to provide secular and inclusive support for students, rather than the current chaplains program, which denies LGBTIQ students access to meaningful, unbiased support,” she said. In the 2018 budget the Turnbull government extended $247m of funding to the school chaplaincy program over four years, committing to give the program “an enhanced focus on addressing bullying in schools”. Rice warned that the Ruddock review is a “Trojan horse to entrench discrimination” that was set up by the far right of the Liberal party intent on “attacking LGBTI people in their schools and workplaces”. “This IDAHOBIT, I’m calling on my parliamentary colleagues in the government and the Labor opposition to commit to standing by all LGBTIQ people, and reject any further watering down of protections against discrimination,” she said. “Australia needs to strengthen anti-discrimination laws, not weaken them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/17/labor-considers-tougher-environmental-laws-as-branches-call-for-new-agency","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"Labor considers tougher environmental laws as branches call for new agency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/17/labor-considers-tougher-environmental-laws-as-branches-call-for-new-agency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/17/labor-considers-tougher-environmental-laws-as-branches-call-for-new-agency","fields":{"headline":"Labor considers tougher environmental laws as branches call for new agency","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The shadow environment minister, Tony Burke, has declared Labor is not afraid to strengthen national protections as 371 local branches have endorsed a motion calling on the ALP to set up an independent agency responsible for proactive environmental protection. A grassroots campaign ahead of Labor’s national conference in July spearheaded by the activist group the Labor Environment Action Network is building support from rank-and-file members for the creation of a federal environmental protection agency, a regulator that could be the decision-maker for approvals rather than the environment minister – and a second organisation, an environment commission, to drive proactive protection of environmental assets. Separate to the LEAN push, which is about securing a substantial overhaul and strengthening of the existing framework, the draft national platform also proposes inserting a land-clearing trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act, which links the issue explicitly to the management of climate change. It also proposes consideration of a separate national parks trigger. The draft platform would commit Labor to carrying out “root and branch reform of federal environment laws” and to a “strong, well-resourced, science based, independent environment institutional structure with strong legislative and financial basis to proactively protect environmental assets”. The conference debate is playing out amid a public backlash to a draft decision by the Turnbull government to approve the bulldozing of almost 2,000ha of pristine Queensland forest on Cape York Peninsula. A draft report from the environment department recommends that the clearing at Kingvale station, authorised under the former Newman state government 2014, should be allowed to proceed with conditions. The development has revived the public debate about the impact of deforestation on the Great Barrier Reef. The LEAN motion calls on the ALP to “safeguard our unique natural heritage and environment on behalf of future Australians by creating new environment laws and founding an independent, fully resourced public agency for the environment, within the first term of government”. It says “new independent and well-resourced institutions will embed principles of democratic accountability and intergenerational justice” and adds “these institutions will develop and implement a national environment plan and will enforce the law”. Labor sources suggest Burke has signalled internally he is relaxed about the new regulatory body even if it removes his power as decision maker. Putting the decisions with an independent agency would allow occupants of the environment portfolio to conduct more frontline advocacy on behalf of the environment. The current system prevents environment ministers from undertaking public activism on various projects because they are decision makers, while other ministers, like the holders of the resources portfolio, can engage in public commentary. Activists report there is some internal resistance on the idea of a second environmental agency with a policy focus. Burke told Guardian Australia there was still live internal discussion about the LEAN proposals, including the regulatory agency, so he declined to express a view. “Whether changes mean the minister gets more responsibility or an independent agency sets the standards and makes sure they are adhered to is a matter Labor is still consulting on,” he said. But he said “we aren’t afraid to strengthen the law”. At the last national conference, in 2015, LEAN followed the same strategy of building grassroots support for a strengthening of party policy. Last time, 370 branches endorsed a motion calling on the party to adopt a 50% renewable energy goal and an emissions reduction target for 2030 based on the advice of the federal Climate Change Authority."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/16/deputy-bank-governor-under-fire-for-menopausal-economy-comment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T14:35:39Z","webTitle":"Deputy Bank governor apologises for 'menopausal economy' comment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/deputy-bank-governor-under-fire-for-menopausal-economy-comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/16/deputy-bank-governor-under-fire-for-menopausal-economy-comment","fields":{"headline":"Deputy Bank governor apologises for 'menopausal economy' comment","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A deputy governor of the Bank of England has apologised for saying the UK economy was in a “menopausal” phase after passing its productive peak. Ben Broadbent was accused of using “lazy, sexist” language when he compared the current state of the economy to the late Victorian era, when a pause between steam technology and the age of electricity contributed to a slump in productivity. In an interview with the Telegraph, Broadbent said the term applied by economic historians to describe such a slump was “climacteric”, which he said essentially means “menopausal, but can apply to both genders. You’ve passed your productive peak.” Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said the language Broadbent used in his interview was “totally inappropriate”. “There’s no need to resort to lazy, sexist comments to describe problems in the economy,” she said. Broadbent issued a statement on Wednesday morning after his comments drew widespread criticism: “I’m sorry for my poor choice of language in an interview with the Telegraph yesterday and regret the offence caused. “I was explaining the meaning of the word “climacteric”, a term used by economic historians to describe a period of low productivity growth during the 19th century. Economic productivity is something which affects every one of us, of all ages and genders.” Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money UK, who led a government review on boosting gender equality in the financial sector, said: “When I read this I thought about my own menopause and was sure he meant that the future is hard work, challenging, renewing, worth fighting for, 100% positive and constantly HOT!” Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, the business lobby group, said Broadbent’s comments in the interview detracted from the crucial issue of weak productivity and living standards. “This poor choice of words is very disappointing and distracts from the real issue at hand,” she said. “Productivity has been the UK’s achilles heel for far too long. “Our priority should be tackling the low productivity that can lead to higher regional inequality. Solving this will help build a stronger economy that raises living standards and wages for everyone.” Vivienne Artz, president of Women in Banking &amp; Finance, said: “Women aged 50 and over are the fastest-growing group of employees in the UK. Menopause is experienced by all women, and those in the menopause years constitute an estimated 20% of the workforce. “To refer to menopause as being “past one’s productive peak” in the context of the economy ignores the reality that women are often at the peak of their careers during their menopause years.” Robert Peston, the political editor of ITV, tweeted that Broadbent’s language was “sloppy and potentially offensive”. Louise Newson, a GP and medical writer, said it was a “terrible analogy”, while another Twitter user, Rebecca Harvey, said it was a shocking example of #everydaysexism. Broadbent, a former economist at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, is considered a potential successor to the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney. As deputy governor for monetary policy, he sits on the monetary policy committee, which is responsible for setting interest rates. Carney has previously attributed a 25% gender pay gap at the Bank – with male employees paid almost a quarter more than their female colleagues – to the fact that men dominate the most senior positions at Threadneedle Street. Of the nine members on the MPC, just one – Silvana Tenreyro – is a woman. Broadbent gave the interview after official figures showed that productivity fell 0.5% in the first three months of 2018, at a time when employment in Britain hit a fresh record high but growth slowed to just 0.1%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/18/a-third-of-worlds-nature-reserves-severely-degraded-by-human-activity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T18:00:37Z","webTitle":"A third of world's nature reserves severely degraded by human activity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/18/a-third-of-worlds-nature-reserves-severely-degraded-by-human-activity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/18/a-third-of-worlds-nature-reserves-severely-degraded-by-human-activity","fields":{"headline":"A third of world's nature reserves severely degraded by human activity","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A third of global protected areas such as national parks have been severely degraded by human activities in what researchers say is a stunning reality check of efforts by nations to stall biodiversity loss. A University of Queensland-led study, published on Friday in the prestigious academic journal Science, analysed human activity across 50,000 protected areas worldwide. Researchers found more than 90% of conservation sites, such as national parks and nature reserves, showed some signs of degradation from human activities including logging, mining, tourism and urbanisation and a third – or 6m square kilometres of protected land – had been severely modified. The worst damage was found in highly populated parts of Europe, Asia and Africa, but researchers said there was significant degradation in all nations, including wealthy and less-populated countries such as Australia. •Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning James Watson, the paper’s senior author and a conservation scientist at the University of Queensland and the Wildlife Conservation Society, said the results were alarming and showed countries were failing to protect biodiversity even in places specifically identified for that purpose. “What we found was massive amounts of high-level human infrastructure, for example mining activity, industrial logging activity, industrial agriculture, townships, roads and energy,” he said. “These are the places that nations have said they are setting aside for nature’s needs not human needs. “So for us to find such a significant amount of human infrastructure in places governments have set aside for safe-guarding biodiversity is staggering.” He said there were some glaring examples in Australia, such as Barrow Island off the Western Australian coast, a nature reserve that is home to 13 mammal species and the Gorgon gas plant. “Some of these species are found nowhere else on the planet and yet we allow significant human infrastructure to occur inside these boundaries,” Watson said. “Australia should be setting the standard that other nations should look to and yet we are one of the worst behaved of the lot.” Martin Taylor, conservation scientist at WWF Australia, said the Turnbull government’s proposal to downgrade high-level protections in sensitive marine parks, including critical waters around the Great Barrier Reef, was another example of industry being given precedence over conservation. He said there was also a low level of public awareness of the extent to which a range of industries had been able to encroach on protected areas. “The public just aren’t aware that these kinds of things are going on and we hope this paper builds awareness of it,” he said. “The community expects a national park to be reserved for wildlife.” In Australia alone, more than 1,800 plants, animals and ecological communities are known to be at risk of extinction. Conservationists and scientists have described the situation confronting Australia’s vulnerable wildlife as a “national disgrace” and the systems that are supposed to protect it as broken."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/may/16/living-in-an-age-of-anger-50-year-rage-cycle","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"Why are we living in an age of anger – is it because of the 50-year rage cycle?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/16/living-in-an-age-of-anger-50-year-rage-cycle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/16/living-in-an-age-of-anger-50-year-rage-cycle","fields":{"headline":"Why are we living in an age of anger – is it because of the 50-year rage cycle?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A neighbour objected to a young couple from Newcastle being naked in their own home. “We are sick of seeing big bums, big boobs and little willy,” was the core message of the note, crescendoing to: “We will report you both for indecent exposure.” It is such a small thing, banal, without consequence. It connects to no wider narrative and conveys nothing but the bubbling discomfort of human beings living near each other. Yet when Karin Stone (one of the nakeds) posted the note on Facebook, 15,000 people pored over it. An Australian radio show interviewed her. I have got to be honest, I am heavily emotionally invested in the story myself and I do not regret a second of the time I have spent reading about it. There is a through-line to these spurts of emotion we get from spectatorship: the subject matter is not important. It could be human rights abuse or a party-wall dispute; it does not matter, so long as it delivers a shot of righteous anger. Bile connects each issue. I look at that note, the prurience and prissiness, the mashup of capital and lower-case letters, the unlikeliness that its author has a smaller bum or a bigger willy, and I feel sure they voted for Brexit. The neighbours are delighted by their disgust for these vigorous, lusty newlyweds, I am delighted by my disgust for the neighbours, radio listeners in Australia are delighted. We see rage and we meet it with our own, always wanting more. There was the mean note left on the car of a disabled woman (“I witnessed you and your young able-bodied daughter … walk towards the precinct with no sign of disability”); the crazed dyspepsia of the woman whose driveway was blocked briefly by paramedics while they tried to save someone’s life. Last week, Highways England felt moved to launch a campaign against road rage, spurred by 3,446 recorded instances in a year of motorists driving straight through roadworks. Violent crime has not gone up – well, it has, but this is thought mainly to reflect better reporting practices – but violent fantasies are ablaze. Political discourse is drenched in rage. The things people want to do to Diane Abbott and Luciana Berger make my eyes pop out of my head. But what exactly are we looking at? Does any of this have a wider social meaning? Does it place us at a perilous point on the curve of history, on the tinderbox of a grand explosion? Or is it that some things – cars, social media – are really bad for our mental health? There is a discipline known as cliodynamics, developed at the start of the century by the scientist Peter Turchin, which plots historical events by a series of mathematical measures. Some are obvious – equality – and some take a bit of unpacking (“elite overproduction”, for example; as a consequence of inequality, there are periods in history when there are too many extremely rich people for the positions of power that extremely rich people typically occupy. This results in them going rogue and buying themselves into power by hosing money at elections. Donald Trump is the ultimate human face of elite overproduction). These measures yield a map of history in which you can see spikes of rage roughly every 50 years: 1870, 1920, 1970 (you have to allow a little wiggle room to take in the first world war and 1968). Cycles of violence are not always unproductive – they take in civil rights, union and suffragette movements. Indeed, all social movements of consequence start with unrest, whether in the form of strike action, protest or riot. Some situate economics at the heart of the social mood: the Kondratiev wave, which lasts between 40 and 60 years (call it 50 and it will correspond neatly with the cycle of violence), describes the modern world economy in cycles of high and low growth, where stagnation always corresponds with unrest. David Andress is a professor of history at the University of Portsmouth and the author of Cultural Dementia, a fascinating account of how the slash-and-burn rage of the present political climate is made possible only by wilfully forgetting the past. He counsels against what could become an indolent understanding of history – if everything is a wave and the waves just happen, what is there to discover? – but he allows that “everything has to come back to economics unless you’re rich. Economics is about scarcity and insecurity turns very quickly into anger and scapegoating.” “As a historian and as a teacher, I’m always trying to get people to understand that societies in general are violent and hierarchical places,” he says. “People like you and me have wanted societies to be less violent and hierarchical and we have worked at that. We’ve never actually succeeded. We’ve managed to persuade people to take their foot off other people’s throats, when they felt secure enough.” Anger is remarkable not in and of itself, but when it becomes so widespread that it feels like the dominant cultural force. What is notable to Andress is the counterfactual – the periods in history not marked by fury. “Antagonism never goes away. That is what has made the postwar project quite exceptional, the EU project quite exceptional.” Ah, the EU. Perhaps another time. The psychotherapeutic perspective would not reject these economic factors, nor argue that anger is a new phenomenon. But there are elements of the human emotional journey that are novel and are driven by modern conditions. Aaron Balick, a psychotherapist and the author of a perceptive and surprisingly readable academic account, The Psychodynamics of Social Networking, says: “I think for sure anger is more expressed. What you see of it is a consequence of emotional contagion, which I think social media is partly responsible for. There’s an anger-bandwagon effect: someone expresses it and this drives someone else to express it as well.” Psychologically speaking, the important thing is not the emotion, but what you do with it; whether you vent, process or suppress it. We are in an age where the trigger event can be something as trivial as a cranky git who does not like nudity. Thanks to Facebook, 15,000 people can get a righteous thrill of expressed rage. Wherever we are on the Kondratiev curve, ours is a materially different life experience to one in which you would only come together in fury for something serious, such as destroying a ploughshare or burning a witch. “Hysteria is not a particularly politically correct term any more, because it’s kind of misogynist, but it does have a technical meaning,” says Balick. “A hysterical emotional response is when you’re having too much emotion, because you’re not in touch with the foundational feeling. An example would be office bitching. Everybody in the office is bitching and it becomes a hysterical negativity that never treats itself; nobody is taking it forwards.” This has the hammer thud of deep truth. I have worked in only a couple of offices, but there was always a gentle hubbub of whinging, in which important and intimate connections were forged by shared grievance, but it was underpinned by a deliberate relinquishing of power. You complained exactly because you did not intend to address the grievance meaningfully. Social media has given us a way to transmute that anger from the workplace – which often we do not have the power to change – to every other area of life. You can go on Mumsnet to get angry with other people’s lazy husbands and interfering mother-in-laws; Twitter to find comradeship in fury about politics and punctuation; Facebook for rage-offs about people who shouted at a baby on a train or left their dog in a hot car. These social forums “enable hysterical contagion”, says Balick, but that does not mean it is always unproductive. The example he uses of a groundswell of infectious anger that became a movement is the Arab spring, but you could point to petitions websites such as 38 Degrees and Avaaz or crowdfunded justice projects. Most broad, collaborative calls for change begin with a story that enrages people. To distinguish “good” anger from “bad” anger – indeed, to determine whether anything productive could come of a given spurt of rage – it is worth considering the purpose of anger. “Its purpose is to maintain personal boundaries. So, if somebody crosses you, gets in your space, insults you, touches you, you’re going to get angry and the productive use of anger is to say: ‘Fuck off,’” Balick says. The complicating feature of social media is that “someone might be stepping on our identity or our belief system”. So, the natural sense of scale you get in the offline world – a stranger could run over your toes with a shopping trolley but, being a stranger, would find it hard to traduce your essential nature – is collapsed in the virtual one. In the act of broadcasting who we are – what we believe, what we look like, what we are eating, who we love – we offer up a vast stretch of personal boundary that could be invaded by anyone, even by accident. Usually it is not an accident, though; usually they do it on purpose. However, if it gives you a fillip to lie in bed checking whatever news or chat feed nourishes you, then experience a short thrill of indignation, is that a bad thing? Could it just be supplying the insignificant boost we used to get from smoking? There is certainly a hormonal response (“There’s always a physical manifestation; emotions aren’t a made-up thing,” Balick says), but it is not an obvious one: Neus Herrero, a researcher at the University of Valencia, “stimulated” anger in 30 men (with “first-person” remarks) and found a variety of apparent contradictions. Cortisol, which you would expect to go up, since it is the stress hormone, goes down; testosterone goes up and heart rate and arterial tension go up. Herrera discovered an oddity in “motivational direction” – usually, positive emotions make you want to get closer to the source, while negative ones make you want to withdraw. Anger has a “motivation of closeness”, which Herrera explains simply: “Normally, when we get angry, we show a natural tendency to get closer to what made us angry to try to eliminate it.” Like any stimulant, it has addictive properties: you become habituated to it and start to rove around looking for things to make you angry. Rage has an illusion of power, the way the Incredible Hulk takes peculiar pride in the destructive potential of his strong emotion. “You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry” is such a curious catchphrase; the only logical response is: “I don’t like anyone when they are angry.” But it manages to make sense on a deeper, primeval level. The important consequences are not for your own health, but rather for that of society as a whole. Unprocessed anger pollutes the social sphere. Every outburst legitimises the next. And we have landed – I like to think by accident – on a technology that perpetuates it and amplifies it, occasionally productively, but more often to no purpose at all. Writ large on a world stage – take Trump or Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary, venting unmediated fury for political effect – we can see how denaturing it is, how it gates off all other, less exhilarating responses, such as empathy. People getting so angry about traffic cones that they drive straight into them, while effing and jeffing at a workman in a hi-vis jacket, may or may not be a harbinger of greater social unrest, but I remember the John Major years and his cones hotline. Whatever cones signify, it is never anything good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/15/london-considering-car-free-days-in-bid-to-tackle-air-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T12:40:35Z","webTitle":"London considering car-free days in bid to tackle air pollution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/15/london-considering-car-free-days-in-bid-to-tackle-air-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/15/london-considering-car-free-days-in-bid-to-tackle-air-pollution","fields":{"headline":"London considering car-free days in bid to tackle air pollution","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"London is considering introducing car-free days in an attempt to tackle the city’s air pollution crisis that experts say is responsible for thousands of early deaths each year. Officials at City Hall were due to meet on Tuesday to examine how best to roll out a ban across specific areas of the capital on different days this year - with “more ambitious plans” in the pipeline for 2019. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: “[He] is determined to do everything in his power to protect the health of Londoners and prioritise walking, cycling and public transport and reduce Londoners’ dependency on polluting cars.” A source at City Hall said details were still being hammered out but they were hoping to introduce separate car-free days in each London borough this year, with the potential for city-wide car-free days next year. “The mayor already supports a number of car-restricted days for annual events in London, and he has asked City Hall officials to consider additional opportunities for car-free activities as part of his healthy streets vision,” said a spokesman. “Tackling toxic emissions from the most polluting vehicles is a core part of the hard-hitting measures the mayor has introduced to help clean up London’s air, from delivering the Toxicity-Charge (T-Charge) in central London, to the early introduction of the Ultra-Low Emission Zone, and transforming the bus fleet.” Cities around the world have turned to car-free days in the fight against air pollution and there has been a growing campaign for London to follow suit. Bridget Fox, from Campaign for Better Transport, one of 50 organisations which wrote to Khan to call on him to sign up to a car-free day earlier this year, said “creating traffic free spaces, even for a day, transforms places for the better.” “Car-free days are a great way to show the potential to cut traffic across London. We hope every community in the capital will be inspired to take part.” Caroline Lucas the co-leader of the Green Party also welcomed the idea, but said the mayor’s recent decision to push ahead with the new £1bn Silvertown tunnel under the Thames undermined his efforts to tackle London’s poisonous air. “These car-free days would be a significant step forward for London - but need to be part of a much better strategy that tackles pollution everywhere,” she said. The move comes amid growing concern about the impact of the UK’s poisonous air that causes 40,000 early deaths a year. Earlier this year an unprecedented joint inquiry by four committees of MPs described it as a “national health emergency”. In the report, the “super committee” was scathing about the government’s clean air plans which have been judged illegal three times in the high court. The latest proposal, rejected by the high court earlier this year, was condemned as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors. London’s air pollution crisis is responsible for 9,000 early deaths each year. Its scale was laid bare last year with new figures showing that every person in the capital is breathing air that exceeds global guidelines for one of the most dangerous toxic particles. The findings, described as “sickening” by Khan, have serious health implications – especially for children – with both short- and long-term exposure to these particulates increasing the likelihood of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Health experts say young people exposed to these toxic pollutants are more likely to grow up with reduced lung function and to develop asthma."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/uk-government-block-release-files-gaddafi-libya-abdel-hakim-belhaj","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T11:44:51Z","webTitle":"UK government trying to block release of files exposing Gaddafi links","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/uk-government-block-release-files-gaddafi-libya-abdel-hakim-belhaj","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/uk-government-block-release-files-gaddafi-libya-abdel-hakim-belhaj","fields":{"headline":"UK government trying to block release of files exposing Gaddafi links","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Government lawyers are attempting to prevent documents that detail the relationship between the British government and Muammar Gaddafi from being made public under the Freedom of Information Act, just days after apologising for the UK’s role in the kidnap and torture of one of the Libyan dictator’s opponents. They are appealing against an information tribunal ruling that the documents should be handed to Nigel Ashton, professor of international history at the London School of Economics. At a hearing in London on Wednesday, lawyers for the Cabinet Office will argue that Ashton’s request should be dismissed as being “vexatious” because of the amount of time it would take to redact the papers before release, on such grounds as national security and the safeguarding of international relations. At a hearing last year, the information tribunal ruled that Ashton had made a request for “information which is of great public value and significance”, and that as a consequence the clause in the act that deals with vexatious requests – those that are manifestly unjustified – could not be invoked. Ashton initially requested copies of Downing Street files that covered the period from the Lockerbie bombing of December 1988 to the revolution of 2011 that resulted in Gaddafi being deposed and murdered. He subsequently narrowed his request to files from the years 1990 to 2002, but has said he may request more. Last week Theresa May told Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the leader of an Islamist militia that had been opposed to Gaddafi, and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, that she was “profoundly sorry” about the role MI6 played in their kidnap, rendition and torture in 2004. The government paid Boudchar £500,000. Throughout his six-year legal battle, Behaj insisted he wanted only an apology, and he received no payment. In return, the couple dropped their civil claim against MI6 and the Foreign Office, and against Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, who were foreign secretary and head of counter-terrorism at MI6 at the time of the couple’s kidnap. The couple’s lawyers also withdrew their attempt to seek a judicial review of the Crown Prosecution Service’s decision not to charge Allen with criminal offences after a four-year Scotland Yard investigation. The couple had been taken off a flight in Bangkok and detained by the CIA after a tipoff from MI6. They were put on a flight to Tripoli, where Belhaj was imprisoned for six years and frequently tortured. Boudchar was taped head to foot to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight. She was four and a half months pregnant at the time. Four weeks later, a second leading opponent of Gaddafi was kidnapped in Hong Kong after an MI6 tipoff and flown to Tripoli with his wife and four children. He settled his claim against the British government in 2012, receiving £2.2m. Documents discovered in government offices in Tripoli during the Libyan revolution show the kidnap operations followed lengthy MI6 surveillance of the two men. Papers recovered at the same time show that information subsequently extracted under torture from the two men was used to justify the detention and attempted deportation of a number of Libyans living in Britain. There were also papers that detailed the way in which Gaddafi’s intelligence officers were invited to Britain, where they allegedly threatened Libyan asylum seekers and British-Libyan nationals, in the presence of MI5 officers. Asked whether it was resisting Ashton’s request because it did not wish to see further evidence of unlawful and politically embarrassing activities coming to light, the Cabinet Office declined to comment. Ashton submitted his request for information in 2014 and hopes ultimately to achieve a greater understanding of the role the British government played in creating Libya as it is today. This would include examining British responses to the Lockerbie bombing and Gaddafi’s support for the IRA; the period of rapprochement during which the rendition plots were hatched; and the UK’s role in supporting the insurgency that eventually toppled the Gaddafi regime. “The public interest in understanding Britain’s policy towards Libya is overwhelming,” Ashton said. “It seems extraordinary that the Cabinet Office has resisted my freedom of information request at every turn.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/16/why-the-sound-of-music-led-the-way-for-the-critic-proof-hit-musical","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T12:25:52Z","webTitle":"How The Sound of Music led the way for the critic-proof hit musical","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/16/why-the-sound-of-music-led-the-way-for-the-critic-proof-hit-musical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/16/why-the-sound-of-music-led-the-way-for-the-critic-proof-hit-musical","fields":{"headline":"How The Sound of Music led the way for the critic-proof hit musical","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The cinemas are alive with The Sound of Music once more as the classic musical returns to the big screen. With five Oscars under its belt, legions of devoted fans including those prone to dressing up and singing along, and having taken so much box-office cash that it is in the top 10 highest-grossing films of all time, The Sound of Music is comfortably, and indisputably, a resounding hit. Take a bow, Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Rodgers and Hammerstein, director Robert Wise, all the warbling Von Trapp children and even that saucy, if wooden, yodelling goatherd – you created a movie that is inordinately beloved. However, the question many word-perfect fans may not want to ask is this: is The Sound of Music actually any good? On the film’s first release in 1965, the answer from most critics was a flat no. In the UK, Monthly Film Bulletin called the three-hour tale of a gamine postulate who gives seven precocious children and their uptight widowed father the gift of music and affection “an exceedingly sugary experience” whipped up from ingredients “that might have been bearable if the songs had been better”. Other critics gagged on that taste, with noted grump Bosley Crowther describing it in the New York Times as “cosy-cum-corny”. Others took exception not just to its sweetness but its distortion of history. As with the original stage musical, the film is set in Austria on the cusp of the Nazi invasion. Courting a family audience, however, the film drastically dilutes the threat of fascism. In Vogue, Joan Didion lambasted “its suggestion that history need not happen to people … Just whistle a happy tune, and leave the Anschluss behind”. Most famously, Pauline Kael called it “the sugar-coated lie that people seem to want to eat ... and this is the attitude that makes a critic feel that maybe it’s all hopeless. Why not just send the director, Robert Wise, a wire: ‘You win, I give up’?” Why not, indeed, as audiences and the Academy took little note of those negative notices. In fact, perhaps the recent success of The Greatest Showman, as well as other fan favourites such as Mamma Mia! (which Peter Bradshaw called a “soulless panto”), tell us critics and audiences want very different things from a musical. Where reviewers found The Sound of Music slow, sugary and mendacious, audiences discovered a heartwarming story about childhood, and a series of catchy, upbeat songs. Dr Martha Shearer, a musicals expert at King’s College London, takes issue with the critics: “There’s some kind of implication that the audience for this film is either too stupid to pick up on how bad it is. Or that they’ve been tricked.” On the contrary, The Sound of Music delivers exactly the responses it promises: you’ll laugh, you’ll cry and you’ll be humming My Favourite Things for weeks afterwards. Where critics see manipulation, audiences applaud what composer and broadcaster Neil Brand calls “Hollywood professionalism of the highest order”. The film pivots on Julie Andrews’s inarguably excellent performance as Maria – she not only sings with great skill and charm, but no doubt also brought lots of audience goodwill and a useful aura of maternal efficiency from her performance in Mary Poppins the previous year. Brand agrees that some reviewers are allergic to song-and-dance shows: “The musical is the easiest genre to denigrate on the basis of its artifice alone. You can either accept the artifice of ‘real’ people suddenly bursting into song and dance, or you can’t.” Shearer discerns a gender angle too, whether the critic in question is male or female: “There can be a tendency amongst critics to be particularly dismissive of musicals and of mainstream films that are coded as feminine in some way.” The Greatest Showman, argues Shearer, triumphs because from its opening number on, it tells audiences to sit back and enjoy the spectacle. “It’s so overt and it even has a critic character who can’t appreciate the show because he can’t appreciate joy.” The Sound of Music does something similar. Right at the beginning of the film the nuns debate the question: how do you solve a problem like Maria? They’re effectively asking whether we should enjoy her effervescent spirit or condemn her for breaking the rules. Whose side are you on? There is also more than one way to watch The Sound of Music. Viewing it as a dramatisation of a true story from the Anschluss is not the best approach. Most of us watch the film first when we’re a child, and subsequently enjoy the ritual of its slowly unfolding plot and frequent song reprisals with the comfort of nostalgia – not for nothing was its first UK TV broadcast on Christmas Day. Many, people, including academic Stacy Wolf, read androgynous Maria as radiating “delicious queerness”. Alternatively you can wallow in the film’s toothsome charms as the last gasp of the family-friendly studio musical before the climate changed and the genre went in darker directions. It’s even possible to enjoy being manipulated. “Its recognition of how ridiculous it is, is part of the pleasure of it,” argues Shearer. For Brand, Andrews alone is worth the price of admission. “She is the phenomenon,” he says. “To be able to play an Austrian with impeccable English vowels, to make us concerned for her because she’s the politest rebel in all cinema, to be able to make singing sound exciting whilst never giving the impression it is anything but radiantly enjoyable, above all to challenge Audrey Hepburn in the tomboy stakes.” Just like Captain Von Trapp himself, we may start out sceptical but soon find ourselves to warming to plucky Maria and her guitar. We shouldn’t forget that even Kael herself was susceptible. That line about the “sugar-coated lie” refers to The Sound of Music all right, but it comes from an aside in a review of a later film, The Singing Nun, for McCall’s. Her initial assessment of the movie, in an unsigned note for the New Yorker, admitted she was not immune to its contrivances and charms and praised Plummer’s “sinister, archly decadent performance”. “Whom could this operetta offend?” she wrote. “Only those of us who, despite the fact that we may respond, loathe being manipulated in this way and are aware of how cheap and ready-made are the responses we are made to feel. We may become even more aware of the way we have been turned into emotional aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.” Did Kael exit the cinema singing Edelweiss? Perhaps she should have sent that note of surrender to Wise after all. The Sound of Music plays in 70mm at BFI Southbank from 18 May before touring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/may/16/social-care-funding-plans-branded-costly-and-unfair","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Social care funding plans branded costly and unfair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/16/social-care-funding-plans-branded-costly-and-unfair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/16/social-care-funding-plans-branded-costly-and-unfair","fields":{"headline":"Social care funding plans branded costly and unfair","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government’s plans for reforming social care in England – at the heart of a planned green paper – have been criticised as costly and unfair in a report on the future of funding care for older people. The report from two highly respected thinktanks, the Kings Fund and the Health Foundation, finds that the idea of increasing the number of people paying for care, and how much they pay, put forward in the Tory manifesto last year, would be almost as costly as making all care free. The proposals, based for the first time on putting housing assets into the means test for people needing personal care at home as well as those in residential care, puts a floor of £100,000 on assets. After a disastrous weekend of negative publicity following the plan’s unveiling, a cap on the total amount paid for care needs was proposed. For their report, the thinktanks have set it at £75,000. “It catches a lot of people who are not paying now for the support they get at home,” Anita Charlesworth of the Health Foundation said. “It is even more complex than the current system and it’s only a very slight improvement in terms of the cash it raises.” Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary who is now also responsible for social care, put this so-called “cap and floor” approach at the heart of his thinking when he set out the principles that would underlie his green paper earlier this year. Wednesday’s report joins a long list that predicts the need for a huge rise in spending to meet the needs of an ageing population. Even to maintain the current system, which steadily squeezes the criteria for eligibility for support in order to keep it affordable, faces a £1.5bn shortfall by 2020. If standards and availability were raised to the level the coalition government inherited in 2010, an extra £8bn would have to be found. The cap and floor system would need an extra £5bn over the same period, while providing free personal care would cost an extra £7bn. Free personal care has been introduced in Scotland, where it is very popular. But one of the main justifications for such a policy, that it would ease the pressure on the health service by helping people stay at home, has not been fully realised. While there is some support for a hypothecated tax, according to a detailed study of public attitudes to funding social care done for the report, focus groups also understood that in an economic downturn it might not raise enough income. Most of those questioned agreed that responsibility for care costs should be shared. But there was widespread hostility, regardless of age or home ownership, to taxing housing wealth. The report’s authors conclude that very few people understand how social care funding works, and many assume it will be free. They also find that the government is not trusted to deliver on its promises for quality as well as availability. They suggest the government does not even have enough trust to be believed when it tries to explain the scale of the problem. Charlesworth concludes: “Everyone agrees that the social care system is not fit for purpose. But finding reforms that balance good quality care for those who need it with the funding needed to provide it is incredibly challenging.” A health department spokesperson confirmed today that the green paper will be published this summer. • This article was amended on 16 May 2018. An earlier version had a health department spokesperson suggesting the green paper’s summer deadline might slip. Later the department said there was no question of this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/15/talking-horses-157m-for-painting-looks-good-business-by-john-magnier","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T11:35:25Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: $157m for painting looks good business by John Magnier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/15/talking-horses-157m-for-painting-looks-good-business-by-john-magnier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/15/talking-horses-157m-for-painting-looks-good-business-by-john-magnier","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: $157m for painting looks good business by John Magnier","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tuesday’s best bets, by Chris Cook So this morning, I picked up three picture books which my daughter can no longer bear to read and took them round to the local cafe, where they keep a couple of shelves of donated reading matter for the nippers. About nine hours earlier in New York, John Magnier of Coolmore fame reportedly sold a painting by Modigliani for $157m, a record for the auction house in question. Is it a stretch to suggest a broad equivalence between these two disposals? Perhaps Magnier glanced up at the painting while coming down to breakfast one morning and thought: “Oh, we’ve still got that old thing. Let’s take it down Sotheby’s, see if someone else wants it. I can fill up the space with a couple of Chagalls.” Or perhaps Mrs Magnier made the final decision about the picture, a reclining nude. “I’ve had it up to here with looking at that woman’s bum,” I imagine her saying. “Kindly get her out of the house.” Magnier’s reputation is as a hard-nosed businessman, so many will assume that he is simply deciding to take the value, having made a very sound investment in acquiring the painting for less than $30m. That profit of over $100m will surely be the biggest news in Magnier’s working life this year. Or perhaps the sale is an indication that, for all the intense sensuality and artistic significance of the Modigliani, Magnier’s greatest interest is in the equine works crafted by his own stud for display at the Curragh, Newmarket and Epsom. At Ballydoyle yesterday, I was struck by the sheer number of variations on the theme of Galileo, glossy bays with splashes of white down their faces and round their ankles, like so many preliminary sketches in an artist’s studio. I should say that Magnier has never confirmed his ownership of the painting, though he has been widely described as the vendor and there seems to be no dispute about it. I asked Aidan O’Brien if he’d be following the sale but the painting was due to go under the hammer after midnight and the trainer was pretty sure he’d be asleep by then. Saxon Warrior is the (potential) masterpiece on his mind just now. At Beverley today, Juneau (4.40) is the one that catches my eye at odds of 11-2. A nicely bred Mark Johnston filly, she ran into one when second on her handicap debut at Lingfield, the winner having since won easily from a 7lb higher mark. Juneau gets to run from the same mark here and should be all the better for the experience and the return to this distance. A wide draw isn’t helpful but Joe Fanning will be familiar with such issues at one of his local tracks. In the next, Contrebasse (5.10) appeals at 7-2. On breeding, Tim Easterby’s gelding ought to be a lot better this year, now that he’s been stepped up in distance from his maiden runs as a juvenile. He was pocketed by traffic trouble at Redcar 12 days ago but still hinted at plenty of ability. The last at Chepstow has rather fallen apart through non-runners but Bailarico (8.20) is of interest at 4-1. Bred to need time and distance, he showed nothing until landing a point at Barbury in January. He’s since joined Warren Greatrex and gets in here on a basement mark with the potential to be thrown in, in view of his pedigree. Of course, he might also be tailed off by halfway by I think the odds justify the risk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/may/15/ryanair-cuts-check-in-time-for-passengers-without-reserved-seats","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T12:14:23Z","webTitle":"Ryanair cuts check-in time for passengers without reserved seats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/15/ryanair-cuts-check-in-time-for-passengers-without-reserved-seats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/15/ryanair-cuts-check-in-time-for-passengers-without-reserved-seats","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair cuts check-in time for passengers without reserved seats","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Millions of Ryanair passengers booked on flights after 13 June will have shorter check-in periods, in a move likely to encourage more travellers to pay for reserved seating. The budget airline said its check-in window for passengers who have not paid for reserved seating will shrink from four days to 48 hours. But if customers pay for a reserved seat – which costs from £3 each way but rises to £15 for seats with more leg room – they will be allowed to check in up to 60 days before flying. The latest rule change at Ryanair comes just months after a controversial change to its baggage policy. Passengers have to pay £5 for priority boarding to avoid having their main cabin bag checked in to the hold at their departure gate. The baggage policy was due to begin in November last year but was delayed until January amid the Ryanair flight cancellations fiasco. The new check-in policy is likely to encourage weekend-break travellers to pay for reserved seating, or be forced to find ways to check in online while abroad. For many travellers using the Ryanair app on their smartphones, check-in is a relatively simple procedure, but others will find it more daunting. As recently as 2016, passengers could check in for free up to a week before departure, but this was cut to four days and will now move to 48 hours. The airline has also faced widespread criticism for running a “pay up or we split you up” seat allocation policy. Couples travelling together who do not pay for reserved seating often find themselves seated at opposite ends of the aircraft, despite Ryanair claims that the allocation policy is random. Ryanair said the new check-in window brings it into line with rival airlines. In a statement, it said: “Online check-in (for those customers who don’t choose reserved seats) will be available from 48 hours to two hours pre-departure for all flights from Wednesday 13 June. This is double the 24- hour check-in period operated by Aer Lingus, British Airways, Lufthansa, Norwegian and Iberia. This will give reserve seat customers more time to select their preferred seats prior to departure.” Shares in Ryanair have tumbled since the cancellations issue and prolonged labour disputes. They peaked at €19.35 in August last year, but have since fallen to around €15.72. Meanwhile shares in its main rival, easyJet, which announced upbeat figures on Tuesday, have jumped from around £12 last August to £17.10."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/15/giant-straw-giant-hat-summer-instagram-la-bomba-jacquemus-justin-bieber-oversized","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T16:18:53Z","webTitle":"How the giant​ straw​ hat is winning summer (and Instagram)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/15/giant-straw-giant-hat-summer-instagram-la-bomba-jacquemus-justin-bieber-oversized","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/15/giant-straw-giant-hat-summer-instagram-la-bomba-jacquemus-justin-bieber-oversized","fields":{"headline":"How the giant​ straw​ hat is winning summer (and Instagram)","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"High fashion doesn’t always translate to Instagram, but occasionally something comes along that translates so well, it accidentally veers into parody. Take the La Bomba hat by Jacquemus. This giant straw hat is absurd to look at on a catwalk, but worn on a sandy beach, and photographed from behind, it encapsulates everything that summer is – and everything you want to be when you wear it. In short, to be seen while not being seen, ideally on holiday. It has also kickstarted what looks like the defining Instagram trend of the summer – hats with brims of alarming diameter. At Sensi, they are large and paper-braided, while versions at Topshop and Off White, although smaller, come with a wide brim as flat as the Norfolk Broads. At Missoni, they are shaped like an exaggerated wimple. At Gucci, they tie under the chin with a ribbon. At Delpozo, they are more bow-like than hat-like, but the sentiment remains. Dig deeper, and oversized hats serve the same seen/unseen purpose on celebrities. Melania Trump hid beneath a white one designed by Hervé Pierre when the Macrons visited the White House. Justin Bieber dodged speculation over his love life in a straw version as he took a “meditative hike” through the hills. Jacquemus is the French label for cool French women. The Jacquemus girl, the handsome, oft-tanned designer Simon Porte Jacquemus once told the Guardian, “is not Parisian, and that is important. She is French, and French girls are not elegant, they are raw, casual, spontaneous.” It is also a label that likes to play with scale when it comes to accessories. His tiny Le Sac Chiquito handbags are the size of your fist, yet are the It bag of summer 2018. The La Bomba hat is the size of a manta ray, making it impossible to transport, yet it is long sold out and, even if it wasn’t, is comically antisocial, shielding not just its wearer from the sun but anyone on the same stretch of beach. And yet ... Hats have become heavy with meaning, and a good way to signal an allegiance – be it Trump’s red baseball cap or the pink pussy hats. If autumn 2017 was dominated by baseball caps worn by people who wouldn’t normally wear baseball caps, then other kinds of hats are successfully revised each season, and do the same job. See berets, stetsons and, now, straw hats. Much like Lenny Kravitz’s famously large scarf a few years ago, hats are the quickest way to signal a “don’t look at me, but, like, do” level of fame. If Instagram 2017 was all about tropical kitschiness, starring flamingos and cacti among other twee nostalgic tics, then this is the summer of the giant parody straw hat.

The world’s second-biggest company has warned that the “hostile” tax, which will charge firms $275 per worker a year to fund homelessness outreach services and affordable housing, “forces us to question our growth here”. Amazon, which is Seattle’s biggest private sector employer with more than 40,000 staff in the city, had halted construction work on a 17-storey office tower in protest against the tax. Pressure from Amazon and other big employers, including Starbucks and Expedia, had forced councillors to reduce the tax from an initial proposal of $500 per worker. The tax will only effect companies making revenue of more than $20m-a-year. The tax is expected to raise between $45m and $49m a year, of which about $10m would come from Amazon. The company said it would restart building work on the tower but may sublease another new office block to reduce its tax bill. “We are disappointed by today’s city Council decision to introduce a tax on jobs,” said Drew Herdener, an Amazon vice-president. We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council’s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.” Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is the world’s richest man with a $133bn fortune. Campaigners said the company should be forced to take financial responsibility for Seattle’s cost of living, which has forced many families on to the streets. There are almost 12,000 homeless people in Seattle region, equating to the third-highest rate per capita in the US. Last year 169 homeless people died in Seattle. The city declared a state of emergency because of homelessness in late 2015 Before the council vote on Monday, more than 100 people marched through Amazon’s campus and held a rally outside the company’s new spherical greenhouses, some holding signs saying “Tax Amazon”. Seattle councillor Teresa Mosqueda said: “People are dying on the doorsteps of prosperity. This is the richest city in the state and in a state that has the most regressive tax system in the country.” The vote was passed unanimously, with several council members saying they were voting reluctantly in favour of the lower rate for the tax after Seattle’s mayor, Jenny Durkan, threatened to veto a higher rate. “This was a tough debate. Not just here at city hall, but all across this city,” Durkan, said. “No one is saying that this will solve everything, but it will make a meaningful difference. This legislation will help us address our homelessness crisis without jeopardising critical jobs.” Politicians from 50 other US cities wrote an open letter to Seattle council in a show solidarity with the councillors attempt to tackle Amazon’s impact on the city. “By threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,” the letter said. Starbucks had also fought against the tax, with its public affairs chief, John Kelly, accusing the city of continuing to “spend without reforming and fail without accountability, while ignoring the plight of hundreds of children sleeping outside”. He added: “If they cannot provide a warm meal and safe bed to a five-year-old child, no one believes they will be able to make housing affordable or address opiate addiction.” Marilyn Strickland, the head of Seattle’s chamber of commerce, voiced business leaders’ opposition to the tax. “Taxing jobs will not fix our region’s housing and homelessness problems,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/21/our-kind-cruelty-what-we-did-star-north-thrillers-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"Thrillers review: Our Kind of Cruelty; What We Did; Star of the North","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/21/our-kind-cruelty-what-we-did-star-north-thrillers-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/21/our-kind-cruelty-what-we-did-star-north-thrillers-review","fields":{"headline":"Thrillers review: Our Kind of Cruelty; What We Did; Star of the North","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Mike and Verity play a dangerous game: the Crave.

It was obvious that we were beginning a new, more intricate Crave.” Hall writes in an afterword to this fiendishly clever psychological thriller that she “wanted to change the perspective away from all the brilliant damaged women I’d read in the last few years, and reveal a damaged man”. Mike is exactly that. The product of an appalling childhood, he is not entirely unsympathetic, but his creepy obsessing over Verity and his stalkerish, unstable behaviour are page-turningly unnerving. Unless, that is, Verity is in on it all. By putting the story into Mike’s mouth and taking away Verity’s voice, as her story plays out to a violent climax, Hall forces her readers to consider their attitudes to the sexes in a world where, as she puts it in her afterword, “women must be perfect, men are allowed to get away with murder”. In Christobel Kent’s What We Did (Sphere, £12.99), Bridget’s life – running a clothing shop, loving her gentle husband, Matt, and her teenage son, Finn – is carefully ordered. Her routines make her feel safe, keeping memories of the sexual abuse she suffered as a child at bay. But when the music teacher who abused her walks into her shop, accompanying another teenage girl, “bright, upright and excited, face upturned”, her careful life is turned upside down. “She’d told herself memory was boxes, with lids, neatly stacked, but all the time it was like a sea, it was like seething space, a forest at night. It was all around her and it moved, in the dark.” Bridget doesn’t know why Anthony Carmichael – “Call me Tony” – is back in her life, but his sinister presence is, all of a sudden, everywhere, threatening “Finn and her and Matt, the steady little tripod of their lives”. She flounders, panics, doesn’t know what to do. “She went over the options again. Do nothing. Leave. Go to the police. Maybe he will just die. She dreamed.” And then, all of a sudden, she acts. A stirring, eloquent thriller with a nail-biting finish. DB John is one of the few westerners to have visited North Korea, and the co-author of Hyeonseo Lee’s memoir about her escape from the closed state, The Girl With Seven Names. In Star of the North (Harvill Secker, £12.99), he centres his story on Jenna Williams, a Korean-African American professor at Georgetown whose twin sister went missing from a South Korean beach 12 years earlier. As the US struggles to handle its diplomatic relations with North Korea, Jenna is recruited by the CIA for a peace mission. She has other plans, after learning that her sister might have been abducted by North Korea, and could still be alive. John moves between Jenna’s perspective, that of a North Korean official sent to negotiate with the west, and that of a North Korean woman disillusioned with the regime in a fascinating, disturbing insight into this secretive country, from its labour camps to its executions. And Williams is a gratifyingly competent protagonist to follow. “One of the most promising candidates” the CIA has ever seen, she not only has the highest IQ recorded in Virginia, she has also perfected a North Korean dialect and is a tae kwon do superstar.

A party where people who look really good at parties will bring their A-game. A party that has already provoked an advance period of what-are-we-wearing discussion with other guests. The sort of party, in other words, that is a full-blown wardrobe crisis waiting to happen. Except not this time, because I know exactly what I want to wear. I know the look that will feel zeitgeist but not fashion victim, glamorous but not self-conscious. What’s more, it is super comfortable, I don’t have to wear heels with it and it requires zero beach-body-ready nonsense, because there is no waistband to do up. And it covers most of my body, so I won’t even have to sheep-dip myself in St Tropez like I normally do when I go out. I am going to wear a kaftan, obviously. My longtime favourite is a Maje one, silvery and tissue-thin, with wide flowing sleeves and a hemline almost to the floor, but I am seriously considering investing in a gold-edged one covered in leopards and tiger lilies by the London-based label Lazul. The kaftan – a unisex garment with a storied global heritage, which refuses to peg fabulousness to any particular dress size – feels right for now in a way that no skimpy, wiggle-into-it number does. A woman wearing a kaftan takes up physical space, rather than whittling herself down to the capacity of a pair of Spanx. She is comfortable, she can dance, she brings with her a bit of 1966-era mood music. The red-carpet blackouts of the Golden Globes and the Baftas set the tone for a year in which glamour is politicised. Wearing a trad party dress feels a bit basic, tbh. If last summer’s style slogan was The Future Is Female, as seen on a trillion T-shirts, the message of 2018 is that The Woke Wear Kaftans. I should admit here that I am biased. I have written before about my longstanding love affair with the kaftan, a hot-weather garment steeped in history, with roots in what was then Mesopotamia. But this summer it’s not just me. In the May issue of British Vogue, model Karly Loyce wears Emilia Wickstead’s kaftan-shaped, balloon-sleeved Octavia gown. (Fashion director Venetia Scott made a yellow turban to go with it.) At the most recent Paris fashion week, the hit show by the fashion editors’ favourite designer, Simon Porte Jacquemus, opened with a buttermilk satin kaftan inspired by a trip to the recently opened Yves Saint Laurent museum in Marrakech. Maya Rudolph’s scarlet Valentino kaftan was a standout look of this year’s Oscars. On vintage sites, prices for trophy kaftans have risen sky-high. A Gina Fratini rainbow-sleeved kaftan, as worn by Liz Taylor at her (second) wedding to Richard Burton in 1975, now fetches more than £6,000. This is all the more striking because until a couple of years ago the kaftan was frankly naff. The glory years of Saint Laurent in Marrakech were long gone and the kaftan had been hemmed to the upper thigh and adopted by bejewelled women with too-dark tans, dancing badly in beach bars to terrible music. How times change. This summer there are 60 super-chic kaftans to choose from at Net-a-Porter, and sales are up 25% on last year at Stylebop, where the cool linen kaftan-style maxis by Three Graces London, designed by Céline-wearing Irishwoman Catherine Johnson, are flying out, as are bell-sleeved pieces with rich Ukrainian embroidery by New York label March11. At Matches Fashion, Pippa Holt kaftans are bestsellers, says buyer Chelsea Power, “to be worn with jeans and slides now, and then thrown over a swimsuit on holiday”, while turbans by Norma Kamali, a Studio 54 regular and iconic New York designer for three decades, are proving a surprise hit of the season. Harvey Nichols has recently taken on three new kaftan-type brands: Sundress, Innika Choo and Lemlem, to add to Marios Schwab’s On The Island label. Like an enormous pair of sunglasses, a kaftan has a double-edged look-at-me/don’t-look-at-me vibe. It is a cover-up, but it is definitely not for wallflowers. Diana Vreeland, who said of style that “without it, you are nobody”, was a fan, writing in Vogue that kaftans were “for the beautiful people”. Princess Grace wore Pucci kaftans with matching turbans and was photographed several times in the dramatic La Bayadère kaftan designed by Marc Bohan for Christian Dior in 1969. The kaftan is laid-back, but it flirts with danger in its anything-goes vibe: Talitha Getty wears a multicoloured kaftan in the portrait by Patrick Lichfield, taken on the starlit terrace of the Marrakech palace where she entertained the Rolling Stones and Yves Saint Laurent, two years before she died of a heroin overdose. “We would all go to work in a kaftan if it was up to me,” says my fellow enthusiast Nina Deckers, the founder of Lazul. But the kaftan’s appeal is bound up in that of days spent by a pool with a glass of rosé and has been boosted by the elevation of what we wear on holiday. A few years ago, to wear earrings on the beach would have been considered eccentric; now it is the norm. At Net-a-Porter, where the holiday wardrobe now has its own offshoot – Jet-a-Porter – global buying director Elizabeth von der Goltz reports that 60% of spending on beachwear is on kaftans and cover-ups rather than swimwear. And since we are spending more on what we pack in our suitcases, we are more inclined to give these pieces a run out at home. The poolside kaftan, reinvented as a languorous party dress, translates better to real life than the giant inflatable flamingo. Stylebop’s Coco Chan describes the kaftan as “empowering”, while Deckers believes “there is a sexiness in a silk kaftan that can never be attempted by a tight-fitting dress. The playfulness of silk around a female body is something so gorgeous.” The body politics of the kaftan are complex. Is it more empowering to reject objectification by covering your body, or to signal ownership of your sexuality by celebrating it? Does dressing modestly make you complicit in a patriarchal notion that women’s bodies are shameful, or does it semaphore sisterhood by refusing to make party-dressing a body-competitive sport? Both points of view have their champions. But this summer, only one is winning the fashion argument."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/may/15/joe-hart-england-world-cup-squad-out-gareth-southgate-west-ham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart left out of England’s World Cup squad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/15/joe-hart-england-world-cup-squad-out-gareth-southgate-west-ham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/15/joe-hart-england-world-cup-squad-out-gareth-southgate-west-ham","fields":{"headline":"Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart left out of England’s World Cup squad","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart have been omitted from England’s squad for this summer’s World Cup but there is a place in Gareth Southgate’s selection for Fabian Delph. Wilshere has missed out after being called up for the friendlies against Italy and the Netherlands in March only to withdraw because of injury. The Arsenal midfielder, who has not played for his country since Euro 2016, started only 12 Premier League games in the season just finished and a historically fragile body may have counted against him given the demands of a tournament. In leaving out Hart, Southgate has chosen to ignore his most experienced player. The Manchester City goalkeeper, who has spent the season on loan at West Ham, was told on Monday in a phone-call from the England manager that he would not be travelling to a fifth major finals despite Southgate having considered the 31-year-old his first choice for much of his tenure. Hart won his 75th and most recent cap against Brazil in November but Jordan Pickford and Jack Butland started the friendlies in March and have usurped him in the pecking order. The suggestion had been Hart would still travel to the World Cup as an experienced third-choice – only Gary Cahill and Jermain Defoe of Southgate’s recent selections have more than 50 caps, with neither expected to make the cut for Russia – and would have been willing to fulfil that role, but his toils at club level appear to have counted against him. He has endured an indifferent spell on-loan at West Ham this season, losing his place towards the end of November to Adrián and starting only 19 league games in total. He regained his place after a 4-1 defeat at Swansea in March, but there were subsequent high-profile errors against Burnley and Stoke. His last appearance was a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on 22 April. Burnley’s Nick Pope, who was called up for the games against the Netherlands and Italy but remains uncapped, is the likeliest to replace Hart in the 23-man squad, which Southgate will reveal on Wednesday. Delph’s inclusion follows a season in which he has been successfully remodelled as a left-back at City by Pep Guardiola. The 28-year-old has been more naturally a central midfielder and brings versatility to Southgate’s squad. The left-back Ryan Bertrand has been left out but Ashley Young will be part of the squad. The Burnley defender James Tarkowski, who has one cap, is understood to be on the standby list. Southgate is expected to select Phil Jones, John Stones and Harry Maguire as centre-backs, with Kyle Walker and Eric Dier also capable of playing there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/mp-who-called-jacinda-ardern-a-stupid-little-girl-refuses-to-own-up","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T14:33:09Z","webTitle":"MP who called Jacinda Ardern a ‘stupid little girl’ refuses to own up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/mp-who-called-jacinda-ardern-a-stupid-little-girl-refuses-to-own-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/mp-who-called-jacinda-ardern-a-stupid-little-girl-refuses-to-own-up","fields":{"headline":"MP who called Jacinda Ardern a ‘stupid little girl’ refuses to own up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A male MP from New Zealand’s opposition party who called the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, a “stupid little girl” remains unidentified more than a week after making the remark in parliament. A search of parliamentary records and an investigation by Newshub have so far not uncovered the identity of the man who blasted Ardern – the third woman to lead the country. The speaker of the house, Trevor Mallard, halted proceedings immediately after the comment was made, and demanded the man apologise for the “very sexist remark” directed towards the prime minister, who is 37 years old and expecting her first child next month. The MP who spoke the words has yet to own up to the incident. In doing so, he would have to issue an official apology to Ardern and withdraw the remark. According to comments made by Mallard at the time, the MP was sat somewhere behind the opposition leader, Simon Bridges. Newshub approached 10 MPs from the New Zealand National party who could have made the remark and all denied it had come from them. Bridges said he would be reviewing footage of the incident to identify who had spoken, and that if the culprit was identified he would consider what consequences the MP would face. “Parliament’s a place of cut and thrust. People say things in the heat of moment, on all sides of the house, including, let’s be honest, the speaker,” Bridges told Newshub. The minister for women, Julie Anne Genter, said the remark was unacceptable. “People should get with the times, especially the National party backbenches. Grow up,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/20/trump-russia-review-le-carre-mario-puzo-moscow-manhattan","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T05:00:50Z","webTitle":"Trump/Russia review: Le Carré meets Mario Puzo in Moscow and Manhattan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/20/trump-russia-review-le-carre-mario-puzo-moscow-manhattan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/20/trump-russia-review-le-carre-mario-puzo-moscow-manhattan","fields":{"headline":"Trump/Russia review: Le Carré meets Mario Puzo in Moscow and Manhattan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s probably a bad sign for the republic when the only way to write a plausible biography of the president of the United States is to make it read like a cross between The Godfather and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. But that’s where we are in the age of Trump. As the number of books in this genre proliferates – from Collusion by Luke Harding of the Guardian to Russian Roulette by David Corn and Michael Isikoff and more – it’s getting harder and harder to shock a knowledgable (and therefore, numbed) reader. But with Trump/Russia: a Definitive History, Seth Hettena still manages a frisson of surprise from time to time. For example, did you know that Michael Cohen was introduced to Trump by his Ukrainian father-in-law, who was convicted of a money-laundering-related crime, and that Cohen’s uncle, Morton Levine, owned a Brooklyn catering hall, the El Caribe Country Club, in which Cohen had a stake himself, and which was rented to the first Russian mafia boss of Brighton Beach? Would you be surprised to learn that some of the earliest Russian mobsters in Brooklyn kept a fraudulent gasoline wholesale business thriving by aligning themselves with the Italian Colombo family – and that one of those Russians, David Bogatin, eventually earned enough from this racket to spend $5.8m on five different units in Trump Tower, the developer’s first important luxury apartment building in Manhattan? When it went up (with ready-mix concrete from an Italian-controlled mob firm), Trump Tower was one of only two buildings in Manhattan that allowed buyers to be anonymous. This was when Trump got the habit of filling his pockets with the profits of criminals, by selling to everyone from the Cuban swindler Roberto Polo to the Haitian dictator Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier. A former state investigator told Hettena he was “90% sure” Russian buyers were “doing Trump a favor” by buying so many apartments in his building, but Trump’s connection to them was never investigated. Hettena points out that Trump is hardly the first president to brush up against the mob – think JFK and Judith Campbell Exner, or Nixon and Bebe Rebozo – but Trump has broken new ground by being the first to benefit from his connections to so many mobsters tied to a foreign power. And as a Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor has noted, in Russia “one cannot tell the difference between the activities of the government and those of its organized crime groups” – because the mobs are actually controlled by the state’s security services. “After the collapse of the USSR,” writes Hettena, Russia’s gangsters emerged “into the daylight” to “take their place in the new ruling class of the country … bureaucrats, spies, oligarchs and criminals” are part of a loose and constantly “shifting network of alliances”. Like other investigators before him, Hettena, describes the astonishing web that connects the Russians who teamed up with Trump to bring the Miss Universe contest in Moscow to the notorious meeting at Trump Tower, where a motley crew of Russian conspirators offered Trump campaign officials dirt on Hillary Clinton. It was the Azerbaijani mogul Aras Agalarov who paid Trump $20m to bring Miss Universe to Russia. Trump allowed Agalarov’s singer-son Emin to perform for 10 minutes on the Miss Universe telecast to promote his career in the west. Then it was Emin’s publicist, Rob Goldstone, who first contacted Donald Trump Jr to tell him Aras Agalarov had met with the Russian “crown prosecutor” (a non-existent position) and that they had agreed to offer the Trump campaign damaging information about his Democratic opponent. There are so many instances of Russian-Trump collaboration it’s hard to keep track. Way back in 2002, Trump partnered with Sotheby’s International and a Moscow-based realty company to open an office to sell apartments in his new Trump World Tower in Manhattan. The apartments appealed to Russian oligarchs, “because if you were wealthy in Russia your money was never secure. Your money was only safe if and when it moved out of the country” – into something like a Trump condominium, which functioned for its owner like a safe deposit box. Bloomberg Business Week found that two years later, one-third of the units on floors 76 through 83 of Trump World Tower had been sold to companies connected to Russia or neighboring states such as Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Hettena also does the standard review of the contents of the Steele dossier, which describes many different contacts between Russians and Trump associates. He quotes experts who are skeptical of the most salacious allegation, concerning the prostitutes Trump allegedly met with in a $13,000-a-night suite at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow. “Sex stuff comes up a lot and it’s often nonsense,” one Washington attorney who often hires private investigators told the author. But I believe a novelist is better qualified than any lawyer or reporter to answer this question. And the novelist with the best credentials to evaluate the Steele dossier is undoubtedly John le Carré, the author of all the finest cold war thrillers, including Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. And Le Carré has said on NPR that he believes “it’s perfectly possible that Trump was taken into what I call a honey trap – that he had ladies found for him, and he misbehaved in Russia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/21/anna-jones-vegetarian-barbecue-recipes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T11:00:23Z","webTitle":"Anna Jones’s vegetarian barbecue recipes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/21/anna-jones-vegetarian-barbecue-recipes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/21/anna-jones-vegetarian-barbecue-recipes","fields":{"headline":"Anna Jones’s vegetarian barbecue recipes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This week I bring you the two best things I ate last year at barbecues. One was cooked in my sister’s front yard in the LA sunshine; the other in my British back garden, hurriedly, before the dark clouds descended. Both were unreasonably delicious and are now firmly on my summer lineup. I’ve edged the barbecue closer to the back door so we needn’t even wait for the sun. Feta, tomato and smoky pepper parcels (pictured above) This is my take on Greek feta bouyiourdi, although I char my peppers first as it doubles the smoky hum. I use the pale yellow-green Turkish peppers: they are long and thin, sweeter and milder than their green pepper cousins, but, if you can’t find them, don’t worry. This is best done on the barbecue, but you can also char the peppers over a naked gas flame, then cook the parcels in the oven. Prep 15 min Cooking 25 min Serves 2-4 2 fresh Turkish peppers or 1 green pepper 1 x 200g block feta, cut into 5 slices 1 handful cherry tomatoes, halved (I used different coloured ones) 1 tsp coriander seed, bashed in a mortar 1 pinch of dried oregano Olive oil Light the barbecue. Once hot and still roaring, cook the peppers directly on the flame until they are blackened all over. Take off the heat and, once cool, peel away most of the black skin and cut the flesh into slices, discarding the stems and seeds. Put the feta slices on a piece of foil large enough to wrap around them. Top the cheese with the tomatoes, peppers, coriander, oregano and a drizzle of olive oil. Seal the foil at the top to make a little parcel. Once the barbecue flames have died down and the coals are white, put the packet on to them and cook for 10-15 minutes (you could also do this in an oven at 220C/425F/gas 7). It’s ready when each slice of feta is soft, the peppers cooked-through and the tomatoes sticky and roasted. Charred carrot and fennel salad with spiced maple This is the kind of salad around which to build a meal: yoghurt, greens, charred carrots and fennel generously spiced and with a little sweet and sour. I used baby carrots here, but big ones work just as well. Prep 10 min Rest 30+ min Serves 2-4 600g different coloured carrots, washed and scrubbed 2 bulbs fennel 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp fennel seeds 1 tsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp maple syrup 2 tbsp red-wine vinegar 2 tbsp olive oil 6 tbsp Greek yoghurt Salt and black pepper 2 handfuls peppery lettuce leaves If you are using bigger carrots, cut them into halves, quarters or even thick coins. No need to peel. Fill a large pot with generously salted boiling water and blanch the carrots for seven to 12 minutes (depending on size), until they are cooked through but still holding their shape. Meanwhile, slice the fennel into thin wedges across the root and toss with the cumin, fennel seeds, turmeric, maple syrup, vinegar and olive oil and seasoning in a baking tray. Drain the carrots and add them, tossing again. Leave to sit for at least 30 minutes – ideally for a few hours or overnight. When you are ready to cook, heat the barbecue or griddle pan. If you are using a barbecue, cook the carrots and fennel slices on once the flames have died down but the coals are still red hot. Turn from time to time, until they are charred all over and soft throughout. Meanwhile, mix the yoghurt with a few tablespoons of the remaining marinade and a good pinch each of salt and pepper. Spread the yoghurt over the bottom of a plate, toss the leaves in any remaining marinade and scatter them over the yoghurt. Put the charred carrots and fennel on top and serve.

Standing in a packed-out square in Lisbon with thousands of others, I was watching the Eurovision final on a giant screen, the results from the night slowly rolling in. Having spent the preceding week with the UK’s contestant, SuRie, initially I thought I was just gutted for her after a wash of low scores and a stage invasion. But looking around, as Netta, the Israeli entry, took to the stage, overjoyed and victorious – the Israeli flags being waved all around me suddenly took on a more sinister tone. Eurovision is traditionally held in the country that won the previous year, and when Netta gave her short acceptance speech, she made it clear: “Next year in Jerusalem.” Whether this was an off-the-cuff remark, or high command decision being communicated to the world, really doesn’t matter. It seems that, despite Tel Aviv being the country’s cultural capital and queer-friendly city, it would be in the disputed city of Jerusalem that next year’s event will be held. On the day of Yom Yerushalayim (Jerusalem Day), the optics of this was no accident. This controversial day in the Israeli calendar marks the date that the whole of Jerusalem was brought under Israeli rule. To others, it marks the further ongoing occupation of Palestinian land. Now it will be the host of the world’s largest live music competition – it makes the light-hearted event feel a little more dark. It didn’t take long for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to attach his name to the victory: “You know what we say: Those who didn’t want Jerusalem in the #Eurovision are going to get the Eurovision in Jerusalem,” he tweeted, in a series of posts praising Trump and celebrating the controversial move of the US embassy on Monday from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. All the while his government continues to oversee the displacement of Palestinians from their Jerusalem homes. Having spent the last week in Lisbon immersed in Eurovision culture, there was a sentiment I heard repeated over and over again. From the organising team to the fans, and each nation’s artists – Eurovision is about unity. “It’s not about divisive politics” was very much the line. But whether its organisers like it or not, if held in Jerusalem next year’s event will be political. Netanyahu has already made sure of that. In the Eurovision arena, there was booing in abundance during the Russian performance, and the displeased crescendo became even louder as the scores from Moscow were broadcast live. Such outrage must also be evident next year – LGBTQ+ lives are no more valuable than those of other oppressed minorities. Will we also be subjected to a dose of pink-washing, employed to distract onlookers from the oppression routinely dished out by the Israeli state? Israel may have a better record on LGBTQ+ rights than some of its neighbours (lesbian and gay people can be conscripted into the military, although same-sex marriages are still not conducted in the country) – but that doesn’t negate the human rights abuses the government regularly dishes out. Many Eurovision lovers affectionately refer to the competition as “Gay Christmas”, but if anyone makes a pilgrimage to the holy land next year, an effort must be made by all to ensure a visible LGBTQ+ presence is not co-opted. As the world watches on as the bullets rain down in Gaza, those preparing to book flights for Eurovision’s 2019 instalment should also consider how the event will materially affect Palestinians on the ground. Time and time again we see how Palestinians are punished, the Israeli Defence Force keen to flex its lethal military muscle on days that are seen as significant, or when Palestinian-led protests are planned. When international events come to most European countries where there are sites of dissent and protest, there’s an expectation – quite rightly – that campaigners will have their basic human rights upheld. On Monday, 58 Palestinians were killed for demonstrating, and no doubt there will be further protests planned to coincide with Eurovision next year. I’ll be honest, I felt a sense of discomfort at Eurovision in general – flags and deep-rooted patriotism really isn’t my bag, even when it’s surrounded by camp culture and catchy pop songs. In Jerusalem next year, these symbols will be of increased significance.

But there are times when it is uncannily literal, and one such occasion is when you are teaching your kids to ride. I have three children and, as is the way of these things, have a very clear memory of teaching one of them to ride – I just can’t remember which of the three it was. So, to save an argument later, I’ll plump for the youngest as all the other stories seem to be about the older two anyway. We took Vita to our local park, she’d been wobbling on a balance bike for weeks and it was time for her first proper ride. We walked to the top of a long grassy slope. My wife had the camera. We lined her up. Feet on pedals, hands on bars, bottom on saddle, stabilisers off. “Don’t forget to brake at the bottom,” Juliet said at least four times. I put my hand under Vita’s saddle and started to push her across the grass. Her little legs began to spin. After a few steps I stopped and my wife and I watched her whirr off down the hill and into the distance, blonde hair eddying behind her, shrieks of joy floating over her shoulder. We’d let go… I then spoiled the moment by guffawing, but really I wanted to weep. Learning to ride is one of the great rites of passage – both for parents and children. You are launching them into a sport/hobby/pastime that will last a lifetime. My 85-year-old mother-in-law rode her bike to school in Somerset as a seven-year-old and almost eight decades later is still riding. As with anything child-related, the expense-to-time ratio can be steep. But don’t scrimp on their first bike. Buy a decent one because it’s the bike they’ll remember forever. I could happily tell you everything about the bike I learned to ride on. Cheap kids’ bikes break quickly, are hard to ride, often don’t work properly and are usually too heavy for scrawny limbs. One man who does not have scrawny limbs is Sir Chris Hoy. At his peak his monumental thighs were 27in in circumference – each. Working with Evans Cycles, the Olympic champion has recently updated his bestselling bike range. It now includes two essential designs – the Bonaly and Meadowmill. They cater for children from age 4 to 16 and offer a selection of bikes to suit multiple ridding terrains. Named after the area of the Pentland Hills where Sir Chris Hoy first rode his mountain bike, the Bonaly is Evans Cycles’ best-selling children’s bike. Building on the success of previous models, the updated range comes in 16, 20, 24 and 26 inch wheel sizes and now offers a completely redesigned lightweight frame and child friendly components. A perfect all-round ride for a young rider gripped by the thrills of fast bikes, the Meadowmill is named after the cyclo-cross circuit where Sir Chris Hoy raced early in his career. Aimed at young riders who are looking to ride on a multitude of terrains the Meadowmill isn’t just a cyclocross bike, with drop down handlebars and lightweight aluminium frame they also make fine road bikes, at home on the bridleways and quiet tracks that make up any young explorer’s ride. Understanding that a child’s bike is a much greater percentage of their weight than an adult’s bike is means that these bikes have lightweight frames that balance strength and comfort. Internal cable routing creates a clean aesthetic and keeps wires away from small hands. A set of updated child-friendly components also help to offer a better experience when learning to ride. A new “Q factor” crankset has been designed to ensure junior riders’ legs are closer together and that pedalling is efficient and smooth. The crankset lengths are size specific to limit any overstretch of legs, and also ensure pedals don’t clip the floor when cornering. Size-specific handlebars are used to suit the different shoulder widths of children, ensuring confident handling. In addition to the new lightweight frame and finishing kit, low-spoke wheels and super light foam padding for saddles all help to reduce weight and improve comfort whilst on the bike. You can’t stop them riding away, but at least you’ll know they’re doing it on a bike you can trust.

The story goes that early on, such was their overseas signing’s attitude that he handed his batting partner, one Mike Atherton, his sweater during a break in play with orders to run it back to the dressing room. It’s a great line but, sadly, one that is apocryphal, or has at least been spun to such an extent that Muttiah Muralitharan would have been be proud. Atherton did briefly find himself holding said cable-knit while his team-mate made a sartorial adjustment but apparently no such instruction was given. Nevertheless, that such an embellishment followed is still symptomatic of Ganguly’s time at Old Trafford as a man apart. Andrew Flintoff said it was like having “Prince Charles” in the team, such was his regal demeanour. Ian Austin lamented the fact he “made no attempt to join in socially” and did not truly deliver with the bat after turning up believing “county cricket would be a doddle”. Others simply described a cricketer who was a little reserved – hardly a first – and worked his hours. Ganguly himself has since explained that long playing days meant drinking after stumps was not his thing, not least since his wife, Dona, was with him in Manchester and did not know many people. The Ganguly-Lancashire mismatch came to mind when The Spin began pondering the impending arrival of Virat Kohli at Surrey for his mutually beneficial month-long spell in June. The India captain, desperate to avoid a repeat of a 2014 horror show that yielded 138 runs in 10 innings against England, can adjust to conditions before the Tests in August, while the club and the County Championship will be swamped by an avalanche of stardust. Beyond the inevitable grumbles about English cricket pointing the blunderbuss to the foot of its own national team, what can his new team-mates expect from Kohli? Will he be rocking up and throwing his bats to Rikki Clarke for extra linseed oil, or ordering Sam Curran to fetch him 1,000 brown M&amp;Ms to fill a brandy glass as a pre-condition of taking the field? After all, this is a cricketer with a combined social-media following of 83 million people, estimated annual earnings of £20m (thanks to deals with Puma, Tissot, Audi and Pepsi) and is one half of India’s leading power couple following his marriage to Bollywood’s Anuskha Sharma. Surrey have long had a reputation as the south London strutters who love a big-name signing, but Kohli surely tops the lot. To this end, The Spin enquired as to what is in store for the dressing room in SE11 by asking Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two upstanding Brummies who have spent the past six weeks playing under Kohli for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League, for something of a character reference. “I know a few of the Surrey guys and they are not what people make them out to be a lot of the time. But if anyone in that dressing room does think they are a big dog, they will need to sit down for a little while because there is a proper big dog coming,” says Moeen with tongue is slightly in cheek. “You have your perceptions of someone like Virat, who is quite passionate, emotional, in your face and plays it hard,” explains Woakes. “But off the field he’s very calm and you can chat about anything. He’s very down to earth and for someone who has such huge pressures and public focus in India, to see him go about his business in this way quite refreshing.” Moeen adds: “You see him on the field and people might think he’s arrogant but it is the complete opposite. He’s so humble it is almost weird how nice he is. He’s the biggest name in India but will ring me to check I’m OK or ask if I fancy lunch. Sometimes a player will invite the squad to their house for a meal and it would be easy for him to say no. But he would always go. I can say with certainty that anyone who has a bad word doesn’t know the guy.” Though Kohli’s presence in county cricket will doubtless draw huge focus – no bad thing at a time when the English game is finally trying to break down barriers to entry for the South Asian community – it will still be a step down in intensity from the hothouse of India. Indeed AB de Villiers, another RCB team-mate, told The Spin he expects the 29-year-old to one day finish his career in England for this reason. Says Woakes: “In my first year of IPL I found as an overseas player you get a lot of attention walking through airports in India. But having him in the team – the No 1, the king – we’re almost irrelevant. It makes you realise what his life is like. So county cricket will be much more chilled and he’ll enjoy that. Playing at smaller grounds, that will be an experience too. Having spoken to him about it, he loves touring other countries – it’s a release.” When Surrey confirmed the deal, director of cricket Alec Stewart said one of the main benefits will be watching his off-field preparation – not least his dedication to fitness – with Woakes giving a glimpse of just what this means. “Around 30 minutes before the bus leaves for a match, he does what he calls a ‘priming session’ in the gym,” he says. “It’s like a short burst of Olympic weightlifting. It’s certainly different but it works for him. Overall, his fitness work is having a serious impact on the next generation of Indian players. He’s leaner, fitter, more agile than those before.” For Moeen, however, Kohli’s overriding impact on Surrey will probably be his drive: “When he crosses the line he just wants to win. But it’s winning with control, not win at all costs. They will see his passion for the game. It is unbelievable. “And the fact he’s coming in a day and age when people are trying to play as much T20 as they can, that sums him up – he’s just dedicated to improvement. The England series is big for him personally and he’s giving himself the best chance to succeed.” The latter point may leave some frustrated and the fact it means missing Afghanistan’s inaugural Test in India will irk others. But there is little question that county cricket is going to get an almighty jolt when Kohli arrives next month, not least to any “big dogs” in south London. • This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

We began with iced melon, which was followed by the famous brandade truffee, a delicious concoction of fish cooked with truffles. We could quite contentedly have stopped there, but the next course - small bord like a quail, simmered in wine and served on a bed of green grapes - would have tempted an anchorite to break his penance. Then crêpes Suzette, and, finally, coffee and Armagnac. Madam, Will You Talk? by Mary Stewart --- The recent, glorious spring days in the UK have felt reminiscent of the wonderfully evocative Mediterranean summers in the books I have been reading this week: Mary Stewart’s Madam, Will You Talk? and My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, have somehow manifested in Stroud. The sun is high and bright in the sky, drenching the garden in light. We’ve been hunting for wide brimmed hats and cool, linen dresses, finally packing away coats and tights, until the leaves start to turn again. We’ve picked wild garlic from verdant fields, and have been eating it with everything. And as the sun sets in the evening, we take to the back deck, with cold drinks in our hands. In all honesty, after a few lovely days, I struggle with the summer months – I find myself quietly looking forward to the arrival of autumn. And so I relish narratives where the summer itself is an inescapable aspect of the story, impacting on the actions of everyone under its influence. I identified a kindred spirit in Madam, Will You Talk?: Louise, who sits in the garden of their Provencal hotel, far too hot, drinking ice cold vermouth, burying herself in sketchbooks and novels. Her friend Charity, around whom the book is set, heads off instead to explore, and becomes embroiled in a twisting story of murder and kidnapping. I’ll be revisiting this book again – particularly an extraordinary meal that takes place in the midst of a car chase – but I found myself thinking of this meal instead, one that lives up to expectation after an intensely taxing day. Crêpes Suzette Serves 4 Ingredients Crêpes (this should make 12 - enough for 3 each) 30g butter + 20g for greasing the pan 125g plain flour 2 eggs 375ml whole milk Pinch salt Sauce 50g granulated sugar 75g butter 150ml freshly squeezed orange juice (from 2-3 oranges) Zest of 2-3 oranges 2tbsp Grand Marnier Equipment Small saucepan Large jug Whisk Well-seasoned frying pan Spatula 1. First, make the crêpes. Melt all the butter and set it aside to cool. Measure out the flour in a jug. Make a well in the centre, then crack in the eggs and add a splash of the milk. Whisk vigorously, then continue to add the milk until you have a batter the consistency of single cream. Pour in 30g of the melted butter, and keep the rest for greasing your pan. If you have any lumps in your batter, pour it through a sieve. Set aside for at least half an hour (overnight, if you prefer). 2. Place the frying pan over a medium heat; the crêpes should be cooked relatively quickly, or they’ll be dry and crispy. Brush a little butter around the pan with a pastry brush or piece of kitchen towel. Pour a couple of tablespoons of the batter into the pan, and quickly swirl it around until it covers the pan. If you have too much batter, pour it back into the jug. Cook for 45 seconds, until flecked with golden brown patches, then flip over and cook on the other side. Tip the crêpe onto a plate, and then continue until the batter is used up. (Inevitably, your first attempt will be a bit rubbish; just spread it with a little butter and eat it while making the second.) 3. To make the sauce, pour the sugar into the pan and melt without stirring until it becomes a warm, golden liquid. Add the butter; it will spit and foam, so watch your hands. Whisk in the orange juice, zest and Grand Marnier. The caramel will clump at this stage, but keep it over the heat and whisk until it is melted in. Reduce the sauce until smooth and viscous. 4. Reduce the heat to low. Drop three crêpes into the pan and coat them with the sauce. If you want to be traditional, you can keep the Grand Marnier aside until this point – warm it in a separate pan, set it alight and add it to the sauce. Fold the crêpes into quarters, then transfer them to a plate. Repeat with the rest of the crêpes. Serve immediately."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/19/dj-bbq-key-kit-five-tools-barbecue","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T08:30:22Z","webTitle":"DJ BBQ’s key kit: five tools for a top barbecue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/19/dj-bbq-key-kit-five-tools-barbecue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/19/dj-bbq-key-kit-five-tools-barbecue","fields":{"headline":"DJ BBQ’s key kit: five tools for a top barbecue","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1 A solid cooker with a lid I have a bunch of cookers in my backyard, but the one I use most is the Weber 57cm Master Touch (£269). 2 Good tongs Buy a set that feels comfortable in your hands, because they’re going to do a lot of the work.

More than 20,000 students are paying for rooms owned by companies based in places such as Jersey, Guernsey, the British Virgin Islands and Luxembourg but that figure is likely to be an underestimate given the surge in building in university towns in recent years. The holding structure means that overseas investors are able to sell on the rooms without paying tax on their gains and it allows buildings to change hands without any stamp duty bill. Complex company arrangements also give companies the opportunity to minimise the tax they pay while charging students up to £14,000 a year in fees for high-end housing. One company collected £2.2m in rental income in 2016 but contributed just £10,000 in income tax after it paid £2.1m in charges, mostly to a Luxembourg based holding company. The structures are perfectly legal, but MPs and students criticised their use. John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, said: “Students are squeezed enough without paying high rents to offshore companies. It is a disgrace that offshore companies are maximising their gain from UK students whilst minimising their tax liability here. “That this is perfectly legal demonstrates exactly why parliament needs to thoroughly examine issues of tax avoidance, evasion and offshoring.” The student accommodation industry has been transformed in recent years as universities have turned to private developers to provide accommodation. One study estimated the market to be worth £45bn and billions of pounds worth of deals were done in 2017 alone. Investors from all over the world have snapped up student properties in England and Wales including big pension funds, foreign states and wealthy individuals. Those that bought companies holding buildings, rather than buying properties directly, will not have had to pay any stamp duty land tax. Analysis of Land Registry data and company accounts show many developments are owned by investors through companies or funds set up abroad. The Guardian found developments all over England and Wales – including London, Exeter, Newcastle, Chester and Bristol. Holding a property offshore currently allows overseas investors to sell on properties without a UK tax bill on their profits. This is due to change in April 2019, although any gains made before then are expected to be ignored and not subject to tax. Complex structures involving large loans and charges also allow investors to minimise the profits they pay tax on and make gains on sales without facing any bill from HMRC. Investors may own whole blocks or, in some cases, snap up individual rooms with the promise of high returns. For instance, among the owners of one student block in Newcastle are companies based in jurisdictions including United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Investors paid about £100,000 for each room, with students charged upwards of £135 a week to live there. Accounts for the UK manager of the Courtrooms, a Student Housing Company block in Bristol where students pay £161 a week for an en-suite single room, show that in 2016 it collected a rental income of £2.2m and paid £10,000 in income tax. The bill was reduced by charges of almost £2.1m, the bulk of which were payments to Unicity XV Bristol Sarl, a Luxembourg company registered as the owner of the property. A spokesperson said: “We are a responsible business whose revenue and operations are taken into account when calculating profits on which we pay tax.” Analysis by the Guardian found more than 100 student apartment blocks around England and Wales owned by different offshore companies, with the actual number likely to be higher as there is no clear way to identify student properties in the records. Land Registry listings cover only England and Wales, and some blocks are described as “land”, or another type of building, because that is what the developer purchased before converting into student rooms. Owners are liable for UK tax on the rents they collect from students, but can receive the money before tax and reduce the amount they have to pay by offsetting expenses and debt repayments. The rental income they do declare is subject to UK income tax at 20%, rather than to corporation tax. Corporation tax is 19%, but before April 2015 was higher than the income tax rate. One big investor is GSA, which in partnership with Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund owns 13 buildings around the country managed by the Student Housing Company. The buildings are owned by separate Luxembourg companies. Millions of pounds in rent is collected by UK companies that then pass on payments to Luxembourg. The Luxembourg companies charge high costs for managing the buildings, allowing the firm to reduce the tax it pays. The National Union of Students vice-president for welfare, Izzy Lenga, said UK students were seen as a cash cow by overseas investors, and often had no choice but to take rooms in “overpriced glass towers”. Lenga said: “Overseas investors make billions of pounds building luxury apartments and charging sky-high rents for students. There is a cost of living crisis and finding good-quality affordable accommodation is a huge barrier for low- and middle-income students attending our world-leading institutions.” Additional reporting by Sunniva Kolostyak"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/15/julie-bishop-defends-record-on-china-after-former-ambassadors-call-for-her-to-be-sacked","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T10:15:55Z","webTitle":"Julie Bishop defends record on China after former ambassador's call for her to be sacked","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/julie-bishop-defends-record-on-china-after-former-ambassadors-call-for-her-to-be-sacked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/julie-bishop-defends-record-on-china-after-former-ambassadors-call-for-her-to-be-sacked","fields":{"headline":"Julie Bishop defends record on China after former ambassador's call for her to be sacked","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Julie Bishop has defended her record on engagement with China and committed to donating to a fighting fund to increase representation of women in the Liberal party. In an interview on ABC’s 7.30 on Tuesday, the foreign affairs minister labelled comments by Geoff Raby, a former Australian ambassador to China, “one of the most ill-informed” pieces on the China-Australia relationship she has read. In an opinion piece, Raby suggested sacking Bishop would improve relations with China, attacking her for not having visited in more than two years while angering Beijing with “strident public comments on the South China Sea”. Bishop said the article was “clearly not” impartial and criticised Raby for being “profoundly ignorant” about the level of engagement between China and Australia. She cited the fact that she is due to meet her Chinese counterpart very shortly to discuss North Korea, in addition to having conducted personal phone calls with the Japanese and South Korean foreign affairs ministers and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Asked about failing to visit China in more than two years, Bishop said it was “not correct” because she had visited in 2016 and is due to go back this year. She also cited visits to Australia by the Chinese foreign affairs minister, Wang Yi, and businessman Li Ka-shing, and side meetings at the UN general assembly, the east Asia summit and Asean forum. On Monday night the former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton warned against Chinese interference in Australian politics, telling the same program that she believed “Australians need to be for Australians, Americans need to be for Americans”. “Whether it’s Russia in a secret way interfering with our election and producing more than 3,500 ads to try to confuse our electorate, to try to damage me, or the Chinese looking to try to influence policy, we should say no,” Clinton said. Bishop said that all countries seek to influence others but “improper interference of course would not be allowed in any country”. “And that’s why Australia has now introduced some foreign interference laws to ensure that our sovereignty is maintained,” she said. Asked about representation of women in the Liberal party after assistant minister Jane Prentice lost her preselection, Bishop argued it was an “issue across parliament”. She cited the fact that 13 of the 24 female cabinet ministers since federation had been on the Coalition side compared with 11 from Labor. On Tuesday Guardian Australia revealed that Kelly O’Dwyer had decided to donate $50,000 to a fighting fund for female candidates. Bishop said she would make a donation and would urge others to do the same. She said she would have to look at her campaign funds before deciding how much to donate, adding “I don’t think anybody would question my commitment to fundraising for the Liberal party”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
