The trouble is, morality varies from person to person, and is linked to – among other things – your political views. Measure your own morality by answering (a) agree, (b) disagree or (c) feel ambivalent to each of the following questions 1. Parents should never slap their children (harm) 2. If I were standing in a long queue, I’d feel uncomfortable letting a friend push in front of me (fairness) 3. I wouldn’t turn in a family member who had committed a murder (ingroup loyalty) 4. If I were in the army, I’d obey my commanding officer even if I strongly disagreed with his orders (respect for authority) 5. It’s wrong to do things other people find disgusting, even if nobody is physically harmed (purity) If you agreed with 1 and 2, but disagreed – or were ambivalent – with 3-5, you have a liberal notion of morality. For you, the way to be a moral person is to try to protect others from harm, and to be fair to everyone. If you agreed with the majority of these statements, you have a more conservative view of morality. You of course agree with liberals that, in an ideal world, we should avoid harming other people or treating them unfairly. But, for you, these aren’t absolutes. Sometimes it might be necessary to harm others or treat them unfairly (for example, in situations of war or terrorism). These findings help explain why liberals and conservatives tend to view each other as immoral – they have different views of what constitutes morality in the first place.

Online, it said the desk had shipped, but weeks passed and nothing. I would call, repeat my story to the customer service rep du jour and be greeted with commiseration, as though they too didn’t quite understand how their shop worked. Maybe they didn’t. All I knew was that, after a year of nearly nonstop book touring, I had got it into my head that I needed this desk in order to start writing again and the fact that I didn’t have it yet was sending me into hysterics. About a month or so in, after being told a delivery date and then waking up that day to a note online that said my delivery date had been cancelled “per customer’s request”, I really lost it. I told the customer service rep that it was news to me that I had cancelled this delivery, to which she replied that they had called me and left a voicemail. That was news to me, too. After the call, I cried for about an hour, which probably sounds crazy to anyone who isn’t a writer, who isn’t accustomed to the kinds of irrational bargaining and ritualising that accompanies a writing practice and, yes, a writing space. Usually, my irrational bargaining goes something like this: I start working at around 10 if I’m feeling motivated, 11 if I’m not. I reread the work from the day before and/or passages that I think I got right in order to try to set the tone. I write a sentence. I read it aloud. I delete the sentence. I look at the clock and wonder if it’s too early to think about lunch. I tell myself that, if I can make it to 300 words, I can break for lunch. I write another sentence. This one I might like. If I’m lucky, it leads to a second sentence. I think: “What is the point of all of this? Is anyone truly happy?” I delete the second sentence. I check my email. I have 15 new ones. I respond to them in my head, but don’t actually respond. I write a few more sentences. I get seven new emails. These ones following up on the emails that I didn’t respond to a few days ago. I think: “What exactly does it mean for something to be ‘urgent’?” I plead with myself to write at least another 200 words. On the best days, I stop pleading, stop bargaining and watch-checking and fall into a rhythm so satisfying that I simply forget I’m working. So much of my writing day feels like well-digging. Sometimes I dig 200ft down before coming back up, dry. Every day I search for water. The desk helps, now that I have it. I’ve stacked piles of books that I love on it to act as talismans. They help, too. The desk makes me feel like I’m going to work, even though work is located in a cramped but bright corner of my living room. I wrote much of Homegoing in a writing nook I set up in the Iowa City apartment my parents and I used to call “the dungeon”, because of how dark and dank it was. They had driven 11 hours from Alabama to Iowa to help me set it up. The desk I chose then was cheap and ugly, but I didn’t mind. It was my first time living by myself. Every day I would wake up in the dungeon, head to my nook, sit at my desk and feel proud and productive and contented. I’m trying to recapture that feeling. These days, I’m away more often than I’m home. I’ve never managed to get any real work done on an aeroplane or in a hotel room. How do other writers do it, the ones who seem to have a new novel every year and are constantly on tour? I used to think of myself as someone with a great deal of discipline, but I lost it in the air somewhere over the Rocky Mountains. Now, instead of discipline, I have a desk, and every day that I sit at it I dig a little deeper. At some point, I get deep enough that suddenly, amazingly, I find it – the great rush of water that I had hoped and pleaded for. •Yaa Gyasi's Homegoing is published by Viking (Penguin, £8.99).

The flight was to Schiphol: from there, I took a train into Amsterdam and then a taxi to a Bauhaus-style block of flats beside a canal. This is the place my eldest daughter, Rosie, 25, now knows as home. She and her boyfriend live what seems to me a very sophisticated existence: after they had cycled off to work the following morning, I sat down and realised I was in shock. Surely, I’m not old enough to be the parent of a woman in her mid-20s who lives in another country … I was there to have fun, but also for a serious chat with Rosie. Her life is laid out before her: so many choices, so many possible avenues, so many opportunities. But as she wisely said, making one choice means cutting off a whole lot of others: and when you are 25, poised on the edge of almost everything, there are many routes you need to explore. Sitting in a bar with her later, chatting through the issues in her life, I was struck by the realisation that this was what parenting her had all been about. This talk we were having about her future, under the setting Dutch sun, was the crucial moment; because everything that really matters in anyone’s life – career, partner, children – was now on the line. As a parent, the years are peppered with milestone moments, forks in the road. They aren’t always operatic set-pieces. Some are so subtle they could pass you by almost unnoticed: except that, hawk-like parent that you are, they were never going to sneak in under the door. I was making the children’s tea, I remember, when one of my daughters, aged four or five, casually announced she had been moved down a table for maths. It was her first term at school; and amid the fish fingers and smiley faces I was sliding on to the plates, I realised that all that mattered, in the whole world, was what table she was on for maths. It was a slippery slope from there; being consigned to the lower echelons of the reception-class hierarchy would undoubtedly mean academic disaster. As soon as the children were fed, I phoned my husband. Our entire work as parents rested on deciding what to do in the face of the calamity. There are, of course, plenty of milestone moments: Sats, end-of-year exams, GCSEs, A-levels – and, lo and behold, each stage neatly cancels out the one that went before. Why did I ever worry about Sats, I thought five years later, when GCSEs were clearly the exams that really mattered? No, scrub that: two years on, it was clear that the truly important milestone was how they fared in their A-levels – the gateway to university and all that lies beyond. But hang on; three years down the line, we were waiting to find out which degree class a daughter had graduated with – and this, surely, was the apex of everything? No, no, what was I thinking of: postgraduate study followed. What they choose to study at this stage, where they went, how they did – this would determine their career, and we all know how important fulfilling work is to a happy life. Now two of my four daughters have acquired postgraduate qualifications and I have discovered that the holy grail is not their exam results or which university they attended, or even which career they have chosen: it is who they choose as their life partners. You can overcome anything, after all, with the right partner by your side. Like any parent, all I want for my children is happiness: but life can’t be all happy. It has to include challenges, setbacks, rethinks and even disasters; and for these, all you can aim to do is equip them with the most important and lasting trait anyone can have: resilience. So the truth is that it wasn’t ever about how they were going to do in their exams, or whether they got into their first choice of university; it was never about whether they were in the “popular” group, or whether they got invited to “that” birthday party in year 8; it was never about what table they were on in reception class. What really mattered, every time, was whether my child had the resources to deal with things if they didn’t go the right way, and how quickly she would bounce back. None of this negates the fact that it is a parent’s job to totally believe, in the moment, that these milestones do matter. With my younger children, I have sometimes erred on the wrong side of that fence, and it can fail a child as much as piling on the pressure can: however many children you have, you need to keep on clocking the big moments. So, yes, I know now that GCSEs aren’t the be-all and end-all, but as my youngest sweats over her revision, I have to remind myself that these exams are important, and I must take them seriously. It matters to her that I care; but what is interesting, as an aside, is that it doesn’t seem to matter in terms of the outcome. Whether I have been exercised or chilled about my daughters’ lives, their milestone moments have turned out much the same; I have to conclude that our fretting is more about us than it is about the outcome. One of the most dramatic milestone moments was when one daughter was taking A-levels, and another was waiting to find out what secondary school she had got into. Both were poised at gateways, and both gateways were hugely significant. Then: disaster. The elder daughter had some boy issue that meant, suddenly, she could no longer do any work. She took to her bed, day after day, curtains drawn, Ucas offer languishing on the bedside table. Meanwhile, I discovered that the other daughter was unlikely to get into the school she desperately wanted to go to. It felt like too much to deal with all at once. When the letter came from the local authority with the school offer, I left the envelope unopened in the hall and went to talk to my lovelorn daughter. That day was the turning point; she was coaxed out of bed and agreed that, yes, she did need to go back to her studies. I was so relieved that it was only later in the day, when I checked my phone and found a stream of messages from other parents asking about the school admission letter, that I remembered the envelope, and went to get it. “How could you just have left it there,” asked another mother, incredulous. But what does it matter which secondary school they get into, when what it really all comes down to is when a seismic love crisis will strike, and how will your child cope?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/27/rita-oras-anywhere-abba-esque-electropop-romp-sophie-liam-payne","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T14:00:31Z","webTitle":"Rita Ora’s Anywhere: an Abba-esque electropop romp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/27/rita-oras-anywhere-abba-esque-electropop-romp-sophie-liam-payne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/27/rita-oras-anywhere-abba-esque-electropop-romp-sophie-liam-payne","fields":{"headline":"Rita Ora’s Anywhere: an Abba-esque electropop romp","bodyText":"TRACK OF THE WEEK Rita Ora: Anywhere A surprisingly wistful nod to dreams we don’t belong in, the confines of reality, the fantasy of escapism and one pop star’s quest for temporary anonymity, well-judged electropop romp Anywhere sounds like something that sparks minor online controversy when it only comes third in Sweden’s annual Eurovision heats — and Melodifestivalen followers will know there is no higher compliment. Actually, there is: the line “looking for connection in a crowd of empty faces” makes Anywhere the modern answer to Abba’s Super Trouper. SOPHIE: It’s Okay to Cry In the four years since SOPHIE released the excellently wibbly left-of-leftfield pop masterpiece Bipp there have been production credits ranging from established icons such as Charli XCX to relative newcomers like Madonna, but It’s Okay to Cry finds SOPHIE unearthing pop’s holy grail: an emotionally charged glimpse of what we all hoped a ballad might really sound like in the year 2017. We wanted jetpacks; we got an explosion of sonic twinkles. Not a bad deal. Taylor Swift: Gorgeous Taylor is three tracks into an album campaign that’s taking the innovative route of attempting to build interest through songs that are each slightly less impressive than the last. Great lyrics, though: Gorgeous is about Taylor expressing the conflicted emotions of wanting to bonk someone when she already has a boyfriend and, fair play, “you should take it as a compliment that I’m talking to everyone here but you” is a blinding line. Naughty Boy ft Joe Jonas: One Chance to Dance One from the “I’ve accidentally written it but no way am I bloody singing it” file: an Emeli Sandé-penned mid-tempo stomp-jam – AND THIS IS A JAM THAT STOMPS – that lumbers Joe Jonas with the line, “I’m no professional dancer/ Baby I ain’t no Michael Jackson”. This seems slightly unfair on J.Jo but it could open the door for a trend in songwriter trolling — James Arthur next please, Emeli. Liam Payne: Bedroom Floor This year began with Ed Sheeran talking about filthy bedsheets and things went downhill in the summer when Niall Horan unleashed a paean to his own dirty laundry. As pop’s year of poor textile hygiene draws to a close, Liam Payne’s latest inessential release finds him singing about clothes kicking around on his floor. (Like most things this is all the fault of Jason Derulo, who invented this sorry state of affairs in 2015 when he sang about bedsheets hitting the deck.)

Elsewhere in the Carabao Cup: Bournemouth have beaten Middlesbrough 3-1 at the Vitality Stadium, while Bristol City have put four past Crystal Palace at Ashton Gate - that one finished 4-1 to the Championship side. Leicester City avoided an upset by beating Leeds 3-1 at the King Power Stadium, but Arsenal’s match against Norwich has gone to extra time after finishing one apiece after 90 minutes. At the Etihad, it’s still scoreless between Manchester City and Wolves, with five minutes of normal time to go. You can monitor the scores in the rest of those matches on our live scores service. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It’s all over. With a minimum of fuss, Manchester United advance to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup, consigning Swansea City to their fifth defeat in six games. It was a largely dreadful match, lit up by two splendid goals from Jesse Lingard. 90+2 min: Kyle Naughton has a late effort from outside the Manchester United penalty area deflected wide for a corner. The ensuing inswinger breaks to Leroy Fer three or four yards from goal, but Sergio Romero saves his effort brilliantly from point-blank range. 90+1 min: We enter three minutes of added time, with Swansea looking a completely beaten docket. They’ve offered little or nothing tonight and their fans won’t be happy at all with such an insipid performance. They’ve been so quiet. 89 min: Giving an impressive demonstration of “manspreading” on his seat in the dug-out, Jose Mourinho idly scribbles in a notebook. I’m not sure what he’s writing, because I’m struggling to find anything noteworthy going on out on the pitch. 86 min: Anthony Martial is on the far side of the pitch, furthest from the Manchester United technical area, so it’s he who makes way for Luke Shaw ... very slowly. Shaw gets a warm round of applause from Manchester United’s travelling support. 84 min: Arsenal equalise against Norwich at the Emirates, while Luke Shaw is getting ready for a brief cameo off the bench. Jose Mourinho seems determined to humiliate the kid at every opportunity - is it ludicrous to suggest he could have given him longer than a few minutes at the tail end of a League Cup match that’s already been won? 80 min: With 10 minutes to go, Manchester United are two goals up and in almost complete control of this game. Daley Blind sends in a cross from the left flank, but it’s a mite too high for Romelu Lukaku in the penalty area. 77 min: Bournemouth and Leicester have both taken 2-1 leads against Middlesbrough and Leeds respectively, while it’s as you were in the other Carabao Cup matches taking place elsewhere tonight. Back at the rather dreary game I’m actually supposed to be watching, Daley Blind has just been booked for a foul on Wayne Routledge. 76 min: Axel Tuanzebe trips Jordan Ayew just outside the Manchester United penalty area and is booked for his troubles. The free-kick is in a good position, but Jordan Ayew’s effort is on target but feeble and doesn’t trouble Sergio Romero one bit. 74 min: Abraham doesn’t take long to get involved. On the edge of the Manchester United penalty area, he receives a pass in acres of space, adjusts his sights and unleashes a rising shot that Kristoffer Nordfelt is forced to palm over his own crossbar. Nothing comes of the corner. 72 min: Swansea City substitution: Tammy Abraham on for Oliver McBurnie, who goes off to a warm round of applause from the home fans. The Scottish U-21 international hasn’t had too many chances to shine tonight, but did OK, holding the ball up well on the rare occasions it came his way. 70 min: Elsewhere tonight, Bristol City lead Crystal Palace 4-1 at Ashton Gate, while Norwich are a goal to the good against Arsenal at the Emirates. Other latest scores: Bournemouth 1-1 Middlesbrough, Leicester City 1-1 Leeds United, Manchester City 0-0 Wolves. 68 min: Spare a thought for Swansea’s central defence, who have been softened up for almost 70 minutes by the pace of Rashford and now have to contend with Romelu Lukaku fresh off the bench and hungry for goals after failing to score in his past three appearances. 66 min: Manchester United double-substitution: Ander Herrera and Marcus Rashford off, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic on. Swansea substitution: Roque Mesa off after a very disappointing effort, Leroy Fer on. 63 min: Lingard squanders a half-decent chance to complete his hat-trick, getting in behind the Swans defence again and pulling a low effort across the face of goal. He may have intended to do exactly that, but I think it was just a poor shot from a tight angle. 59 min: This match may be a dud, but Jesse Lingard is doing his damnedest to provide some entertainment. He runs on to a Darmian cross from the right and from just inside the Swansea penalty area, stretches to steer a powerful long distance header past Kristoffer Nordfeldt and inside the left upright. He’s delighted with himself and so he should be. 58 min: Jesse Lingard doubles Manchester United’s lead with a wonderful header. That is outstanding. 57 min: Sam Clucas is booked for a cynical challenge on Marcus Rashford, who promptly drills a low ball into the Swansea penalty area. Anthony Martial tries and fails to get on the end of it. 54 min: Manchester United win a free-kick halfway inside their own half. Chris Smalling stands over it. He looks left, he looks right ... he turns on his heel and passes the ball back to Sergio Romero. Heaven help us all. 50 min: Ander Herrera gets a sarcastic roar of approval from the Swansea fans for a wayward shot that sails high and wide from distance. That’s the first noise they’ve made all night ... unless of course the cheer came from Manchester United’s heroically vocal travelling support. 49 min: Matteo Darmian is penalised for a foul on Roque Mesa in the centre-circle and lumbers back into position in a fit of high dudgeon. 48 min: Wayne Routledge looks a mite dazed and very confused after a clash of heads with Daley Blind while contesting a high ball. He should probably be checked by a doctor, but this is football so it goes without saying that he isn’t and just soldiers on with a possible concussion. 46 min: Manchester United get the second half started, with no further changes in personnel on either side after that first-half substitution of Naughton for the hamstrung Olsson. The more I think about it the more it beggars belief that Paul Clement risked his only fit left-back in a game of such little consequence when his side are struggling in the Premier League. And the Guardian’s man on the Swansea beat doesn’t sound too happy. The teams troop off at half-time, with Manchester United’s second string comfortably outplaying their Swansea counterparts in a very dull match. The Jesse Lingard that separates the sides was one of very few moments of class in front of a very subdued crowd in the opening 45 minutes. Swansea’s woes at the Liberty Stadium look set to continue. 44 min: Paul Clement made eight changes going into this game and probably wishes he’d made nine. Martin Olsson, who has gone off with a hamstring injury, is his only specialist left-back and will, presumably, be unavailable for at least three weeks if not longer. Perhaps he should have taken Luke Shaw on loan from Manchester United - Jose Mourinho certainly seem to have any intention of using him. 41 min: After spluttering briefly into life and looking like it might shape up to be a decent game after all, the game enters another lengthy lull. Making his second appearance for Manchester United in this season’s competition, Scott McTominey runs on to an Anthony Martial, but commits the rookie error of leaning back while shooting and sending the ball high over the bar from the edge of the penalty area. 38 min: Swansea substitution: Martin Olsson off, Kyle Naughton on. 37 min: Swansea left-back Martin Olsson looks like he’s done his hamstring, pulling up sharply and feeling the back of his thigh. He’ll be going off as soon as the ball goes out of play. 34 min: Having just seen a replay of Manchester United’s goal, I must confess that I didn’t give Marcus Rashford enough credit for his assist. Standing with his back to goal, the little back-heel with which he picked out Lingard the goal-scorer was a think of exquisite delight. 33 min: Swansea have a penalty shout of sorts turned down when Tuanzebe appears to hold back Routledge while tracking the Swansea man’s run into the Manchester United penalty area. I think a free-kick just outside the penalty area might have been the correct call there. 30 min: Ki sends in a cross from the left and Daley Blind heads the ball against Oliver McBurnie and looks on in horror as the deflection heads goalwards. Luckily for blind, it flashes just wide of the upright. That would have been a very strange own goal, had the ball gone in. 27 min: After his Huddersfield horror show, Victor Lindelof has looked anything but assured and he fails to convince again, twice, as Wayne Routledge pounces on a through-ball from an offside position. The Swansea man should probably have been flagged for offside, but the linesman failed to spare the Swede’s blushes as he stretched but failed to reach Routledge. Mourinho and all several Manchester United defenders rage at the referee. 25 min: United win a free-kick in the space between the left-side of the Swansea penalty area and the touchline. Rashford drives the ball in low and hard, aiming for goal. It’s cleared at the near post. 23 min: Manchester United have been crying out for somebody to provide an incisive , defence-splitting killer pass and Ander Herrera steps up. He carves open the Swansea defence with a ball through the middle. Marcus Rashford got a flick, sending Lingard in behind one on one with Nordfeldt. He made no mistake, coolly passing the ball in by the right upright. 21 min: Jesse Lingard opens the scoring after being put through on goal, slotting the ball past Kristofer Nordfeldt into the bottom right-hand corner. A good goal and a nice finish. 18 min: Manchester United win a corner. Marcus Rashford’s delivery is poor and Angel Rangel clears at the near post. 16 min: Jordan Ayew continues to look a bit of a handful, but even after just 15 minutes this match already looks well on its way to the One To Forget files. Even Jose Mourinho looks bored, although he has just bounded to the edge of his technical area to bark some instructions at Ander Herrera. 14 min: A mistake from Victor Lindelof almost lets Jordan Ayew wriggle his way between a couple of defenders and unleash a shot. He eventually runs out of space and Sergio Romero collects. 11 min: Swansea City apply a bit of pressure, getting forward in numbers. From the left touchline, Martin Olsson sends in a cross. Jordan Ayew gets his head to the ball ahead of Axel Tuanzebe, but is unable to get any control or direction on his effort. 10 min: Manchester United continue to dominate possession but are showing little or no cutting edge in these early stages. They advance, but only so far, before invariably turning around and retreating with the ball. 8 min: Ki Sung-Yeung arrows the ball into the penalty area from the corner flag and Oliver McBurnie, wearing the Swansea No68 shirt, attempts to steer a header goalwards. The ball takes a deflection off a defender on its way wide, but the referee mistakenly awards a goal-kick. 7 min: Matteo Darmian concedes a corner as he blocks an attempted Martin Olsson cross from the left. 7 min: Angel Rangel and Wayne Routledge combine down the right flank and the latter tries to send in a cross from near the corner flag. Daley Blind blocks. 5 min: Swansea City goalkeeper Kristoffer Nordfedt tips a Jesse Lingard shot from distance over his own crossbar. Daley Blind takes the corner and Swansea’s defence clears the ball. 3 min: There looks to be a good crowd at the Liberty Stadium, but the atmosphere seems a bit flat in these early stages. Manchester United go forward, with Anthony Martial and Daley Blind combining down the left flank before they are forced backwards. 2 min: Sam Clucas concedes the first corner of the match, running the ball out of play while attempting to clear his lines. The ball’s fired into the penalty area, where Chris Smalling leads highest and puts a near post downwards header wide from about eight yards out. 1 min: Swansea City get the ball rolling and Manchester United quickly win a throw-in. It’s windy and wet in Swansea as the two teams make their way out on to the pitch and line up for the last of the pre-match formalities. Just the 15 changes across both sides, with Pal Clement making eight and his opposite number, Jose Mourinho, making seven. “What’s happened with Roque Mesa?” he asks. “Lauded as a smart acquisition, he’s barely had a look in in a struggling team.” The Spanish midfielder signed from Las Palmas for £11m during the summer and has made just three starts. “Some people have questioned why he is not in the team,” said Paul Clement, suggesting that Phillip Wainright may have sent him an email too. “He is still getting up to speed with things, he has been training hard, he is ready for a start.” Swansea: Nordfeldt, Rangel, van der Hoorn, Mawson, Olsson, Ki, Roque, Clucas, Routledge, Ayew, McBurnie.

We’ll bring you the benches, shortly, but it looks a certainty that Luke Shaw will be sitting on Manchester United’s, as he travelled with the team this morning. He’s made just one appearance for Manchester United so far this season and the world’s most expensive teenager now looks to be Jose Mourinho’s fifth choice left-back. Surely his failure to get into tonight’s starting line-up will be a humiliation and snub too far for a player who has made several appearances for United’s U23s this season, once out of position. The Carabao Cup fifth-round draw will be streamed exclusively live on Twitter, the English Football League has announced.

The draw will be held at Twitter’s UK headquarters in central London and the quarter-final fixtures will take place during the week commencing December 18, with the final scheduled for Wembley on February 25. Sergio Romero, Victor Lindelof, Axel Tuanzebe and Scott McTominay all start for Manchester United. Paul Clement makes eight changhes to the Swansea side that was beaten by Leicester at the weekend. Kristoffer Nordfeldt, Oliver McBurnie and Roque Mesa are among the starters there. We’ll have the full line-ups for you very shortly. Both teams are looking to bounce back from Premier League defeats at the weekend, but neither is likely to be at anywhere near full strength as Jose Mourinho and Paul Clement rest established stars and give fringe players a chance to impress. Despite his howler against Huddersfield on Saturday after coming on for the injured the injured Phil Jones, Victor Lindelof is likely to line up for Manchester United, although there has been speculation that Alex Tuanzebe in place of the Swede. Luke Shaw, Scott McTominay, Sergio Romero, Matteo Darmian and Daley Blind are also understood to have been in the United party that flew – flew! - to Swansea from Manchester this morning. Swansea will be without Renato Sanches, Wilfried Bony and Kyle Bartley, who are all sidelined with injury. Clement is also planning to rest goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. The Swansea manager has also said he will start Roque Mesa for only the fourth time since the midfielder’s move from Las Palmas. Barry will be here soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/31/the-house-simon-lelic-review-tale-of-two-storeys","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-31T07:30:19Z","webTitle":"The House by Simon Lelic review – a tale of two storeys","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/31/the-house-simon-lelic-review-tale-of-two-storeys","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/31/the-house-simon-lelic-review-tale-of-two-storeys","fields":{"headline":"The House by Simon Lelic review – a tale of two storeys","bodyText":"Houses play important parts in some of the very best scary stories, whether it’s the immortal genius of Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House (“silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone”) or the mind-bending chills of Mark Z Danielewski’s The House of Leaves. Simon Lelic’s The House appears to set out its stall accordingly: a young couple are looking for their first home together in London. The market is desperately competitive, and the one home they miraculously succeed in snapping up ahead of a horde of rivals is definitively creepy, packed floor to ceiling with the former owner’s junk, from old coats to stuffed dead birds. Jack, one of Lelic’s narrators, hates it from the first. “The house stood alone (‘detached’, marvelled the brochure) as though it had been shunned,” he tells us portentously. “There was a row of terraced houses on one side, huddled together as though for safety, and a block of flats with its back turned on the other. It looked – and felt – somehow ostracised.” We know where we’re going with this: it feels pretty run of the mill, albeit just right for a late October read. But then Lelic introduces his second narrator, Jack’s girlfriend Sydney, and the novel turns into something else altogether. “First off: this isn’t a ghost story. OK? Let’s make that very fucking clear. The house stood alone as though shunned. Who do you think you are, Jack – Stephen King?” she spits. “Creepy house, creepy furnishings, a happy (ish) couple moving in all dumb and cheerful. All the elements are there.” Jack and Sydney are, we learn, writing down their versions of what has led them to the situation they now find themselves in. “What we said was, we wouldn’t just write down what’s happened but also what we thought and what we felt,” says Sydney. “So there’s a chance whoever ends up reading this will actually believe us.” We don’t know what has happened yet, but it’s clear it’s bad, and involves knives and blood. As Jack and Sydney slowly reveal more, jumping back and forth in time as their story layers together, we begin to glean more details: the smell, which is worst in one part of the house. The gruesome discovery Jack makes in the loft. The photograph that makes Sydney’s mum jump out of her skin. Movements in the night: “That’s when I heard it again. The sound that had woken me. It was a shuffling, skidding sort of sound: more the slip of a sole than the clunk of a central-heating pipe.” So we’ve two narrators, ostensibly in love but clearly hiding things from each other, telling us dual versions of a story that aren’t quite matching up, as the cover is slowly peeled off a chilling backstory, and as the police circle closer. “Something else was becoming clearer in my mind too. Something darker. It was like I was peering down into a pit, watching the shadows there slowly taking shape,” says Sydney, wonderfully spookily. Sometimes Lelic’s two voices – Sydney’s sharp as a tack and streetwise, Jack’s that of an all-round good guy – stray a little too close to each other, and the denouement is a little far-fetched. But piecing it all together is half the fun – this isn’t your high-end literary thriller, but it’s a bundle of creepy chills, perfectly timed for Halloween. Is it a “fucking ghost story”?

For seven years he toiled in a poor, remote village in China’s Shaanxi province, unblocking sewage pipes, carrying heavy loads across the hills and sleeping in a flea-infested cave dwelling. He was lonely, bored, hungry, exhausted and anxious about his future. The experience shaped him for life, but not as one might expect. Xi Zhongxun, the Chinese president’s father, was a Communist party veteran celebrated in later life as one of the “immortals”. But when Mao unleashed the Cultural Revolution in 1966, he was brutally persecuted. Xi Jinping’s elder half-sister died in the turmoil and the teenage Xi, along with 17 million peers, was sent to labour in the countryside. Those years have become Xi’s creation myth. It is a potent political narrative. Despite his distinguished family heritage, Xi understands what life is like for those at the bottom of society, in a way that few politicians in the west or even his recent predecessors could. He has suffered, and he has risen above it. “When I arrived ... I was anxious and confused ... When I left, at 22, my life goals were firm and I was filled with confidence,” he has written. His experience helps to account for his genuine popularity, as well as his discipline and drive. Yet a man whose family was so deeply scarred by the excesses of Maoism is dismantling the changes designed to safeguard his party and country against further such disasters. After the Cultural Revolution, Mao’s successors resolved that never again should one person hold such power. Deng Xiaoping, and other survivors such as Xi’s father, sought to institutionalise politics. Their ideas were not codified, but they were crucial in limiting the power of the leader by setting a term limit and ensuring authority was exercised collectively. Xi has ripped up this unwritten rulebook. He is in charge, full stop. This week he became the only living leader since Mao to have his ideology enshrined in the party constitution under his name. His ideas are recorded as “Xi Jinping Thought”, on a par with Mao Zedong Thought, rather than Deng’s slightly less elevated “Theory”. As one analyst joked recently, the five most important people in China are “Xi, Xi, Xi, Xi and Xi”. It looks increasingly likely that the norm of the leader stepping down after two five-year terms is on the way out. Many believe Xi plans to remain in power after 2022, whether by formally retaining the party leadership or by exercising his authority behind the scenes. Comparisons to Mao are overblown, though there are some parallels in Xi’s approach: his demands for ideological purity, his call for China to play a leading role on the world stage and, above all, his personal appeal to the masses. Unlike Mao, he seeks the tacit support of the people, rather than their active intervention. Xi has none of Mao’s love of disruption, only his insistence on dominance. He believes wielding his authority and that of the party more strictly can solve the multiplying problems that previous administrations failed to get to grips with, from rampant corruption to environmental damage. In Xi’s vision, greater control will end stagnation and abuse – the alternative is stasis or, worse, an end to party rule. The leaders before Xi drew a simple lesson from the Cultural Revolution and from preceding disasters like the Great Leap Forward: strongmen breed instability and must be prevented at all costs. Xi appears to have reached a radically different conclusion: at least in this “new era”, stabilising China requires the concentration of power. It just needs to be concentrated in the right, incorruptible hands – his."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/nov/10/lets-move-to-frome-somerset-property","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T16:30:23Z","webTitle":"Let’s move to Frome, Somerset: ‘You want community?

By rolling back the state, it would vanquish the stifling power of officialdom, granting us unprecedented freedom and opportunity. This promise runs through the works of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, and Ludwig von Mises’ book Bureaucracy. But in place of the old bureaucracy, it has created a state-corporate system more oppressive and intrusive than anything governments produced in the social democratic era. The hybrid nature of this system, protected from challenge by commercial confidentiality, property rights and civil law, places it beyond the reach of democracy. The intermingling of state and corporate power allows corporations to harness the resources and protection of the state, and the state to hide behind its corporate partners. A classic example is the private finance initiative: a programme developed in the UK by the Conservatives but greatly expanded by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Under PFI, private companies finance and deliver public goods that governments would otherwise have provided. We were told it would produce better services at lower cost, but the contracts have repeatedly put corporate demands ahead of public need. The debts afflicting hospitals and other parts of the public sector, as they are forced to keep paying for services they neither want nor need, were both foreseeable and foreseen. Labour has now promised, if it takes office, to review all PFI contracts and buy them out if necessary. But the message has yet to filter through, even to some Labour councils. A few days ago, in Sheffield with local campaigners, I toured the battle lines between people and profit. Sheffield has been described as Europe’s greenest city, but the council seems determined to change this through the massacre of many of its famous avenues of trees. In 2012, it signed a contract for what it called “the largest highways PFI programme in the UK” with Amey, a subsidiary of the vast Spanish company Ferrovial. As part of this programme, Amey earmarked 6,000 trees for felling. Among them were magnificent and stunning specimens, treasured by local people, including famous landmarks such as the Vernon Oak in Dore, the Chelsea Road elm, the Western Road memorial trees and the cherry avenues of Abbeydale Park Rise. The reasons given for destroying them seemed incomprehensible: the lifting of a kerbstone or two, the cracking of a pavement, roots intruding a couple of inches into the road. These are routine issues in any city, which can be easily and cheaply addressed without any need to attack the tree. In the case of the Chelsea Road elm – a rare survivor of Dutch elm disease, harbouring a colony of even rarer white-letter hairstreak butterflies – the residents commissioned an engineer to provide an estimate for addressing the cracked paving, and discovered it could be done, at minimal cost, without felling the tree. But, the council tells me, “alternative engineering solutions … are not funded within the contract”. So they cannot be applied, regardless of any cost savings, and regardless of common sense. The terms of the contract were locked in for 25 years in 2012, and cannot be changed. It specifies that the trees must be felled, so down they must come. Nor can there be meaningful engagement with local people – that, too, would stand outside the terms of the contract. The council has claimed that the issue is too big and too contentious for a public consultation to handle. In a democratic system, big and contentious are generally considered to be reasons for consultation. Because a PFI contract must guarantee financial certainty for the corporate partner, it forbids government agencies to learn, adapt and respond. As a result, the landscape architect Steve Frazer points out, Sheffield’s streets, with their rich communities, complex forms and multiple functions, are being reduced to nothing but “conduits for conveying cars and people”. Sterilised, featureless streets are the physical embodiment of a rigid and intolerant mindset, which itself arises from a rigid and unassailable contract. The flexibility that capital demands of the workforce cannot be applied to capital. If the contract were changed, the council insists, there would be “catastrophic financial consequences”. Exactly what these are is impossible to know, because the relevant sections of the contract have been blacked out. This, the council tells me, is because such details are “commercially confidential or commercially sensitive to either Amey or the council.” It is hard to see why. It seems to me that the information is more likely to be politically embarrassing than commercially compromising. In a twist that comes straight out of a Franz Kafka novel, the schedule to the contract (#30) that explains why parts of it have been deemed “commercially sensitive” has been withheld from public view. The hybrid nature of PFI provides a never-ending excuse for denying information to the public. As soon as a PFI contract is signed, the public sector must become the guardian of private sector interests. On Friday two local people, Calvin Payne and the Green councillor Alison Teal, will be tried under another hybrid instrument: a civil case with potential criminal penalties. Sheffield city council has accused them of contempt of court, by breaking the injunction it served to prevent them from obstructing the felling of the trees they love. It has asked for custodial sentences. They might also, if found guilty, be charged with the costs of delaying the contract, which could amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds and result in the seizure of their assets. Throughout the neoliberal era, governments and companies have devised new criminal and civil procedures to defend capital from protest. This is the force behind market forces. The enabling state, with its strong public services and robust social safety nets, might have been rolled back, but the security state has expanded, to protect corporate profits from democracy. Those who defend the neoliberal model insist that such arrangements are a distortion of the programme, caused by government meddling, thwarting their purely commercial utopia. But the truth is that this hybrid, Kafkaesque system is an inevitable result of a model that cannot meet our needs – while providing endless opportunities for clientelism and capture. PFI exemplifies the practice of neoliberalism. It exposes the doctrine for what it is: a gigantic self-serving con. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/24/poundland-reaches-deal-with-toblerone-makers-over-copycat-bar","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T17:38:03Z","webTitle":"Poundland reaches deal with Toblerone makers over copycat bar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/24/poundland-reaches-deal-with-toblerone-makers-over-copycat-bar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/24/poundland-reaches-deal-with-toblerone-makers-over-copycat-bar","fields":{"headline":"Poundland reaches deal with Toblerone makers over copycat bar","bodyText":"Poundland is being forced to redesign its copycat Toblerone bar, but can sell half a million of the lookalike chocolate this Christmas after reaching a sweet deal with the Swiss original’s owners. In July, the budget chain was forced to delay the launch of its Twin Peaks bar, which has two points per segment, rather than the single peak of a Toblerone, after a legal warning from the brand’s owner, a Swiss division of US confectionery and snacks group Mondelēz. Poundland said that 500,000 of the bars, which are currently in production, would go on sale in December in “distinctive packaging” different from the light-gold wrapper it originally planned. The deal brings to an end a three-month legal wrangle in which Poundland tried to claim that the Toblerone shape was no longer distinctive. The retailer said it wanted to launch Twin Peaks “in response to the unfavourable reception” that greeted Toblerone’s new version with fewer chunks, launched last year after chocolate and other ingredient prices rose. “Poundland is an important and valued customer of Mondelēz, so we are glad that we have reached a solution for their Twin Peaks bar,” a spokesperson for Mondelēz said. “Toblerone is one of the most loved, unique, best-value Swiss-made chocolate products in the world. Its high-quality, special Swiss recipe and triangular peaks have been delighting people around the world since 1908, and we believe will continue to do so for future generations of chocolate lovers too.” Poundland said it would relaunch Twin Peaks in the new year “with a modified shape that still offers customers 180g of British-made chocolate inspired by the Wrekin and Ercall hills in Shropshire”. “Following positive discussions, we can confirm Poundland and Mondelēz have come to an agreement that allows both businesses to put their Twin Peaks dispute behind them,” the company said in a statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/toy-designer-tom-karen-home-raleigh-chopper","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-04T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Child at heart: inside toy designer Tom Karen’s fun-filled home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/toy-designer-tom-karen-home-raleigh-chopper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/toy-designer-tom-karen-home-raleigh-chopper","fields":{"headline":"Child at heart: inside toy designer Tom Karen’s fun-filled home","bodyText":"In Tom Karen’s Cambridge house, toys, games and sculptures pepper every surface. They drop hints about his long career: from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, Karen was chief designer at Ogle Design, the UK firm responsible for the Raleigh Chopper, the children’s game Marble Run, as well as cars, lorry cabs, crash test dummies, radios and washing machines. He has a Chopper permanently propped up in the front room, and points to its key innovation, the large back wheel: “It symbolised the power going through the back, like a Formula One car.” At 91, and 20 years after he officially retired, Karen is still designing, for his own pleasure: bird sculptures, corrugated cardboard trees and games. A garage serves as his workshop and is filled with inventions and works in progress; a drill, bandsaw and sander are lined up on an old table. “I’m happier here than anywhere else,” he says. But the back of the house – a kitchen, dining room and studio – is where he spends most of his time. The bright, south-facing space has big windows, a glass door leading out into the long garden, and a side extension with an orange-painted steel ceiling joist. His modest Victorian terrace is a far cry from his childhood home, an imposing building in the Czech city of Brno. “We had a swimming pool, tennis court, huge greenhouse, vegetable garden, servants…” he recalls. “The city is ringed with wooded hills; Cambridge is a bit flat in comparison.” The wealth came from a brickworks set up by his great-grandfather. In 1939, when Karen was 13, the family fled as the German army advanced. They travelled from Belgium to France to Portugal, before landing in the UK in 1942. The surname Kohn was changed to Karen when he was naturalised here. Karen’s enthusiasm for toy-making is driven by his interest in children’s development. “The age range I love best of all is up to four or five. They go through a learning curve that is extraordinary.” His house is “geared to having children around”, notably his six grandchildren, aged between five and 12, who visit from London, Yorkshire and Zambia. “I always have lots of felt pens and paper around.” Sculptures and figurines adorn shelves, tables and cabinets, including a wooden hippo from Denmark with moving parts. “He’s so clever – I just adore him.” Karen himself has created an outsize mobile phone and hedgehog from driftwood and rusty nails, as well as a tiger from Tesco packaging. He loves making birds; with their wire skeletons and paper bodies, they are a common theme throughout the house. “I often wonder if it’s because of my pet in Brno – a tame jackdaw called Kako. He loved me; he would fly around the house and sit on my pillow.” He gives the impression there are a lot more inventions in him yet. “I have a butterfly mind, and I’m still flooded with ideas,” Karen says. As for his house, he says, with some understatement: “I have a knack for filling every surface.” House rules Pet interiors hate Free-standing baths. Design hero Nicolas Hayek, the founder of Swatch.

I’m not the only one working in the fashion business wondering whether this will finally signal the end of our own disgraceful “hush hush” culture surrounding harassment. I thought this moment had come when reading that Condé Nast International – which publishes Vogue, GQ and Glamour – had finally decided that it would no longer work with photographer Terry Richardson, for whom allegations of multiple sexual assaults have dogged his seemingly unstoppable career for years. But given that we have only heard this because of a leaked email, and that the company has refused to confirm or deny it publicly, perhaps not. This late display of “duck and cover” neither protects victims nor presents Condé Nast as an ethically minded company. Because when accusations are made, it’s usually the accusers who suffer, unless the fashion industry decides to change its habit of a lifetime and makes the correct moral choice to make a strong show of protecting them. As a fashion stylist, I was sexually harassed by a high-profile rapper in a meeting with a fashion client a few years ago. I had to beg my colleagues not to be left alone with him, and I was met with “joke” envy about how lucky I was. The message was clear – I should either get over it, or get another job. I have also had to physically push overzealous photographers away from partially nude girls getting changed backstage at fashion shows, and I’ve comforted a 16-year-old crying uncontrollably after a man in his 40s had barked at her to “Come on, be sexy darling! You can do better than THAT!” This is only the tip of the iceberg of what many models have to endure on a daily basis as part their unofficial job description. Last week the model Cameron Russell used her Instagram account to publish dozens of accounts of sexual abuse and harassment from anonymous victims, under #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse. Former supermodel Christy Turlington supported Russell’s campaign, saying “harassment and mistreatment have always been widely known and tolerated in the industry. The industry is surrounded by predators.” The lucrative love affair between fashion and film was strengthened by Weinstein, who in 2010 invited Sarah Jessica Parker to be chief creative officer for fashion house Halston Heritage, for which Parker also wore designs on Sex and the City. Knowing that actresses are live adverts for fashion houses, Weinstein also strategically pushed his wife’s couture label, Marchesa, demonstrating his red carpet savvy. US Vogue cover placements of his female actors were also thanks to his shrewd relationship with editor Anna Wintour. Weinstein’s interest in fashion reflects two historically intertwined industries, which are representative of high-octane glamour, but also guilty of the covert abuse of power. But are we on the precipice of change? Last week on BBC Radio 4, Tom Hanks called for rigorous guidelines. “I think there should be a code of ethics posted in every lunchroom of every company on the planet that says here is the behaviour that is expected of you as an employee of this company,” he said. Recently there has been a spate of “outings” for alleged harassment and assault on social media. “Social media provides a safe space and a community, and now we are seeing abusers being named on it too, which is key,” says Rebecca Pearson model and founder of modeltypeface.com. “No more rumours about a ‘certain casting director’ – actual names and details of the experience and what effect it had on the victim are now out there,” she says. In 2012, former model Sara Ziff founded The Model Alliance, a much-needed union body that promotes “fair treatment, equal opportunity and sustainable practices in the fashion industry from the runway to factory floor”. So will this spell the end of Richardson’s place as feted photographer in the fashion world? He has always denied any abuse, but post-Weinstein, Richardson’s self-portraits of him having sex with his subjects and ejaculating on to a model’s face are surely seen in a different light. Like Jimmy Savile, Richardson dons a “comedic” persona, openly flaunting his predatory nature. Despite many allegations over the years, he continues to get high-profile gigs, most recently photographing teen icon Kylie Jenner for her 2017 calendar and directed a music video for Beyoncé in 2013. International makeup artist and activist Georgina Graham, who has worked for fashion’s biggest names, believes the dominance of the male gaze in fashion imagery is the key factor. The enablers – often female editors and stylists, who are knowingly or unknowingly complicit – have internalised the culture of misogyny, and facilitate the acceptance and standardisation of abuse. Graham believes what is needed is already happening – more empowered creative feminists to revolutionise the patriarchal rot at the helm of power. She says: “For so long, both the heterosexual and homosexual male gaze has driven the aesthetics of women in both editorial and on the runway, and especially in advertising for the last 40 years – Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, Mario Testino and Terry Richardson have reigned supreme. We are now finally seeing a rise in female photographers and creatives such as Harley Weir, Petra Collins and Zoe Ghertner, and designers like Phoebe Philo at Céline, Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy, and Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen, who are transforming fashion power dynamics with a definitively empowered female perspective.” With the new breed of “woke” models like Adwoa Aboah, who uses her fame to highlight social justice issues with her “Gurls talk” platform encouraging girls (and boys) to speak out about mental health, let’s hope that the tragic exploitation of female sexuality will no longer be tolerated. And male Hollywood stalwarts such as Hanks speaking out about the need for proper moral conduct and care for employees in our severely unregulated entertainment industry will hopefully encourage more men to align themselves with the struggles of women. Who knows? Maybe now we will start to see corporations finally begin to take some responsibility. To admit their collusion in the distress of young women may seem an idealistic ask, but it’s only by owning up to their mistakes and instilling crystal clear procedures to wipe out future harassment, that we can begin to respect them again. • Namalee Bolle is fashion writer and director"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/modern-styling-in-the-heart-of-rural-devon","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"Modern styling in the heart of rural Devon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/modern-styling-in-the-heart-of-rural-devon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/modern-styling-in-the-heart-of-rural-devon","fields":{"headline":"Modern styling in the heart of rural Devon","bodyText":"When Mark Camillin and Liam Denny moved to Devon, they received a note through their letterbox from the parish council. “It basically said: ‘Welcome to the village with no pub and no bus service, but plenty of social activities,’” says Mark. After city life, this was exactly what they were looking for. “We came with the idea of continuing to run our architecture practice, but also working the three acres of land – a modern-day version of The Good Life,” he adds. Their home doesn’t look like a no-frills, back-to-the-land farmstead. It’s a contemporary house they designed and built from scratch, replacing a less lovely building on the plot. “The setting is idyllic, but sadly the previous house didn’t match the location,” says Liam. What had originally been a small 19th-century farm cottage had long since been obliterated by extensions and alternations. It was damp, the windows were in uPVC and the whole house had been sprayed with concrete and painted custard yellow. “It was no longer recognisable as a Victorian cottage. The character had been sucked out of it,” says Mark. The couple lived in the old house for a year while they thought through ways to salvage it. During this time, more problems emerged. “At one point, we thought there was a ghost going around breaking things: the boiler, the light switches, the door locks, the windows, the toilet, the cooker – they all died at various points in the year,” remembers Liam. “We had wanted to restore it, but realistically there was little left of the old building and it was less expensive to start over. That way we could create a house that was more environmentally friendly and really made the most of the location.” As they co-run architecture practice Camillin Denny, the couple had plenty of ideas, but also took inspiration from favourite international architects including Richard Neutra “with his panoramic glazing” and Wildrich Hien Architekten’s Haus Hesse in Austria. Closer to home, they looked to the style of houses in their village of Northleigh and the courtyard layout of local farms. “Some farmyards have overhanging buildings that provide shelter, while others are more random arrangements of outbuildings, the main aim being to get to the animals from the house easily in winter,” says Mark. The layout of their home is in a Z-shape, with a guest annexe forming one leg and the main living area in the central section and opening on to a courtyard. For their take on barn style, all exterior walls are clad in slim panels of Canadian red cedar and a timber canopy wraps around an outdoor seating area. At the house’s core is a panelled wall that incorporates library shelving, cubbyhole nooks, coloured panels that slide back and a secret ladder up to the mezzanine. Mark explains their thinking: “Before building this place, we’d always lived in Victorian houses, which tend to come with their own quirks and features. We didn’t want a space that felt comparatively soulless, with echoey spaces and white plastered walls.” So they created this library wall as a focal point. “We wanted this wall to look as if it had always existed,” he says. Panels are interspersed with sections painted vivid green, in part a nod to one of the key “strong colours” defined by Le Corbusier, but also to echo the valley views that lie beyond the living room’s picture windows. In the same spirit of creating character within a modern frame, the couple added internal windows to connect the spaces. “They help you think of the rooms as flowing into each other, rather than as a series of separate rectangles,” says Mark. “Overall, we wanted to give the house an organic feel, so you notice the textures of the wood, the concrete floor and then you look outside, to the views over the countryside.” As for The Good Life, “Yes, it’s all starting to come together,” says Liam. The vegetable beds are all ready for planting and timber offcuts from the house build are being put to good use on their next project – a chicken coop."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/24/james-toback-sexual-harassment-allegations-film-maker","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T23:24:44Z","webTitle":"James Toback: the film-maker accused of being a sexual predator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/24/james-toback-sexual-harassment-allegations-film-maker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/24/james-toback-sexual-harassment-allegations-film-maker","fields":{"headline":"James Toback: the film-maker accused of being a sexual predator","bodyText":"There’s a strong chance the average moviegoer isn’t familiar with the name James Toback. It’s a fact the 72-year-old writer-director is allegedly painfully aware of. A recent Los Angeles Times exposé paints a portrait of a man bragging and name-dropping to get what he wants. According to more than 200 testimonies, what Toback wants is to sexually harass and intimidate women and post-Harvey Weinstein, he’s the next Hollywood heavyweight to find himself accused of being an aggressive predator. Like Weinstein, his behavior has reportedly been an open secret in industry circles for years. “It’s a common thread among many women I know,” said Karen Sklaire, a drama teacher, actor and playwright. “After someone mentions they were sexually abused by a creepy writer-director, the response is, ‘Oh, no. You got Tobacked.’” Reports of Toback’s conduct go as far back as a 1989 issue of Spy magazine, and later found their way into Gawker. He even made a semi-autobiographical film called The Pick-Up Artist. But Toback’s standing in the industry was nowhere near as lofty as Weinstein’s. His alleged techniques for picking up women are as simple as approaching them on the street, a business card and often a DVD of one of his films ready to impress them. His list of accomplishments includes an Oscar-nomination for his Bugsy screenplay in 1991. He has directed three films starring Robert Downey Jr (including 1997’s Two Girls and a Guy); he was an uncredited script doctor on Bad Boys, Crimson Tide and Disclosure; he made a HBO documentary about film-making that featured interviews with stars such as Ryan Gosling, Jessica Chastain and Martin Scorsese and had a small role in Woody Allen’s 1990 drama Alice. Since the 70s, he’s been a constant presence on the scene, continuing to work on films that might not break out to a wide audience but manage to attract a steady stream of stars. His most recent, the arthouse drama The Private Life of a Modern Woman starring Sienna Miller and Alex Baldwin, received its world premiere at the Venice film festival earlier this year. Toback is the grandson of a retail magnate but managed to gamble away his $1m inheritance by the age of 21 (the experience led him to write the script for the 1974 James Caan drama The Gambler). He went to Harvard, befriended Tommy Lee Jones and claims to have taken the largest dose of LSD in history. His colorful background made him a compelling character to many. In various interviews he’s described as “larger than life”, “opinionated” and a “torrential talker”. He was boisterous in a 1999 interview with the Guardian, simulating gay sex as a way of recalling a scene from his film Black and White between Downey Jr and Mike Tyson. He frequently depicted explicit female sexuality in his films, most notably in the largely improvised 2004 drama When Will I Be Loved, which opened with a five-minute scene of Neve Campbell masturbating with a shower nozzle. “Well, I’m obsessed with women, so I can imagine my way into a female consciousness very well,” Toback said to IGN upon the film’s release. But behind the facade of an indie stalwart helping to create strong female characters, allegations now position Toback as a serial predator, taking advantage of his position to coerce women into situations sold as career-improving. He would allegedly take meetings with female actors that would soon devolve into intrusively intimate questions about sexual history before Toback would dry-hump, masturbate and often ejaculate on them. He is said to have boasted of famous sexual conquests and to have made threats. One unnamed victim, a rising Hollywood star at the time, claims he told her: “People who go against me … I know people that hurt people.” Toback has denied any suggestion of wrongdoing, claiming never to have met many of the accusers; if he had, it was for “five minutes” and he had “no recollection” of the meeting. He also states that his diabetes and a heart condition mean it is “biologically impossible” to do the things he has allegedly done. The Weinstein allegations feel like the start of a sea change in Hollywood, a place long beset with tales of casting-couch impropriety and sexual harassment. The accusations against Toback have prompted other high-profile figures to speak out. On Tuesday, Julianne Moore tweeted: “#JamesToback approached me in the 80’s on Columbus Ave with the same language – wanted me to audition, come to his apt. I refused. One month later he did it again with the EXACT same language. I said don’t u remember u did this before?” The Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn also shared a Facebook post describing the cases of 15 women who have shared stories with him, including former girlfriends and a family member. “I told the women who would come forward I had their back,” he wrote. “This is me doing my best to fulfill that promise.” On Twitter, Anthony Bourdain referred to him as “a well known sack of shit” while the Weinstein accuser Asia Argento called him “another pig”. The growing list of women, more than 230 to date, has also led to the possibility of an official Los Angeles police department investigation while officials determine the severity of complaints. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Toback’s agent has cut ties with him. His membership at the Writers Guild of America East is also at risk. “The allegations against James Toback are deeply troubling,” a WGAE statement read. “They are both extensive and consistent, and this sort of behavior cannot be tolerated.” In 2004, Toback said, with perhaps alarming prophecy: “I think I could name, without coming up for air, about 30 famous, established, rich, successful guys who have turned themselves into helpless, pathetic buffoons because of sexual obsession.” In the current Hollywood climate, Weinstein was the first and Toback won’t be the last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/24/premier-league-big-six-defeated-overseas-tv-revenue","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T15:24:39Z","webTitle":"Premier League’s ‘big six’ abandon move to reallocate overseas TV revenue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/24/premier-league-big-six-defeated-overseas-tv-revenue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/24/premier-league-big-six-defeated-overseas-tv-revenue","fields":{"headline":"Premier League’s ‘big six’ abandon move to reallocate overseas TV revenue","bodyText":"The Premier League’s so-called big six have been forced to accept defeat in their battle for a bigger share of £1bn of overseas TV revenue. Some of the other Premier League clubs banded together to oppose strongly a proposal that would have seen 35% of the money distributed according to league position. A meeting planned for Wednesday in London was cancelled when it became apparent no agreement would be reached. The current arrangement, in place since the Premier League came into existence 25 years ago, distributes overseas television revenue equally between all clubs. In an attempt to appease the six the Premier League’s executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, had suggested a model whereby 35% of the money would be distributed according to league position. Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur were believed to have pulled West Ham United, Leicester City and Everton on board but the agreement of 14 clubs is needed to effect such a substantial change. Stoke, Swansea and Crystal Palace are understood to have been the three clubs most fervently against the proposed change. A meeting of representatives from the 20 clubs this month had ended without resolution and it is believed Steve Parish, the chairman and part-owner of Palace, called a meeting with the 13 other clubs to ensure they held firm. The six have pushed for change because they believe they are more responsible for the growing overseas interest and therefore deserving of a larger slice of the income. It is understood the Premier League is not concerned that this setback could cause the six to look at establishing a breakaway league, possibly with other European clubs, with any such move needing to be approved by Uefa. It is not the first time some clubs have suggested they are worthy of a larger share of TV money. In 2011, Ian Ayre, then the Liverpool chief executive, intimated that certain others lacked pulling power abroad. “In Kuala Lumpur there isn’t anyone subscribing to ESPN to watch Bolton,” he claimed. However, it is the first time it has reached the negotiating table and Scudamore has been desperate to keep both sides happy. He may now look at offering a different deal but will be wary of pushing the six into a breakaway move. The Premier League said in a statement: “Clubs have been discussing the distribution formula for their international broadcasting revenues. The Premier League has facilitated these discussions, to bring together the wide range of views which exist. It has become clear there is currently no consensus for change, meaning tomorrow’s club meeting is not necessary.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/photographs-british-sundays-pinata-cake-what-to-buy-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T06:00:20Z","webTitle":"Photographs of British Sundays and a piñata cake: what to buy this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/photographs-british-sundays-pinata-cake-what-to-buy-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/photographs-british-sundays-pinata-cake-what-to-buy-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Photographs of British Sundays and a piñata cake: what to buy this week","bodyText":"Easy like Sunday morning Want to see what the British do on Sunday?

Speaking in response to a Labour motion passed unanimously last week calling for the gradual national extension of the system to be paused, Damian Hinds, the junior work and pensions minister, said ministers would “continue to listen to concerns”. But he declined to say whether the government would reduce the six-week wait for claimants to receive initial payments. Labour has called, among other changes, for this to be reduced to four or five weeks, saying the system as it is pushes people into debt. Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, told Hinds that the main food bank in his Birkenhead constituency was seeking 15 tonnes more supplies before the arrival of universal credit locally next month. Asked whether the food bank was being prudent, Hinds replied: “I think we have to be careful to ascribing the reasons for the use of food banks to individual or simple causes. Of course we do not expect that to happen, we expect this system to work exactly as well as it can.” Field intervened again to say this was “not the food bank thinking up ideas or targets. This is our food bank talking to other food banks in other areas that have already had the rollout. On that basis they suggest in the coming year, not just Christmas, they need to raise an additional 15 tonnes of food.” He asked: “Are they scaremongering, and we should put them aside, or should we believe them that the government won’t be able to deliver universal credit without reducing people to hunger?” Hinds said he did not want to suggest the food bank was being alarmist. “But my response to his substantive question is no, we do not expect these things to happen, because we want this system to work as well as it possibly can. It continues to improve in its performance and we continue to evolve and improve the system,” he said. The Labour motion calling for a pause to the rollout of universal credit was passed by 299 votes to zero last Wednesday after government whips ordered Conservative MPs not to take part. The new debate was granted by the Speaker, John Bercow, for the government to respond to the vote. Beginning the debate for Labour, Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said she did not know why David Gauke, her government opposite number, was not appearing, and she had not received a “satisfactory response” from his office on this question. Abrahams said ministers needed to give a proper response to worries after the vote about both the implementation of universal credit and what she said were serious design flaws. “The government must take action or face serious constitutional questions,” she said. “This government has had three sitting days to respond to the legislature, keeping this house, keeping the country, along with the 7 million people expected to be using this programme, waiting.” Although the Labour motion last week was advisory, Abrahams said the government should “respect the will of the house, this country’s elected representatives, and pause universal credit full service rollout”. She added: “I stand ready to work with him [Gauke] in the national interest to address these issues and avert the disaster that is universal credit.” Hinds did not engage with Abrahams’ questions, saying only that the system had been fully debated before it began to be implemented and that the government was listening to concerns. “Yes, it is a fundamental reform, it is a lot of change. It’s a new benefit, it’s a new IT system, it’s a new operational system. It involves new ways of working with partners, and yes that does bring with it some challenges,” he said. “But its implementation is at a very measured pace, stretching over nine years, from 2013 to 2022.” Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, criticised Gauke for not attending the debate, saying her constituents on universal credit would be sanctioned for similar behaviour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2017/oct/31/good-to-meet-you-lavinia-moore","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-31T10:57:14Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

However, it is the international news that I have relied on when Australian newspapers have failed to provide me with detail that I seek. In 2001 I went to Woomera with a group of human rights activists. A desert gulag had been established where asylum seekers were placed as far as possible out of sight of ordinary Australians. I started a group of activists at work to lobby for the rights of these people. That same year the courageous captain of the Tampa stood against the government of Australia. And then there was 9/11, and the invasion of Iraq. I remember a colleague at this time who could not cope with all of the horror and decided to avoid all media mentions of what was happening. I made a decision to do just the opposite: to read and listen to as much as I could possibly find. It was then that I began the habit of getting the Weekly. And I have continued to do so ever since. I am now retired, but as an elder I reserve the right to speak out, especially regarding equality and human rights. I think that I owe this trait to my lovely mother – a Lancashire lass – who always advised me to help others whenever I was able.

I met a lot of people you’ll know and some you won’t: publishers, captains of industry. The way they acted – and the way I did, to be honest – was a source of inspiration later. Sex is a great leveller. It made me want to tell a story about good and evil in which sexuality was the connective tissue. Most English and American horror movies were not sexual, or coquettishly so – a bunch of teenagers having sex and then getting killed. Hellraiser, the story of a man driven to seek the ultimate sensual experience , has a much more twisted sense of sexuality. By the mid-80s I’d had two cinematic abominations made from my stories. It felt as if God was telling me I should direct. How much worse could I be? I said to Christopher Figg, who became my producer: “What’s the least I could spend and expect someone to hire a first-time director?” And he said: “Under a million dollars. You just need a house, some monsters, and pretty much unknown actors.” My novella The Hellbound Heart, which mostly took place in one house, fitted those parameters. Roger Corman’s company New World – who agreed to fund a film for $900,000 – said very plainly it would go straight to video. My film required some design elements that hadn’t been seen before, the equivalent of Freddy Krueger’s fedora, striped sweater and burnt face. The look of the Cenobites, such as the pins in their leader’s head, was inspired by S&amp;M clubs. But I was emotionally inspired by them, too. On S&amp;M’s sliding scale, I’m probably a 6. There was an underground club called Cellblock 28 in New York that had a very hard S&amp;M night. No drink, no drugs, they played it very straight. It was the first time I ever saw people pierced for fun. It was the first time I saw blood spilt. The austere atmosphere definitely informed Pinhead: “No tears, please. It’s a waste of good suffering!” The week before filming started, I went to the library at Crouch End, where I was living in London, to get a book about directing. They had one – but it was out. Luckily, the crew were very gentle with me. You can only go that far into darkness if everybody’s on board. I had Richard Marden, who had worked with David Lean, as editor, and Bob Keen, who had done special effects on Star Wars and came up with Frank’s resurrection scene. We had a nice working rhythm. Initially, New World couldn’t care less. Then, about halfway through the six-week shoot, they said: “We’re coming over.” Robin Vidgeon, my director of photography, said: “I’ve seen this a million times. They see something they like and they want to take charge.” Three of them came over, all in new Burberry coats. Robin and I had changed the schedule so we were doing something incredibly bloody – one of them may have got their Burberry splashed, and they fled after 15 minutes. I didn’t get bothered by them again until later on. They got us to relocate the story to America, and overdub some of the accents – which I didn’t feel great about because the original story had been so English. I wanted to call the movie Hellbound but Christopher said it was too negative. He suggested Hellraiser, which is exactly right. It’s about something coming at you. The American censors gave it an X rating, and to get an R we had to take some spanking out of the flashback scenes and shorten some of the violence. New World gave it a wide release, and it made $33m worldwide. Pinhead was only in it for eight minutes, but it quickly became apparent people liked him. And I got a good reaction from the S&amp;M crowd – and still do. I was validating a lifestyle. It was a celebration of the beauty of these strange secret rituals. Doug Bradley, actor I’d known Clive since we did a play together at high school in Liverpool. He first mentioned in the fall of 1985 that he was putting together a low-budget British independent horror movie. He said there might be a part for me – what became known as Pinhead. I was also offered the role of a removals man. For a split second, I had an actorly conversation with myself: because Hellraiser was my first movie, I thought it might be a good idea to be seen on screen as myself. But it was a brief conversation. There was no doubt in my mind that this unnamed guy with the pins in his head had a certain je ne sais quoi that a mattress-delivery guy didn’t. The makeup took five or six hours to put on at first, though they got it down to three or four. The first time I wore it, I sat in front of the mirror trying to make friends with this new face, playing some lines and seeing where they took me. Most of my decisions about playing Pinhead were made there and then. I had a sense of power, of majesty, of a kind of beauty. His threat is implied: look what I did to myself – now imagine what I can do to you. Clive was very excited to have his creations walking and talking around him. But he gave me one note. He said: “You have no idea how amazing this looks on camera. But do less.” So I would take things down a notch, and he would say the same thing again. He was leading me to realise that the makeup was so powerful, I didn’t need to sell it to the audience. It’s difficult as an actor because you feel as if you’re just standing still and saying words. It was me on the poster when the film came out, and Pinhead was on the cover of Time Out. But I was not credited, and I didn’t do any publicity for the first film. However, when I came to the States for the first time in 1989 for a Fangoria horror convention, there was a line of fans going out of the hotel and round the corner. I assumed they were there for someone else, but it took me 20 minutes to get to my room because I was surrounded by people asking for photographs. That’s when I realised Pinhead had taken off with horror fandom. He represents the Faustian bargain: the things we desire will come at a price. • Hellraiser is out now on limited edition Blu-ray steelbook."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/05/giant-curtain-erected-in-peru-in-bid-to-reveal-secrets-of-the-cloud-forest","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T11:20:58Z","webTitle":"Giant curtain erected in Peru in bid to reveal secrets of the cloud forest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/05/giant-curtain-erected-in-peru-in-bid-to-reveal-secrets-of-the-cloud-forest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/05/giant-curtain-erected-in-peru-in-bid-to-reveal-secrets-of-the-cloud-forest","fields":{"headline":"Giant curtain erected in Peru in bid to reveal secrets of the cloud forest","bodyText":"What will happen if climate change pushes clouds higher into the sky, as models predict?

Cloud forest thrives on mountainsides at 500-4,000 metres above sea level, making up about 1% of the world’s forest in a tropical band that hugs the equator. But, though the area covered is small, the forests are vital to much broader regions. For instance, they help regulate rivers across vast tracts of lowlands, absorbing moisture into spongy soil when the weather is wet and releasing water when it’s dry. And they provide habitats for many birds, such as the coppery headed emerald hummingbird of Costa Rica and the elfin wood warbler of Puerto Rico, both of which live only in cloud forests. Many scientists believe the process forcing clouds higher may already have begun. This would diminish a cloud forest’s moisture and it’s uncertain whether forests could successfully migrate uphill in response. Examining the impact of clouds relocating is critical to understanding the future of the forests. Dan Metcalfe, a biology professor at Lund University in Sweden, wants hard data so he can determine what will happen to the forests that remain if the models are correct. He explains he’s trying something never before done: “an experimental approach where we actually physically try to remove clouds from a portion of the forest”.Metcalfe had planned to encircle a square plot twice the size of a basketball court with a mesh curtain suspended from 10-storey phone poles at each corner. Fog would condense on the fabric, leaving the interior moisture-starved. He chose the Wayqecha Biological Station, a cloud forest research centre 3,000m above sea level in Peru. But he didn’t factor in the difficulty of operating heavy equipment at Wayqecha. Precipitous slopes and fragile soil prevent hauling in the kind of drill rig that could set corner posts deeply enough for big nets. No roads penetrate to Wayqecha’s groves, only footpaths. Metcalfe realised he’d have to install bolted metal lattice towers. These can be hand-carried in pieces, then assembled on site. They can be built atop slender footings and stabilised by guy wires installed with lightweight equipment. But they’re expensive. He couldn’t afford two, let alone four, and feared that he might have to cancel the project. But then Metcalfe heard that not long before, the station had suffered a misfortune that could help him. Wayqecha already had three lattice towers, supporting a catwalk over a ravine. Until recently, the walkway had included a fourth tower, but it had been toppled by a landslide. However, the structure’s struts and decking were undamaged. Rather than completely enclosing a plot in nets, Metcalfe realised he could suspend a single mesh curtain across the path of mist blowing up a valley. The fog-catching curtain would dangle from a cable stretched between one of the undamaged towers and a new one he’d build out of the one that had fallen. Metcalfe encountered obstacle after obstacle even carrying out his plan: a key member of his construction team got sick and needed months of recovery; a fire destroyed expensive gear; and Peruvian customs balked when they saw that a shipping container of construction supplies included the bow and arrow he’d need for stringing cables. In the four years since he started the project, his wife had a child. And then another. It got tougher to leave home for Peru. But finally, the curtain is nearly done. A crew built the tower in September and the last step, suspending the curtain above the forest floor, was completed at the end of October. Soon, Metcalfe will be able to shed light on the future of the forest. • Reporting for this story was supported in part by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting and the Whole Systems Foundation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/25/the-guardian-view-on-mps-and-brexit-parliament-must-have-the-power","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T18:19:32Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on MPs and Brexit: parliament must have the power | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/25/the-guardian-view-on-mps-and-brexit-parliament-must-have-the-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/25/the-guardian-view-on-mps-and-brexit-parliament-must-have-the-power","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on MPs and Brexit: parliament must have the power","bodyText":"For a senior minister to be slapped down on his own departmental special subject is unusual. For that senior minister to be slapped down on his own special subject by his own press spokesperson is surely unprecedented. Yet this is what happened to the always supremely self-confident Brexit secretary, David Davis, on Wednesday. It happened, moreover, on a dimension of Brexit that, in comparison with many, is extremely simple to understand. It was also one on which, unusually, the government has made its goal clear. That is why the episode provides a truly disturbing insight into a government strategy that is now beyond shambles. It is no secret, Mr Davis told MPs, that the European Union tends to make its decisions “at the 59th minute of the 11th hour”. This was therefore “precisely” what he expected to happen in the case of the UK’s Brexit talks with the EU. So, Labour’s Seema Malhotra asked him, does that mean parliament may not get to vote on any Brexit deal until after Brexit has occurred? “It could be, yeah,” said Mr Davis. “It depends when it concludes.” So it could be after 29 March 2019, the day the UK ceases to be a member of the EU? “It could be,” Mr Davis agreed. “It can’t come before we have the deal.” Seven months ago, on the day that she formally began the two-year article 50 Brexit process, Theresa May gave MPs and peers a promise that had been forced out of her by a vote in the House of Lords in March. “I have been clear,” the prime minister said in a Commons statement, “that the government will put the final deal agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament before it comes into force.” Such a deal, if there is one, will come into force at the end of March 2019. It follows that, for parliament to have its vote, the deal must be made in sufficient time for MPs and peers – as well as the European parliament, which has treaty rights to sign off on the agreement – to consider it. That can’t happen if the deal is only struck at 11.59pm on the last day of the process; “precisely” the timetable that Mr Davis expects. Mrs May tried to brush the problem aside at prime minister’s questions. She said she was confident that a deal would be done in time for parliament to have its vote, though this was not what Mr Davis had said. A few hours later, Mr Davis’s own spokesperson had another go: “We expect and intend” the vote to be before Brexit, said a statement, adding that “this morning the secretary of state was asked about hypothetical scenarios”. This, too, was a partial reverse, but not a complete one, as the Conservative remainer Dominic Grieve and Labour’s Stephen Kinnock both insisted. At the very heart of the leave campaign in 2016 was the demand to take back control and to reclaim the sovereignty of the UK parliament. It is impossible to think of a more important peacetime decision for the UK than the terms on which Britain leaves the EU. It would be completely absurd for the government to deny parliament a meaningful vote on that issue. Any vote that took place after the Brexit deadline would be utterly meaningless. It would be the polar opposite of parliamentary sovereignty. The UK parliament vote should logically precede the vote in the European parliament, This can only mean one of two things. Either the deadline for the talks is really late 2018 – in which case everything has to be tied up in a year from now. Or the EU must prolong the article 50 process, a power it possesses. Whichever it is, Mr Davis has been exposed by this episode. He spent an hour and a half insouciantly implying to MPs that he was the master of the situation and that everything would work out well in the end. But on this and on many other issues in the Brexit process, this is simply untrue. “Expecting and intending” to have a parliamentary vote on the biggest issue facing Britain is not enough. The commitment must be absolute. The guarantee must be unconditional. Parliament must have the power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/26/john-f-kennedy-asssassination-documents-national-archives","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T09:19:56Z","webTitle":"Files will shed light on a JFK shooting conspiracy – but not the one you think","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/26/john-f-kennedy-asssassination-documents-national-archives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/26/john-f-kennedy-asssassination-documents-national-archives","fields":{"headline":"Files will shed light on a JFK shooting conspiracy – but not the one you think","bodyText":"In the persistent, probably eternal whirlwind of conspiracy theories about the November 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy, there is one conspiracy theory that is no longer just a theory – and hasn’t been for years. That wide-ranging conspiracy was for real. And proof of its existence will almost certainly grow more solid on Thursday with the imminent release of tens of thousands of pages of long-classified, assassination-related documents from the National Archives – supposedly the last of the government’s secret files on Kennedy’s murder. What conspiracy? Not one involving a second assassin in Dealey Plaza. (All of the most credible evidence continues to point to Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone gunman in Dallas.) Not some sort of mafia plot that resulted in the silencing of Oswald two days later by Dallas strip-club impresario Jack Ruby. (Really, what half-way competent Mob boss would choose a delusional blabbermouth like Ruby to carry out a second Crime of the Century by murdering Oswald?) Not a sprawling coup d’état involving everyone from President Lyndon Johnson to the Pentagon architects of the Vietnam war to a cabal of gay rightwingers in New Orleans. (See Oliver Stone’s hit 1991 film JFK.) I’m referring to the well-documented, proven conspiracy within the highest reaches of the US government – a criminal conspiracy from the start, involving the destruction of top-secret documents and photographs, the silencing of witnesses and whistleblowers, and the wholesale suborning of perjury – to cover up the truth about what the government had known in advance about Oswald and the clear threat he had posed to one man: President Kennedy. The word “cover-up” is not hyperbole. Remarkably enough, it is the word that the CIA itself applies to what happened immediately after the assassination. In a once-classified internal report that became public in 2014, the spy agency’s in-house historian acknowledged that the CIA had engaged in a “cover-up” (albeit a “benign cover-up”, he insisted) to hide evidence from the Warren commission and later government investigations. The cover-up was intended to keep investigators focused exclusively on evidence that proved “what the Agency believed at the time was the ‘best truth’ – that Lee Harvey Oswald, for as yet undetermined motives, had acted alone in killing Kennedy”. I certainly don’t see the cover-up as benign. And in conspiring to hide evidence of their bungling before the assassination – a conspiracy exposed document by document over the last half-century – the CIA and FBI helped launch the much larger wave of conspiracy theories that followed and are likely to plague us forever. Since the late 1960s, opinion polls have shown consistently that a majority of the American people are convinced that the government has never told them the full truth about the murder of their president. And their skepticism, the evidence shows, has always been justified. After falling down the rabbit hole of the national debate over the Kennedy assassination – my first book was a history of the 9/11 commission, so I made the grievous mistake of thinking it would be easy to follow up by writing a similar history of the Warren commission – I was saddened and surprised by a central conclusion that I reached by the end of my research: the Kennedy assassination did not have to happen. It could have been prevented – easily – if the CIA and FBI had just acted on the intelligence in their own files in November 1963. Yes, Oswald was a violent, delusional misfit. But he was not the pure “lone wolf” portrayed by the initial government accounts of the assassination – the image that the government was desperate to present after Kennedy’s murder, since it suggested nothing could have been done to stop him. In fact, both the CIA and FBI had Oswald under aggressive surveillance in the months before the assassination – and knew he was talking to people who, at the height of the cold war, might also have wanted to see Kennedy dead. Both agencies had strong reason to believe that Oswald, a self-proclaimed Marxist who had years of rifle practice in the Marine Corps, would be a danger when Kennedy’s motorcade passed through Dallas on 22 November 1963. In what I believe was a horrifying coincidence, Oswald had just begun a new job as a laborer in a book warehouse that overlooked Dealey Plaza – the Texas School Book Depository. The evidence gathered by the CIA and FBI before the assassination about Oswald should have put his name in “red lights” as a threat to Kennedy, former FBI director Clarence Kelley admitted reluctantly after his retirement. If the FBI had just acted on the information, he wrote in his own memoirs in 1987, “without doubt JFK would not have died in Dallas and history would have taken a different turn”. Instead, immediately after the assassination, panicked officials at both the CIA and FBI tried, desperately, to cover up evidence of the extent of their knowledge of Oswald, fearing their bungling of the intelligence about JFK’s assassin might be exposed – and that they would be blamed for the president’s murder. All of which brings us to today. It is no surprise that the CIA and FBI are, ultimately, the source of most of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of pages, of classified documents that are scheduled to be released by the National Archives on Thursday. From the bare-bones index of the documents provided by the archives, many of the 3,100 never-before-seen files will reveal new details about the extent of the voluminous information that the CIA and FBI gathered about Oswald in the months and years before Kennedy’s death; previously declassified CIA documents show the agency was monitoring Oswald as early as 1959, the year he tried to defect to Moscow. This week’s massive government document dump, which Donald Trump has said he does not intend to block unless he sees “compelling and clear” last-minute proof that some documents could damage national security, fulfills a deadline established under a 1992 law passed by Congress to try to stem conspiracy theories about the Kennedy assassination. The authors of the 1992 JFK Assassination Records Collection Act said they were alarmed, in particular, by the cloud of suspicion kicked up by Stone’s film, which was released the year before. Under the law, all government files related to the assassination must be released, in full, within 25 years of the law’s passage – a deadline reached this Thursday, 26 October. Many historians and researchers, including this one, will be most intrigued to see the still-secret files that, according to the Archives index, are related to an event that was the focus of so much of the cover-up by the CIA and FBI – Oswald’s six-day trip to Mexico City just weeks before the assassination. He had apparently gone there to try to obtain a visa to defect to Cuba. Immediately after the assassination, the CIA and FBI acknowledged they had been aware that Oswald had visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico. But the agencies insisted they had no information to suggest that Oswald had done anything in Mexico to hint that a plot to kill Kennedy had been hatched there – or anywhere else. But declassified files from both agencies would become public years later that showed that, during the trip, Oswald met in Mexico with Cuban and Soviet spies, including – incredibly enough – a KGB assassinations expert. He appears to have had a brief affair with a Mexican woman employed at the Cuban consulate there. Another document declassified in the 1990s: a top-secret June 1964 FBI memo prepared by its director, J Edgar Hoover, for the Warren commission that revealed that Oswald had apparently spoken openly in Mexico City of his intention to kill Kennedy. In what appears to be another, particularly brazen part of the cover-up, that memo appears never to have reached the commission. While Hoover’s memo eventually appeared in the panel’s digital records at the National Archives, surviving commission staff lawyers told me for my book they never saw it during the commission’s investigation in 1964. They said they would have remembered such a “bombshell” document, and it would have prompted an urgent investigation in Mexico to determine who else heard Oswald talk about killing Kennedy – and if anyone there had offered to help. In Dallas, the FBI cover-up began the weekend after the president’s death. The first act came on Sunday 24 November, the day Ruby gunned down Oswald at Dallas police headquarters, when an FBI agent in the bureau’s field office across town was ordered to destroy a threatening handwritten note that Oswald had hand-delivered to the office earlier that month – apparently a protest over the FBI’s aggressive surveillance of his family. What did Oswald write in the note? We’ll never know, because the agent took the note into the men’s room, tore it into pieces and flushed it down the toilet. Years later, the agent admitted to congressional investigators that he and his supervisor had panicked at the thought that the note would been seen as proof that that the FBI had botched the opportunity to save the president’s life. • Philip Shenon, a former Washington and foreign correspondent for the New York Times, is the author of A Cruel and Shocking Act: The Secret History of the Kennedy Assassination • We’d like your help.

It is absurd to have to write this. Three months ago – after travelling to Scotland to attend our grandfather’s funeral – she was detained at Edinburgh airport under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. She was forced to hand over her passwords for her mobile phone and computer; she was interrogated about the political beliefs of her relatives (myself included); and then was driven from the airport to a police station to have her DNA sample and fingerprints taken. After being detained for four hours, she missed her flight back to Berlin, where she lives: the police refused to even pay the cost of a ticket for a new flight. Here’s the background. My sister took part in July’s protests at the G20 summit in Hamburg. She was sprayed by water cannon and tear gas, witnessed police brutality and, in the melee, fell and injured her legs. She was later arrested on suspicion of being in the anarchist black bloc (she wasn’t), detained for 36 hours and released without charge. Her first arrest itself represented an attack on the civil liberties of a peaceful protester. The second detention can hardly be construed as anything other than an attempt to intimidate and harass someone exercising their fundamental democratic rights – using legislation supposedly designed to prevent would-be murderers committing atrocities. The Labour MSP Neil Findlay has written to Scotland’s justice minister with a series of questions about my sister’s case: including whether the detention was fair, justified or proportionate; about the tactics Police Scotland used against “a wholly innocent UK citizen”; and asking who authorised the action. No one rational disputes the need for laws to protect people from the threat of terror. It is not unreasonable, after all, to expect anti-terrorism legislation to be used to target terrorists. When such laws were introduced, critics suggested they would threaten civil liberties and infringe on the rights of the innocent. They were smeared as scaremongers, and yet they were vindicated. Eleanor is herself desperate to emphasise that she has a privileged position. She is a white woman whose brother is a newspaper columnist. “I’m more worried about people who don’t have my privileges or voice who are wrongfully harassed by this law,” she tells me. “I want my case to be used to bring attention to their injustice.” Schedule 7, a legacy of New Labour authoritarianism, grants the police sweeping and unchecked powers at the border: at airports, ports and international train stations. “It allows the police to detain and question someone without any suspicion of wrongdoing,” says Millie Graham Wood, a solicitor at Privacy International. “And so they are often suffered by people who have done nothing wrong.” If few of those who are targeted by section 7 go on to challenge it – perhaps feeling embarrassed or intimidated, or simply not wanting further hassle – then the police clearly feel that they can get away with it. As my sister puts it, white people like her are not normally the victims. Schedule 7 reeks of racism. According to Liberty, in 2010/11 45% of those targeted were Asian, 21% black, and a mere 8% white. The police can question those they detain for up to six hours, and keep their possessions for up to a week, while the detained have no right to remain silent and no right to a lawyer. Their basic civil rights are suspended. The forcible downloading of data from laptops and mobile phones is chilling too. In the modern era, our entire lives are contained on these devices, including the most sensitive and personal details. Allowing strangers to scour through our photos and information on everything from our sexuality to medical conditions is horribly intrusive, humiliating even. And the disproportionate targeting of minority Britons is a form of state-sanctioned harassment that should concern us all. As David Anderson QC – the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation – puts it, there is an “absence of a suspicion threshold for some of the more intrusive powers under schedule 7”. Yet the government has refused to accept his recommendation for such a threshold – meaning that innocent people will continue to have their civil liberties infringed. Indeed, David Miranda – partner of the former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald – was detained under the clause four years ago. As a court of appeal judgment into his detention later found, schedule 7 was incompatible with the European convention on human rights. Other activists have suffered my sister’s fate: in 2009 the climate change campaigner Chris Kitchen was prevented from travelling to Copenhagen for the climate change talks. In 2012 anarchists were prevented from visiting an international gathering in Switzerland; their data was also taken. The same happened to a peace campaigner. It’s not just schedule 7 either. A 2009 report detailed the use of other anti-terror laws against protesters. Britain has suffered deadly terrorist attacks this year that have cost the lives of dozens of people: children at a Manchester concert, revellers in Borough market, tourists on Westminster Bridge, and a worshipper at a mosque. Yes, there is an indisputable need for the police and security services to have the powers they need to prevent such acts. But it suits the government to deflect attention from having slashed 20,000 police jobs, and instead emphasise the need for ever more authoritarian legislation. After all, Theresa May denounced police officers who warned such cuts would put the country at risk as “crying wolf” and “scaremongering”. Yet Max Hill QC – the current independent reviewer of terrorism legislation – this week warned against the government’s “kneejerk reaction” to recent attacks. Without “very careful work”, he said, plans to imprison those who repeatedly look up online terrorist content could mean innocent people being locked up. Is that scaremongering? Or does the experience of my sister underline that this is a very obvious risk? Our rights and freedoms were won with huge sacrifice. Allowing the threat of terrorism to deprive citizens of basic human rights is dangerous. It also hands victories to terrorists who can quite rightly boast of changing our way of life and of widening divisions within our communities. My sister’s case represents an attempt to intimidate a protester. Activists and innocent Britons from minority backgrounds are having their civil rights taken away from them. It is an affront to our democracy, and it must stop."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/25/raila-odinga-civil-resistance-eve-rerun-kenyan-election-presidential","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T20:41:44Z","webTitle":"Raila Odinga calls for civil resistance on eve of rerun of Kenyan election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/raila-odinga-civil-resistance-eve-rerun-kenyan-election-presidential","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/25/raila-odinga-civil-resistance-eve-rerun-kenyan-election-presidential","fields":{"headline":"Raila Odinga calls for civil resistance on eve of rerun of Kenyan election","bodyText":"The leader of Kenya’s main opposition party has called for a campaign of civil disobedience and resistance on the eve of a controversial rerun presidential poll. Raila Odinga told a crowd of several thousand supporters in the centre of Nairobi that the polls scheduled for Thursday were a “sham” and amounted to a “coup d’etat” by Uhuru Kenyatta, the incumbent president, and told them not to vote. “Tomorrow we begin the new battle for electoral justice … We must rise to the occasion and save democracy not only for ourselves but for all Africa,” the 72-year-old political veteran said. There will be relief that Odinga did not call for protests, which could have led to widespread violence, instead telling supporters to “hold vigils and prayers away from polling stations, or just stay at home”. Thursday’s disputed election was called after the supreme court annulled an election held in August owing to procedural irregularities. The August presidential poll was won by Kenyatta, by a margin of 9 percentage points. Odinga urged supporters on Wednesday to respect those who wanted to vote in the rerun. “Do not look at your [neighbour] with suspicion … He or she is as much of a victim as you,” said Odinga, who has lost four times in elections. In a televised speech on Wednesday evening, Kenyatta described the rerun as Kenya’s “greatest democratic test”. “Tomorrow we head to the polls. Tomorrow we ask God for his guidance … and to grant each and everyone of us wisdom and peace in these testing times. We have another opportunity to show the world that we are a modern state striving for shared progress and shared prosperity. We have a unique opportunity to solidify the foundations of Kenya … and emerge, stronger, more confident and more united as a people.” Kenyatta added a warning, however. “Let no one infringe on his brother or sister’s right [to vote] .... Our security agencies have been deployed across the country to ensure the safety of each and every Kenyan,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday Kenya’s supreme court could not consider a petition to postpone the highly contentious vote because not enough justices were available to form a quorum. David Maraga, the chief justice, said one judge was unwell, another was abroad and unable to return in time and a third was unable to come to court after her bodyguard was shot and injured on Tuesday night by unidentified gunmen. That attack has been viewed by some commentators as an attempt to intimidate the judiciary. The last-minute petition, filed by three voters, including a human rights activist, argued that officials could not ensure the polls were free, fair and credible. Protesters in Kisumu, a western city which is an opposition stronghold, blocked roads with boulders, sticks, and burning tyres after news of the supreme court statement was broadcast. Opposition leaders and supporters have said they do not believe the rerun will be fair, as none of the electoral reforms they requested have been implemented. “The same system that bungled the August election will bungle this election … We can’t participate in elections and every time our leader is unfairly defeated,” said David Jesso, a 22-year-old law student among the crowds in Nairobi’s Uhuru Park to hear Odinga speak. Senior members of the Electoral Commission have expressed deep concerns about the forthcoming polls. One went on leave last week and another fled to the US citing threats to her personal security. Some experts have been calling for a short delay to allow tensions to ease and essential preparations to be completed. Adding to the uncertainty on Wednesday was a high court ruling that invalidated the appointments of constituency electoral agents for the vote. It is likely the ruling will provide the basis for at least one of many expected legal challenges to the poll. Many in Nairobi remained nervous, with long queues at supermarkets as locals stocked up on essentials. The European Union has reduced its team of election observers for the election, citing “the extreme tension, disruptions of polling preparations, and strong criticism that has been made of the international community”. Odinga’s claims of vote-rigging after his defeat in 2007 elections prompted rioting and retaliation by security forces, which tipped the country into its worst crisis for decades. About 1,200 people were killed in the ethnic violence that followed. Many Kenyans say that the potential for violence is reduced now because the country has learned from its earlier traumatic experiences; though 37 people were killed in protests after the August poll, widespread clashes have been avoided. There have been near-daily opposition protests against both the Electoral Commission and the draft electoral law, which the president has yet to sign. Rising prices, unemployment and allegations of graft have also fuelled discontent. The crisis has aggravated ethnic divides within Kenya that many believed were declining in importance. Odinga is Luo and has succeeded in attracting support from a range of minorities, while Kenyatta, who has been in power since 2013, is Kikuyu, the most dominant community. Nic Cheeseman, a professor of African politics at Birmingham University, said a range of broader grievances were focused on the country’s most prominent leaders. “Odinga is a personification of one community’s frustration and sense of marginalisation, while Kenyatta is seen as the personification of another supposedly privileged community. So it is this broader identification which means the elections can be so explosive,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/25/roy-dotrice-obituary-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T17:04:47Z","webTitle":"Letters: Roy Dotrice obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/25/roy-dotrice-obituary-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/25/roy-dotrice-obituary-letters","fields":{"headline":"Letters: Roy Dotrice obituary","bodyText":"Kevin Bannon writes: Roy Dotrice took a leading role in the BBC television comedy series AP Herbert’s Misleading Cases (1967-71). He played the litigious, self-representing Albert Haddock, whose stupendously ingenious courtroom disputes with state bureaucracies or corporate magnates were presided over by Justice Swallow (Alistair Sim). The judge’s audacious bias in Haddock’s favour was to the chagrin of the ever-frustrated opposing counsel – Sir Joshua Hoot QC (Thorley Walters). It was the most delightfully eccentric of programmes. John Machin writes: In the early 1950s Roy Dotrice worked at the Savoy theatre in Scunthorpe. He featured in the popular, if unchallenging, plays that were in the repertoire of the a typical repertory company of the times, and demonstrated his versatility in more demanding ones: Johnny Belinda, No Trees in the Street, and the macabre drama of Mary Hayley Bell’s Duet for Two Hands. My sister Rosemary recalls that backstage he was very friendly and thoughtful, encouraging her in her involvement in local amateur dramatics. Geoffrey Batten writes: I still recall Roy Dotrice’s extraordinary solo performance as John Aubrey in Brief Lives at the Criterion theatre in 1969. He appeared to fall asleep at the end of the first act and remained on stage during the interval until the audience were back in their seats when he roused himself for the second half. At one point in the performance he used a chamber pot, the contents of which he proceeded to tip out of the window. Also memorable was the set by Julia Trevelyan Oman, who created what the author, Patrick Garland, described as a “Jacobean kitchen-sink”. During his performance as Caliban in The Tempest at Stratford in 1963 he retreated to the back of the stage for the same purpose."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/26/no-one-use-libraries-any-more-rubbish-sanctuaries--enrich-communities","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"No one needs libraries any more?

It’s a question I have been mulling over for the past couple of days, since I bought a secondhand book online and found guiltily that it was, in actual fact, a library book. I assumed that someone had stolen it, or taken it out and then died, but then it struck me that perhaps the library had closed. So I’ve been trying to find out. Meanwhile, the journalist and former Conservative aide Andre Walker took to Twitter. “Nobody goes to libraries anymore,” he wrote. “Close the public ones and put the books in schools”. What a privileged position to take, I thought, this assumption that these vital public spaces are not needed. Spoken like someone who has always been able to afford books and magazines (or else, I suspect, doesn’t read), who can pay for an internet connection, who doesn’t need help filling in government forms. Spoken like someone who doesn’t require shelter from the storm, isn’t housebound or lonely or trying to escape a chaotic home life, isn’t a new parent wondering what to do with a small, helpless being for a few hours, because it’s raining and you’re knackered. Spoken like someone who, because of money, selfishness, or political ideals, doesn’t need or want to feel part of a community that, for others, gives life depth, and variety, and meaning. Now, I don’t usually make a habit of writing columns about something controversial that someone has said on Twitter; life is far too short. But this time, more than 100,000 people have replied to Walker’s tweet, rendering it somewhat newsworthy (and also leading him to back down and admit that libraries are not as unpopular as he believed). I’m also addressing it because of the context in which it appears: because of cuts to local authorities, libraries in Britain are closing all the time, at a rate that – despite the passionate commitment of librarians and activists, has begun to feel heartbreakingly inevitable. As I write, £10m worth of cuts mean that 21 libraries in Northamptonshire are at risk. Alan Moore, the writer of the graphic novels Watchmen and V for Vendetta, grew up in a working-class family in Northampton – and has threatened to halt filming of a TV project due to take place in the town if the council does not reconsider. Without library access, he told the Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo, he would not have become a writer. The same is true of me. Throughout my childhood, I withdrew eight books (the maximum allowed) every few weeks from my local library. We could never have afforded to buy them. They gave me a passion for reading that was indiscriminate – I would devour anything, whether age appropriate or not (a few brutally graphic crime novels, snuck out without my parents’ knowledge, certainly kept me up at night). You could throw anything at me, from the Brontës or the Sweet Valley twins, it didn’t matter. Growing up in a rural area, I had a planet of ideas and experiences opened up by the library. Next summer my first novel will be published. Without the libraries of my childhood, it would never have been written. I feel emotional almost to the point of tears about libraries. In wanting to examine why, it occurred to me that for many of us library lovers, a library is an extension of home – a big, cosy living room into which everyone is invited. And just as the interior architecture of a childhood home becomes enmeshed with the interior architecture of our minds – that painting of the fox that you always felt was watching you, or that ornament that seemed fixed, as if glued, to the mantelpiece, or that intricate pattern on the god-awful rug – so does the library’s. Many of us, if blindfolded and transported back to the library door, would know it from the smell alone, could navigate our way to our favourite stacks with no effort, could draw the posters from memory. Libraries are witnesses to formative experiences regardless of age or maturity, places where you may have sat and been transported telepathically into the mind of another: the universe that they have created, the feelings they have projected. And so, of course, we feel protective of them. The books we read make us, and often save us. As I was writing this, I was inundated with stories of what libraries mean to people, in various ways: to some they are sanctuaries from abusive home lives, or even homelessness. They are places to revise and learn and use technology, to rent films and records and CDs, when doing so elsewhere is impossible. They are the backdrop for bonding rituals with parents and aunts and grandparents – one young woman, Dawn Powell, told me that her mother had loved her library so much, a bench had been up in her honour there after she died. (She also used to nick family members’ library cards, so she could take out more books). Relationships with librarians were also important. They pointed out books that changed readers’ lives for ever, and offered guidance, sympathy, tissues, a friendly face. (If you’ve ever cried in a library you’ll know what I mean.) One child even had a birthday cake baked every year. Libraries may be needed more by poor people but many comfortably off people use them too. Regardless of class background, libraries plug us into our communities, reminding us that there is life beyond our living rooms, that there’s more to our daily existences than work and coming home, and the same again tomorrow. We are not all atomised in front of our glowing screens. Libraries don’t just mean us, they mean other people too. No wonder we fiercely protective of them. They are priceless. Maybe that’s why they are so busy • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/25/new-zealand-to-ban-foreign-buyers-existing-homes-jacinda-ardern","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T19:17:49Z","webTitle":"New Zealand to ban foreign buyers snapping up existing homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/new-zealand-to-ban-foreign-buyers-existing-homes-jacinda-ardern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/25/new-zealand-to-ban-foreign-buyers-existing-homes-jacinda-ardern","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand to ban foreign buyers snapping up existing homes","bodyText":"New Zealand is planning to ban foreign buyers from purchasing existing homes in an attempt to tackle a housing crisis by halting a trend among the world’s wealthy to snap up property in the country. The restrictions announced by the prime minister-designate, Jacinda Ardern, are likely to be closely watched by other countries around the world also facing housing shortages and price rises driven by foreign investors. At 37, Ardern has become New Zealand’s youngest leader for 150 years. New Zealand has become a destination for Chinese, Australian and Asian buyers and has gained a reputation as a bolthole for the world’s wealthy – who view it as a safe haven from a potential nuclear conflict, the rise of terrorism and civil unrest, or simply as a place to get away from it all. The country has become a hotspot for wealthy Americans seeking an escape from political upheaval elsewhere, who view it as a stable nation with robust laws and far from potential conflict zones. Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and a Facebook board member and donor to Donald Trump’s campaign, is among those to have purchased property in New Zealand. Global financiers have been increasingly snapping up properties in the country. Speaking at the annual gathering of the world’s elite in Davos, Robert Johnson, the president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, said: “I know hedge-fund managers all over the world who are buying airstrips and farms in places like New Zealand because they think they need a getaway.” Reports by Bloomberg and the New Yorker have suggested dozens of Silicon Valley futurists are secretly preparing for doomsday, acquiring boltholes in the country. Jack Ma, the man behind Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon and its richest man, is also reported to have shown interest in buying a home there. Land sales to foreign buyers are booming in New Zealand, with 465,863 hectares (1.16m acres) bought in 2016, an almost sixfold increase on the year before. That is the equivalent to 3.2% of farmland in a country of 4.7 million people. Despite this apparent boom, official statistics show that of the 48,603 property transfers registered by the government in the three months to June, just 3% were buyers with an overseas tax residency. The bulk of those buyers were Chinese, followed by Australians. Tax residents of the UK, US and Hong Kong were also among the biggest buyers of property. Domestic buyers feel they are losing out. Only a quarter of adults in New Zealand own their own home, compared with half in 1991. Soaring house prices have put home ownership out of reach for many. Hundreds of families in Auckland were found last year to be living in cars, garages and even a shipping container. According to research from property agents Knight Frank, New Zealand was the 10th fastest growing country in the world in terms of house prices. Prices increased by 10.4% in the year to the end of June, compared with 2.8% in the UK. In Wellington, the capital, they soared by more than 18% in the same period. A report by the Economist this year showed New Zealand had the most unaffordable house prices in the world, with prices in Auckland climbing 75% in the last four years, although the market has cooled in recent months. The country’s proposed ban on foreign buyers, which would only apply to non-domiciles, comes amid rising support for protectionist policies in developed nations around the world. Trump rode to election victory by pledging more jobs and support for US citizens, while the Brexit vote has been interpreted as a call to prioritise British workers over European migrant labour. The steps announced by Ardern form part of a coalition deal unveiled this week by her Labour party and the minority partners forming her government – the Green party and anti-immigration New Zealand First. It follows a campaign pledge by Labour to crack down on “property speculators”. Speaking after the announcement of the ban on foreign buyers of existing homes, the leader of NZ First, Winston Peters, said: “There’s going to be a change and a clear signal sent internationally that New Zealand is no longer for sale in the way it has been. And we are happy with that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/25/terry-richardson-vogue-conde-nast-international","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T16:03:00Z","webTitle":"I spoke out about Terry Richardson seven years ago.

Why did Condé Nast only ban him now?","bodyText":"This week, an unexpected thing happened: the fashion industry seemed to grow a soul. In an email that leaked Monday, executive vice-president James Woodhouse instructed his staff at Condé Nast International that the company would no longer be working with “controversial” fashion photographer Terry Richardson. (Condé Nast US, a separate entity, severed ties with Richardson some years ago; he hasn’t shot for American Vogue since 2010.) “Condé Nast would like to no longer work with the photographer Terry Richardson,” Woodhouse wrote. “Any shoots that have been commission[ed] or any shoots that have been completed but not yet published, should be killed and substituted with other material.” Shortly thereafter, major fashion brands Valentino and Bulgari announced they, too, would like to no longer work with Richardson. More names are likely to follow. Of course, this didn’t happen in a vacuum. The press coverage around Harvey Weinstein’s decades-long rampage of alleged sexual assault and coercion from his high perch in Hollywood has put a renewed spotlight on men who use their power and influence to violate people’s – often young women’s – boundaries and intimidate them into staying quiet. It’s put pressure on pretty much every industry to stop enabling these men’s misdeeds … either by straight up collaboration, or more often, by looking the other way because they generate revenue. It seems the potential liabilities of associating one’s brand with a powerful abuser’s are finally starting to outweigh the benefits. As the person who first spoke publicly about a negative encounter with Richardson in 2010 after six years of embarrassed silence, I’m pleased that European magazines and luxury brands – two spaces not exactly known for their progressive gender politics – are finally moving to dissociate themselves from the infamous creep. (I’d say “alleged creep,” but Richardson has never disputed what happens in his studio, only whether or not meaningful consent is given for it.) While he’s been shamed out of most women’s magazines in the US, he’s continued to make a luxurious living in advertising, and I was starting to wonder if Richardson would ever see any material consequences for his actions. I am more sure now than I used to be that he will. Of course, I’m not naive enough to think these brands suddenly care about the human rights of models. After all, seven years have passed since I spoke out. It should not have taken this long. But I’ve never looked to captains of industry – let alone one as out of touch and regressive as fashion – to save us. Indeed, the gradual fall of Richardson’s star is a testament to the power of the enlightened masses to impose change from the ground up. It was never my goal to see Richardson’s career destroyed. In telling my story, all I wanted was for him to re-evaluate his behavior and, most importantly, change it. (I also wanted to warn my fellow women, although the onus to stop harassment should not be on us.) Even if he were as clueless as he pretends to be about how coercion works, a decent human being would, upon discovering his “collaborators” were coming away with signs of PTSD, ask what he could do differently that might prevent these negative outcomes. He would not go on defensive tirades about how art is meant to be challenging, or how everyone involved was operating on fully informed, affirmative consent. Unfortunately, Richardson has made it clear he’s not interested in having this conversation. Given that, we have only one choice: to exert whatever limited power we have to get people like him out of positions where they can do harm. For me, that power turned out to be my voice. I’ll probably have to use it for the rest of my life, but it will be a nice surprise if I can stop sooner.

Documents show 29% of the 140 miles (225km) of new high-speed line from the capital to the West Midlands will be through tunnels, to avoid disruption to communities and the landscape. In contrast, only 2% of the 123 miles of track running through Yorkshire, from the West Midlands to Leeds – the latest phase of the rail line to be planned – will run underground. Campaigners accused HS2 of dumping the costs from the first phase of the programme on to the latest phase, and forcing Yorkshire to pay for tunnels in London and the south-east. Jonathan Pile, a spokesman for Yorkshire against HS2, whose family home in Wakefield is 265 metres from the proposed line, said public pressure to reduce the project’s costs meant the company had been steadily stripping tunnels out of its proposals for the Yorkshire section since the first plans were published in 2013. In July the government announced that section would run to the east of Sheffield instead of going through the Meadowhall shopping centre on the city’s border with Rotherham. It claimed the route represented a £1bn saving, which – documents show – includes spending £212m less on tunnels. “We’re getting this double standard, where they’re spending all the money down south, no problem, but when it’s the north they just expect us to lump it,” said Pile. He said the government was going back on its initial commitment to “minimise the local environmental impact of the new railway wherever possible by using tunnels, deep cuttings and existing transport corridors”. In July, a HS2 study into a proposed 5.9 mile tunnel at Mexborough, that would save the newly built Shimmer estate from demolition, also concluded such a project would be too costly. “We can point to tunnels that have been put in as a result of protests for mitigation [in the south] and these have not been in strictly urban areas,” said Pile. “They’ve been put in to protect places like Wendover [at the foot of the Chiltern Hills], which is a town that is a similar size to Crofton.” “I think they have a view that we might be willing to put up with more and that the home counties are going to scream blue murder and, to some extend, there is something to that. “We are post-industrial communities which have been used to industrial landscapes that the home counties wouldn’t be happy with. But this area has been restored to green belt now. It’s got a burgeoning leisure industry and it’s definitely as beautiful as the Chilterns.” Jon Trickett, MP for Hemsworth – an area the HS2 line will pass through – said the figures would confirm a feeling in Yorkshire that there was “one rule for the Tory marginals in the south and a completely different rule for the north”. He said the train line would be wider than two motorways and, in some cases, would be placed on a platform 12 meters in the air. He said the fact that HS2 would not pay for parts of the route in Yorkshire to be in tunnels reinforced “the idea that the north is a place where they can save money, make cuts and leave communities damaged to the benefit of the south”. A HS2 spokesperson said the train line would deliver major benefits to the Yorkshire region. “It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to dramatically improve journeys between the Midlands and the north, and London, boosting capacity, improving connectivity and helping to rebalance the national economy,” they said. “It is also becoming integral to local plans to drive business growth, create jobs and secure investment years before it arrives. “We are at the very early stages of design for the route through south and west Yorkshire and are committed to working with communities and stakeholders to identify appropriate solutions to further reduce impacts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/25/fats-domino-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T17:08:40Z","webTitle":"Fats Domino obituary: giant of American music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/25/fats-domino-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/25/fats-domino-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Fats Domino obituary: giant of American music","bodyText":"Out in his own uncategorisable stratosphere, the vocalist and pianist Fats Domino, who has died aged 89, sold astonishing quantities of records from the start of the 1950s until the early 60s. Domino was an original, one of the creators of rock’n’roll, and by far the biggest selling rhythm and blues artist of that time. He was crucial in breaking down the musical colour barrier, but too mainstream and popular to retain credibility as a blues singer. He brought a new, heavy back-beat to white ears, yet trailed old-fashioned, jazz-band habits behind him. His famous records were many, stretching across a decade from the early 50s: Valley of Tears, I’m Walkin’, The Big Beat, I’m in Love Again, I Want to Walk You Home, Be My Guest, Country Boy, Walking to New Orleans, Three Nights a Week, My Girl Josephine, It Keeps Rainin’, What a Party, and, in 1963, when he finally left Imperial Records for ABC-Paramount, Red Sails in the Sunset. His chart placings were oddly modest. His only British Top 10 success was Blueberry Hill in 1956. In the US he never topped the mainstream charts and by 1962 had no Top 20 entries. Yet in the mid-70s it was still true that, with record sales of 60 or 70m, no one had outsold him except Elvis and the Beatles. He behaved like a star. When he toured he took 200 pairs of shoes and 30 suits on the road, and wore big diamond rings. Thus he asserted himself on the era’s extraordinary multiple bills. On the first, in 1956, Domino was with BB King, Hank Ballard, Jerry Lee Lewis, James Brown and Duane Eddy. A 1957 tour put him in among the Drifters, Frankie Lymon, Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran, LaVern Baker, the Everlys, Paul Anka and Buddy Holly. His performing style was simple, like his songs – he’d sit at the piano sideways on to the crowd, showing his solid right profile and turning his splendid head to grin and beam as he sang and played, but he would add a touch of flamboyance at the end by pushing the piano off stage with his stomach. (That head of his was a perfect cube, thanks to his flat-top haircut. This would became fashionable 30 years after he pioneered it.) Born Antoine Domino in New Orleans, to Donatile (nee Gros) and Antoine Domino Sr, he began playing the piano in public at the age of 10. He was dubbed “Fats” by the bassist Billy Diamond’s band at his first professional engagements, at the Hideaway Club on Desire Street. The city’s pianists included Professor Longhair and Amos Milburn (from whom Domino took what became his trademark 6/8 hammered triplets), but his main influence was the Chicago pianist Albert Ammons, first recorded in the 1930s. Domino was offered a record deal by the Imperial boss Lew Chudd, and cut his first sides on 10 December 1949, with the trumpeter/arranger Dave Bartholomew’s band. This would remain much the same on Domino’s huge hits of a decade later, and the band would tour behind him for more decades still. The tenor saxist Herb Hardesty would support Domino for half a century. The second number recorded was The Fat Man (named after a radio detective), which sold 800,000 in the black market and gave the 22-year-old the first of many gold discs. Domino and Chudd soon fell out with Bartholomew, the man held to have given Domino his musical credibility. Domino recorded without him, using his own musicians, including his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett. The rift was healed in 1952, after Bartholomew persuaded Domino to play piano on Lloyd Price’s Lawdy Miss Clawdy. It is one of the great contributions to embryonic rock’n’roll. Domino’s early singles had mixed success, but he re-signed to Imperial and packed out live shows, clinching his stardom at Alan Freed’s Cleveland Arena show in 1953 and thrilling the new white audience for black music at Freed’s New York rock’n’roll Jubilee Ball in January 1955. Then came Ain’t It a Shame (AKA Ain’t That a Shame). Though Pat Boone’s cover topped the pop charts, Domino’s original chased it, the blackest sound that had ever hit the hot 100, and the No 1 R&amp;B side for 11 weeks. Domino rarely took sole composer-credit for songs. Most were written with Bartholomew, some by Bartholomew alone, including Blue Monday, a hit from the 1956 Frank Tashlin film The Girl Can’t Help It, starring Jayne Mansfield and Tom Ewell, in which Domino appeared, as he did (this time with top billing) in Jamboree (1957). Domino’s voice had dropped an octave around the end of 1954. Before that, his was a high, reedy voice; by Ain’t It a Shame he had a rich warm baritone. What unites these two styles as much as the shared big beat is Domino’s magnificently quirky pronunciation, New Orleans-based but carried to a disarming extreme. His way with the title of his hit My Blue Heaven (Mah, Blee-oo, HeaVON) still delights, as does the rhyming he could achieve: “cryin” with “down”, “man” with “ashamed”. Irrational pronunciation was always a factor in rock’n’roll’s appeal – there’s no overestimating the attraction of non-received English in the 1950s. In his amiable, non-confrontational way, Domino offered this liberation early. His career dipped in the 1960s when a new black consciousness rejected the pre-soul stars, and white consciousness shied away from hit-singles artists and the suddenly embarrassing, unhip simplicities of 50s music. Creatively, the 60s and beyond was one long period of decline. The songwriting ended; a 1961 album showed a painting of nonchalant, cigarette-smoking Domino as if he were Dean Martin; another was called Twistin’ the Stomp. He sounded equally perplexed on Ah Left Mah Hot in San Francisco and the Beatles’ Lady Madonna and Lovely Rita, but he understood country material perfectly, as with Hank Williams’s Jambalaya and You Win Again. Nor could decline be blamed on his tendency to cover “standards”. Some of his biggest hits had made rock’n’roll classics of them, especially When My Dreamboat Comes Home, Blueberry Hill and My Blue Heaven. He sometimes proved his mastery of boogie-woogie on them too: gasp at his Stephen Foster makeover on Swanee River Hop. There was one fine later album, the self-produced Sleeping on the Job, cut in New Orleans in 1978. Authentic and fresh, it surprised everyone. He never managed that again. Domino was reduced to night clubs and Las Vegas. It demonstrates his limitations and artistry that he could play his hour’s worth with such enthusiasm so many hundreds of times. But his vice was gambling, and trying to work off his debts by touring only kept him in the Vegas trap. Worry thinned him. Even yellow crimplene suits couldn’t disguise his being disappointingly less than massive, yet he still pushed the piano off stage with his stomach at the end of his high-energy show. He was still at it in London at the Royal Festival Hall in 1985, and the Royal Albert Hall in 1990, his mike still placed so that he took up a supplicating pose, crouched down, head twisted round and upwards, radiant smile fixed on the punters in the circle. Illness overtook him in 1995, on a UK tour with Little Richard and Chuck Berry. His performance ended when he tried the piano stomach-push in Sheffield, and was taken to hospital with breathing problems. He would not tour again, restricting his live appearances to his home city of New Orleans. He refused to travel to Cleveland, Ohio, for his induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, and even declined a White House invitation from Bill Clinton to receive a National Medal of Arts in 1998. He was at home when his house was one of those ruined by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Domino had always lived in the badly hit Lower Ninth Ward – he’d built his mansion there – and though he and his wife, Rosemary, whom he had married in 1948, were rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter from their roof, he was thought to be missing for several days afterwards. His daughter Karen, living in New Jersey, recognised him in a newspaper photograph of survivors at a shelter in Baton Rouge. It was months before Domino could revisit his home and reportedly only three of his many gold discs were retrieved. Moved by the widespread concern for his welfare, Domino responded with a new album, Alive and Kickin’, donating proceeds to the Tipitina’s Foundation, dedicated to preserving and restoring New Orleans’ musical culture. The album’s title track opens with as simple a lyric as any of Domino’s classics: “All over the country, people wanna know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino? / I’m alive and kickin’.” Alive and kickin’ maybe, and living back in New Orleans, but in poor health. Domino was to have been the closing act at the city’s first post-Katrina jazz festival in May 2006, but he was admitted to hospital shortly beforehand. A year later, at the 2007 festival, he gave what would be his last performance, of just five songs. A tribute album, Goin’ Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino, by artists including Dr John, Norah Jones, BB King, Willie Nelson, Toots and the Maytals and Neil Young, was released later that year. Other artists continued to record and perform Domino’s repertoire, and always will. He was one of the few true giants of postwar American popular music: no one sounded like him, yet ask who he influenced, and the answer is everyone. He and Rosemary had 13 children. She died in 2008. • Fats (Antoine) Domino, musician, born 26 February 1928; died 24 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/25/the-rule-of-law-stands-firm-in-hong-kong","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T18:20:15Z","webTitle":"The rule of law stands firm in Hong Kong | Letter from I Grenville Cross, former director of public prosecutions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/the-rule-of-law-stands-firm-in-hong-kong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/25/the-rule-of-law-stands-firm-in-hong-kong","fields":{"headline":"The rule of law stands firm in Hong Kong","bodyText":"Although the 12 international lawyers claim the imprisonment in Hong Kong of Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow was a “serious threat to the rule of law” (theguardian.com, 16 October), the court of appeal described their offence as “a large-scale unlawful assembly, involving violence”. The evidence showed that they and others stormed a restricted area, with gates forced open and barriers overturned. Ten security guards suffered injuries, with one, Chan Kei-lun, sustaining bruises, swelling and a fracture, resulting in 39 days’ sick leave. The court of appeal imprisoned the men because of fundamental errors of principle made by the trial magistrate, which resulted in manifestly inadequate sentences. In Hong Kong, everyone is equal before the law, and political motivations do not shield offenders from the consequences of their actions. The Hong Kong Bar Association and Law Society have emphasised that court rulings are made “solely according to law”. Although Wong and Law had served their community service when the review was listed, the case was not heard earlier because they, and Chow, lodged appeals against conviction, which they later abandoned. The court, however, notwithstanding that the three men had caused the delay, still discounted their sentences by several weeks. Far from breaching the “double jeopardy” principle, the court’s review accords with international practice. Throughout the common law world, it is recognised that a mechanism is necessary to rectify serious sentencing errors by trial courts. The sentencing review system was introduced into Hong Kong by the British colonial government in the 1970s, to correct mistakes in exceptional cases. In 1988, the UK enacted similar legislation, and the attorney general regularly seeks increased sentences from the court of appeal. Although China’s white paper in 2014 reiterated that it enjoys “comprehensive jurisdiction” over Hong Kong, the suggestion that administrators, including judges, should love the country does not affect judicial independence. When asked, Lord Neuberger, a non-permanent judge of the Hong Kong court of final appeal (and, until last month, president of the UK supreme court), said “I wonder if there is anything to worry about in the white paper”. He explained that judicial independence was not inconsistent with judicial patriotism, and that, having himself taken a judicial oath of allegiance to Hong Kong, “the way in which judges demonstrate their patriotism is by an irrevocable and undiluted commitment to the rule of law”. Hong Kong’s judiciary is fiercely independent, and comprises men and women of great integrity.

A dozen cities and regions across the UK are lobbying to provide a new home to Channel 4, including Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield and Leeds. However, the chief executive, David Abraham, and the chairman, Charles Gurassa, have ferociously rejected a wholesale move of Channel 4 and its 800 staff, saying it would be catastrophic for its business. The government’s 56-page report examined a range of options – including a full, partial and very limited move from London – as well as the impact of making Channel 4 increase its spend on programmes made by TV producers outside the capital. The report found that combining a full move of the broadcaster’s headquarters with an £88m-a-year boost in spending on shows made outside of London could create economic benefits of £580m and 7,490 jobs across the country. Implementing only a wholesale move of Channel 4 staff out of London, with no shift in programming spend, would deliver a £235m benefit and 3,400 jobs. Choosing only to boost Channel 4’s out-of-London programming spend would create £300m in benefits and create 3,500 jobs. The report found that combining the two plans would create more impact than either implemented on their own. The models looked at cutting Channel 4’s staff by about 20%, some 160 of its 800 staff. “Channel 4, as a publicly owned broadcaster, should do more to support economic growth and provide for audiences outside of London,” said the culture secretary, Karen Bradley. “This independent analysis makes clear the potential benefits of Channel 4 increasing its impact outside the capital, and we hope to agree a way forward so that the broadcaster truly reflects and represents the full diversity of the UK.” A partial relocation, in which Channel 4’s large ad sales operation would remain in London, would create about £170m in economic benefits and create up to 2,500 jobs. A limited relocation – excluding the ad sales operation, 120-strong programme commissioning function and other teams with “strong connections” – would generate £95m in economic benefits and 1,400 jobs. The government – which has also evaluated, but rejected, a £1bn sale of Channel 4 – could benefit by up to £100m by selling off the broadcaster’s headquarters in Horseferry Road, Victoria, in central London. “We are not the BBC and do not have armies of producers to move to Manchester and Salford,” said Abraham, speaking to a committee of MPs on Tuesday. “We are enthusiasts for the regionalism of our schedule. We are disappointed we are presented as if we are in our palace in London never venturing forth, which is just not true.” Abraham has said that as much as 60% to 80% of Channel 4’s workforce would leave if they were forced to move out of the capital. Channel 4 spends £695m a year on programming, with £500m of that on original TV shows. Of the original productions budget, about 40% is spent on shows from TV production companies based outside London. About 55% of the hours of TV shown by Channel 4 is made up of programming made outside London. The broadcaster has said that it would look to further increase its spending and presence beyond London. Currently only about three or four of its 120 commissioners live outside the capital."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/25/judas-tree-song-earth-kenneth-macmillan-review-royal-opera-house","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T16:45:23Z","webTitle":"The Judas Tree/Song of the Earth review – from torrid violence to delicate majesty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/25/judas-tree-song-earth-kenneth-macmillan-review-royal-opera-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/25/judas-tree-song-earth-kenneth-macmillan-review-royal-opera-house","fields":{"headline":"The Judas Tree/Song of the Earth review – from torrid violence to delicate majesty","bodyText":"This season’s Kenneth MacMillan celebration continues with a double bill that lays out the extremes of the choreographer’s sensibility to brutal and sublime effect. While the evening closes with the majesty and delicacy of his setting of Mahler’s Song of the Earth, it opens to the torridly graphic violence of his most controversial ballet, The Judas Tree. I’ve watched The Judas Tree a number of times since its 1992 premiere, but have never been able to see it as anything but the most muddled and rebarbative of MacMillan’s work. Even though its storyline is meant to be allegorical (its main characters standing for Christ, Mary Magdalene and Judas) and even though some of the choreography is a brave – even brilliant – foray into the darkest reaches of expressionism, the action feels queasily akin to bad porn. An unnamed female character appears among a group of construction workers and, without preamble, starts posing and touching herself. She may be mockingly assertive, but in the very odd terms of this ballet she’s pretty much asking for sex. When her “lover”, the Foreman, sees her with his friend, he’s goaded to revenge, killing the friend and encouraging his gang to rape the woman. The guilt that drives the Foreman to hang himself, however, seems directed only towards his friend, rather than towards the woman, who has been flayed, splayed and violated to within an inch of her life. It is a distressing ballet to review, and all the more so because the Royal Ballet dance it with valiant conviction. Lauren Cuthbertson as the Woman, honours the fine detail of the choreography, and manages to convey some dignified sense of purpose in her character’s indignities. Thiago Soares judges the role of the Foreman nicely, allowing his pent-up rage to unravel by subtle degrees, and Edward Watson embodies the inward struggle and the physical logic of MacMillan’s choreography with an almost otherworldly clarity. One significant aspect of MacMillan’s enduring power is the puzzle of his creative personality, and Song of the Earth looks as if it could so easily have been the work of another man. It is performed this season by English National Ballet and outstanding among a very good cast is guest principal Jeffrey Cirio, dancing the Messenger of Death with a sensitivity that allows him to shade the role’s athleticism with quiet intimations of tragedy. Isaac Hernández, a hugely watchable artist, brings a poignant, puppyish naivety to the doomed young lover. However, his partnership with Erina Takahashi lacks chemistry, and it is only when the latter is dancing on her own, her tiny body fluttering in space, her hands and face stark with anguish, that we feel on our nerve endings the inexorability of death.

But there is little of his chancellor’s famous pragmatism in the debut novel that set the literary world alight this year. Strauss’s Sieben Nächte (Seven Nights), which has caused the Tagesspiegel newspaper to hail the 28-year-old as “one of the greatest talents of his generation”, tells the story of a protagonist who has grown tired of rational consensus-seeking and embarks on a quest to experience the seven cardinal sins on seven consecutive nights. “Compromises compromise – they weaken your handshake,” says the narrator as he sets forth into the night. “The only desire that counts is that for a beating heart.” Strauss is the most prominent member of the “Merkel generation” engaged in a controversial revival of romanticism, the creative artistic movement of such painters as Caspar David Friedrich, writers like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and thinkers such as Friedrich Schlegel, which put German culture on the world map in the late 18th century but played an equally important role in its darker chapters. “After the steely ideologies of the 20th century and the fidgetiness of postmodernism, it is not just a new generation that is looking for identity,” wrote a conservative commentator, Wolfram Weiler. “Strauss offers us a signpost where it could be found … in the blue flower, a neo-romantic longing for better understanding.” In a manifesto published by a small Berlin publishing house, Korbinian, earlier this year, a young author, Leonhard Hieronymi, announced the dawn of “ultra-romanticism” in German literature, declaring an end to the “unofficial ban on ecstatic feeling” and calling on his fellow writers to create a “Romantic variation of cyberpunk” inspired by Blade Runner, ET and the films of Werner Herzog. Germany’s new Romantics have found their intellectual lodestar in the Korean-born philosopher Byung-Chul Han, whose series of talks on romanticism at Berlin’s University of the Arts last year saw prominent artists, architects and novelists jostling with undergraduates for floor space in packed lecture theatres. Han has championed the Romantic cult of the broken heart as a symbol of resistance against what he sees as a modern cult of “smoothness”, spanning iPhone design via Brazilian waxing to the “Teflon chancellor” Merkel. “To me, the Romantic world of [German poet Friedrich] Hölderlin is the world of the future,” said Han, whose lectures also featured lengthy playbacks of Schubert’s Winterreise cycle. Germany’s relationship with the Romantics remains an ambiguous affair, however. For its rich legacy in music, painting and poetry, many Germans remember how easily the movement’s obsession with nature, folklore and purity were absorbed by National Socialism, a movement that the novelist Thomas Mann described as “Romantic barbarism”. At Germany’s federal elections in September, more first-time voters cast their ballot for Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union than any other party. But the latest batch of neo-Romantic manifestos suggest a less liberal-leaning youth than the statistics imply. Hieronymi’s ultra-romantic manifesto rails against “impostors” for whom their “homeland is a grave to be urinated upon”, while Strauss prophesies that “strangers” are “a danger for all those who believe that their life will continue as it did until now”, even though he remains ambiguous whether that could also be a positive. Praise for Strauss’s debut has been countered by scepticism. Few critics have declined to mention Strauss’s controversial father Botho, himself a leading novelist and playwright who has equated the refugee crisis with the decline of Germany’s intellectual tradition. In a column in Die Zeit, German Jewish writer Maxim Biller went as far as hinting at a fascist dimension in Seven Nights’ imagery, saying that the book reminded him more of the arguably Hitler-sympathising Scouts movement founder Robert Baden-Powell than poets such as Rainer Maria Rilke. “In Germany, we have a tendency to focus on romanticism’s perversion rather than its original promise,” replied Strauss when confronted with the criticism. “But there was something powerful in the Romantic movement’s origins: an attempt to explore humanity in its inner form, to search inside ourselves for hidden currents. It was a rejection of uptightness and Biedermeier conformity.” “Romanticism should be like religion in that way: an individual affair, rather than the opium for the masses it became under National Socialism.” Strauss was approached to write his book after he wrote an article headlined “I yearn for more quarrels” in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, where he works as a theatre critic. Tom Müller, an editor at the traditionally left-leaning publishing house Aufbau, challenged Strauss to write his book about the seven sins in just seven nights. “We wanted immediacy, we wanted it to be raw, we wanted it to carry all virtues and flaws of youth, the lack of moderation, and we wanted paradox and opposition,” Müller said. In the 2014 article that inspired the book, Strauss had said that he yearned for “conflicts of attitude in moral questions” – words that sound prophetic in the light of Germany’s recent elections, which saw an overtly nationalist party return to the country’s parliament for the first time in half a century. Did Strauss yearn for Alternative für Deutschland? “Of course I was shocked by how well the AfD did in the elections,” Strauss said. “But with it also came a moment of relief, because it means the populists can no longer rail at ‘those at the top’. It is better to have the AfD in parliament than for these currents to ferment in the underground.” “My generation now has something like a historical mission, to make the parliamentary tradition and the European idea our own again,” he continued. “We have to find a new, more Romantic language to talk about Europe – that is something that Macron has started to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/29/british-airways-compensation-delay-cancelled-flight","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"British Airways pays compensation at last – but sends it to wrong bank account","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/29/british-airways-compensation-delay-cancelled-flight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/29/british-airways-compensation-delay-cancelled-flight","fields":{"headline":"British Airways pays compensation at last – but sends it to wrong bank account","bodyText":"Back in May we were caught up in a British Airways fiasco – our flight to Ibiza was cancelled, forcing us to buy alternatives with Monarch.

The Eurosceptic MP, whose appearances at the Conservative conference in Manchester last month drew large crowds, said Carney had been “consistently wrong” about the economic impact of the EU referendum. Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 Live, Rees-Mogg said: “Mark Carney has consistently complained about the Brexit vote and the result. He said before the Brexit vote there would be a sharp downturn in the economy because of Brexit, he had a panic interest rate cut that was completely unnecessary and helped push the pound down further than it would otherwise have gone.” He added: “Mark Carney is one of the enemies of Brexit. He has opposed it consistently.” Carney, the Canadian central banker who was handpicked in 2012 for his role at the Bank by George Osborne when chancellor, warned about the economic risks of Brexit during last year’s referendum campaign. He endured tough questioning from the Treasury select committee, of which Rees-Mogg was then a member. Rees-Mogg suggested it was good news that sterling had declined on foreign exchanges since last year’s vote, saying: “The fall of the pound is one of the automatic stabilisers in the economy. The fall of the pound has helped the economy.” He added: “Mark Carney has opposed Brexit the whole way through, and is an enemy of Brexit. There is no doubt about that. He’s shamed his role because he’s become a partisan. He quite disgracefully intervened in the referendum campaign, by giving forecasts one way or another.” Carney and several fellow members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee have signalled in recent weeks that they expect to increase interest rates from their record low of 0.25% – perhaps as soon as next month – to tackle rising inflation. Inflation is running well above the Bank’s 2% target, hitting 3% in September, driven in part by the decline in sterling, which increases the costs of imported goods. Rees-Mogg also took aim at the BBC for presenting an unbalanced view of Britain’s prospects outside the EU. “The BBC always wants to blame things on Brexit. I’m not saying this is a conspiracy, I’m saying it is a fact of life,” he said. Labour’s leftwing grassroots group Momentum announced on Wednesday that it planned to target Rees-Mogg in its next campaign day aimed at unseating prominent Conservative MPs. Rees-Mogg has a 10,000 majority in his North East Somerset constituency. Momentum said that he was being targeted because he was a favourite among Conservative members to succeed Theresa May as leader. The group also highlighted his opposition to abortion even in the case of rape and referring to the rise of food bank usage as “uplifting”. The group said Labour could win the seat from Rees-Mogg with a swing of around 9%, similar to the swings that resulted in Labour candidates winning seats in Canterbury, Brighton Kemptown and Battersea in the 2017 general election. Other seats being targeted by Momentum over the coming months include those of the home secretary, Amber Rudd, the education secretary, Justine Greening, the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, all of whose majorities were significantly diminished in June. Emma Rees, Momentum’s national coordinator, said she believed a targeted ground campaign could win Rees-Mogg’s seat for Labour. “From opposing equal rights for LGBTQ people to opposing women’s right to choose – even when they’ve been raped – his views belong in the 18th century,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/27/brexit-bluff-and-mccarthyism-who-said-what-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T12:00:29Z","webTitle":"Brexit, bluff and McCarthyism: who said what this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/27/brexit-bluff-and-mccarthyism-who-said-what-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/27/brexit-bluff-and-mccarthyism-who-said-what-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Brexit, bluff and McCarthyism: who said what this week?","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/30/fourth-industrial-revolution-could-unlock-445bn-for-uk-report-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T00:01:41Z","webTitle":"Fourth industrial revolution could unlock £445bn for UK, report reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/30/fourth-industrial-revolution-could-unlock-445bn-for-uk-report-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/30/fourth-industrial-revolution-could-unlock-445bn-for-uk-report-reveals","fields":{"headline":"Fourth industrial revolution could unlock £445bn for UK, report reveals","bodyText":"Britain’s manufacturing sector could unlock £455bn over the next decade and create thousands of jobs if it cracks the fourth industrial revolution and carves out a successful post Brexit future. That is the conclusion of a government commissioned review on industrial digitalisation, published today and led by industry chief Jürgen Maier, the UK and Ireland boss of German engineering giant Siemens. A deal between government and industry could put Britain at the forefront of new technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, augmented and virtual reality, giving a much needed productivity boost and a net gain of 175,000 highly skilled, better paid jobs. Maier – who was tasked by Theresa May with providing a longterm vision for the industry – said the ambitious proposals outlined in the review could serve as an “antidote” to some of the tough challenges and higher costs facing the manufacturing sector as a result of the Brexit vote. “The business and academic community has set out a vision for much greater ambition needed for Britain to be a world leader in the fourth industrial revolution,” Maier said. “The good news here is Britain is not starting from nothing. The UK has brilliant knowledge, assets and skills in this space but it is sometimes not as organised as it could be. “This combined package of measures will boost UK growth and productivity in manufacturing and provide more exports and increased earning potential, which our economy desperately needs.” The 246-page review brings together in a series of recommendations the views and input from over 200 firms and organisations, including Rolls-Royce, Accenture and Cambridge and Newcastle universities. The so-called “made smarter” proposals include building a national digital ecosystem – to be piloted in the north-west – which would give smaller and medium-sized engineering companies the chance to go to a physical space to experiment with new technologies and see how they might be applied to a process in their own factories. Government support through tax incentives and funding would also facilitate the process of adopting new technologies, the review concluded. The review also recommends the creation of 12 digital innovation hubs as part of a new national innovation programme to create new technologies and companies, where startups would work with universities and established firms such as Siemens. Thirdly, it calls for a new national body, titled Made Smarter UK Commission, including representatives from industry, government and academia to safeguard a longterm commitment to the work, which Maier hopes will lead to the “upskilling” of one million industrial workers in Britain. The government will now consider the proposals with the ultimate aim of agreeing a sector deal with industry that is likely to involve co-investment. Publication of a government white paper is expected before Christmas. The business secretary Greg Clark said the review outlined the huge potential digitalisation offers to manufacturing: “The UK manufacturing sector has the potential to be a global leader in the industrial digital technology revolution. Government and industry must work together to seize the opportunities that exist in this sector and promote the benefits of adopting emerging digital technologies, as well as cutting edge business models.” It is hoped the net gain in jobs would be achievable – despite areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence making some traditional shopfloor roles redundant – through growth in the sector and new roles in IT, analytics, research and development. If taken up, the proposals would contribute an additional 3% to annual growth in manufacturing, Maier said. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI business lobby group said the plans would bring a “new energy” to British industry. “The UK must compete with China, the US and much of Europe where there are already advanced plans to embrace the fourth industrial revolution,” she said. “I urge the government to consider these plans carefully, as they are focused on increasing productivity and wages, especially in smaller businesses.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/25/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-punches-bruise-universal-credit-may-defended-policy-forcefully","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T12:09:05Z","webTitle":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn punches the bruise on universal credit | Andrew Sparrow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/25/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-punches-bruise-universal-credit-may-defended-policy-forcefully","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/25/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-punches-bruise-universal-credit-may-defended-policy-forcefully","fields":{"headline":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn punches the bruise on universal credit","bodyText":"Key points Jeremy Corbyn concentrated his fire on the government’s controversial universal credit system, which involves merging six benefits into a single monthly payment. He opened by asking Theresa May whether the rollout of the system would be paused after a Labour motion on the subject passed last week (the Tories were whipped to abstain). May replied that the rollout was being carefully implemented in three phases, to be concluded in 2022, and that four out of five recipients were satisfied with the service. Corbyn retorted that if 20% were dissatisfied, surely that should give the government pause for thought. He quoted a Tory member of the Welsh assembly saying that universal credit was “callous at best, downright cruel at worst” and that she was ashamed of her government May responded by attacking Labour’s tax credit system, which she said had been rushed and which resulted in the number of workless households doubling, and saw the government clawing back thousands of pounds from the low paid. Corbyn said Labour had introduced the minimum wage, opposed by the Tories, and lifted a million children out of poverty. Universal credit, the Labour leader went on, had caused hard-pressed councils to dip into their own budgets to prevent tenants from being evicted due to rent arrears. The prime minister said flexibility had been built into the system so landlords could be paid, and that no one would be evicted due to short-term rent arrears, though Corbyn said this did not cover the private rented system. He said the onus should be placed on employers to pay a decent wage, calling low pay “endemic in the United Kingdom”. Running through the government’s divisions on universal credit, the NHS pay cap and Brexit, Corbyn concluded that the government was too weak and incompetent to make decisions for the good of the country. May retorted that a Corbyn government would result in “capital flight and a run on the pound. That’s what Labour would do and we will never let it happen.” Verdict “Punch the bruise”, as the saying goes, and after a very good PMQs last week Corbyn came back to the subject of universal credit (his main theme two weeks ago, and a topic that gave Labour a symbolic victory in the opposition day debate a week ago). He had the edge on May again, not least because she could not answer his strong opening question about why she was ignoring the will of the Commons. (It would have been nice to hear him make the point that Brexit was supposed to be about restoring the sovereignty of parliament, but Corbyn seems averse to bringing up Brexit at PMQs, which may not be noble but probably makes tactical sense.) Corbyn may have been on much the same form as last week, but May was much improved. Instead of defaulting immediately to the “strong economy” sloganising (which she saved up to the end), she engaged with the issue of universal credit, and defended her policy with newish statistics on the slow pace of its rollout. She was also forceful on the issue of tax credits, at one point arguing that the Gordon Brown initiative created exactly the problems that Corbyn was criticising her for (allowing the benefit system to subsidise low-paying employers). But, as ever, trying to hold Corbyn responsible for the failings of New Labour economics is inevitably a relatively feeble debating point.

Despite being one of the world’s biggest coffee producers, Colombia has traditionally exported its best beans, and the few chains that do sell it are expensive; Colombians have instead developed a taste for tinto, a sweet brew made out of leftover beans. The Tostao’ chain, however, sells actual coffee for a third of the price of the chains in poorer areas of the city, under the slogan “sin estrato” (“without social stratum”). Like all good marketing slogans, it’s a phrase that holds special resonance for its intended audience. Something of an urbanist’s darling, Bogotá has been lauded for pioneering innovations such as the Rapid Bus Transport (RBT) network TransMilenio. But the high-altitude city of 8 million people is also the birthplace of a more controversial planning policy: explicit socio-economic stratification. All neighbourhoods in the city are classified from 1-6, with 6 being the richest and 1 the poorest. Homeless people are simply sin estrato (without stratum). The idea is that “higher” strata residents (5 and 6) pay more for utilities and services such as water, telephone bills and rubbish collection, subsidising the “lower” strata (1, 2 and 3). “I live in stratum 4,” says Jiménez. “Between 3, 4 or 5, you won’t notice much difference. But between someone from 1 and 6, you will. The vocabulary, the style of dress, the lack of culture.” His remark is instructive of what many say is the unintended consequence of stratification: prejudice and stigma. What was designed as a progressive “system of solidarity” now stands accused of fuelling social segregation, and Bogotá’s district authority is pushing for the government to phase it out. Unique to Colombia, the stratification system is applied according to a home’s characteristics; the government argues that “poor housing is inhabited by poor families”. Income is not considered. First launched in Bogotá in the 80s before spreading to almost every urban area in Colombia, the system has grown to incorporate university fees and social programmes. Bogotá sprawls across a large Andean basin, 2,600m above sea level; “strata maps” clearly show how the strata correspond to the social makeup of the city. More than half of Bogotá’s citizens live in zones 1 and 2, mostly in dense slums that cover the hillsides; in the northern fringes are small clusters of zone 6, where luxury apartment towers block out the hillsides. Just 1.9% of all homes in 2014 were in stratum 6. Laudable ambitions Milena Pérez, 39, works as an administrator near a pristine retail park in stratum 6, but lives in stratum 1, in the megaslum of Ciudad Bolívar. She commutes two hours each way, south to north. “The two are completely different – in the north I die of hunger because things costs so much more,” she jokes. If she had the means, she says, she would move. “If I could get a rich husband from the north, then sure!” The stratification scheme had impeccable ideals: to alleviate urban inequality by helping the poor pay less. Bogotanos seem to approve of the principle. But the system is inefficient. In the past three years, the government has paid out close to £65m to Bogotá’s water firms to cover the shortfall in subsidies. There are also quirks. The low-rise historic centre of La Candelaria, home to numerous expats and diplomats, receives stratum 1 subsidies because of the area’s heritage status. Several decades after stratification was introduced, Colombia remains the second most unequal country in Latin America, according to World Bank figures. One consequence that its planners did not foresee was people competing to live in poorer, cheaper districts. Communities often fight fight to prove that their area does not deserve to be bumped up into the next stratum. Taxi driver Carlos Córdoba, 54, is a self-described “stingy millionaire” who chooses to live in the southern district of Soacha, in stratum 3. “I earn a lot of money,” he says. “I could live in the north but I don’t want to pay.” Strata 4 and 5 are boring, he says, since fewer people dance, drink, party and fight. He thinks the stratification system reflects class, rather than creating it, and the city works better when people “stick to their own level”. “If I’m strata 3, that’s who I am. How is someone from strata 1, living among strata 5, going to be able to afford to pay for milk?” Córdoba’s words hint at another, bigger criticism of the system: that Colombians have adopted it as a tool for classifying people, not buildings. The government’s website agrees with Córdoba – arguing that stratification does not “generate such differences” in class, but merely records them. But Manuel Riaño, an urban economist and professor at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, believes it has deepened the rifts between social classes and contributed to the stigmatisation of the poor. “There are plenty of expressions like: ‘He got out of the strata,’ if a person thinks they are important, or ‘You can notice his strata’ to imply a person is bad,” says Riaño, noting as well that people from strata 1 or 2 often struggle to land well-paid jobs. Mónica Soto, 25, a teacher from stratum 4, agrees: “When you have an interview they always ask where you live – and you know the place where you live is highly correlated to your strata.” These problems have led the administration of Bogotá and its mayor, Enrique Peñalosa, to press the national government to transition to a new system, one that takes into account an “increasingly dynamic and complex city”. Peñalosa, a well-known urban consultant who was re-elected in 2015, told a town hall discussion recently that the city is a “very powerful machine that works very well for income redistribution”, but he admits the current system has problems. These include a lack of contributions from affluent rural areas surrounding the capital, and the increasing polarisation of wealth. “Where the richest are, the richest go,” he said. “No one from stratum 6 goes to live in Soacha, and probably no one from stratum 2 goes to live in Sopó [an affluent town north of Bogotá].” A new joint proposal by his administration, in collaboration with UN-Habitat and Bogotá’s utility companies, has proposed replacing strata and using new technology to assess individuals, rather than properties. Removing its legacy and making Bogota truly sin estrato, however, might take much longer. Javier Duque, 55, was displaced from his home in the hills during the war with the Farc guerrillas in the 80s, and now sells tinto for 300 pesos (8p) in Ciudad Bolívar, opposite a branch of Tostao’. He doesn’t think removing the stratification system would have much effect on his area. “I always thought I would die in the country, but now I know it will be here,” he says. “It’s the place for people with nothing.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/26/battle-of-soho-review-documentary-london","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"Battle of Soho review – dewy-eyed documentary tells a good story badly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/26/battle-of-soho-review-documentary-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/26/battle-of-soho-review-documentary-london","fields":{"headline":"Battle of Soho review – dewy-eyed documentary tells a good story badly","bodyText":"There’s enough material here for a decent 45-minute TV programme about the insidious gentrification of London’s Soho: this unique rackety-bohemian quarter is being turned into a wasteland of Starbuckses and empty investment flats while a thriving LGBT culture is being driven out.

Their summer romance is saturated with poetic languor and a deeply sophisticated sensuality. The film is directed by Luca Guadagnino (who made I Am Love and A Bigger Splash) and adapted from the novel by André Aciman by James Ivory, who had originally been slated to co-direct and has a producer credit. Ivory’s presence inevitably calls to mind his film version of EM Forster’s Maurice, to which this is frankly superior. For me, it brought back Alan Hollinghurst novels such as The Folding Star and The Spell. Call Me By Your Name is an erotic pastoral that culminates in a quite amazing speech by Michael Stuhlbarg, playing the boy’s father. It’s a compelling dramatic gesture of wisdom, understanding and what I can only call moral goodness. Stuhlbarg plays Perlman, a middle-aged American professor of classical antiquity living with his stylish wife Annella (Amira Casar), in a handsome Italian house with their son, Elio – a remarkable performance from Timothée Chalamet – who is a very talented musician, spending his time transcribing Schoenberg and composing piano variations on JS Bach. Theirs is a cultured household, in which everyone is proficient in English, French, Italian and, for Annella, German. The family is also Jewish. Elio calls them “Jews of discretion”, a sense of otherness that is to serve as a metaphor for concealed sexuality. Elio slopes and mopes about the huge house as the long hot summer commences, grumpy and moody, not knowing what to do with himself or his directionless sexuality, shooing away flies, frowning over paperbacks, dressed mostly in nothing more than shorts, all shoulder blades and hairless calves. Every year, his dad invites a favoured grad student to spend the summer with the family to help him with research. This year it is the impossibly handsome and statuesque Oliver, played by Armie Hammer, who never wears a pair of long trousers in the entire film. He establishes his academic credentials early on by presuming to correct Perlman’s derivation of the word “apricot”. Both Elio and Oliver are to have romantic associations with local young women, but it is more than clear where this is heading. And when the main event arrives, Guadagnino’s camera wanders tactfully away from their bed, gazing thoughtfully out of the window at the hot summer night. What is perhaps so incredible is the concept of leisure, a cousin to pleasure, pure gorgeous indolence and sexiness for six whole weeks. No one appears to have very much to do in the way of dreary work, despite the references to typing up pages and cataloguing slides. People sunbathe; they impetuously jump up and go swimming, have unhurried meals al fresco, cycle into town to drink in bars, or play volleyball. The main work-related activity is when Perlman and Oliver go to inspect a sensational discovery: parts of a classical statue recovered from a lake. Hellenic sensuality is resurrected in concert with the not-so-secret sexual tumult emerging all about. At any one time, nothing is happening, and everything is happening. Elio and Oliver will catch each other’s eye in their adjoining bedrooms or downstairs in the hall; they will casually notice each other changing into swimming costumes. Each of these intensely realised, superbly controlled and weighted moments is as gripping as a thriller. Hammer’s Oliver is worldlier than Elio, but not a roué or a cynic; in an odd way, Elio is more cosmopolitan than Oliver. The visiting American looks like a mix of Tom Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf. Chalamet’s performance as Elio is outstanding, especially in an unbearably sad sequence, when he has to ring his mum from a payphone and ask to be driven home. (In that scene, Guadagnino contrives to show an old lady fanning herself in the right-hand side of the frame. Was she an actor? A non-professional who just happened to be there? Either way, there is a superb rightness to it.) And then there is Stuhlbarg’s speech advising against the impulse to cauterise or forget pain: “We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.” There is such tenderness to this film. I was overwhelmed by it. • This article was amended on 31 October 2017.

He has signed a contract until June 2020 and was described by the club’s vice-chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, as “a perfect fit”. Leicester interviewed several candidates for the position that has been held on a temporary basis for the past two matches by Michael Appleton, who will revert to his assistant’s role. Puel will be introduced to the media on Friday and will take charge of Sunday’s home match against Everton, who are without a full-time manager. Puel was let go by Southampton in June despite leading the club to an eighth-placed finish in the Premier League and the final of the Capital One Cup. Southampton flopped in the Europa League and decent domestic results were deemed not good enough to compensate for a style of play that many supporters decried as too defensive. Several players disliked his rotation policy. Puel told French media he was let go “for a little bit more than sporting reasons”. Puel, who has since been without a club, impressed Leicester during more than one set of talks. “Upon meeting Claude, his attention to detail, knowledge of our squad, understanding of our potential and his vision to help us realise it were extremely impressive,” Srivaddhanaprabha said. “He quickly emerged as the outstanding candidate.” The Leicester squad will find Puel a different character to Shakespeare, with whom many players formed a warm relationship during his many years as an assistant before his promotion in the wake of Claudio Ranieri’s shock sacking in February. Puel’s record suggests he will bring the tactical savviness Shakespeare was accused of lacking this season. The 56-year-old has a French title among his managerial achievements, having won Ligue 1 in 2000 with Monaco, the club at which he had spent his entire playing career. He is perhaps known more as a builder of medium-sized clubs and a cultivator of young talents thanks to his six-year spell in charge of Lille, who regularly qualified for Europe by finishing above clubs with more resources. He was voted the manager of the year in France in 2005 for leading Lille to a second-place finish in Ligue 1 behind Lyon. He was appointed as the Lyon manager in 2008 and, despite leading the club to the semi-finals of the 2010 Champions League, his reign ended unhappily in 2011 amid criticism of his man-management and a dreary playing style. He refurbished his image at Nice by transforming a struggling side with young players and a thrilling attacking style before leaving in 2016 and taking over at Southampton. Puel described it as “a great privilege” to take the Leicester job. “The opportunity to help the club build on its remarkable recent achievements is a truly exciting one, and I’m looking forward to working with the owners, players, staff and supporters to deliver further lasting success,” he said. He arrives with the club 14th in the Premier League, one point above the relegation zone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/25/chemical-surgery-can-correct-genetic-mutations-behind-many-diseases-study","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T17:00:42Z","webTitle":"'Chemical surgery' can correct genetic mutations behind many diseases – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/25/chemical-surgery-can-correct-genetic-mutations-behind-many-diseases-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/25/chemical-surgery-can-correct-genetic-mutations-behind-many-diseases-study","fields":{"headline":"'Chemical surgery' can correct genetic mutations behind many diseases – study","bodyText":"A breakthrough in “chemical surgery” that can correct a type of genetic mutation behind a host of diseases has been unveiled by researchers. Scientists are hopeful that the approach could offer new ways to understand – and even one day tackle – certain human genetic diseases by correcting mutations in a patient’s body. There are tens of thousands of human genetic variations associated with disease. While many diseases involve multiple variations, a large proportion, including sickle cell anaemia, arise as a result of just one genetic “misspelling” – known as a “point mutation”. In other words, there is an error in one of the “rungs” of the DNA double helix – structures that are made of pairs of molecules known as “bases” that come in four forms dubbed A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine) and G (guanine). While A pairs with T, C pairs with G. About half of the 32,000 known point mutations that are linked to diseases are down to bases that ought to be G instead being A and their corresponding pair being a T instead of a C. Now scientists say they can fix these errors in a process known as “base editing”, turning A bases back to G and T bases back to C using a modified version of the gene editing tool Crispr–Cas9. The study comes hot on the heels of previous research by the same team that converted C to T and G to A in cells, as well as research by other scientists including a team in China who recently used base-editing techniques to convert G to A in human embryos. “We are currently using base editing to try to study or validate potential future therapeutic treatments for blood diseases, genetic deafness, genetic blindness … and some neurological disorders as well,” said David Liu, co-author of the new research from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Writing in the journal Nature, Liu and colleagues describe how they developed the new Crispr-Cas9 base editing tool. Within the new machinery, a section of single-stranded genetic material known as RNA directs the tool to the faulty section of DNA, which the Cas9 protein “unwinds”. A specially-developed enzyme within the tool then chemically alters the A base, turning it into a molecule known as inosine, which is “read” as a G by the cell’s machinery. Crucially, the Cas9 protein used in the tool has been hobbled so that it cannot sever the two strands of DNA, as is typical with gene-editing techniques. Instead, the editing tool only makes a notch in the opposite strand of DNA near the “problem” base, tricking the cell into replacing the DNA strand around the site. “That nick prompts the cell to replace the T with a C, because the base opposite the T has been converted to inosine, which pairs with C,” said Liu, adding that the team has shown the approach to work in both the cells of bacteria and of humans. The technique, Liu adds, has some advantages over traditional Crispr-Cas9 techniques for switching base pairs, not least that it is less prone to problems of random insertions or deletions, was not found to cause unwanted changes to the base pairs, and works well in adult cells. However, he noted that base-editing cannot be used to insert or delete stretches of DNA. The team also demonstrated applications of the work, including using the new base editing tool to correct a point mutation in cells taken from a patient with a condition known as hereditary haemochromatosis, which causes excessive iron-build up in the body and is currently managed by regularly taking blood from patients. But, Liu warns, more work will be needed to “cure” diseases. “There are many additional steps beyond simply making the mutation that may be needed to treat [a] disease,” he told the Guardian. Robin Lovell-Badge, a developmental geneticist from the Francis Crick Institute in London, described the new research as clever and important science. “Many genetic diseases are due to mutations where a single base pair has been substituted for another,” he said. “This makes these new base editing methods of great value in both basic research to make disease models and, in theory to correct genetic disease – making either non-hereditable or hereditable alterations.” Darren Griffin, a geneticist at the University of Kent, suggested the research could lead to improvements in cultures for embryos which might improve IVF. But he said, it is less likely to be widely used to fix genetic errors in human embryos destined for birth, since – even without considering ethical issues – embryo screening can already allow doctors to select embryos without harmful mutations. However, Liu notes that the technology could be used in patients after birth to tackle genetic diseases. A second study, published in the journal Science, reveals another step forward for gene-editing with a new type of Crispr-based tool that can convert A bases to inosine in RNA. Since the changes produced using the tool do not occur in the DNA, they only temporarily alter the proteins generated – a development that could not only avoid some of the ethical dilemmas around gene editing, but also offer ways to tackle diseases caused by temporary changes within a cell, such as inflammation. However, further work is needed to tackle the problems of changes being made to unintended targets. “I am hopeful that as complementary approaches, DNA base editing and RNA base editing will together enable an especially broad set of potential research and therapeutic applications,” said Liu."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/25/hugh-kearney-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T11:43:57Z","webTitle":"Hugh Kearney obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/25/hugh-kearney-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/25/hugh-kearney-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Hugh Kearney obituary","bodyText":"Through his book The British Isles: A History of Four Nations, Hugh Kearney, who has died aged 93, sought to alter the way the islands’ occupants viewed their past. Before its publication, in 1989, the writing of the histories of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales had tended to be separate, narrowly national projects, with that of England given primacy. Hugh adopted a quite different perspective. He maintained that key events from the Roman conquest, Viking invasions and the Norman conquest to the civil wars of the 17th century and the Industrial Revolution affected the region as a whole, transcending “the national boundaries of a later date”. His challenge to the prevailing anglocentricity was better appreciated by the time of the book’s second edition (2006). The pan-Britannic perspective he took of the whole archipelago, from prehistory to the present day, has become ever more relevant for contemplating the current state of relations within these islands, and between them and the European Union. His final book, Ireland: Contested Ideas of Nationalism and History (2007), contains reprints of many of his challenging articles on Irish history, revolving inescapably around Anglo-Irish relations and based on voracious reading transcending disciplinary and national boundaries, not least on the role of nationalism in eastern Europe. He poses questions of enduring relevance. Who is included in the Irish nation? How do its borders relate to religion, ethnicity, languages and civic commitment? How should its history be taught? However much scope remains for other interpretations, and for all the short-term fluctuations in the fortunes of the four nations, and mutations of their political cultures, Hugh’s probing approach will not go away. Born in Liverpool, itself a national and religious crossroads, Hugh was the son of Hugh Sr, a first world war ambulance driver who went on to work for the Co-op, and Martha (nee Thomas), who ran a number of market stalls. He attended St Francis Xavier college, from where he won a scholarship to Peterhouse, Cambridge, starting on his history studies in 1942. There his awareness of diversities was further stimulated by Herbert Butterfield, author of The Whig Interpretation of History, which criticised the tendency of historians “to produce a story which is the ratification if not the glorification of the present”. He graduated after second world war army service and a return to Cambridge. After working for Manchester University Press, in 1950 Hugh became a lecturer at University College Dublin. His colleagues there included Dudley Edwards and Desmond Williams, and I heard his lectures – models of how to inspire students, through an almost casual conversational style, to think for themselves, and engage with all sides before venturing to a conclusion. There he met Catherine (Kate) Murphy, a student from Tyrone, Northern Ireland. They married in 1956, and had three children, Martha, Jamie and Peter. Family holidays were often spent tramping through wet fields in search of dolmens and standing stones. Hugh had a passion for exploring historic sites such as Dunluce Castle, in Co Antrim, which came to provide the cover picture for the first edition of The British Isles. Symbolic of what seemed to him a complex web of identities, it was the seat of the MacDonnells, who had Viking forebears, were earls of Antrim and cousins of the MacDonalds of Scotland, and in 1644 sent troops in support of Charles I. At UCD, Hugh embarked on research, which included learning Irish. The publication of his thesis, Strafford in Ireland 1633-41: A Study in Absolutism (1959), did much to transform views of Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, who was appointed lord deputy (ie governor) of Ireland by Charles I, but ultimately impeached and executed for his tyrannical conduct. This reassessment not only had consequences for the historiography of Stuart Ireland, but required significant rethinking of the origins of the English civil war. Strafford’s role emerged as far less benign than it often had in previous accounts that relied on his own testimony. A series of positive reviews by both English and Irish scholars doubtless contributed to Hugh’s appointment in 1962 as a lecturer at the new University of Sussex. There the collaborative and trans-disciplinary approach to teaching fostered under Asa Briggs allowed his disposition towards deep reading in literature, as well as in history, to flourish. In teaching, as in writing, he stuck to his observation in the preface to Strafford that “conflicting interpretations are a commonplace of historical writing, but once their existence is recognised, the historian is no longer free to adopt the simplicity of one point of view alone”. His interests broadened in this stimulating environment, and two more books resulted: Scholars and Gentlemen: Universities and Society in Pre-industrial Britain, 1500-1700 (1970) and Science and Change, 1500-1700 (1971). In 1970 he went to Edinburgh University as professor, but after the flexibility of Sussex, he found the rigidity of hierarchical status and disciplinary boundaries deeply frustrating. Hugh’s gentle disposition could conceal an intense ambition to push back the frontiers of historical understanding and, after five years, his preference for collegiality and inter-disciplinarity took him to the University of Pittsburgh, where he had already been a visiting professor. There he did much of the reading for The British Isles, and found much satisfaction in a department that was a pioneering centre of social history. Following his retirement in 1999, he and Kate moved to Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk. She and his children survive him. • Hugh Francis Kearney, historian, born 22 January 1924; died 1 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/25/dolly-partons-bedtime-story-could-be-her-greatest-hit","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T11:20:45Z","webTitle":"Dolly Parton's bedtime story could be CBeebies' greatest hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/25/dolly-partons-bedtime-story-could-be-her-greatest-hit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/25/dolly-partons-bedtime-story-could-be-her-greatest-hit","fields":{"headline":"Dolly Parton's bedtime story could be CBeebies' greatest hit","bodyText":"For years, the CBeebies Bedtime Story was a secret known only by parents of the very young. Every day, the final hour of the channel’s programming would gradually wind down, its DayGlo thud replaced by something more muted before the final send-off – a friendly face from the telly reading a hushed recital of a children’s book. Bedtime Stories was a long, shallow glide to the runway. Tonally, it was perfect. But now everyone’s in on it. Pound for pound, Bedtime Stories might be the most star-studded programme the BBC makes. Chris Evans has read some stories. James McAvoy has read some. Simon Pegg, Rosamund Pike, David Hasselhoff, Josh Homme. Tonight’s Bedtime Story hits another new high, being read by Dolly Parton. Booking-wise, it’s coup after coup after coup. So who is the magician behind it all? “I wouldn’t say that it’s necessarily a massive change,” says CBeebies controller Kay Benbow. “We’ve always had amazing people. Even before we left London [for Salford] we had people like Sheila Hancock and Patrick Stewart and Derek Jacobi. It really just plays into my mantra of wanting the very best for the very young. The whole point is that we want great storytellers, because great storytelling is at the heart of everything we do.” So if having stellar guests has always been a forte of Bedtime Stories why are people only latching on to it now? Benbow attributes the seachange to a couple of things. The first is that CBeebies has become more prominent on social media, spending more time irreverently sympathising with knackered parents than pushing out press releases. And the second? “The big turning point was Tom Hardy,” says Benbow. “He and his agents approached us because he wanted to do it for his kids. I’m so grateful to him, because he raised the profile of Bedtime Stories and brought people to it who wouldn’t necessarily think to look at CBeebies.” Ah, yes. Tom Hardy. Undeniably, he was the breakout moment for Bedtime Stories; the moment when it stopped being something to simply plonk your kids in front of, and became something for mums to watch just as avidly as their toddlers. Hardy’s three appearances so far have been a sensation, not just because they have prompted those without children to tune in, but because he absolutely sells the hell out his stories. His most recent episode – a reading of Odd Dog Out – was filmed in tribute to his dog Woody, who died earlier this year. And, no word of a lie, it is an absolute tearjerker. Hardy approaches it like a full-blown heartrending drama, refusing to dial it back just because it’s a gussied-up Jackanory hidden away at the bottom of the EPG. It honestly might count as some of his best work. It has even been nominated for a Royal Television Society award. And this would appear to be the secret Bedtime Stories booking strategy – there are no set rules. When I slightly cynically ask Benbow if Hardy was brought in to appeal to the mums, she goes to great lengths to point out that it was him who approached her. It was important for him to make something that his own children could watch, she says, and this seems to go for all the participants. Suranne Jones travelled up to Manchester just to film her Bedtime Story, because she wanted to do something for her son. Josh Homme asked to read a book that he reads his own children at night. Dolly Parton has a charity that donates children’s books to libraries. There are other big names on the horizon and, although I was unable to prise them out of Benbow, they too approached CBeebies rather than the other way around. It isn’t all wall-to-wall A-list megastars (for my money, Nadiya Hussein remains the gold standard storyteller to whom all others should aspire) and this is apparently for good reason. “It’s about getting a range of people,” Benbow says. “We take diversity very seriously. We want all children to see something of their lives, or themselves, or people like them. But the most important thing is that we have good storytellers. If you don’t do it for the right reasons, people will see right through it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/26/cage-concert-for-piano-orchestra-wolff-resistance-cd-review-apartment-house-thomas-hcr","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T15:00:01Z","webTitle":"Cage: Concert for Piano; Wolff: Resistance CD review – playful, quick-witted and magnetic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/26/cage-concert-for-piano-orchestra-wolff-resistance-cd-review-apartment-house-thomas-hcr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/26/cage-concert-for-piano-orchestra-wolff-resistance-cd-review-apartment-house-thomas-hcr","fields":{"headline":"Cage: Concert for Piano; Wolff: Resistance CD review – playful, quick-witted and magnetic","bodyText":"Performers of John Cage’s piano concerto could theoretically play nothing at all, if that’s what they wanted. The point is about choice. “John, you’re my man,” said a trombonist who played in the original performance. “I’ll play for you any time.” Trust is the making of indeterminate music and Apartment House’s new recording is all trust. Philip Thomas makes the piano part magnetic, like the centrifugal planet in an erratic constellation. Around him spin trumpet, violin, flute and others, everyone quick-witted and playful. After 53 minutes the tenuous ecosystem suddenly dissipates and I was left pondering stark real-world ecological resonances. Sixty years on, 83-year-old Christian Wolff has written a companion piece for Cage’s concerto that should feel like a throwback: the name Resistance, the quotation from a Pete Seeger protest song, the old chance techniques.

Guardiola branded the Mitre ball as “highly unacceptable” following City’s 4-1 penalty shootout win over Wolverhampton Wanderers in Tuesday’s Carabao Cup last-16 tie at the Etihad Stadium. He complained that it was “too light, it moves all over the place” and that it was “impossible to score with”. In a statement the EFL said: “The Mitre ball used in this season’s Carabao Cup is of exactly the same technical specification as the balls used in the Sky Bet EFL and Checkatrade Trophy, all of which are tested in accordance with the ‘Fifa Quality Programme for Footballs’ and meet the ‘Fifa Quality Pro’ standard. “All balls used in the professional game are required to meet this standard. Clearly, preference is a subjective matter, but overall the entertainment provided across last night’s round-four ties would suggest that the ball used is not having a negative impact in the competition. “We will look to engage with Mr Guardiola and Manchester City to fully understand any concerns in advance of their round-five tie.” Yaya Touré, who took one of City’s penalties, was also scathing about the ball. “I don’t like it to be honest,” he said. “They can do better than that. It’s too light. Even in my country they can’t use those kind of balls. I think they have to be better than that because the ball was too soft. It’s rubbish but that’s fine. “A lot of players were complaining. The FA can try to do something because we just want to enjoy it. It’s difficult to play with these kind of balls but we try to find a way. It’s everything. Shooting – the ball is very light, when you touch it, it’s floating, it’s rubbish. And in this [rainy] weather it’s difficult.” Mitre also issued a statement addressing the controversy, highlighting how teams receive balls in advance of matches. “We’re passionate about the game and obsessed about everything related to ball technology,” it said. “We work with professional players and clubs to develop and test our pro balls and independent testing by EMPA (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology). “We totally appreciate that all balls feel different and that’s why we made sure competing teams were sent balls well ahead of the tournament for training.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/26/lankum-between-the-earth-and-sky-review-brilliant-raw-detonating-folk","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:30:07Z","webTitle":"Lankum: Between the Earth and Sky review – brilliant, raw, detonating folk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/26/lankum-between-the-earth-and-sky-review-brilliant-raw-detonating-folk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/26/lankum-between-the-earth-and-sky-review-brilliant-raw-detonating-folk","fields":{"headline":"Lankum: Between the Earth and Sky review – brilliant, raw, detonating folk","bodyText":"There is folk that wants to whisper in your ear, and then there is the music of Lankum: urgent, desperate and detonating, full of lyrics and sounds smacking together like waves shattering stones in a storm.

Together they have created what purports to be the world’s most sustainable office building, and certainly one of the most expensive. Standing in the middle of the City of London, occupying a 3.2-acre site between the high-tech bracing of Cannon Street station and the pink-striped stone galleon of No 1 Poultry, the 1 million sq ft hulk does its best to be a demure neighbour. “We were very conscious of being guests in London,” says Bloomberg. “We wanted something perfectly modern and eminently British that respected London’s traditions.” Over 9,000 tonnes of the same Derbyshire sandstone as the adjacent Victorian magistrate’s court have been used to clad the building’s chunky columns, which rise to eight storeys before stepping back for an extra two, matching the height of its neighbours. “We could have gone a lot higher,” says Foster, “but Mike wanted to fit in. He has a keen sense of civic pride.” The building is a radical departure from what Foster had proposed on the same site for a different client just a few years before, in collaboration with French architect Jean Nouvel. Nicknamed “Darth Vader’s helmet”, the previous scheme – which received planning permission in 2007 at the peak of the light-headed “iconic” architecture bubble – would have risen to 22 storeys, its sinister domed tower looming over the Mansion House. It was a wonky glass mess, the result of design-by-committee, lost in translation across the channel, and it was scrapped in 2009 when Spanish property company Metrovacesa pulled out. Lurching from the outlandish to the timid, Foster’s redesign has almost retreated too far: the result has the prosaic air of a regional Debenhams. Its heavy stone columns march along the street, framing bulky bronze fins around the windows. Everything looks a bit too chubby, almost cartoonish, as if it was designed at a smaller scale and blown up to fit the site. In a welcome move, the original Roman road of Watling Street has been reinstated, slicing a new diagonal route through the building, but it takes the form of a gloomy covered passage, heavily guarded by Bloomberg’s Seal Security team and rebranded as the Bloomberg Arcade. In a civic-minded gesture, there are three new public spaces at the corners of the site, adorned with water features by Spanish artist Cristina Iglesias, although her green-patinated bronze layers of matted foliage resemble fetid swamps – perhaps a sly comment on the financial services industry. “Bloomberg wanted an outside that’s dignified and an inside that’s dynamic,” says project architect Michael Jones, leading a tour along the “vortex” ramp that winds in a trefoil spiral for over 200 metres through the building, connecting the office floors in a meandering loop. The usual central core of lifts and services has been broken up and distributed to the edge of the floors, opening up the middle and allowing views between the levels, where the 4,000 staff will work at bespoke sit-stand desks, up to 700 people to a floor. The result is an extremely deep-plan, inward-looking office environment, where glimpses of the outside world are secondary to views back in to Bloomberg’s hubbub of “collaboration and teamwork”. You often feel very far away from a window, a sense exacerbated by the great bronze baffles that further block the view. These are what Foster calls the “gills”, featuring flaps that open and close automatically, allowing the building to breathe, while softening traffic noise from outside. Further environmental cunning is to be found in the sparkly ceilings, which deal with lighting, cooling and acoustic attenuation in a slender 100mm sandwich. Inspired by the pressed tin ceilings of turn-of-the-century New York, they are covered with 2.5 million polished aluminium petals that serve as light reflectors, sound baffles and coolers, chilled by water from above. They create a starry sky above the endless field of desks, adding a fitting touch of Bloombergian razzmatazz to the scene. The passive ventilation system – whereby air is drawn up through the building and exhausted through a central roof-light – is a big part of the reason the project achieved a sustainability score of 98.5% from Breaam, the body in charge of awarding green credentials. Bloomberg spared no expense, having a full-size mock-up built in a warehouse in Battersea to put these novel environmental strategies to the test. Foster says the resulting building uses 70% less water and 40% less energy than a typical office block, although the embodied energy levels are not slight, given that it contains 600 tonnes of bronze imported from Japan and a quarry-full of granite from India. More impressive rocks are to be found in the basement, in the form of the ruins of the ancient Roman Temple of Mithras, which was discovered in the 1950s when the site was first excavated, and clumsily rebuilt down the road at the time. The remains have been returned, and will be open to the public in a dedicated space from November, alongside some of the 14,000 artefacts that were recovered during the excavation. “Maybe 1,800 years from now,” says Bloomberg, “people will discover the ruins of our building too.” They may well marvel at this latter-day sustainable temple of financial reporting – if, by then, it hasn’t been painstakingly deconstructed post-Brexit, and moved with the rest of the industry to Frankfurt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/25/centrelink-phone-system-returned-55m-busy-signals-in-a-year","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T10:42:40Z","webTitle":"Centrelink phone system returned 55m busy signals in a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/25/centrelink-phone-system-returned-55m-busy-signals-in-a-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/25/centrelink-phone-system-returned-55m-busy-signals-in-a-year","fields":{"headline":"Centrelink phone system returned 55m busy signals in a year","bodyText":"Centrelink’s phone system returned 55m engaged signals last financial year, prompting further criticism that the agency is “in crisis”. The figure is a dramatic increase on the 29m calls that received a busy signal in 2015-16, and the 22m in 2014-15. The evidence, which does not include the number of abandoned calls, emerged during Senate estimates on Wednesday evening. The new secretary of the Department of Human Services, Renée Leon, blamed the significant increase on the uptake of automatic dialling apps on smartphones. Leon said those apps accounted for roughly 20% of the busy signals recorded by Centrelink. “That’s not 55m unique calls, our analysis of the telephone data is that in the vicinity of 20% of those are repeat dialling apps that people now have on their smart phones,” Leon said. “So 55m doesn’t mean there were 55 million people who tried to ring, because many of those were repeat call,” she said. But Labor jumped on the figures as evidence of an agency “in crisis”. Labor senator, Lisa Singh, expressed frustrations on behalf of welfare recipients to the departmental officials. “I’m sure you can appreciate how frustrating this must be for millions of Australians trying to get through that get that busy signal,” she said. “What’s more concerning though is that each year, year-on-year, the number is getting bigger and bigger by the millions.” The shadow social services minister, Jenny Macklin, issued a statement describing the figures as “shocking”. “This simply isn’t good enough. Centrelink is under-resourced and understaffed,” Macklin said. “Centrelink needs permanent, full-time staff, who are qualified and familiar with the often complex issues facing Australians who require income support.” Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the 55m busy signals represented a “lot of frustrated people who may be exasperated and struggling”. “On top of this 55m there were nearly 7m abandoned calls,” Siewert said. “This isn’t surprising because when you get through you have to wait for long periods before you speak to a human being.” The government recently announced plans to introduce private workers from multinational outsourcing giant Serco to the Centrelink call centre. The human services minister, Alan Tudge, said the 250 staff would help relieve pressure on the centre and reduce call wait times. “I am not going to put a figure in terms of what that might reduce the minutes by, but that, in concert with some of the other things that we are doing, will hopefully see a demonstrable difference by next year whereby people won’t have to wait for as long,” Tudge told the ABC last week. “I am not promising to change the world here but, nevertheless, I hear what people are saying about waiting too long and we are addressing it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/26/gilad-atzmon-the-spirirt-of-trane-review-fanfare-discovery","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T18:00:07Z","webTitle":"Gilad Atzmon: The Spirit of Trane review – heart and soul homage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/26/gilad-atzmon-the-spirirt-of-trane-review-fanfare-discovery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/26/gilad-atzmon-the-spirirt-of-trane-review-fanfare-discovery","fields":{"headline":"Gilad Atzmon: The Spirit of Trane review – heart and soul homage","bodyText":"Fifty years after Coltrane’s death, Gilad Atzmon, the expat Israeli saxophonist, clarinetist and author has recorded and is touring this dedication to the great American saxophonist, made with his Orient House Ensemble and the Sigamos String Quartet (Atzmon previously paid tribute to the genius of Charlie Parker on his 2009 album In Loving Memory of America). Here the saxophonist (who embraces Coltrane as “a man who transformed anger into love and plight into a humanist message”) emphasises the American’s tenderness over his revolutionary heat, but he’s dealing with Coltrane’s subjective impact, not mimicking a legacy. The tenor-sax soliloquy on Invitation is warmly romantic, then whirls upward against the quiver of the strings. Minor Thing is a hovering Coltrane-style lament and Blue Train is a flat-out triumph for Atzmon and pianist Frank Harrison, while Naima is a gentle dialogue with strings.

The move signalled a retrenchment from consumer-friendly policies introduced during Barack Obama’s presidency and relied on a final vote by Donald Trump’s vice-president, Mike Pence, to break the deadlock of a 50-50 tie. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – a government agency – had wanted the rule change to be introduced. It would have allowed consumers to join together to sue their bank or credit card company to resolve financial disputes rather than sign up to the closed-door arbitration agreements included in the small print when they opened accounts. Richard Cordray, director of the CFPB, said: “Tonight’s vote is a giant setback for every consumer in this country. Wall Street won and ordinary people lost. This vote means the courtroom doors will remain closed for groups of people seeking justice and relief when they are wronged by a company.” The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the president applauded the vote. “The rule would harm our community banks and credit unions by opening the door to frivolous lawsuits by special interest trial lawyers,” Sanders said. The CFPB rule was to be introduced next Spring but would not have helped customers affected by the Equifax data leak or the sales practices scandal at Wells Fargo, where staff created as many as 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit card accounts without customers’ consent. Even so, Democratic lawmakers said the CFPB’s rule would have given consumers more leverage to stop companies from financial wrongdoing. “So who does forced arbitration help? Wall Street banks and other huge corporations that never pay the price for cheating working people,” said Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown. “Once again, we’re helping the powerful against the powerless,” said Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, as the Senate neared the vote, sensing the Democrats would lose. Opponents of the rule change said that the average consumer got less from a court case than from arbitration. “The effort to try to characterise this as some devious system that has been created to try to stop consumers from having access to fairness is simply false,” said Senator Mike Crapo, the Republican chairman of the Senate banking, housing and urban affairs committee. “We have a very fair system that has been working for over 100 years in this country.” Crapo said the average pay-out for consumers in class-action lawsuits against financial companies was just $32, but lawyers stood to make millions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/25/everton-fans-liverpool-gobshites-google-maps-rival-stadium","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T11:09:26Z","webTitle":"Pranksters turn Google Maps blue with new search term for Anfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/25/everton-fans-liverpool-gobshites-google-maps-rival-stadium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/25/everton-fans-liverpool-gobshites-google-maps-rival-stadium","fields":{"headline":"Pranksters turn Google Maps blue with new search term for Anfield","bodyText":"Everton fans have been given cause to smile, after it was found that searching for the term “gobshites” in Google Maps would direct them to their rival Liverpool FC’s Anfield football stadium.

They’re into genocide, violence, reckless banking, sadistic political policies and sending deranged tweets late at night. However, a new study suggests psychopaths could act as a force for “greater good”. The research, by the University of Plymouth, found that when you need to carry out a bit of utilitarianism – sacrificing one person to save many others, for example – you might be wise to rely on someone with psychopathic traits to get the job done. In experiments using virtual reality, a lifelike human model and a device that measured force and speed, volunteers were asked to make life-and-death decisions, involving physical force, to save other people. One involved deciding whether to stab to death an injured soldier in your group to prevent them being captured and tortured, or taking them with you at the risk of everyone being captured. Those with psychopathic traits (as measured through a prior test) were not more likely to dispense with an individual life, but they did seem to be more enthusiastic about the execution of it. In written dilemmas or thought experiments, says Dr Kathryn Francis, one of the researchers of the study at Plymouth, people are less likely to carry out the action. “But if you put them in these immersive environments where they have to actually simulate the action, then you find the opposite and you get the majority of people choosing to carry out the action.” And people with psychopathic traits don’t hold back. “When they were simulating those actions, they were carrying them out with more power. We calculated that by looking at how much force they performed the action with and how fast they do it.” One reason, says Francis, is that “perhaps lowered empathy means they have less aversion to performing harmful actions. It almost gives them a kind of resilience that then allows them to carry out these, what some people would consider, harmful actions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/30/share-your-underwhelming-halloween-photos","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T12:16:08Z","webTitle":"Share your underwhelming Halloween photos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/30/share-your-underwhelming-halloween-photos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/30/share-your-underwhelming-halloween-photos","fields":{"headline":"Share your underwhelming Halloween photos","bodyText":"WoooOOOoooOOooo!

Yet Andy Serkis’s directorial feature debut, about the life of pioneering polio survivor Robin Cavendish, is so full of laughter that one might easily forget its sombre subject matter. Part exuberant love story, part great escape adventure, this is an old-fashioned tale of triumph over adversity that refuses – like its protagonists – to succumb to confinement. Comparisons with The Diving Bell and the Butterfly and The Theory of Everything are perhaps inevitable, but I was reminded more of the warmth and wit of the lovely 2014 Edwyn Collins documentary The Possibilities Are Endless. I honestly can’t remember the last time I laughed and cried so much at the same movie. We first meet Robin (Andrew Garfield) in a late-50s whirlwind of cricket and tennis, tea and travel, sweeping his new bride Diana (Claire Foy) off to Kenya where she announces that they are to be parents. The world is their oyster – until polio strikes and Robin is paralysed from the neck down, kept alive by a respirator. “We’re talking a couple of months,” Diana is told, while Robin demands: “Let me die”. Instead, Diana resolves to remove her husband from hospital (“You’ll be dead in two weeks!” insists a doctor) and take him home. Family and friends rally round, including eccentric professor Teddy Hall (Hugh Bonneville), who develops a Heath Robinson-style contraption combining a wheelchair with a respirator. Utilising a bicycle chain and a set of Sturmey-Archer gears, the device reignites Robin’s wanderlust, challenging the restrictive expectations placed on his condition by medicine – and by society at large. Written by Shadowlands author William Nicholson, and co-produced by Jonathan Cavendish (son of Robin and Diana), Breathe is less a labour of love than a celebration of life – a proudly upbeat work that isn’t afraid to smile when disaster looms. Some sequences, such as the hospital breakout scene, are played almost like a Carry On… caper. “That was interesting,” Robin deadpans after a dog unplugs his home respirator, leaving him writhing in suffocation. Later, a visit to a wealthy dowager (haughtily played by Diana Rigg) to request funding for more “Cavendish chairs” prompts the question: “Are we plucky or pitiful?” None of which is to suggest that the harsh realities of Robin’s situation are sidestepped. In the early stages of his illness, his silent cry to be allowed to die is heartbreaking. There’s real terror in Garfield’s eyes as Robin stares into the abyss, spitting in the face of a hospital chaplain who announces that his suffering is somehow part of God’s great plan. Later, a visit to a sterile German hospital finds a room full of patients in neatly stacked iron lungs, waiting for death. It’s a horrifying image that prompts Robin to ask: “Why do you keep your disabled people in prison?” This image of bodies encased in metal containers is just one variant of a complex visual motif that recurs throughout Serkis’s film. Early images of Robin place him in a sports car, a biplane, and an open-topped jeep, the camera soaring over English fields and African plains, chasing these magical machines. When Robin is strapped to a steel gurney and rushed into hospital, cinematographer Robert Richardson’s frame closes in, echoing the claustrophobia of a fireside story about prisoners crammed into a tin hut, deciding to die. But when Teddy’s invention gives Robin wings, the camera flies again – into the Bedford van that takes the Cavendish family on the road, and on to the plane that transports them abroad; containers within containers, confinement ironically bringing freedom. Having played polio survivor Ian Dury in Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll, Serkis brings compassion and empathy to the drama, painting Robin and his fellow “responauts” as explorers with mountains to climb. The excellent supporting cast includes Tom Hollander as Diana’s twin brothers Bloggs and David Blacker – a dual role that is niftily executed. Meanwhile, Nitin Sawhney’s affecting score is augmented by Bing Crosby crooning about True Love, from which the haunting line “Oh, how lucky we are” strikes a particularly poignant note."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/25/weinstein-company-hit-with-lawsuit-following-sexual-assault-allegations-harvey-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T15:36:35Z","webTitle":"Weinstein Company hit with lawsuit following sexual assault allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/25/weinstein-company-hit-with-lawsuit-following-sexual-assault-allegations-harvey-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/25/weinstein-company-hit-with-lawsuit-following-sexual-assault-allegations-harvey-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"Weinstein Company hit with lawsuit following sexual assault allegations","bodyText":"An actor who claims she was sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein is suing the disgraced mogul’s production company, claiming it was complicit in his abuse, according to reports. Dominique Huett has filed a $5m (£3.8m) civil suit with Los Angeles superior court, alleging that the Weinstein Company “aided and abetted” Weinstein in “repeated acts of sexual misconduct”. The suit is believed to be the first filed against Weinstein or his company since the allegations against the producer came to light three weeks ago. According to documents uploaded by Variety, the lawsuit alleges that Weinstein asked Huett to his room at a hotel in Beverly Hills in 2010 under the pretence of discussing her acting career. Once there he asked if she would give him a massage, before suggesting he perform oral sex on her. Huett refused, but says that Weinstein “would not take no for an answer”. After performing oral sex on Huett, Weinstein masturbated in front of her, the suit claims. Weinstein then allegedly offered Huett a role on the reality TV series Project Runway, which the Weinstein Company produced. In the suit Huett alleges that the board of the Weinstein Company had been negligent in ignoring Weinstein’s behaviour, which it had been aware of since the 1990s. The suit claims that the company’s board of directors, which includes Weinstein’s brother Bob, knew about the confidential settlements that Weinstein is alleged to have reached with multiple women and did nothing to prevent further incidents. “The Board of Directors was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of failing to remove or adequately supervise Weinstein,” the suit reads. “In failing to do so, [the] Defendant acted with actual malice and with conscious disregard to Plaintiff’s safety.” The suit also claims that Weinstein would use female employees at the company as “honeypots”, “to lure his victims into a false sense of security” at the outset of meetings. These female employees were then later dismissed, leaving Weinstein alone with his victims, the suit says. So far more than 50 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment or sexual assault. The 65-year old is currently the subject of criminal investigations in London, Los Angeles and New York. A spokesperson for Weinstein says that the producer has “unequivocally denied” all allegations of non-consensual sex. The Weinstein Company has repeatedly said that it was unaware of Weinstein’s alleged behaviour, with Bob Weinstein saying that he had no idea about “the type of predator [his brother] was”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/29/mozart-requiem-sussmayr-dutron-rias-kammerchor-freiburger-barockorchester-jacobs","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T07:20:21Z","webTitle":"Mozart: Requiem ed Süssmayr/Dutron CD review – sometimes stimulating, often jarring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/29/mozart-requiem-sussmayr-dutron-rias-kammerchor-freiburger-barockorchester-jacobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/29/mozart-requiem-sussmayr-dutron-rias-kammerchor-freiburger-barockorchester-jacobs","fields":{"headline":"Mozart: Requiem ed Süssmayr/Dutron CD review – sometimes stimulating, often jarring","bodyText":"There have been repeated efforts to improve on Süssmayr’s completion of Mozart’s unfinished Requiem.

The results are sometimes stimulating, often jarring.

This collection of Nat King Cole songs, however, presumably aimed at the Christmas market, sees him go the full Bublé. Instead of concentrating on Cole’s impressive jazz career – the 1940s piano/bass/guitar recordings on Capitol, the After Midnight album – here Vince Mendoza’s cloying arrangements for a 70-piece orchestra pay homage to the string-drenched showbiz Cole with a fidelity that is largely pointless. That said, a zingy big-band Ballerina works well, the sprightly small-group version of L-O-V-E is ace, while Porter does eke dark truths from Freddy Cole’s I Wonder Who My Daddy Is."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/27/sharp-rise-in-number-of-children-admitted-to-intensive-care-in-england","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Sharp rise in number of children admitted to intensive care in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/27/sharp-rise-in-number-of-children-admitted-to-intensive-care-in-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/27/sharp-rise-in-number-of-children-admitted-to-intensive-care-in-england","fields":{"headline":"Sharp rise in number of children admitted to intensive care in England","bodyText":"The number of children admitted to intensive care in England has risen sharply since 2009, putting additional pressure on already overstretched health services, researchers have warned. A study of admissions to paediatric intensive care units in England found a nearly 15% increase from 2004 to 2013, with a larger than expected rise against population growth from 2009 onwards. In Wales there was a more than 2% rise over the period studied. But the authors of the research said it was unclear what is behind the surge in numbers. However, they noted that migration and better survival rates for those born prematurely could be a factor. The spike seen from 2009 onwards also correlates with cuts to public healthcare spending, the researchers say. “From 2004 to 2009, public healthcare spending in the UK increased by 8.3% per annum; however from 2009 onwards, it grew at just 1.9%,” they write. Admission rates were higher in areas of England with high numbers of mothers born outside the UK, particularly those from eastern Europe. This includes the South Central region, for example, where there was a 43% rise over the period studied, and London, which saw an increase of nearly 31%. “We wanted to investigate why there was a rise in admissions and to see if it was due to an increased birth rate or other factors. Following analysis, only a proportion of the rise was due to birth rate; we think the additional increase over what would be expected could possibly be due partly to migration into England, and the problems associated with newly-migrated populations into a new country,” said one of the authors, Prof Elizabeth Draper of the University of Leicester. She added: “Another factor is that increasing numbers of critically ill children are surviving pre-term birth and other major illness who may not have survived in the past.” Dr Peter Davis, consultant in paediatric intensive care at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, said: “What is changing is probably the nature of and type of patients admitted. They tend to have conditions that are more complex and chronic. That won’t change, as parental expectations now are that there should be more done for children than in the past. People are offered all sorts of treatment and packages and surviving longer.” Writing in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, Draper and colleagues said that whatever the reason for the rise, it looks set to continue. “Increasing numbers of critically ill children requiring paediatric intensive care in England and Wales will prove challenging both for [these] services and commissioners, as increased demand potentially outstrips resource,” they conclude. Researchers at the University of Leicester and the paediatric intensive care unit at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children analysed admissions data from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network along with population data, including births, comparing predicted admission numbers with the actual figures. The paper found admission rates were slightly higher among boys than girls and were also higher among children of South Asian ethnicity. The steepest rises were among younger children up to the age of five and those with breathing or cardiovascular problems. Infants under one made up almost half the total annual admissions. Davis said: “NHS England has a review ongoing at the moment looking at what they are doing in paediatric intensive care and paediatric surgical care. Within that they are looking at issues of where children are cared for.” “We need to look at investing into making sure that we have we got the right number of beds in the right places to support these children. We know in winter intensive care beds get very tight … The concern within the profession is whether the review will mean more investment or just the same funding distributed differently.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/10/temper-city-london-ec2-restaurant-review-rhik-samadder","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T14:00:20Z","webTitle":"Temper City, London EC2: ‘There’s so much going on here, you don’t know where you are’ – restaurant review | Rhik Samadder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/10/temper-city-london-ec2-restaurant-review-rhik-samadder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/10/temper-city-london-ec2-restaurant-review-rhik-samadder","fields":{"headline":"Temper City, London EC2: ‘There’s so much going on here, you don’t know where you are’ – restaurant review","bodyText":"I once met the brother of 1980s heart-throb Matt Dillon, and found myself transfixed by his distorted familiarities: same anvil of a head; eyes not brown, but blue and pleading; the fact his name was Kevin. It was a face cursed by comparison, and I can’t help but think of it as I sit in Temper City. A week before my visit, Neil Rankin’s first Temper restaurant, a Soho firepit where whole animals are slung on to coals and diners order meat by weight, picked up best newcomer at the Observer Food Monthly awards. His second venture is a step into new territory – and a stumble into identity crisis. With the confusion of someone invited to a retro, pan-Asian fusion barbecue, I try to wrap my head around “squid and samphire pakora” and “dashi chip shop chicken”. “Korean haggis” is the sort of madness you’d scribble on a pad at 4am, so I can’t not order it. Weirdly, it’s decent: lung-y and oaty, with the pepperiness substituted by gochugaru chilli. It works for my companion, too. C is a bald Chinese comedian, and he knows Asian flavours. “It’s crazily reminiscent of choong, my grandma’s glutinous rice with cuts of pork and shiitake: that heavy umami thing.” I had hoped he’d make some cheap cracks about “Seoul food”, but apparently he’s “too good for that”. The rest is divided between curry and steak, not a classic combo. They work fine as individual nights at Wetherspoons, on Tuesday and Thursday, but even then they’re split by Wing It Wednesday. This menu straddles both food groups. Sadly, the cutlery doesn’t. Implements are perfect for Asian fare, yet trying to eat bavette with a fork and a spoon is like living an Alanis Morissette lyric. I roll a few slices by hand, rending the flesh with my teeth, but C is part of a circle of friends I see once a year, and I don’t want him reporting back that I’ve gone feral. I ask for a knife. His dish also confuses. Tandoori chicken should be diabolically red and blackened by the fires of hell. Here, it’s soft and sauce-striped, profoundly savoured by smoke, but less so by curry marinade, and not what we expected. It’s cooked well, but at £18 for a half-bird, I want no alarms and no surprises, please. On the curry side, better news. Fish head is lovely, if mild. I pictured a decapitated snapper rearing from its broth, but these seductive chunks in aromatic coconut milk are more Cleopatra than Jaws. “Dry goat” sounds as appetising as “old shoe”, but this heap of caramelised shreds, musky, toasted and looking like a mound of American tobacco, knocks me backwards. For meat lovers, it’s a bowl of the best crisp bits. Piled on to yoghurt and tamarind, and folded in roti with chutney and pickles, it is sensational. Temper Soho’s open cube of a kitchen survives, smoke wafting over dangling ducks, ribs and sirloins working their tans over the coals. There are booths, tables, a low-light mezzanine, but the counter suits us, watching the thalis get ready for their date with a curry. Each is a pleasing flavour wheel of sulphuric za’atar tomatoes, fried potato wisps, chutney, turmeric pickle, a hot and vinegary pepper. There’s also an over-heavy roti, and what the waitress calls “piles of dust”: one sweet Bombay mix, the other insanely sweet roast coconut. This thali ain’t big enough for the both of them. It’s international gin and tonic day, so we do our duty from a vast selection, and Abelforth’s Bathtub gin and Bobby’s Schiedam are the smoothest I’ve ever tried. There are also “funny” cocktails, including Chamomile The F**k Down and Mr Faulty, a sour basil daiquiri (see?) made with rice-wine vinegar that resembles algae scoopings. “Bananaramadrama” perfectly illustrates Temper City’s problem: textured banana ice-cream, kept company by fragrant banana fritters and cubes of warm, cinnamon-crusted banana bread, is so achingly homely, I could curl foetal around it. But it’s ruined by a scattering of foam bananas, whose chemical bloom obliterates all else. I love foam bananas, but here they’re a superfluous gag, a wallop of slapstick during a declaration of love. The Scottish chip shop thing, the provocative fusions, the meaty machismo, the Chesney Hawkes: there’s so much going on here, you don’t know where you are. While not as wrongheaded as Kevin Dillon, the addled enthusiasm could do with tempering. Despite a new location in the old financial district (or possibly because of it), something here doesn’t quite add up. • Temper City 2 Angel Court, 30 Throgmorton Street, London EC2, 020-3004 6984.

Iranian authorities have imposed an asset freeze on at least 152 BBC Persian journalists and former contributors, preventing them from conducting financial transactions or selling properties in their homeland because of their affiliation with the British broadcaster. It has emerged that a criminal investigation has also been launched in Iran, accusing those linked with BBC Persian of “conspiracy against national security”. The corporation said it was the latest “sustained campaign of harassment and persecution ... designed to pressure journalists against continuing their work for the BBC”. Acting on behalf of its London-based Persian service staff, the BBC has filed an urgent complaint with David Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. It has also contacted Asma Jahangir, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, who was expected to issue a statement on Wednesday. Tony Hall, the BBC director general, said the Iranian investigation appeared to be politically motivated. “This is an unprecedented collective punishment of journalists who are simply doing their jobs,” he said. “This is not just a campaign against BBC Persian staff but against fundamental human rights, and the BBC calls on the government of Iran to end this legal action immediately.” The National Union of Journalists in the UK also condemned the harassment of BBC Persian journalists. “These ludicrous charges amount to the collective punishment of journalists and a crass attempt to intimidate,” said Michelle Stanistreet, the general secretary. “Iran should drop the criminal charges and lift the asset ban immediately.” About 140 employees work for BBC Persian from outside Iran. The TV channel, which is broadcast from London, is loathed by the Iranian establishment and banned inside Iran, but millions of people, hungry for news not reported by the state-run channels, watch it via illegal satellite dishes. Iran has launched a campaign of harassment against BBC Persian staff by summoning their family members who live in the country for questioning. A number of employees have also been victims of false allegations of sexual misconduct, duplicated Facebook accounts, fake blogs and online identity theft designed to discredit them. In one case, the sister of a BBC Persian journalist was taken to Evin prison in Tehran, held there for 17 days and “forced to plead with the journalist via Skype to stop working for the BBC or spy on colleagues”. Britain is often called the “old fox” by Iranian hardliners, who consider BBC Persian to be a subversive arm of MI6, aimed at fomenting regime change in Iran. The BBC World Service, which controls the foreign language services, received funding until 2014 from the Foreign Office – a factor that has fanned the Iranian establishment’s distrust. Historical suspicions date back to the 1941 Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, and later to the still unacknowledged MI6-engineered coup against the country’s first democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, who had nationalised the Anglo-Iranian oil company. The ongoing imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman serving a five-year jail sentence in Iran, is linked to her previous work for the BBC. Tehran’s prosecutor general, in comments made earlier this month, alleged that she was running “a BBC Persian online journalism course aimed at recruiting and training people to spread propaganda against Iran”. Zaghari-Ratcliffe worked for BBC Media Action between February 2009 and October 2010. “The BBC, on behalf of its staff, will use all available legal avenues to challenge this order,” Hall vowed, urging the international community to “use their own influence in Iran to persuade the authorities that this completely unacceptable treatment must end”. BBC Persian journalists cannot visit their families in Iran for fear of reprisal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/937","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T00:00:41Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 937","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/937","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/937","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 937","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/26/disinhibited-director-max-stafford-clark-humiliated-me-actor-tracy-ann-oberman-says","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T13:11:44Z","webTitle":"'Disrespectful' director Max Stafford-Clark humiliated me, actor Tracy Ann Oberman says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/26/disinhibited-director-max-stafford-clark-humiliated-me-actor-tracy-ann-oberman-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/26/disinhibited-director-max-stafford-clark-humiliated-me-actor-tracy-ann-oberman-says","fields":{"headline":"'Disrespectful' director Max Stafford-Clark humiliated me, actor says","bodyText":"Actor and writer Tracy Ann Oberman has said theatre director Max Stafford-Clark was “disinhibited and provocative, objectifying and disrespectful to women back in 1992”, after it was revealed last week that he was forced to leave the company he founded following a complaint about sexualised comments. Oberman, who has starred in EastEnders, Doctor Who and Friday Night Dinner, has written for the Guardian about her experience with Stafford-Clark, saying his actions left her feeling “uncomfortable, sexualised and propositioned”. The actor said Stafford-Clark often alluded to the pair having sex and told her he wanted a threesome with her and another female actor. On one occasion he asked to come with her when she went to the toilet. She said she found the experience “humiliating and disconcerting”. Two other women who worked with the director have also independently told the Guardian he made inappropriate, sexualised comments to them in the 80s and 90s too. A spokesperson for Stafford-Clark said: “Mr Stafford-Clark wholeheartedly apologises if his behaviour has at any time made anyone feel uncomfortable or upset. He strongly denies any unlawful or aggressive behaviour. Beyond that he is not in a position to comment on the specific allegations, some of which are said to have occurred 30 years ago.” On Friday the Guardian revealed that Stafford-Clark was forced from Out of Joint in September after the company’s education manager, Gina Abolins, complained that he had made inappropriate and sexualised remarks, including: “Back in the day, I’d have been up you like a rat up a drainpipe.” The director’s former personal assistant Steffi Holtz also said he had made a number of sexualised comments to her. In total five women have now said Stafford-Clark made inappropriate sexualised comments to them. Responding to the original article a spokesperson for Stafford-Clark said the director had suffered from pseudobulbar palsy and “occasional disinhibition” since a stroke and brain injury in 2006, which occasionally resulted “in him displaying disinhibited and compulsive behaviour and his usual (at times provocative) behaviour being magnified”.Oberman said she sympathised with people suffering from illnesses which caused disinhibition, but added that she wanted to stand up for the young women who had spoken out about what happened to them recently. She described having a “similar experience” to Abolins and Holtz with Stafford-Clark in 1992, as a young actor, 14 years before his stroke. She said she often left his rehearsal room “confused and ill at ease”. “On more than one occasion he inferred that it would only take an affair with a high-profile director for my career to rocket. Three years later, I bumped into him at a press night and he repeated the offer,” she wrote. Abigail Morris, former artistic director of the Soho Theatre and now director of the Jewish Museum, said she was excited when she was given the opportunity to work as assistant director to Stafford-Clark at the Royal Court in the late 1980s. She was in her early 20s. But she said he regularly made sexualised remarks to her and other colleagues. “He would always comment on what I was wearing, he commented on my legs all the time,” she said. “He would keep being inappropriate – for example if he was directing a straightforward piece of text he would unnecessarily make it very sexual and graphically explicit.” She added: “He often commented on what I looked like, what other women looked like and what he’d like to do to us. He regularly used his power to try and humiliate me.“It’s hard to speak out, even after so many years, but women are consistently silenced. His belittling behaviour felt so degrading but I don’t want to feel anymore that it’s me who’s dirty and ashamed.” The novelist and actor Emily Woof said the director had commissioned her to write a play for the Royal Court in the early 90s, when she was a recent graduate, and invited her to a restaurant for dinner to discuss ideas. She was initially “nervous and excited”, as the director was “respected and known for championing women writers and feminist causes”. “The first thing he said when I sat down was that I had a ‘beautiful arse’,” she said. “I was completely tongue-tied and deeply embarrassed.” He continued to make lewd comments throughout the meal and afterwards offered her a lift, which she accepted, she said. “He put his hand on my thigh,” she said. “I remember being scared that I had to go back to his house, and managed to tell him that I wanted to go home. He dropped me somewhere in London that was nowhere near where I needed to be.” Woof’s show was put on at the Royal Court but she said that she avoided the director, adding: “He betrayed what might have become a mentoring, nurturing relationship with the theatre.” Woof said she had been tempted to dismiss the incident or laugh at it, but said in “this current wave of women’s anger and bravery, like being part of a new sexual revolution”, she had felt emboldened to speak openly. “The truth is that I was an extremely shy young woman trying to find my voice, eager to impress, pouring my heart and soul into kinetic and personal pieces for the theatre. His casual and demeaning sexualisation of me, was an abuse of power. It was damaging to me.” Oberman said she had spoken out to call out the “double standards and hypocrisy” of a man being feted as a “champion of women whose own actions don’t match that analysis”. “Words are important, and as one of the most esteemed directors of contemporary playwriting Max Stafford-Clark knows the power of words,” she wrote. “He should be held accountable for his.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/27/iceland-set-for-second-snap-election-in-a-year-after-series-of-scandals","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T04:00:19Z","webTitle":"Iceland set for second snap election in a year after series of scandals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/27/iceland-set-for-second-snap-election-in-a-year-after-series-of-scandals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/27/iceland-set-for-second-snap-election-in-a-year-after-series-of-scandals","fields":{"headline":"Iceland set for second snap election in a year after series of scandals","bodyText":"Iceland heads into its second snap parliamentary election in less than a year on Saturday with the financial crash that brought the country to its knees nearly a decade ago still playing out in its politics. The island’s economy is thriving again, thanks mainly to an unprecedented tourism boom, but some of its top politicians have been hit by a succession of financial and ethical scandals that have badly dented voters’ trust. The prime minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, called the election last month after his three-party government collapsed over an alleged attempt to cover up efforts by his father to help “restore the honour” of a convicted child sex offender. Benediktsson formed his centre-right coalition barely 10 months ago, following early elections triggered by his predecessor’s resignation. Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson had stepped down amid public fury at revelations in the Panama Papers that his family had sheltered money offshore. The Guardian revealed this month that while an MP, Benediktsson – whose name also appeared in the Panama Papers – had himself sold millions of króna of assets in a major Icelandic bank’s investment fund as the state was about to seize control of the country’s failing financial sector at the peak of the 2008 crisis. The prime minister, a member of one of Iceland’s wealthiest families, has denied any wrongdoing, but newly leaked documents suggest his relationship with Glitnir bank was close enough to raise serious questions about a possible conflict of interest between his roles as an MP and one of its most valued clients. Glitnir Holdco, which administers the collapsed bank’s estate, has since sought an injunction preventing Stundin and Reykjavik Media, the Icelandic news outlets that worked on the investigation with the Guardian, from publishing more of the leaked data. Benediktsson has said he had nothing to do with the gagging order. Despite the scandals, polls show the prime minister’s conservative Independence party – a member of 19 of the 27 governments that have run modern Iceland – is now edging ahead in the race with its main rival, the Left-Green Movement, which earlier this month held a clear lead. Headed by 41-year-old Katrín Jakobsdóttir, the Left-Greens have largely succeeded the more traditional Social Democrats as the leading party of the Icelandic left, campaigning against inequality and for greater investment in public services and higher taxes for the better-off. Polls show nearly half of Iceland’s voters would like the popular Jakobsdóttir, seen as representing a new breed of politician, to be prime minister – around twice the number who say they plan to vote for her party. A centre-left government would be only the second since Iceland won full independence from Denmark in 1944. At least six other parties – including a new Centre Party launched by Gunnlaugsson – could win seats in the 63-member alþingi in a continuing fragmentation of Icelandic politics that reflect mounting voter dissatisfaction with the cronyism and corruption many see as endemic in their political and business classes. Iceland was plunged into a deep recession following the 2008 crash, during which its three major banks, including Glitnir, failed with liabilities of 11 times the country’s GDP. The stock market fell 97%, the value of the króna halved, and Iceland became the first western European country in 25 years to ask the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. A perception now exists that Benediktsson, 47, “is part of the elite that crashed the system”, said Egill Helgason, a political commentator at the public broadcaster, RUV. The prime minister and his circle suffer from a serious lack of trust in the wake of recent scandals, he said. With growth surging at 7.2% last year, however, and unemployment down at just 2.5%, it seems likely that many Icelandic voters still see the Independence party, which has campaigned on a platform of tax cuts and more business investment, as the most likely to deliver economic stability."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/28/nick-fraser-world-stroke-day-speechless-bbc4-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T19:45:07Z","webTitle":"Stroke: when words fail you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/28/nick-fraser-world-stroke-day-speechless-bbc4-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/28/nick-fraser-world-stroke-day-speechless-bbc4-documentary","fields":{"headline":"Stroke: when words fail you","bodyText":"I was just finishing a talk about documentaries I was giving in Soho. I’d been asked a question about why so many films are seriously depressing. I remember that I talked about the great neurosurgeon Henry Marsh and the documentary about him, The English Surgeon. The film followed him to Ukraine as he helped and taught the local surgeons, who often resorted to using rusty domestic power tools to work on their patients’ skulls. I’d talked about him for some time, enthusiastically explaining how awed Henry said he felt every time he opened a patient’s head, and about how beautiful the brain is. I wanted to say more – but suddenly I sat down, and couldn’t say or think anything. Something had happened to me. I had gone into a different world of not making sense. I was taken by ambulance to University College hospital and given a head CT scan. There was a blood clot on my brain. I’d had a stroke, a brain attack. Time is all-important to stroke patients, and fortunately I was within the time frame to be given serious clot-busting drugs. There was something else they could do, the doctor said, a procedure called a thrombectomy. UCH offered the procedure up until 6pm. The time was then around 8pm, but the doctor heroically fought through NHS protocols and secured me a trip to St George’s hospital in south-west London, the only UK location open 24/7 for thrombectomies. I was lucky. I remember meeting the neuro-radiologist who, after putting me under mild sedation, performed the extraordinary procedure that involved sending a very thin wire from my groin to my brain, and removing one small clot and one larger one from the left side of my brain. I could understand the details of the operation, but I couldn’t say anything. I wondered if I would be all right. The larger clot had been on the speech area of my brain. I had escaped physical impairment but was diagnosed with expressive and receptive aphasia, which meant I had been left with communication issues. As every stroke is different, so aphasia affects sufferers individually. Some aphasiacs can’t talk, read, write, or understand clearly, so they can’t communicate at all. Some experience mild speech problems, but are otherwise unscathed. Others have a combination of what the clinicians refer to as communication “deficits”. I cannot understand the phenomenon of aphasia. Initially, in hospital, I could listen to music on my headphones but I couldn’t understand the words of people around me or on television. When I tried to talk, my gibberish sounded like President Trump. But I could read, slowly, and I tried to listen to language in my head. Friends brought me graphic books, such as Art Spiegelman’s Maus, and I reread Animal Farm. I could understand what George Orwell was saying. My neurologist made me read a few sentences from a page. The words made sense in my head, but what came out of my mouth was incomprehensible. I couldn’t write a sentence or phrase. But the words were beautiful and made sense to me. I felt half-whole. My family and friends encouraged me, and said I could do it. “Better…better,” I’d reply to people who asked how I was doing, when I couldn’t form sentences. I’d stick to simple phrases. During weeks in neuro rehab I had intensive speech therapy. The pictures the therapists use look like they’re from primary school books. Back home I had relays of therapists to push my efforts. I worked hard and read and read, and gradually my speech has improved, gradually my auditory processing has improved so I understand much more of what is being said. It’s all to do with the brain’s plasticity, in which the brain magically creates new neural pathways to replace those cells damaged by the stroke. It is possible to repair, but the neurologists and therapists can’t tell you how long it will take, nor the extent of the restoration. Today is World Stroke Day, and to mark it a new documentary is being shown on BBC4. Speechless traces the experiences of aphasia patients and explores the importance of language. Director Richard Alwyn encountered the world of aphasia after his brother-in-law’s stroke. Alwyn’s eloquent film meets aphasiacs, including patients at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, where speech therapists can work with patients for months at a time. The film shows how the therapists need to understand the gestures of patients who have no speech. They appreciate the depressions that all post-stroke sufferers experience, and the frustration and anger of finding oneself incommunicado. We glimpse the film-maker’s brother-in-law, who doesn’t have language structures but has garbled phonemes. We encounter Barry, a businessman and former fitness fanatic, who has half language and is exasperated with his situation. After six months in hospital he isn’t sure that he wants to be at home either, because he knows it will be hard to be alone. Junior Agogo, formerly a Premier League footballer, talks well but loses his thread. Sometimes he runs in the park with his dog, but he is usually in his flat with his mother, or he stays in bed. He appears to have lost his self-confidence. He wants to be going somewhere but he cannot. Every person in the film seems to be looking at a hole in the sky, waiting for something. These people may be silenced, but they speak volumes despite their wordlessness. What comes across strongly, that I can identify with, is that the isolation of aphasia can be profound. When you try to talk, people turn away. They don’t understand what you cannot say. It is very frustrating. People also need to know that it doesn’t affect intelligence: people with aphasia still think in the same way but are unable to communicate their thoughts easily. And there are a lot of us. In the UK, an estimated 350,000 people have aphasia, which is more than those with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s combined. It must be remembered that recovery is possible in many cases. A woman I met recently had a major stroke and woke up only able to say “giraffe” and “fish and chips”. Now, some years later, she speaks well. It is a sign of optimism and morale. The brain is awesome, as Henry Marsh says. “You have improved,” my speech therapist reminds me, week after week. No one wants to live in isolation. I want to be back in the middle of things. I have been lucky. I will soon be, I hope, what I was. Be better. Speechless is on BBC4 tonight at 8pm.

Yet amid the final preparations for the event’s 15th edition, which begins on Friday when Australia face England in Melbourne, there is one unavoidable question. This is the Rugby League World Cup, so Australia – 10 times winners – are going to breeze through the next five weeks and win it all over again, aren’t they? The honest answer is “probably”. It is difficult to dispute that Mal Meninga’s Kangaroos have the best chance of lifting the trophy in Brisbane on 2 December, but recent history has shown us it is not always completely straightforward for the Australians – such as in 2008, when New Zealand won the final against the hosts in Brisbane the last time the tournament was in the southern hemisphere. The leading contenders to dethrone the Kangaroos are, as always, England and New Zealand. Such is the format – more on that later – they will almost certainly play off in Auckland for the right to reach the final next month, if Australia win Friday’s opener. For England, the message after the disappointment of last year’s Four Nations was clear – don’t worry because, come the World Cup, they would be much better prepared. “England are capable of being a lot better than what they are,” insisted their coach, Wayne Bennett, 12 months ago. Yet they have not even made a final, let alone won one, for 22 years. That is not good enough and while there is optimism that this could end this time, there appears to be even more competition to contend with. The traditional big three of Australia, England and New Zealand are still there but this time they have been joined by a star-studded squad from the southern Pacific, in the surprising shape of Tonga. International rugby league’s eligibility rules are such that if a player is not being selected for a tier one nation – England, Australia or New Zealand – they can switch to a tier two one. It is a strange rule but, by rugby league standards, nothing too dramatic. But this year a number of high-profile players have actually turned their backs on leading teams, choosing to play for Tonga instead. The domino effect began when Jason Taumalolo, who played for Tonga in the 2013 World Cup but had since won 10 caps for New Zealand, decided he would reject the Kiwis to pull on the Mate Ma’a shirt again. Andrew Fifita had actually been named in Australia’s squad for this World Cup but then switched allegiance to Tonga. Manu Vatuvei, who scored four tries for New Zealand in their 2008 group win against England and played 28 Tests up to 2015, followed suit. They and others will be up against New Zealand, Samoa and Scotland in Group B. It is worth noting that the Tonga players will earn next to nothing, whereas playing for Australia or New Zealand will earn thousands of dollars. The end result is the strongest Tonga squad in history and the suspicion that, for once, there is not a big three but a big four – and this could have the greatest impact on Australia. The winners of Group A – featuring Australia, England, Lebanon and France – should have an easier route to the final, with the runners-up likely heading to New Zealand in the semi-finals to face the Kiwis, who should still be too good to not win Group B. But whereas in 2013, for example, Australia were far too good for the other side in the final four – that year it was Fiji – in 2017, with Tonga a far more fearsome prospect than ever before, it could be a very different story. There is, though, plenty of rugby to be played before the semi-final lineup emerges and, in the group stages, it is the smaller, less established nations who have a habit of stealing the spotlight. Look at Lebanon, for instance. The Cedars – who could surely only reach a major World Cup in rugby league – are back at the tournament for the first time since their debut in 2000. There are big names in their ranks, too, from players who have not made Australia’s squad, such as the Cedars captain, South Sydney’s Robbie Farah. The Lebanese – up against Australia, England and France – may quietly fancy a place in the last eight too. Which raises the question of how it all works. Three of the four teams in the heavier-weighted Groups A and B will reach the quarter-finals, while in the three-team Groups C and D, first place only will qualify. For a story in those groups, look no further than the co-hosts Papua New Guinea, who compete alongside Wales and Ireland in Group C. The organisers of the tournament were criticised when they confirmed only two games would be held in the league stronghold of Sydney all tournament, but hosting three games in PNG’s capital, Port Moresby, could be an inspired decision for the only country where league is the national sport. It is in the less distinguished areas where the World Cup often captivates the imagination – take the sell-out crowd that watched USA play Cook Islands in Bristol on a wet, miserable Wednesday night four years ago, for example. This time the USA are in Group D, alongside Fiji and Italy. One further wrinkle is that each of the sides in C and D play one further game, against a team in the other three-team pool. While England will be hoping for so much more, Scotland, Wales and Ireland will also fancy a run to the quarter-finals but it will be tricky for the last two, who will have to head to a partisan Port Moresby and win to stand any sort of chance. As in 2013, though, they will all leave their mark on the tournament before they head home. In the end, there is no escaping that there is every possibility the tournament will finish the way it begins, with Australia playing England, this time on Saturday 2 December for the right to be crowned world champions. It is difficult to talk down the Kangaroos’ overwhelming chances of winning it all again. But do not overlook the stories, technicolour and drama that will take place in the 26 games in between."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/25/vaughan-williams-london-symphony-1920-cd-review-bbc-scottish-so-brabbins-hyperion","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T14:30:24Z","webTitle":"Vaughan Williams: A London Symphony (1920) CD review – fabulously assured, with fascinating fill-ups","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/25/vaughan-williams-london-symphony-1920-cd-review-bbc-scottish-so-brabbins-hyperion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/25/vaughan-williams-london-symphony-1920-cd-review-bbc-scottish-so-brabbins-hyperion","fields":{"headline":"Vaughan Williams: A London Symphony (1920) CD review – fabulously assured, with fascinating fill-ups","bodyText":"Vaughan Williams’s second symphony, a portrait of London life inspired by HG Wells’s novel Tono-Bungay, was completed in 1913 and first performed the following year. In its original form, A London Symphony was a huge work lasting more than an hour, but over the next 20 years the composer revised and shortened it several times, until the definitive score, which eventually appeared in print in 1936, emerged – more than 15 minutes shorter than the original. That final version of the symphony is the one usually performed today, but in 2001 the late Richard Hickox was given permission to conduct the original 1913 score for Chandos, on the strict understanding that it would never be performed in concert. It revealed how much of the music that Vaughan Williams would later excise was vividly pictorial, and that most of the cuts he made, particularly in the finale, tightened the symphonic structure and made it less episodic. Now Martyn Brabbins’s recording fills in a bit more of the history; he conducts the first revision, performed for the first time in 1918, and published two years later. By then, much of the major surgery on the score had been carried out; it clocks in at 51 minutes in the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s performance, with Brabbins’s fabulously assured reading generally favouring broad tempi, in the unaltered first movement especially. The fill-ups are fascinating, too – early settings of Rossetti and Shakespeare for female voices (Elizabeth Watts, Mary Bevan and Kitty Whately) and orchestra, and the very late Variations for brass band – but there’s no suggestion that Brabbins’s disc is anything more than a one-off. Yet among the flurry of VW recordings this month, two other releases continue well-established symphony cycles. Andrew Davis’s account of the Sinfonia Antartica (the seventh symphony) with the Bergen orchestra follows their account of the Ninth last year, and completes the Chandos cycle that Hickox left unfinished, though the sound pictures it paints sometimes seem subdued. There’s something a bit subfusc, too, about Mark Elder’s coupling of the Fourth and the Sixth Symphonies. The latest instalment of his Hallé cycle is perhaps the most disappointing, often lacking the intensity that these two wonderfully taut, fierce scores really need. The long admired VW cycles conducted by Adrian Boult and Bernard Haitink (Warner Classics) remain benchmarks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/25/david-davis-final-brexit-vote-rug-parliament-feet-mps-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T12:15:48Z","webTitle":"No final Brexit vote?

David Davis has pulled the rug from under parliament’s feet","bodyText":"David Davis has dropped the government into another crisis of credibility by saying that parliament may not be able to vote on the final Brexit deal until after the UK has left the EU in March 2019. The secretary of state for exiting the EU made the comments in an almost off-hand way in an exchange with Labour’s Seema Malhotra while giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee this morning. The way he said it felt as if, in the technocratic and bureaucratic world Davis now inhabits as a minister with one of the toughest briefs in Whitehall, this is merely one loose end among the hundreds involved in leaving the EU. This is a man who, as he told the committee, now arrives at negotiations in Brussels with a team of 100 civil servants. Cocooned in this world of endless specialist talks, it would not be surprising if Davis had long ago dismissed the notion that MPs will have much effect on the final Brexit process anyway. But it’s a major failure of his political antennae if so. As the Brexit process has ground on, raising ever greater uncertainties about every aspect of national life, MPs and peers of all parties have begun to attach ever more importance to that “final Brexit vote”. In their minds it has become the big moment in the politics of the whole Brexit process. It is, they believe, their chance to decide the deal, their chance to say if it will go ahead, and their chance to exercise their ultimate power – the sovereignty of parliament. Many outside, especially remainers, are right behind them on that. So for Davis to say that this vote could take place after 29 March 2019 (the date by which, under the article 50 process, the UK will leave the EU) makes a mockery of a role that many anti-Brexit MPs and peers see as their great responsibility. MPs are not stupid. But they struggle – as we all would and as Davis himself does – to keep on top of the complexity of the Brexit negotiations. What MPs know with complete clarity, however, is that they should have a vote and that it should be an effective one. Davis has pulled that rug from under parliament’s feet. He will go on insisting that he has said nothing particularly significant, that it’s all a negotiating process, and that this is the sort of thing that happens in negotiations. He was eloquent with the select committee when he admitted he expected everything in the Brexit deal to be sorted in the final hour of the last day permitted, with the clock stopped. For him, the parliamentary vote is very clearly a secondary matter, since it will only take place after the deal is struck (always assuming that it is struck). Yet in this way, he reveals a fundamental cultural clash with MPs and their self-image as a sovereign body. Politically, Davis lost it when he made his remarks. If this was a football match, the crowd would now be starting to chant at Davis, as they sometimes do to referees: “You don’t know what you’re doing.” Justified or not, it’s not a good moment for the Brexit secretary, or the process of which he claims to be master. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-lead-singer-with-the-fall-dies-aged-60","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T08:09:15Z","webTitle":"Mark E Smith, founder and lead singer with the Fall, dies aged 60","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-lead-singer-with-the-fall-dies-aged-60","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-lead-singer-with-the-fall-dies-aged-60","fields":{"headline":"Mark E Smith, founder and lead singer with the Fall, dies aged 60","bodyText":"Mark E Smith, the irascible frontman of Manchester post-punk band the Fall, has died at the age of 60. Smith formed the Fall in 1976 in Prestwich and was the only constant member of the band. He was known for his tempestuous relationship with his bandmates, and frequently fired them – there have been 66 different members over the years, with a third of them lasting less than a year. Smith famously once said: “If it’s me and yer granny on bongos, it’s The Fall.” He was a famously prolific musician. Last year the Fall released their 32nd studio album, New Facts Emerge, and had been fitfully touring in recent months when Smith’s health would allow. The band played London’s 100 Club in July, while Smith performed from a wheelchair in Wakefield in October. News of his death was reported on the Fall’s Twitter page and on the website of the band’s record label, Cherry Red Records. In August, the band cancelled shows in New York and Louisville, Kentucky, after Smith was hospitalised for issues relating to his throat, mouth and respiratory system. At the time the Fall’s manager, Pamela Vander, issued a statement saying: “Unfortunately, it would be a gamble on his health to fly anywhere over the next couple of months.” It would have been the Fall’s first US dates in a decade. In late December further US dates were cancelled, with Vander citing “a full year of bad health” as the reason. His former wife Brix Smith Start, who played guitar in the Fall from 1983 to 1989, made a statement on Twitter. “Mark defied convention and definition – he was a true artist. When I arrived in Manchester – a young American – he introduced me to pickled onions, pubs and punk. He was my music mentor, my cultural anchor, and my first love. I feel deeply saddened by his passing, but I feel greater joy for having shared his journey.” Among the tributes paid to Smith were from writer and Haçienda DJ Dave Haslam, who said: “The death of Mark E Smith is news I’d been dreading. One of my heroes, and a man I was proud to call a friend.” BBC Radio 6 Music’s Lauren Laverne described him as “one of my biggest heroes”. She added: “Had a nightmare interviewing him (of course) but then he put me in a song. So sharp, clever and untouchably cool.” Another 6 Music DJ, Marc Riley, joined the band as a teenager and played guitar with them from 1979 to 1983. Hearing the news while on air, he told listeners that Smith “taught me a lot about life and he taught me a lot about music... The Fall were my favourite band when I joined and they were still my favourite band when I got kicked out.” Tim Burgess, of fellow Manchester band the Charlatans, said Smith was “a true uncompromising musical maverick. A genius, a curmudgeon and someone whose company it was an honour to share.” Mancunian presenter Terry Christian called him “a colossus - the rest just chancers and careerists in comparison.” Comedian Vic Reeves wrote on Twitter: “My good friend and my hero. You’ll be so terribly missed by me and millions [of] others. Your words meant more to me than anyone.” Film director Edgar Wright also paid his respects on Twitter, saying Smith was a “gateway” into indie music, while the actor Paddy Considine said Smith was “an artist that knew no compromise. A total one off and original. What a legend.” Cedric Bixler Zavala of US punk band At the Drive In said he was “one of the pillars of influence for me as lyricist and trouble maker. I’ve built trust in people based on whether they owned and actually loved Fall records. Thanks 4 making rock literary, and mischievous.” Another US rock band, Garbage, remembered Smith’s famously acerbic humour: “We will never forget you coming to see us play. Especially when you said watching us play was like watching paint dry.” In 2007, Smith released one of his most highly-regarded late period records, Traumatic Reflexxions, under the name Von Südenfed – a collaboration with German electronic duo Mouse on Mars. The pair wrote on Twitter: “Good-bye dear friend and collaborator.” The poet Ian McMillan said Smith was the “spiky poet of every awkward moment any of us ever lived through, lit by the metallic glow of the ship canal.” Smith was born in Salford in 1957, and formed the Fall with friends Martin Bramah and Tony Friel as a teenager. The band’s output included 11 top 40 albums, including 1993’s The Infotainment Scan, which reached No 9. Smith has also collaborated with artists including Gorillaz, Inspiral Carpets and Elastica. His autobiography, Renegade: The Lives and Tales of Mark E Smith, was published in 2008. In 1983, Smith married Fall member Brix Smith Start; they divorced in 1989. He subsequently married Saffron Prior, who ran the Fall’s fan club. He has been married to his current wife, Eleni Poulou – who was a member of the Fall between 2002 and 2016 – since 2001. His death was previously wrongly announced by the BBC in March last year, on his 60th birthday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/30/paddington-go-home-should-fantasy-stories-be-more-truthful","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T09:08:25Z","webTitle":"Paddington, go home: should our fantasy stories be more truthful?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/30/paddington-go-home-should-fantasy-stories-be-more-truthful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/30/paddington-go-home-should-fantasy-stories-be-more-truthful","fields":{"headline":"Paddington, go home: should our fantasy stories be more truthful?","bodyText":"Back in 2014, an immigration lawyer pointed out that, under current UK law, Paddington would most likely be deported back to Peru or held in a detention centre.

He also dreams of bringing his Aunt Lucy to London, possibly followed by other family members, who would claim benefits and flood the NHS with their marmalade-related health problems. Paddington is a fine ambassador for Britain’s once-proud history as a haven for the persecuted, but did he make a difference? If Theresa May ever read or saw him growing up, her heart and policies remained resolutely un-softened. Every generation has had these children-orientated “let’s be nice to immigrants” fables. Postwar Americans had a rural Kansas couple who took in an orphan from another planet and named him Clark Kent (by good fortune, he had the same skin colour as them, otherwise who knows?). In recent issues of the comic, Superman saves migrants from white supremacists. In real-world Kansas, meanwhile, Donald Trump won the state with a fairly comfortable majority in 2016. In the 1980s we had ET, an alien embraced by small-town America. As is so often with kid-meets-alien stories (Lilo &amp; Stitch, The Iron Giant), ET contrasted the innocence of children with the heartlessness of adults. That these prejudice-free kids might grow into heartless adults is a possibility we don’t like to contemplate. Some current multiplex fixtures might also be of interest to the authorities. Does Wonder Woman have a valid visa from Themyscira? Admittedly, she’d ace any points-based immigration system. And what about the Minions: stateless economic migrants whose language no one can understand? Or Thor: Ragnarok, which ends (spoiler alert) with an entire spaceship-load of refugees in search of a new home. They can cross Earth off their list. In the same way we lie about Santa Claus, maybe we tell children these feelgood stories not for their benefit but our own. We know the reality is crushingly grim, but we want to believe in something rosier, like we did when we were children. It might make for a better world one day, but let’s not kid ourselves.

Cecilia Malmström, a Swedish commissioner with responsibility for human resources, told the debate in Strasbourg that more must be done to address allegations of sexual abuse within the European parliament and commission. Her comments come after at least two staff members claimed they had been raped and other claims of sexual harassment emerged this week. “Workplaces all over the world, including in the European Union and the institutions must look at how we address this,” she said. “Do we do enough?” The debate about sexual violence heard claims that the parliamentary authorities had sought to play down allegations of sexual abuse in the past. These claims were swiftly denied. Anonymous victims of sexual harassment within the European commission and the parliament have suggested through the media in recent days that they have struggled to have their voices heard. The Politico website claims to have heard more than 30 unverified allegations of rape, assault and harassment connected to the parliament in the past week, after it set up a confidential whistleblowing portal. One of the complainants, an MEP’s assistant who requested anonymity, told Politico she had informed senior parliamentary officers that a member of staff had raped her in 2016, only to be discouraged from approaching the police. “If there are formal procedures, I don’t know what they are. I felt completely lost,” she said. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP who sits on the committee that investigates harrassment complaints involving colleagues in the parliament, told the debate that the body regularly had cases to deal with, but none of the 10 reported to it since 2014 had been of a sexual nature. She added, however, that she believed women were fearful of coming forward with the most serious accusations. “All forms of harassment are wrong and must be stopped but sexual harassment is particularly pernicious,” she said. “Coming forward is very distressing for the victims. Disclosure is a professional and financial risk for the victims. “They often don’t come forward and their cases go unreported. So we don’t see the full extent of the problem. This isn’t acceptable. “We must get better. Better at preventing harassment in the first place by introducing mandatory MEP training. Better at encouraging the victims to come forward by providing guarantees they will not lose their job. And better at acting swiftly once the investigation has been completed. With sanctions imposed against accused MEPs.” The fact that MEPs have immunity from prosecution up until the chamber votes to lift it represents a further complication for alleged victims of sexual harassment. The president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, said earlier this week that no formal allegations of sexual harassment had been made against those who work in the chamber, only for contradictory details to emerge and clarifications to follow. A spokesman said on Wednesday that while no formal allegations of sexual abuse had been made to the two advisory committees formed to deal with accusations, “cases of rape or sexual harassment have been reported” to senior personnel and “sanctions and disciplinary measures taken”. MEPs, who are due to vote on a resolution on the subject on Thursday, debated ways to put an end to all forms of sexual harassment. Some shared their own experiences. “I was 19 years old at university, he was a like-minded professor about 70 years old, an intellectual comrade,” the Italian MEP Eleonora Forenza said. Terry Reintke, a Green MEP, said: “Me too, I have been sexually harassed just like millions of other women in the European Union … I think it is about time that we very clearly say that we should not be ashamed but that the perpetrators should be ashamed.” The leader of the Tory MEPs, Ashley Fox, has fallen foul of a group of five female MEPs who are demanding an external investigation into allegations of sexual harassment in the parliament. He was accused of “mansplaining” when he said those responding to an email from the group seeking support for their initiative earlier this week need not reply to everyone on the distribution list, suggesting their responses amounted to spam. Soroya Post, a Swedish MEP, wrote back: “It is amazing that in 2017 we can still see such examples of mansplaining. Times have changed and we will not be dictated by your demands Mr Fox. “The power of visibility that the issue of sexual harassment and assault is gaining right now cannot be underestimated or diminished. We will make our voices louder on this issue which has been silenced for too long to the detriment of all of us. “Martin Luther King Jr said: ‘The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort or convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.’ You Mr Fox could clearly heed his advice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/24/rfu-aim-eclipse-football-strongest-sport-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T21:00:49Z","webTitle":"RFU sets out ambitious aim to eclipse football as ‘strongest’ sport in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/24/rfu-aim-eclipse-football-strongest-sport-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/24/rfu-aim-eclipse-football-strongest-sport-england","fields":{"headline":"RFU sets out ambitious aim to eclipse football as ‘strongest’ sport in England","bodyText":"No one could accuse the Rugby Football Union of not thinking big in the latest five‑year mission statement announced by its new chief executive, Steve Brown. Eddie Jones has long been focused on bringing back the 2019 World Cup but Brown has gone further by seeking to make rugby England’s strongest sport. The day when rugby overtakes football as the country’s pre-eminent team sport is unlikely to dawn imminently but recent events at the Football Association have done little to dissuade the RFU it can set standards others will eventually seek to emulate. Brown admits the target is ambitious but is unapologetic. “Our definition of strongest isn’t necessarily biggest,” he said, when asked how he imagined his vision would go down at Wembley. “That may be some way off for us but you don’t have to be big to be strong. We want to be the best in the country in terms of the way the game is governed and set standards that are a step change for us and other organisations as well.” Coming from a union that was in meltdown less than six years ago following the acrimonious fallout from the 2011 Rugby World Cup, it also reflects the more settled atmosphere at Twickenham, with the 2015 World Cup having delivered a financial windfall and Jones having transformed the team’s fortunes. For English rugby to continue to flourish, however, there is also official acknowledgement not everything in the rose garden is healthy. Injury concerns, financial uncertainty among Championship clubs and the numbers of players who give up the sport in their late teens remain obstacles to Brown’s desire to persuade floating fans that “rugby is good for you”. Most pressing is the need to protect the game’s battered leading players amid talk of strike action. Nigel Melville, the RFU’s director of professional rugby, revealed he would be meeting players’ union representatives on 6 November to discuss their concerns over the mooted extension of the domestic league campaign. “I think we’re very much in line with the players,” Melville said. “I’m not waiting until the end of the season, I want them to know now that we are listening to them.” Melville and others are also looking forward to receiving precise comparative statistics on whether injury rates are on the rise at club level. The verdict of the sports scientists will, in turn, dictate how long a summer break players can expect in future. “There’s no point sitting in a room and talking about what the off‑season should be until we’ve got the data,” Melville said. “We’ve got to find out what’s the best way to go. That determines where you start and finish.” Brown, meanwhile, has backed the England captain, Dylan Hartley, before his latest disciplinary hearing for striking a French opponent in the Champions Cup last weekend, suggesting the outcome would not affect the player’s position. “My personal opinion is that Dylan has been a superb captain for England,” the chief executive said. “I would withhold judgment until we see the outcome of any hearing.” He also indicated England were targeting another Six Nations title – “A grand slam is hard to achieve but we are not planning to come second” – and said the RFU is “already scanning the horizon” to identify the best replacement for Jones when he steps down in 2019. “We need to have plans A, B and C ready. Eddie also wants to leave a legacy and a system that works. I think we’re probably in a better place than we have been in the past. We need it not to be a distraction going into 2019.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/letter-to-children-tell-them-transgender-letter-always-wanted-write","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-04T06:30:11Z","webTitle":"A letter to … my children to tell them I am transgender","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/letter-to-children-tell-them-transgender-letter-always-wanted-write","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/letter-to-children-tell-them-transgender-letter-always-wanted-write","fields":{"headline":"A letter to … my children to tell them I am transgender","bodyText":"I still feel guilty that your mum and I separated and that she and I still don’t talk to each other. I know how painful the separation was for you, and I am grateful that you are still in my life. But now I feel I am going to cause you even further heartache and confusion when I tell you that I am transgender and hope to begin living full-time as a woman very soon. Indeed, I already live most of my life as a woman – I have even transitioned within my workplace – and I go about my daily business as a woman. The only times I have to pretend I am a man are the days and weekends when you come to visit. So, for one day a week, and every second weekend, I hide away my clothes and my makeup and anything that might lead you to suspect, and pretend to be someone I am not. Yes, I have grown my hair long and I have had my ears pierced – which you found amusing, if not remarkable. After all, there are plenty of men with long hair and pierced ears. So, why haven’t I told you yet? The truth is that I am scared. I am scared of how you might react. I am scared of how your mum will react and what she might say about me. But, most of all, I am scared that you might not want to see me any more and that might just break my heart. It has not been easy to get where I am. Believe me, I tried every which way I could think of to avoid it, but there came a point where I could no longer deny who I was. I started seeing a counsellor and then I started the process of coming out to the people in my daily life: my friends, my colleagues, my GP, my employer. And yet you, the most important people in my life, don’t know. I hope you don’t think it is because I consider you the least important – quite the opposite. It is because I have left the most difficult task until last. With any luck, I will soon be put on hormone blockers and, after a few months of that, I will begin hormone treatment. My physical appearance will begin to change to match the image that my brain has of me. I have never been comfortable in my body – is anyone? But, with me, it is a constant buzz at the back of my brain from the minute I get up in the morning to the minute I go to sleep at night. I avoid mirrors as much as possible and I loathe my traitorous body that produces so much testosterone. I know that this will be hard for you to understand, but I am hoping that, some day, when you are old enough, you will be able to read this and maybe it will go a little way towards helping you to understand. I never meant for any of this to happen, but I hope you understand that I need to be me. I can’t go on living a lie and being deeply unhappy. You are all different ages, so that makes it much more difficult to know what to tell each of you and when. All I know is that you must be told – and soon. No matter what happens, no matter how I look, no matter what clothes I wear, I am – and will always be – your dad.

For more than three years, the Syrian town was the political capital of Islamic State’s self-styled caliphate. Last week, the final strongholds fell to Kurdish fighters. However, writer Jason Burke cautions against any talk of victory. A foreign correspondent with extensive experience covering Islamic extremism, Burke reminds us that Raqqa is likely to be a turning point for Isis and its opponents, but not an endgame. Further on in the paper, elections and referendums dot the news pages. In Spain, we keep tabs on the political to and fro over the question of Catalan independence. Meanwhile, in Japan, prime minister Shinzo Abe’s gamble to call an election a year ahead of schedule has paid off. Voters backed his uncompromising stance on North Korea and returned his Liberal Democratic party with its two-thirds “supermajority” in Japan’s lower house intact. In New Zealand, Labour prime minister-elect Jacinda Ardern and New Zealand First’s Winston Peters, who will serve as deputy PM, signed a coalition deal that leaves incumbent PM Bill English’s National party out in the cold. In the Czech Republic, however, it seems tycoon turned populist politician Andrej Babiš, who led his new ANO party to election victory, will have a tougher time attracting coalition partners. The world diary examines the events surrounding the death of Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed last week after 30 years of campaigning journalism in Malta, including work central to the Panama Papers investigation. In the UK, the top story surrounds accusations of “social apartheid” at Oxford, where one in three colleges failed to admit any black British A-level students in 2015.

I get it cut every few months and rely on hair products to tame the mess between cuts, so it passes as some kind of style. It’s not particularly short, so I need something with a decent hold. My first impression of the Superdrug Styling Putty (£1.99, 75ml) was that it was quite oily and had a strong but not unpleasant smell. After being applied to wet hair it seemed to mould easily but gave little actual hold. It dried quite quickly and gave a separated kind of texture, which isn’t really what I’m after. The Murdock Matt Putty (£14, 100ml) had a grainy texture that was preferable to Superdrug’s offering, and a nicer smell. It gave a firm hold, but it wasn’t firm enough for me. The texture was good and it was easy to reshape throughout the day, but this is probably better for people with hair that’s shorter than mine. Although the smell and texture of the Paul Mitchell Flexible Style Lab Elastic Shaping Paste (£17.25, 50ml) reminded me of PVA glue from school, I liked everything else about it. It gave a strong hold that could be reworked if needed, the texture was nice and it had a bit of shine. Bumble and bumble’s SumoTech (£23, 50ml) was my favourite. It gave a great hold and the texture was similar to using a wax together with a paste, which is my usual routine. It had a subtle, natural smell. This will be my new go-to, but I’d use it with the Paul Mitchell if I needed extra hold or shine. • Next week: Sylviane Degunst on foot creams This article contains affiliate links to products.

But the debate has sadly turned into a vicious fight about who should and shouldn’t have access to equality between supporters of trans and women’s rights – two groups that should have common cause. In 2004, the Gender Recognition Act confirmed that transgender people exist, and their gender should be recognised in law. It’s a clunky process that relies on trans people demonstrating they have a mental illness. We moved on from labelling homosexuality as a mental illness back in 1992. Surely it’s long overdue for those who are transgender? As the prime minister reaffirmed last week at the Pink News awards: “Being trans is not an illness and should not be treated as such.” Trans people and people who are neither male nor female should be recognised for who they are without abuse or discrimination; they should not have to go through a lengthy, degrading process. It’s notable that societies more conservative than ours – Argentina, Ireland and Malta – have all done it. Why can’t we? Some believe that if people could self-declare their gender without the bureaucracy and paperwork, men will simply say “I am a woman” in order to access female-only spaces to abuse women. We all should be concerned about male violence, and we should all be concerned about preventing it and responding to it when it happens. But granting trans people equality will not make women any less safe. We live in a society where, unfortunately, women’s safety isn’t guaranteed. But trans people are not to blame for this, and often they are at risk themselves. They cannot be made the scapegoats, or the distraction from the real issue. Granting them rights does not give violent men permission to be violent. The reality is that if a man wants to dress up as a woman to access women-only spaces, he’ll do it anyway. No piece of paper will prevent it. Domestic violence agencies and the prison service have vast amounts of experience dealing sensitively with people from a range of backgrounds. Domestic violence and rape crisis centres are concerned primarily with supporting the victims of male violence, and they will always find an appropriate service for anybody who arrives at their door, including trans men and women. They have been doing it for years without asking trans people to show their certificate. They know how to balance the complex needs with sensitivity and professionalism, although it’s clear that trans (and LGB) people require more direct services designed for them, such as the specialist LGBT service that sits alongside a women’s aid centre in Birmingham. Prisons have also been navigating these issues for years. As the Ministry of Justice says in its own guidance, “allowing transgender offenders to experience the system in the gender in which they identify will, in the great majority of cases, represent the most humane and safest way to act. We believe it will also assist successful rehabilitation.” When an offender indicates their intention to transition while in prison, they will receive central specialised support and undergo comprehensive risk assessment. They will be able to live in that gender regardless of where they are placed, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they will automatically be moved to another prison. Violent men cannot announce they are women and automatically get moved to a women’s prison. It doesn’t happen now. The system does not, and will not, facilitate a mass transfer of male prisoners into women’s prisons, despite headlines that suggest otherwise. The tragic deaths of trans women held in male prisons shows us there is more to do to secure the safety of trans prisoners, but those issues won’t be resolved or made worse by changing the administration around gender recognition certificates. Increased awareness might, however, lead to better conversations, better care, better rehabilitation and fewer unnecessary deaths. Trans people face the same risks to their safety as women. Research shows that 44% of trans people avoid certain streets because they don’t feel safe, and in the past year alone, two in five trans people have experienced a hate crime because of their gender identity. If that sounds familiar to any woman reading this, it’s because you have common cause. Women and trans people both exist in a world where they are prevented from accessing true equality because of their gender. We must not be divided by arguments that undermine the equality we so desperately need and deserve. • Ruth Hunt is the chief executive of Stonewall"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/25/uk-interest-rate-rise-likely-as-gdp-beats-forecast-to-grow-by-04","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T18:55:54Z","webTitle":"UK interest rate rise likely as GDP beats forecast to grow by 0.4%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/25/uk-interest-rate-rise-likely-as-gdp-beats-forecast-to-grow-by-04","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/25/uk-interest-rate-rise-likely-as-gdp-beats-forecast-to-grow-by-04","fields":{"headline":"UK interest rate rise likely as GDP beats forecast to grow by 0.4%","bodyText":"British consumers have been put on notice for an interest rate rise next week, as official figures show the economy expanding faster than expected in the three months to September. GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017 following expansion of 0.3% in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast growth of 0.3%. The official figures come as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, with the monetary policy committee likely to take them into account ahead of its decision on 2 November. Threadneedle Street has faced a slew of warnings against raising the cost of borrowing, amid growing concerns over the strength of the economy – which could be allayed by the latest data. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the latest figures “have probably sealed the deal on an interest rate hike next week”. Taken together with the levels of growth recorded in the first half of the year, the latest official figures point to the weakest expansion for the UK economy since 2009. Over the past 12 months, GDP grew at a rate of 1.5%, which is below the rate of expansion recorded in the 12 months to the end of 2016. It also places Britain behind other major nations including the US, which is expected to report growth at an annualised rate of 2.5% in the third quarter when official figures are released on Friday. Italy, France and Germany are also expected to grow faster next year, as Brexit uncertainties weigh on consumer confidence and deter business investment, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Still, with growth beating expectations and failing to show a deterioration on the previous three months, the latest figures should bolster the Bank to act. The pound gained almost 1% against the dollar to $1.3254 following the release of the figures, indicating that City traders expect a rate increase. Britain’s dominant services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the economy’s output, was the driver behind the third-quarter increase, recording growth of 0.4%. Computer programming was the largest contributor to services growth, while there was also a strong performance by motor traders and the retail sector. Manufacturing returned to growth, recording an expansion of 1%, although did not contribute as much to the economy overall because industrial production is much smaller than the services sector. The construction sector contracted for the second quarter in a row, although statisticians said it remained above its pre-financial crisis peak. Business groups have been spooked in recent weeks by deadlock in the Brexit talks and insufficient clarity over a transitional deal. This could discourage firms from investing in their businesses or raising workers’ wages, spelling further trouble for the economy. While the latest GDP figures will likely bring them some comfort, there could still be storm clouds ahead. Despite the robust performance of the retail and motor trade in the official figures, which account for a three-month period that has now passed, a number of companies in these sectors have issued profit warnings for the future. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: “Despite the modest pick-up in growth in the third quarter, the near-term outlook for the UK economy at least still looks challenging.” The official figures show the economy growing at a slower rate than in 2016, with weaker consumer spending due to higher inflation and sluggish earnings growth for squeezed households. That has led the service sector to record growth of about one- or two-tenths slower this year. Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank, said: “All in all, it appears that the economy is running around 0.5% per year more slowly than prior to the EU referendum.” The latest figures were seized upon by Labour to criticise the government’s policy on the economy, ahead of the budget next month. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the figures “confirm the impact that seven wasted years of Tory economic policy have had on working households”. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: “We have a successful and resilient economy which is supporting a record number of people in employment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/02/premier-league-clubs-all-time-top-goalscorers-sergio-aguero","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-02T10:46:49Z","webTitle":"Who are the Premier League clubs' all-time top goalscorers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/02/premier-league-clubs-all-time-top-goalscorers-sergio-aguero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/02/premier-league-clubs-all-time-top-goalscorers-sergio-aguero","fields":{"headline":"Who are the Premier League clubs' all-time top goalscorers?","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/nov/10/jordan-vivienne-westwood-sex-shop-photo","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T15:30:22Z","webTitle":"Jordan poses at Vivienne Westwood’s SEX shop: ‘I’m not sure why I lifted my top, but it felt right’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/10/jordan-vivienne-westwood-sex-shop-photo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/10/jordan-vivienne-westwood-sex-shop-photo","fields":{"headline":"Jordan poses at Vivienne Westwood’s Sex shop: ‘I’m not sure why I lifted my top, but it felt right’","bodyText":"In 1976, punk was exploding across London. I was working at Sex, the Kings Road boutique owned by Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, where this picture was taken. Chrissie Hynde, Sid Vicious and Glen Matlock all had jobs there at different times; John Lydon auditioned for the Sex Pistols by singing along to the shop’s jukebox. In my first week, two of the New York Dolls came in for a browse. It was my dream job. Since I was 13, I’d been pushing the limits of how I looked. I wanted to turn myself into a work of art. I started going by the name Jordan, after a character in The Great Gatsby, and would search my home town, Seaford, and nearby Brighton for vintage clothes to transform with studs, rips, vinyl patches and ballerina accessories. At 14, I was excluded from school for having a pink mohawk. At 16, I was in the front row of a David Bowie concert when he walked over and asked if he could have my earrings. I said no. I liked Bowie, but I liked the earrings more. At Sex, I’d wear net tops, rubber skirts, stilettos. When I started, I was still commuting from Seaford; British Rail put me in first class because other passengers complained about my clothes. I’d not been working there long when this shot was taken; it was for a magazine article about risque shops. The photographer only came to get some interior images, but the six of us in this shot happened to be there and I suppose we took over. It was spontaneous. What I’m wearing – the racoon makeup, the PVC skirt – was what I’d turned up in that day. Vivienne was insistent the pictures should capture some spirit. Punk was about inspiring people to rip up rules and push boundaries. That’s what we were trying to convey. I’m not sure why I lifted my top, but it felt right, and still does. There’s nothing sexual about it. It’s empowering: a young woman who is comfortable in her own skin. After, I went back to serving customers. It was all fairly matter-of-fact. Not long after, the Sex Pistols made their TV debut, and Malcolm, who managed them, asked me to go along and get on stage. He said I’d add weight to their look. It was fun and I started doing it at a few of their gigs. After that, I’d occasionally end up in the tabloids as a face of punk. It wasn’t something I looked for, but I never minded. I managed Adam and the Ants for a while and starred in the cult films Sebastiane and Jubilee. People have since said that seeing me gave them the courage to dress differently. That was never my intention, but it makes me very proud. I still get teenagers saying it to me today. I tell them: be inspired by others, but always be yourself. I left London and Sex – by then called World’s End – in 1984. I was 28 and a little disillusioned. There was terrible sexism in the music industry, which I had no desire to be part of any more. It felt the right time to move on. But I never stopped believing in the ethos of punk. Those years showed me, if you just have the courage, you can be anyone you want to be – I still believe that as much as I did in 1976. In that way, I’m the same person today as that 20-year-old in the picture. • Jordan is In Conversation today at the Louder Than Words music and literary festival, Manchester, which ends tomorrow.

About 20 teenage refugees from countries including Syria, Iraq, Eritrea and Sudan were hosted by the bishop of Salisbury in parliament on Tuesday. Many described how they had begun to learn English and restart their education. They presented a plaque to Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who campaigned for the amendment last year that prompted the government to commit to bringing lone children from camps in Europe to the UK. Ishmael, 18, from Syria, said he was living with a north London foster family and had started university. “We wanted to come to say thank you to the British parliament and everyone. We have a new life – we lost our country and we lost everything. The British government gave us a home when no one else would,” he said. “It’s our duty now, in our new country, to be part of the British community and help build it together. I believe my country is Britain now. Nothing in the world can change that. The country who kills their own sons is not a country. This country welcomes and takes in the others.” Lord Dubs, who came to the UK as a child on the Kindertransport, said he hoped the plaque would be placed next to one in the Palace of Westminster’s central lobby, which was laid to honour parliament’s decision in 1938 to rescue children from Nazi Europe. The new plaque reads: “We thank the British people and parliament for giving us peace. We found a beautiful life in the UK, so different to the life we fled. We were suffering, but now we are safe.” Though many of the teenagers said they were looking forward to building lives in the UK, others said they faced an uncertain future. Farhad, an 18-year-old Afghan refugee, said he had been told he would be returned to Kabul. “I left my country because when I was 15 I had two choices, either join Daesh [Islamic State] or the Taliban, or leave,” he said. “My mother and I decided I had to leave. I didn’t want to go and fight.” Farhad spent almost a year on the move from his home country across Europe, eventually spending six months in the Calais refugee camp. “It was a really, really bad situation and very dangerous. In my country, we don’t have anything,” he said, pausing several times during his speech to MPs because he was overwhelmed with emotion. “In Calais it was the winter. We had no blankets, nothing to eat, trying every night to get in lorries and get to this country. Now I have two years here, but then I have to return to Kabul. They say it is safe, but it’s a war zone. I don’t know what to do.” Others said they hoped to be reunited with family who were still in camps in Europe. Tekle, from Eritrea, asked MPs to help bring his 14-year-old brother, who he said was still sleeping rough in Calais. “I want to say thank you for helping us. My brother is still in Calais and I really want to ask for the opportunity to bring him here, to have the opportunity I had. I was struggling here, but I have had help provided for me, I was able to integrate, learn English. I want him to have the same opportunity as me.” Beth Gardiner-Smith, a senior campaigns organiser for Safe Passage, a refugee rights organisation, said the charity feared there was “no longer a sense of urgency about what is still a crisis”. Since the Calais camp was demolished last year, many refugees are still sleeping rough in the woods and about 280 local authority places offered for refugee children remained unfilled, Gardiner-Smith said. “We’re talking about vulnerable young people who are scared and losing faith in a system that is legal and instead risking their lives attempting dangerous routes,” she said. Josie Naughton, the founder of Help Refugees, which is assisting lone children sleeping rough near the French port, said many were at the mercy of traffickers. “We are here today to demand that, at the very least, all 480 places are filled before the end of the year, to protect at least some of the children of Calais from freezing temperatures this Christmas,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/25/facebook-orwellian-journalists-democracy-guatemala-slovakia","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T13:46:47Z","webTitle":"'Downright Orwellian': journalists decry Facebook experiment's impact on democracy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/25/facebook-orwellian-journalists-democracy-guatemala-slovakia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/25/facebook-orwellian-journalists-democracy-guatemala-slovakia","fields":{"headline":"'Downright Orwellian': journalists decry Facebook experiment's impact on democracy","bodyText":"Facebook has been criticised for the worrying impact on democracy of its “downright Orwellian” decision to run an experiment seeing professional media removed from the main news feed in six countries. The experiment, which began 19 October and is still ongoing, involves limiting the core element of Facebook’s social network to only personal posts and paid adverts. So-called public posts, such as those from media organisation Facebook pages, are being moved to a separate “explore” feed timeline. As a result, media organisations in the six countries containing 1% of the world’s population – Sri Lanka, Guatemala, Bolivia, Cambodia, Serbia and Slovakia – have had one of their most important publishing platforms removed overnight. “The Facebook explore tab killed 66% of our traffic. Just destroyed it … years of really hard work were just swept away,” says Dina Fernandez, a journalist and member of the editorial board at Guatemalan news site Soy502. “It has been catastrophic, and I am very, very worried.” In Slovakia, data from Facebook-owned analytics site CrowdTangle shows that “interactions” – engagement such as likes, shares and comments – fell by 60% overnight for the Facebook pages of a broad selection of the country’s media Facebook pages. Filip Struhárik, a Slovakian journalist with news site Denník N, says the situation has since worsened, falling by a further 5%. “Lower reach can be a problem for smaller publishers, citizens’ initiatives, small NGOs,” Struhárik said. “They can’t afford to pay for distribution on Facebook by boosting posts – and they don’t have infrastructure to reach people other ways.” Struhárik thinks his employer will survive the change. Denník N has subscription revenue, which means it doesn’t rely on the vast traffic that Facebook can drive for advertising income, and ensures that its most dedicated readers go straight to its homepage for their news. But Fernandez, in Guatemala, is much more concerned. Even if Facebook reversed the change today, she says, “I really don’t know how long it will take to recover. If they reverse it fast enough it will be less difficult. If they take a long time, we might not be around.” Soy502 is a new site in an unstable democracy where journalists and civil society groups already face an uphill battle to be heard. “We currently have a smear campaign that is targeting journalists, which is really vicious, fuelled by interest groups who are against the anti-corruption drive in our country,” she says. “We are regarded in the region as a success story on new media for the digital age. This can destroy us.” The explore feed Moving media content to the explore feed, a secondary section of the site that is rolling out worldwide, means users who really want to see posts from sites they follow have to click over to look for them – if they can find them. “I don’t know what the criteria used to show news is. I see a lot of junk in the feed,” says Fernandez. “At least with past algorithms you had an idea of what would show up. With these, it’s completely strange.” Fernandez shared examples of the sort of posts filling the explore feed: clips of wrestling and reality TV shows from pages like “Filosóraptor” and “Cabronazi” (illustrated with a picture of Adolf Hitler in a pink uniform), but few pieces of content from the pages she and her colleagues had chosen to follow. “My timeline is showing me very little local news.” In Slovakia memes and gifs are the better end of the spectrum. “My explore feed looks quite normal, but a few people told me that they see distinct content here – old jokes, alt-right pages, posts by non-standard politicians,” said Struhárik. “We have regional elections in two weeks, and a lot of members of the fascist party are candidates, so it’s not a good time to hide posts of serious news and show people a strange cocktail of random popular posts.” Where there are losers, there are winners. Jim Anderson, the chief executive of Facebook mega-publisher SocialFlow, says “millions of publishers of all shapes and sizes have pages on Facebook, so there may well be someone out there who benefits. “In general, publishers’ concern is that the news feed is the primary Facebook experience for most users. Getting two billion people into the habit of consuming content in a new place is a tall order.” ‘It’s like we don’t really matter, isn’t it?’ Facebook has long tested sweeping changes to its product on subsections of its user base. When it wanted to roll out a new stories feature, for instance, it did so in Ireland first; when it wanted to trial a new camera app, it did so in Brazil; when it wanted to test adverts in Messenger, Australia was the subject. But in this case, the standard practice of focusing on smaller, less developed countries that matter less to the company’s bottom line means that the nations which have been hit are those with the most riding on a stable media ecosystem. “Independent media in my country is vital to building a new democracy and fighting corruption,” says Otto Angel, a broadcast journalist in Guatemala. “Right now, we use Facebook Live to broadcast judicial hearings in corruption cases. With this ‘catastrophe’, we lose around 57% of clicks a day. “If I could speak with some officer of Facebook, I will ask if they can take back this project,” Angel said. Fernandez accused Facebook of simply not caring what happened to its test subjects. “It’s like it took sites in emerging markets where we don’t really matter. We at Soy502 worked really hard to become a viable, respectable news site four years ago, and it all can be destroyed right away.” In a statement released Monday, Facebook’s head of news feed, Adam Mosseri, said that the company “currently” had no plans to roll the test out further. But he added the purpose of the test was to see whether Facebook users prefer the site if “personal” and “public” posts are separated. If the results are positive, and Facebook does find that the metrics it seeks to optimise are improved by the experiment, then its plans could well change. For those who rely on Facebook to campaign politically, share breaking news, or keep up to date with the world, that might be a concerning thought. “I’m worried about the impact of Facebook on democracy,” said Fernandez. “One company in particular has a gigantic control on the flow of information worldwide. This alone should be worrisome. It’s downright Orwellian.” Google and Facebook under pressure after helping anti-refugee campaign"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/25/electric-cars-emit-50-less-greenhouse-gas-than-diesel-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T12:12:26Z","webTitle":"Electric cars emit 50% less greenhouse gas than diesel, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/25/electric-cars-emit-50-less-greenhouse-gas-than-diesel-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/25/electric-cars-emit-50-less-greenhouse-gas-than-diesel-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Electric cars emit 50% less greenhouse gas than diesel, study finds","bodyText":"Electric cars emit significantly less greenhouse gases over their lifetimes than diesel engines even when they are powered by the most carbon intensive energy, a new report has found. In Poland, which uses high volumes of coal, electric vehicles produced a quarter less emissions than diesels when put through a full lifecycle modelling study by Belgium’s VUB University. CO2 reductions on Europe’s cleanest grid in Sweden were a remarkable 85%, falling to around one half for countries such as the UK. “On average, electric vehicles will emit half the CO2 emissions of a diesel car by 2030, including the manufacturing emissions,” said Yoann Le Petit, a spokesman for the T&amp;E think tank, which commissioned the study. “We’ve been facing a lot of fake news in the past year about electrification put out by the fuel industry but in this study you can see that even in Poland today it is more beneficial to the climate to drive an electric vehicle than a diesel.” The new study uses an EU estimate of Poland’s emissions – at 650gCO2/kWh – which is significantly lower than calculations by the European commission’s Joint Research Centre science wing last year. But its findings will likely be welcomed in Brussels, where a new emissions standard for 2030 is set to be unveiled in November, along with some potentially more radical proposals. Speaking in the European parliament this month, the EU’s climate commissioner, Miguel Canete, said: “One option we’re looking at is a mandate to ensure a minimum share of low – for manufacturers it could be zero – emitting vehicles.” Today, just 1.7% of new vehicles sold in Europe are electric, and some EU officials question whether Europe has access to enough lithium to create a 5-10% market share for electric cars anytime soon. Its capacity to scale up construction of battery plants may also be in doubt. “You can’t have a massive explosion of electric cars as there’s no plants here to build the batteries,” one EU source said. “In any case, when you take into account the emissions from battery manufacture and electricity supply, their GHG emissions are not so attractive. The VUB study says that while the supply of critical metals – lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite – and rare earths would have to be closely monitored and diversified, it should not constrain the clean transport transition. As battery technology improves and more renewables enter the electricity grid, emissions from battery production itself could be cut by 65%, the study found."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/25/scott-brown-us-ambassador-to-new-zealand-investigated-over-inappropriate-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T09:11:56Z","webTitle":"Scott Brown: US ambassador to New Zealand investigated over inappropriate comments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/scott-brown-us-ambassador-to-new-zealand-investigated-over-inappropriate-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/25/scott-brown-us-ambassador-to-new-zealand-investigated-over-inappropriate-comments","fields":{"headline":"Scott Brown: US ambassador to New Zealand investigated over inappropriate comments","bodyText":"The US ambassador to New Zealand Scott Brown has admitted he has been investigated over allegations he made inappropriate comments on his inaugural trip to Samoa, of which he is also the US representative. Brown told New Zealand media on Wednesday he wanted to address “innuendo and rumour” about his visit to Samoa in July to celebrate 50 years of the peace corps in the country. Brown – speaking with his wife, Gail Huff, by his side – confirmed he was the subject of an official administration inquiry by the US state department, which sent investigators to Wellington to look into what took place on the trip. Brown said the official complaints related to comments he had made at a party in the Samoan capital, Apia, where he told attendees they looked “beautiful” and could make hundreds of dollars working in the hospitality industry in the US. Brown and Huff said they had “no idea” the comments would be regarded as offensive. “I was told by my people that you’re not Scott Brown from New Hampshire any more, you’re an ambassador, and you have to be culturally aware of different cultures and sensitivities,” Brown said. “We are in a different culture: even though we all speak English, sometimes when we say one thing it means the complete different thing.” Brown went on to say “politics is a blood sport” and there were a lot of people at the event who did not like US president Donald Trump. Brown was Trump’s first ambassadorial appointment after he took office. Huff said the “takeaway” from the incident was: “We are going to be very, very careful about what we say and how it’s perceived.” The Guardian understands that complaints against Brown came from two serving female members of the peace corps. The Guardian first contacted the US state department in Washington, the US embassy in Wellington and the US high commission in Samoa in August, requesting details of the ambassador’s trip to Samoa and comment on the complaints. All requests have gone unanswered.

On Monday the Welsh government announced plans to follow the lead set by Scotland in 2012 for a minimum unit price of alcohol, although it has yet to be introduced north of the border because of legal challenges. Ministers in Westminster have defied calls to embrace the policy, citing a lack of evidence, but are facing fresh pressure to change tack. In a letter to the Guardian, 50 signatories, including the Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston and representatives of bodies including Alcohol Health Alliance UK, the British Medical Association and the Royal Society of Public Health, wrote: “Minimum unit pricing is a highly effective tool to reduce the number of deaths related to alcohol, crime and workplace absence. “The Welsh government continues to demonstrate its firm commitment to tackle the problem of cheap alcohol and the devastating effect this has on our communities, especially its most vulnerable members.” It added: “With alcohol misuse costing £21bn-52bn per year, the UK government must now follow Wales and Scotland by implementing a policy that will save lives, relieve pressure on our NHS and fulfil its commitment to even out life chances.” The letter, also signed by representatives of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the British Liver Trust and the UK Health Forum, said it was unacceptable that three litres of white cider, containing the equivalent alcohol of 22 shots of vodka, can be bought for just £3.49. It stated that the legislation would not impact prices in pubs but would target “pocket money-priced alcohol”. In 2014, research on the impact of introducing a 50p minimum unit price (the level set by Scotland) in Wales estimated there would be 53 fewer deaths and 1,400 fewer hospital admissions in Wales each year, saving the NHS more than £130m over 20 years. The Welsh government has not stipulated its minimum unit price but the public health minister, Rebecca Evans, said: “There is a very clear and direct link between levels of excessive drinking and the availability of cheap alcohol.” The UK government has previously resisted calls to introduce minimum unit pricing for alcohol despite its health advisers throwing their weight behind the policy. In a review commissioned by the government, published last year, Public Health England found that drink was the biggest killer of people aged between 15 and 49 in England, accounted for 167,000 years of lost productivity each year and was a factor in more than 200 illnesses. The coalition government pledged in March 2012 to bring in minimum pricing but made a U-turn in July 2013 after intense lobbying by the alcohol industry. The Scotch Whisky Association has challenged the Scottish legislation, arguing it is in breach of EU law because it restricts free trade and is anti-competitive. The supreme court is expected to give its judgment within the next few weeks, in the latest stage of the long-running legal battle. A government spokesman said: “Minimum unit pricing in England and Wales remains under review pending the outcome of the legal case between the Scottish government and the Scotch Whisky Association, and any subsequent introduction in Scotland. “The UK government will assess the legislative competence of any Welsh government legislation that is introduced, as is standard practice with all Welsh assembly bills.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/25/bad-rabbit-game-of-thrones-ransomware-europe-notpetya-bitcoin-decryption-key","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T10:06:46Z","webTitle":"Bad Rabbit: Game of Thrones-referencing ransomware hits Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/25/bad-rabbit-game-of-thrones-ransomware-europe-notpetya-bitcoin-decryption-key","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/25/bad-rabbit-game-of-thrones-ransomware-europe-notpetya-bitcoin-decryption-key","fields":{"headline":"Bad Rabbit: Game of Thrones-referencing ransomware hits Europe","bodyText":"A major ransomware attack is hitting computers in Russia and Ukraine, bearing similarities to the NotPetya outbreak that caused billions of pounds of damage in June. The self-titled “Bad Rabbit” malware encrypts data on infected machines before demanding a payment of 0.05 bitcoin (£250) for the decryption key. The ransom demand is phrased similarly to that of June’s outbreak, and researchers at Russian security firm Kaspersky say that the malware uses “methods similar to those used” during the NotPetya attack. Among the affected organisations are Kiev’s metro system, Russian media organisation Interfax and Odessa airport. Interfax was forced to publish to its Facebook page during the outage, since its servers were taken offline for a number of hours. Unusually, the malware’s code is peppered with pop culture references including the names of two dragons from Game of Thrones and the character Gray Worm used as names for scheduled tasks. A list of passwords that the malware tries while attempting to spread also includes “love”, “sex”, “god” and “secret”, which were dubbed the “four most common passwords” by the 1995 movie Hackers. In fact, the four most common passwords are 123456, 123456789, qwerty, and 12345678. “Our observations suggest that this been a targeted attack against corporate networks,” Kaspersky’s researchers said, again suggesting a link between this outbreak and June’s. The NotPetya outbreak began through the release of a compromised version of a popular Ukrainian accounting program, spreading automatically throughout corporate networks. The strongest link between the two attacks is based on the web servers which were used to distribute the initial software. Kaspersky researcher Costin Raiu told Forbes magazine that a network of hacked sites initially linked to NotPetya in July was now being used to host secondary distribution channels for Bad Rabbit. But the two attacks contain a number of notable differences, as well. Where NotPetya was targeted at Ukraine, Bad Rabbit appears to have primarily hit Russian businesses. It was initially seeded through a fake Adobe Flash update placed on at least three hacked Russian media outlets, and from that initial foothold has spread through Russia and Ukraine, as well as other eastern European countries including Poland and Bulgaria. The attack is also different from NotPetya in its mode of distribution. The fake Adobe Flash update which initially installs it doesn’t use any software exploits to run, instead relying on old-fashioned trickery to convince a user to open it themselves. Also, once installed, the software doesn’t use the famous EternalBlue exploit, believed to have been developed by the NSA before being stolen by a hacking group known as The Shadow Brokers, to spread within corporate networks. That decision may have limited the dispersal of the outbreak. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two is that Bad Rabbit does not appear to be a “wiper”, as was suspected of NotPetya. That malware was basically impossible to remove, even for users who attempted to actually pay the ransom, leading to suspicions it had been created more to cause damage and destruction than raise revenue for its developers. Bad Rabbit, by contrast, reportedly does decrypt the hard drive upon entry of the correct password. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre said in a statement, “We are aware of a cyber incident affecting a number of countries around the world. The NCSC has not received any reports that the UK has been affected by this latest malware attack. We are monitoring the situation and working with our partners to better understand the threat.” Carl Leonard, a principal analyst at Forcepoint, said: “We will continue to see massive attacks with economic, employee and public safety ramifications. And the methods will continue to evolve, including the evasive methods to hide their activity as well as their true intent. “The trick will be to better understand the human points in these attacks. The intent or motivations of the attackers can range broadly including financial gain, revenge, political or hacktivism. Understanding these intentions can help shape our security strategies.” Initially, few security products were capable of stopping the outbreak: a sample of the malware uploaded to analysis service VirusTotal showed just four products correctly flagging it as malicious as of 4:30pm on Tuesday, including ones made by Kaspersky and Symantec. By then, the outbreak was well and truly underway. As of Wednesday morning, almost two thirds of updated security products correctly identify the malware. Users without working antivirus protection can also reportedly protect themselves with a “vaccine” by creating a file on their computer before the malware does.

However, if you take a closer look there are several emerging names that could well shape the foundations of the team for many years to come. Herein lies one of the hottest debates in Australian cricket at the moment – the conundrum of potential versus performance in selection. Ed Cowan’s recent non-selection for NSW in the opening round of the Sheffield Shield, after being the leading run-scorer last year, caused a few heated discussions around the water cooler. And as the public becomes more aware of the Women’s National Cricket League landscape and the performances of the Australian Women’s team, these discussions will become more commonplace for the Southern Stars too. When the 1997 Australian team won the World Cup in India, Michelle Gozsko was the only teenager in the squad and there was no other player under the age of 23. Fast forward 20 years and this side has Lauren Cheatle and Belinda Vakarewa still to see in their third decade joining Ash Gardner, Tahlia McGrath, Beth Mooney and Amanda Wellington in the Under-23 age group – all with bucket loads of potential, and, as we saw on Thursday, performances to match. So often in cricket selection the word balance is used to ensure the right team enters the field to take on the opposition. Do we have the right number of batters, the right number and mix of pace and spin bowlers? The balance of senior and junior players is also a critical factor, for both the long-term planning and transition of players as well as the giving younger players time to settle in and find their feet. In season one of the Women’s Big Bash League, Adam Gilchrist waxed lyrical about the quality and control of Adelaide Strikers leg-spinner Amanda Wellington. Just 12 months later Wellington found herself in the green and gold. Her parents and boyfriend had driven non-stop form Adelaide to Coffs Harbour to see her debut with good friend Tahlia McGrath. The two batted together for some important late-order runs in the first innings before Wellington took a wicket with her very first ball of international cricket; the dream start. Not just any wicket, either, but that of South Africa’s leading run scorer Mignon du Preez. A fractured finger kept her out of much of the recent World Cup where fellow leg-spinner Kristen Beams became Australia’s leading wicket-taker with 12 dismissals. Wellington’s subsequent selection in the first Ashes ODI was in many ways testament to how highly she is regarded. Her 10-over spell was probably the best no-wicket haul you’ll see in quite some time, with numerous big, turning leg breaks beating the world’s best batters, which in turn created opportunities at the other end. Ready and waiting from the other end was spin partner and fellow young gun Ash Gardner, who is another bowler full of aggression with great ball revolutions. Gardner’s desire to be involved in the game at all times was evident with her game-changing 27 off just 18 deliveries, which wrestled momentum back in Australia’s favour during the successful run chase. Likewise, her three-wicket haul, which included England’s two best batters in Sarah Taylor and Nat Sciver, was a significant reason England fell well short of a par score total. Having broken onto the WBBL scene as one of the competition’s and Sydney Sixers’ most destructive batters, Gardner finds herself in the Australian line up as part of the bowling unit first and foremost. On the back of Sunday’s heroics, Gardner said she enjoyed her “ruthless” tag, and is “definitely a get out there and do, get the job done player”. Gardner’s desire to be out in the middle, confidence in her own ability under immense pressure, and calmness to process the situation and produce the right delivery or stroke more often than not are traits any sports psychologist would be keen to extract and implant into athletes struggling to transition from national to international level. This is all credit to a young player who has said that “overcoming nerves has been the biggest challenge coming into the Australian setup”. In Wellington and Gardner, Australia has two 20-year-olds who only debuted this year and are already creating headaches for the World Cup winners. Game two of the Ashes is not “do or die” for England, however another Aussie win will make their goal of attaining nine points and the Ashes tough indeed. Tougher again will be the fact they now have to plan and execute as much against Australia’s junior players as they do the senior ones. The player in me wants to say to those getting excited about the sextet of young Australian players: give them time to adjust, to settle into the intensity of international cricket – don’t expect too much too soon. But the unashamed cricket lover in me wants to scream from the top of the Big Banana in Coffs Harbour: get down on Thursday and Sunday and settle in for two days of sporting theatre; in 20 years time you may well be saying: “I was there when they started their long and illustrious careers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/25/what-does-a-sexist-google-engineer-teach-us-about-women-in-science","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"What does a sexist google engineer teach us about women in science? | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/25/what-does-a-sexist-google-engineer-teach-us-about-women-in-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/25/what-does-a-sexist-google-engineer-teach-us-about-women-in-science","fields":{"headline":"What does a sexist Google engineer teach us about women in science?","bodyText":"What does a sexist Google engineer teach us about women in science? Nothing. That’s the short answer, but it deserves some commentary. In early August, a young Google computer engineer made lots of news in the US when he penned a manifesto that many described as sexist and which led to his firing. The memo was written as a backlash against efforts to improve diversity in the workplace. However, the arguments articulated by the manifesto were rightly described as offensive by Google executives. The explosive part in the memo involved comments about how biological differences explain the paucity of women in technology and leadership fields. While there are certainly both physical and mental differences between men and women, the comments about both genders are, in my opinion, misguided and offensive. This article is not going to focus much on the content of this so-called manifesto. It also won’t focus on the author of this document, except to question the basis for how a very young engineer has the experience, training, or education to make such broad-brush generalizations. I mean, has he for instance managed scores of male and female engineers and been able to assess their quality of work and intellectual capacity? I doubt it. Has he studied this in any detail or published on the topic? I doubt it. I found this manifesto so ironic because I give a lot of thought to differences between male and female scientists. I am not an expert in the area, certainly not in evolutionary biology. But I am a Full Professor with many years of instructing both undergraduate and graduate students in engineering. I am often struck by how small the female population is in my discipline (perhaps 20%), yet it is higher in other technical fields (biology, mathematics, chemistry, etc.). I am also impressed by how well female students do in technical courses and degree programs. I note a statistically significant performance gap between male and female students in courses; females consistently outperform their male peers. I also have had the fortune to be a consultant for many different engineering companies from industries such as biomedical, aerospace, manufacturing, clean energy and other fields. In my work, I notice that women team members easily hold their own with male co-workers. I also believe (but I have no evidence) that women think differently than men. In my anecdotal experience, women are able to consider problems from a wider range of perspectives. This perspective has real value to design teams, it encourages companies to pay more for female employees (yes, our female engineering graduates tend to make more than their male counterparts). Diverse teams make effective teams. That includes gender diversity. So, in my 15 or so years as a professor, and in my perhaps 50 consulting positions, I have lived an experience very different from the one this young Google engineer articulated. With all that said, I thought this event provided an excellent opportunity to showcase some female scientists who are either world-known or becoming world-known in the field of climate science. So, here are some short bios of brilliant women climate scientists. Dr. Magdalena Balmaseda Magdalena A. Balmaseda has been working at ECMWF since 1995. She currently leads the Earth System Predictability Section in the Research Department. Dr. Balmaseda has developed her career by helping us understand weather and climate. She has contributed to building bridges between the climate and weather sciences. Her expertise in ocean modelling in general, and in El Niño in particular, greatly contributed to ECMWF’s first steps in seasonal forecasting back in 1995. Now seasonal forecasts are one of the pillars of the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), and the ocean is included in all ECMWF probabilistic forecasting systems, contributing the provision of forecasts of atmospheric conditions from days to months and seasons ahead. Equally important have been her contributions to the role of the ocean in a warming climate. The apparent slowing of the global rise in surface temperature in the first decade of the 21st century – the so-called “hiatus” – had puzzled the scientific community. In 2013 Dr. Balmaseda together with other colleagues demonstrated that a fair amount of energy trapped in the Earth system had actually been absorbed by deep ocean waters. This outcome was only possible thanks to a combination of information from ocean models, atmospheric winds, and ocean observations, using similar combination techniques as those employed for weather forecasting. Dr. Karina von Schuckmann Karina von Schuckmann is an oceanographer working in France at Mercator Ocean. She leads the ocean climate monitoring activities of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, which includes the development of a regular Ocean State Report with more than 100 authors. She is also a lead author of the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special report on ocean and cryosphere. Her research is focused on the ocean’s role in the Earth energy budget. This means she studies how much heat is stored in and how it flows throughout the ocean waters. Her studies particularly highlight the unique importance of measuring the global ocean as its global heat storage is the most fundamental metric defining the status of global climate change and expectations for continued global warming. With this topic she is also playing a leading role on international scientific collaborations under the framework of the World Climate Research Program. Dr. von Schuckmann’s résumé reads like a seasoned superstar’s; she has worked at some of the best research labs in France, the USA, Germany. I was so surprised to find she only recently received her PhD (in 2006). I want to know how she has become a leader in the field so quickly. I guess talent will do that. Her dissertation topic was on ocean climate variability in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Dr. Jessica Conroy Dr Jessica Conroy is a faculty member at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. She holds a dual appointment in the departments of Geology and Plant Biology. Another young and upcoming research scientist, she has been at the forefront of connecting modern climate observations and climate model outputs with long-past climate measurements (paleoclimate data). Her work has helped improve our understanding of past Earth climate. In addition, she has developed long paleoclimate records from regions that are very sensitive to climate change. For instance, remote islands across the tropical Pacific and the Tibetan Plateau. She goes where few scientists have gone to make measurements that even fewer can. Part of her work relies upon lake sediment samples and on the use of stable isotopes (oxygen and hydrogen) to give clues about what past climate was like. Not only does this give information about past temperatures but these data also, perhaps more importantly, tell us what the water cycle was like in the past. She was recently selected as a National Academy of Sciences Kavli Fellow. Dr. Sarah Myhre Dr. Myhre is skilled in climate science as well as climate communication. Her area of research is in paleoceanography (the study of past climate and biology through the oceans). Her research requires her team to gather sediment cores from the seafloor, to analyze the chemical compositions and the shells of creatures that are contained within such cores, or to observe deep sea ecosystem using remotely operated submersibles. Her publications have appeared in some of the most prestigious scientific journals. She may become even better known, however, for her work not only communicating about climate science to the general public but in training other scientists to be communicators. We scientists are often good at talking amongst ourselves, but we are less skilled at explaining why our research is important and how society can use our research to make informed decisions. This is where Dr. Myhre shines. She is a board member of the organization 500 Women Scientists and the Center for Women and Democracy, and is an uncompromising advocate for women’s leadership in science and society. Dr. Rita Colwell World-renowned expert in infectious diseases and health, Dr. Colwell has degrees in bacteriology, genetics, and oceanography; her pioneering use of computational tools and DNA sequencing helped lay the foundation for the bioinformatics revolution. This unique background has allowed her to make connections across these disciplines and enhance our understanding of water availability, disease, safe drinking water, and the effects of climate change on waterborne pathogens. Dr. Colwell has won numerous national and international awards, such as the 2006 National Medal of Science, the 2010 Stockholm Water Prize, and the 2017 International Prize for Biology, and has and been elected to multiple Halls of Fame. She served as the director of the NSF and has served on numerous advisory roles throughout her career. As with some of the other women discussed here, Dr. Colwell prioritizes scientific communication and engagement with the public, particularly children, and expanding participation of minorities and women in the STEM fields. Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies is fortunate to employ Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig. Her technical focus is on climate change impacts – how society will be affected by a changing climate. In addition to her technical research, she has been a tireless service worker in the field, serving as a Coordinating Lead Author on the Fourth IPCC report as well as numerous editing and directorship roles with various climate and adaptation organizations. She also has an appointment at the Center for Climate Systems Research and Columbia University. Perhaps her most current area of research is on climate and crop productivity. She wants to know how agricultural outputs will change as the climate warms and changes to water availability occur. Dr. Jane Lubchenco Dr. Lubchenco is well known as a world leader in the field of environmental science. After decades of innovative research at the intersection of climate change and the ocean, President Obama tapped her to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – the federal agency that keeps the nation’s climate records, produces much of the federal agency climate science, and leads the U.S. National Climate Assessment. She has focused squarely on the intersection between climate change and human well-being, and the opportunities to mitigate and adapt to climate change through smarter coastal and oceanic policies and practices. With a technical record extending back more than four decades, it is challenging to find anyone with a stronger pedigree. She has used her prestige to raise the importance of scientific communication amongst her colleagues. In the past, communicating science to the larger public was an afterthought. Dr. Lubchenco made it a critical measure of one’s career. Most recently, she has issued a new call-to-arms for scientists to become more engaged with society to counter the post-truth mentality, enable citizens and leaders to have confidence in evidence and science and work together to solve climate and other urgent environmental changes. None of these short biographies do the scientists justice, but hopefully they give a sense of how some of our top female scientists are contributing to our understanding of the world in which we live. I know they are making a sexist engineer formally employed at Google look a bit silly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/26/human-rights-watch-says-afp-may-be-needed-on-manus-island-before-closure","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T17:00:42Z","webTitle":"Human Rights Watch says AFP may be needed on Manus Island before closure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/human-rights-watch-says-afp-may-be-needed-on-manus-island-before-closure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/human-rights-watch-says-afp-may-be-needed-on-manus-island-before-closure","fields":{"headline":"Human Rights Watch says AFP may be needed on Manus Island before closure","bodyText":"The Australian government should consider deploying federal police to Manus Island in the lead-up to the closure of the immigration detention centre, Human Rights Watch has said. The organisation recently visited and investigated the situation of 770 men who remained as refugees or asylum seekers after being sent to the Papua New Guinean region by the Australian government. It found escalating violence and tension, including attacks and robberies on the men, and a lack of adequate responses by authorities. Its concerns add to calls by the UNHCR last week that the situation threatened to become a humanitarian emergency. HRW maintained its call for the men to be brought to Australia as the only safe and adequate course of action but said in the meantime AFP officers should be sent to advise and assist local police in preventing crime and ensuring crimes are fully investigated. “The problem is because the police are not taking these attacks seriously we’re trying to think what would be a way to get them a bit more active,” the director of HRW, Elaine Pearson, told the Guardian. “That’s why we thought … with the presence of the AFP in an advisory capacity – as they already do in Port Moresby and other places – the police might take these cases more seriously. “We’re making these recommendations also because we’re concerned the violence will get worse if the centre closes and these men are moved into other housing and accommodation in Lorengau. I think it’s a probability that will happen.” During its investigation, HRW heard of frequent attacks and robberies by armed groups of local men against asylum seekers and refugees. “Human Rights Watch found that groups of local young men, often intoxicated and sometimes armed with sticks, rocks, knives, or screwdrivers, have frequently assaulted and robbed refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island,” it said. There had been at least three serious attacks since June, with the victims needing medical care in Port Moresby or Australia, HRW added. Many refugees and asylum seekers didn’t travel into the nearby town of Lorengau, or travelled in groups, out of fear for their safety. “If you go to the police station they don’t do a proper investigation so we don’t bother to go to the station,” HRW quoted a Rohingya refugee as saying. Two other refugees saids they were robbed by local men, but police arrested them and another refugee instead, for “disturbing our local people” and detaining them for 24 hours without food. “My friend was crying and scared, and then one of the police kicked him in the mouth,” he said. “He fell down and there was lots of blood.” HRW also heard Australian authorities transferred a refugee with psychiatric and mental health conditions to Port Moresby, where the man alleged he was beaten by staff and detained for three weeks in dirty and crowded conditions. “Australia sent refugees and asylum seekers to Manus who may have faced trauma at home but were otherwise healthy,” Pearson said. “Four years later, a significant number are killing themselves and self-harming.” The situation would only worsen as Australian service providers withdrew, HRW said. This week the Guardian reported the healthcare provider IHMS had been contracted by the PNG government to continue treating asylum seekers and refugees beyond 31 October. Pearson said a “two-tiered” health system may add to tensions in the region, which is currently in the midst of a medication shortage along with other parts of PNG. “They should be beefing up those services for everyone but bearing in mind that these refugees and asylum seekers have acute needs and mental health needs,” Pearson said. “There’s been two suicides in recent months. There’s a mental health crisis going on on Manus, which Australia is responsible for. This is not the time for the Australian government to be pulling away.” HRW said it met with 40 asylum seekers and refugees on Manus and in Port Moresby, and interviewed current and former service providers as well as PNG government officials, one of whom allegedly described the settlement process as a “failure”. Of the 770 men remaining on Manus, 600 are still inside the centre and are refusing to leave and take up residence in the East Lorengau alternative accommodation. About 35 have signed settlement papers to remain in PNG but only four have found work and are financially independent. HRW said it was unclear whether the 70 men transferred to Port Moresby for medical care would be returned to Manus once the centre closes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/25/adfs-links-to-vile-facebook-group-shows-backlash-against-progressive-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T07:51:33Z","webTitle":"ADF's links to 'vile' Facebook group show 'backlash against progressive politics'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/25/adfs-links-to-vile-facebook-group-shows-backlash-against-progressive-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/25/adfs-links-to-vile-facebook-group-shows-backlash-against-progressive-politics","fields":{"headline":"ADF's links to 'vile' Facebook group show 'backlash against progressive politics'","bodyText":"A Facebook group featuring jokes about child rape – in which more than 100 current and former Australian defence force personnel allegedly participated – is evidence of a “backlash” against progressive politics in the military, according to veterans. The ADF culture is in the spotlight following the release of evidence showing service personnel were members of a military themed Facebook page called Snafu on which users published jokes and memes about rape, violence against women and child sexual assault. This week the Victims of Abuse in the Australian Defence Force Association released data on what it said was evidence of a “vile and repulsive” culture within the military. The group analysed 8% of the 30,000 Facebook fans of Snafu and said it identified more than 100 active and former members of the military. Secretary and officer Jennifer Jacomb said: “It’s a real issue because what it documents is the ongoing culture of abuse within the ADF.” In a statement the Department of Defence said it had asked Facebook to take the page down and was investigating whether service members had engaged in inappropriate use of social media. However, Jacomb said her group had made government officials aware of the page twice this year. Bridget Clinch, a veteran, said she had seen a cultural shift since joining out of high school in 1997 until leaving the force in 2013 that she said broadly aligned with a change in Australian society. Initially this was for the better, she said. “Maybe it’s a maturity, there seemed to be a better understanding of where we stood in the world then [but] the military is part of our society and culture, and it’s a reflection of it,” she said. But she added: “As there has been this shift in the developed world to the so-called alt-right, anti-political correctness and anti-intellectualism, I guess the military equally runs the risk of allowing those things to become normalised in the service. “It’s really hard to understand just how closed off the military can be at times … You’re around the same people all the time and it’s quite insular so, once that culture seeps in, it’s pretty easy for it to propagate and take hold.” Clinch came out as transgender to her colleagues in the defence force and says the reaction was mixed but overwhelmingly supportive. “In some cases it was pretty extreme, some people were really violently opposed to it, but to be honest they seemed to be the outliers,” she said. The ADF leadership was less accepting and ultimately being trans ended Clinch’s career in the military. Ben Wadham, an associate professor in sociology at Flinders University in Adelaide and a former infantry soldier, agreed, saying there had been a “backlash” against progressive politics in the military since the former army chief David Morrison made his famous 2013 speech telling sexist soldiers “to get out” and “find something else to do”. “More broadly I think we’re going through backlash against progressive politics – you see things like 18C, the rise of Reclaim Australia and those movements,” he said. “The reality is that’s really heavily represented in the military and there’s a strong backlash against Morrison and what he represented.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/25/michaelia-cash-says-her-office-did-not-tip-off-media-before-awu-raids","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T08:52:58Z","webTitle":"Michaelia Cash aide resigns over AWU raid tip-off to media","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/25/michaelia-cash-says-her-office-did-not-tip-off-media-before-awu-raids","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/25/michaelia-cash-says-her-office-did-not-tip-off-media-before-awu-raids","fields":{"headline":"Michaelia Cash aide resigns over AWU raid tip-off to media","bodyText":"A staffer of the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, has resigned after Cash was forced to correct evidence in which she wrongly claimed her office had not tipped off the media before the controversial police raids on the Australian Workers’ Union. Earlier on Wednesday Cash denied that her office had informed journalists of the raid before it was carried out, telling Senate estimates she was not aware of Tuesday’s raid until she saw it unfold on television. Later on Wednesday Buzzfeed reported that journalists from two news outlets, who were not named, said they had been tipped-off by Cash’s office an hour before the raid, in direct contradiction to Cash’s earlier evidence. Asked in estimates whether she stood by her earlier evidence given the story, Cash said she would “not comment on stories from Buzzfeed that I have not yet read but, yes, I stand by my previous evidence and I’ve said it to you on several occasions”. After the dinner break, Cash made a statement revealing that without her knowledge one staff member had received information about a raid “from a media source” which was shared with other outlets. The senior media adviser, David De Garis, came forward and has now resigned. Labor is calling for Cash’s scalp, declaring she must accept responsibility for the actions of her office. But Cash denied she had misled the Senate, and said the conduct of De Garis was unauthorised. The minister said she was unaware her staffer had briefed the media and reiterating her evidence that she found out about the raid on TV. The resignation of the staffer followed mounting political pressure on the government over the conduct of the police raids, with Nick Xenophon having called for an independent inquiry into the leak to the media and Labor characterising the episode as a political witch-hunt. The police raids and the revival of controversy over AWU donations triggered acrimonious exchanges between the major parties throughout Wednesday. After a confrontation in question time Labor frustrations boiled over in Senate estimates hearings with allegations the government was filibustering before an appearance by the Registered Organisations Commission. Controversy over journalists being on-site at the AWU offices before the police raids were carried out began with the Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese contending Cash’s office “was ringing around media organisations ... telling them that [the police raids] were going to occur” – conduct he characterised as “an extraordinary intervention in the process”. A string of Labor frontbenchers lined up from first light on Wednesday to defend the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, and criticise the events of Tuesday afternoon. Opening question time on Wednesday, Shorten asked the prime minister why at least 25 Australian federal police officers were deployed on a raid of the AWU offices to investigate a 10-year-old political donation when the police force lacked resources to investigate serious drug crimes. Malcolm Turnbull then rounded on Shorten, asking was he suggesting that “breaches of the law, breaches of union rules should not be investigated because they’re 10 years old?” “That would be very convenient for the leader of the opposition,” Turnbull said. The prime minister said Labor had launched a political attack on “the integrity of the Australian federal police” and needed to apologise. The deputy Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, asked why “this born-to-rule prime minister was diverting the limited resources of the federal police so that he can attack his political opponents?” Turnbull said he accepted the “snide barb” from Plibersek but pointed out that he had created jobs and businesses before entering parliament, in contrast to “all of those hereditary union princelings opposite”. “Not everybody has a privileged ride to power through a union job,” Turnbull said. Turnbull said the real issue was why the AWU donated $100,000 “of its hardworking members’ union dues” to GetUp – and whether that donation was authorised under union rules. The prime minister was also questioned about whether Cash had tipped the media off in advance and dead-batted, suggesting to the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, that Labor should address the questions to her firsthand. The police raids are associated with an investigation by the Registered Organisations Commission into political donations by the Australian Workers’ Union during the time Shorten led the union, and whether those donations were made in accordance with union rules. Registered Organisations commissioner, Mark Bielecki, told estimates the investigation was not into Shorten, but rather AWU processes. He said the commission had sought documents voluntarily from the union, but they refused. The AWU donated $100,000 to GetUp in 2005 and a total of $130,500 in donations to Labor campaigns at the 2007 election, including $25,000 for then national secretary Bill Shorten’s election in Maribyrnong. The $100,000 donation to GetUp was made up of $50,000 from the AWU national office and $50,000 from the Victorian branch. On Wednesday the AWU national secretary, Daniel Walton, said: “The AWU national executive met to determine and approve the donations to GetUp and the ALP … Those donations were made to further the interests of AWU members. We stood by them then and stand by them today.” In November 2006 the AWU national executive passed a resolution that requests for donations from Labor candidates in the 2007 election “be left in the hands of the national secretary”. Walton said that resolution was sufficient to meet the AWU’s requirement for authorisation of donations and was “in keeping with previous practices”. The Victorian secretary, Ben Davis, said he believed the GetUp donation was “made in accordance with rules and objectives of the AWU”. Walton said the donations were disclosed to the Australian Electoral Commission, producing statements showing the GetUp donations signed by Shorten on 19 January 2007 and then-Victorian secretary Cesar Melhem on in December 2006. Davis said the AWU had “bragged in [its] journal” about supporting GetUp at the time. “It’s a matter of public record,” he said. “The fact that we’d give a donation is hardly a shock, especially to Labor candidates including our [then] national secretary [Bill Shorten].” The Queensland and Victorian branches of the ALP disclosed more than $100,000 in donations from the AWU in 2006-07 and 2007-08. On Wednesday the federal court began hearing an AWU challenge to the validity of Tuesday’s police raids and seeking to quash the Registered Organisations Commission investigation. Guardian Australia understands the AWU’s lawyers intend to argue Cash had no power to refer the matter to the commission for investigation. The court adjourned until Friday after the AFP and the commission agreed not to send or receive information seized in the raid until the case is heard. Speaking outside the court, AWU legal adviser Josh Bornstein, principal of Maurice Blackburn, said the union’s case was that the warrant was “illegal and that the investigation is also unlawful”. He said that 32 police had been deployed to investigate “a debate about internal paperwork of unions”. Earlier, Bornstein said the raids were “an outrageous abuse of power” and the Registered Organisations Commission could have written to the union, or produced a summons, for the documents. “None of these actions were taken,” Bornstein said. “Instead, a highly orchestrated media strategy was implemented so that television cameras arrived before the AFP to capture the raid and thereby seek to paint the union in the worst possible light.” On Wednesday the the Registered Organisation Commission revealed in its 2016-17 annual report it was investigating 10 referrals of the AWU Victorian branch from the trade union royal commission. It said the referrals dealt with “a broad range of possible contraventions, including failing to maintain proper records”. In November 2016 the ROC started an investigation into alleged breaches by the AWU Victoria branch of obligations to keep a register of members and file financial reports that “give a true and fair view of the financial position and performance” of the union. The report states the investigation is estimated to conclude by November 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2017/oct/25/what-is-australias-best-loved-bird-guardian-readers-respond","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T05:07:41Z","webTitle":"What is Australia's best-loved bird?

Guardian readers respond","bodyText":"After New Zealand voted the kea its favourite bird, we asked Guardian readers which Australian bird they love most – and least. With more than 800 species to choose from, we tapped into a wide range of opinion on the subject. One thing is obvious from the comment thread: there’s a lot of avian love out there, and some found it hard to choose a No 1. As our own First Dog on the Moon pointed out, “there are no bad birds”. janusflytrap asked “why are you inciting birdism when they’re all amazing” and there was even this, from breitling1884: Another example of the Guardian and its identity politics. ‘Impressive birds’ But notwithstanding the reservations about singling out winners, many were more than happy to reveal their preference, perennial favourites the sulfur-crested cockatoo and kookaburra featuring heavily. MarrkyD chose “cockatoo, the punk bird”. Alan Baird agreed, describing the cockatoo as “full of character and Australian as buggery”. rastamau5 begged to differ: Surely the best Australian bird has to be the cassowary. Electric-blue, clawed, horned, and six feet tall, no one outside Australia actually believes the cassowary exists. It’s the drop bear of the avian world. And it can disembowel a horse. AndrewMcIntosh preferred lorikeets: “the tie-dye hippies of the skies”. And Greyranga related fondly: Have spent a totally engrossing couple of hours watching (through binoculars) a wedge tail-eagle cruising up and down a ridge line riding thermals and looking for prey. He barely flapped his wings. Impressive birds. MsDWrites recalled: The kookaburra I saw on the poshest street in Newtown, holding someone’s prized koi carp in his beak, whacking the already dead fish on the branch before guzzling it down bit by bit. ‘I’ve got this sorted,’ its expression said. And the Guardian’s own Helen Davidson chose two: The best bird is a Jabiru because they are enormous, majestic dinosaurs with evil Tolkienite faces, who build six-foot-wide nests. The other best bird is the curlew, because it is ridiculous and bases its entire survival on standing motionless whenever it’s near a human, pretending to be a plant. For mattwroberts, it’s the tawny frogmouth: Swift, silent, nocturnal, fugly. Humble but bloody good at its job. Which includes looking like a bit of broken tree. And sounding like a distant bubble jet printer. BobSantamaria’s take was brutally simple: “I love the powerful owl. It eats brushtail possums.” While AshBerger let us in on his dream: I have a fantasy of an alternate reality Australia where the galah is our national symbol and our flag is simply pink and grey. ‘Cane toads of the sky’ But of course we also asked readers to confer the wooden spoon. Which did they consider the worst Australian bird? The Indian mynah, the brush turkey and the ibis all vied for the dubious distinction of being most hated bird: ShaunDogga was unequivocal about the Indian import: Without a doubt, the worst is the common mynah – the cane toads of the sky. Daisy06 called mynahs “flying rats”. Many readers pointed out that the pesky (to some) mynah is different from the noisy miner, which is a native, but that didn’t cut any ice with jeroenspeculaas, who took just as much exception to the native: Yes, there are bad invaders, but our local rogue has the upper hand over even them. Shoot a noisy miner family out of a patch of woodland, and up to 16 other woodland bird species return to live there. This bully boy could outbully Trump, wings down. A lot of readers dislike the long-legged ibis, particularly those that seem to have taken over in inner-city areas. Like many, MorvaHindrance has a nickname for the scavenger: Bin chickens are evil. They pretend they are gentle and friendly, then they take your sandwich from your hand and smack you with a wing in case you consider fighting back. (Others preferred “dump ducks” or “tip turkeys” to describe the ibis.) ‘Soaring above derision’ Despite the pockets of antipathy, if readers’ comments are anything to go by, Australian birds in general are very well-loved, and even the least preferred of the species such as the ibis have their defenders. optimist7 lovingly describes “great flights of ibis on the wing soaring above derision”, and RJHanley asks: Who cares if they like to clean up food scraps and such? Better them doing it than rats and pigeons, surely? Is picking the worst bird then as difficult as picking the best? Perhaps it’s because, as Canadian RonaldOrenstein says: Australia’s birds are second to none."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/25/briton-jamie-harron-dubai-public-indecency","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T23:57:43Z","webTitle":"Briton caught up in Dubai public indecency case 'happy to be home'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/25/briton-jamie-harron-dubai-public-indecency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/25/briton-jamie-harron-dubai-public-indecency","fields":{"headline":"Briton caught up in Dubai public indecency case 'happy to be home'","bodyText":"The British man sentenced to three months in prison after being convicted of public indecency in Dubai has spoken of his relief at returning home. Jamie Harron, 27, from Stirling, touched down at Glasgow airport on a flight from Dubai where he was met by his family and friends. “It feels very good, I’m very happy to be home,” he told reporters. When asked what he would do first when he got home he said: “Get in a good bed, because I’ve been sleeping on my mate’s couch for three and a half months. It’s been a total shambles. It’s just total shock I feel. I can’t believe its been four months.” The electrician had been accused of putting his hand on a man’s hip in the Rock Bottom bar. He said that he only did this to avoid spilling a drink in a crowded bar when he brushed past a man. He was sentenced in absentia to 30 days in prison for failing to appear at court, for making a rude gesture and drinking alcohol. This led to him being imprisoned for five days, before he was bailed and his passport confiscated. After international criticism, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the United Arab Emirates prime minister and ruler of Dubai, intervened personally and exonerated Harron. Harron said he has not ruled out going back to the UAE despite his ordeal. “I would go back through work once everything has been cleared for me,” he said. “I’m not going back in a hurry but I would go back later on. I think I’ve been caught up in a bad situation. I didn’t see light at the end of the tunnel to be honest.” Harron had been working in Afghanistan and was on a two-day stopover in the United Arab Emirates this summer. Radha Stirling, chief executive of the Detained in Dubai advocacy group, thanked Mohammed in a statement. “This was a courageous and honourable decision on the part of Sheikh Mohammed,” she said. “[Although] it highlights the urgent need for judicial reform in the country, it is also a hopeful sign that the United Arab Emirates’ leadership possesses the will and vision to pursue such reforms in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/26/football-transfer-rumours-danny-rose-luke-shaw-swap-manchester-united-tottenham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T08:11:30Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Danny Rose and Luke Shaw to swap clubs?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/26/football-transfer-rumours-danny-rose-luke-shaw-swap-manchester-united-tottenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/26/football-transfer-rumours-danny-rose-luke-shaw-swap-manchester-united-tottenham","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Danny Rose and Luke Shaw to swap clubs?","bodyText":"Why can’t everyone just get along? It’s a question the Rumour Mill ponders on a daily basis, as it surveys the news over its morning mug of bracing custom blend Mountain Morning Organic, to be confronted with one sad story of discord and disharmony, after another, with few being more heart-rending than the apparent frostiness between José Mourinho and Luke Shaw. Previously the world’s most expensive teenager, Shaw is now fourth or fifth choice left-back at Manchester United and suffered his latest humiliation upon being given only four minutes of action in the knockings of a Carabao Cup match his side had already put to bed against Swansea City. Yesterday the Guardian reported that Mourinho is “understood to be unhappy with Shaw’s attitude”, while today the story has moved on with the Times informing that the pair are no longer on speaking terms and Shaw may seek a move elsewhere in January. A known fan of Danny Rose, who has previous in the field of voicing his dissatisfaction with the miserly stipend on which he is forced to scrape by at Tottenham Hotspur, Mourinho may attempt to orchestrate a swap deal both players could find mutually beneficial in January. Tottenham Hotspur are also reported to be monitoring Ajax duo Justin Kluivert and Donny van de Beek. Kluivert, 18, the son of goalscoring Dutch nightclub enthusiast Patrick is something of a chip off the old block and scored two goals in 20 appearances for Ajax last season, but has yet to get off the mark in seven outings in the current campaign. Two years his senior, Van de Beek has almost 50 appearances for the famous Dutch club behind him already. Following on from Wednesday’s big news that Manchester United might be interested in relieving Borussia Dortmund of Marco Reus at the end of the season, Sky Germany have reported that Arsenal are also interested in the midfielder. Reus is currently sidelined with a serious knee injury and is not expected to play again until March. Philippe Coutinho’s on again, off again, on again, off again, on again to Barcelona is off again, according to reports from Spain, who say Andrés Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic don’t want their club to sign the Liverpool midfielder as it would reduce their playing time. Quite how much influence the two players have on Barcelona recruitment policy is open to question, but at least talk of their disquiet has allowed us to fill 77 words worth of space. Having been linked with Sampdoria midfielder Dennis Praet during the summer, Newcastle are expected to move for him again in January. The 23-year-old Belgian playmaker has underwhelmed in his season-and-a-bit with the Serie A side, but Caclio Mercato say Samp won’t countenance selling him until the end of the season, when Newcastle would be able to activate the €20m release clause in his contract."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/26/barclays-bank-boss-defends-strategy-as-share-price-tumbles","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T10:13:50Z","webTitle":"Barclays bank boss defends strategy as share price tumbles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/barclays-bank-boss-defends-strategy-as-share-price-tumbles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/26/barclays-bank-boss-defends-strategy-as-share-price-tumbles","fields":{"headline":"Barclays bank boss defends strategy as share price tumbles","bodyText":"The boss of Barclays has been forced to defend his strategy amid falling profits at the investment banking arm and a tumbling share price. Jes Staley, who is under investigation by City regulators over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower, said at a briefing on the third-quarter results on Thursday that his two-year restructuring of the bank was now complete and he could focus on generating returns to shareholders. Investors were not convinced, with the share price falling more than 7% – the biggest one-day drop since the vote for Brexit in June 2016 – even though the bank reported a 19% rise in nine-month profits to £3.4bn. The focus centred on the 15% fall in profits at Barclays’ international arm – primarily its investment bank. This was driven by lower profits at the bank’s markets business, which trades foreign exchange, bonds and currencies. “The third quarter was clearly a difficult one for our markets business … A lack of volatility in [foreign exchange, bonds and currencies] hit markets revenues hard across the industry and we were no exception to this trend,” Staley said. The bank has reduced the amount set aside for bonuses in the third quarter of the year by 25%. Bankers receive their payouts after the full year. Staley, an American banker who took the top job in December 2015, gave no update on the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank of England and US regulators into attempts to unmask a whistleblower who made allegations about a long-term associate of Staley that he had brought to work at the bank. Staley told investors the bank’s dividend would be reviewed with the full-year results in February. He cut the payout to investors for two years while he implemented his restructuring plan to sell off its African arm and its retail banking outside the UK, which has led to a 60,000-strong fall in headcount during his tenure. “The third quarter of 2017 was particularly significant for Barclays as it was the first for many years in which we have not been in some state of restructuing,” said Staley. Analysts were not convinced. “Barclays investors have already endured a torrid time in 2017, and today’s [statement] offers no relief at all,” said Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec. “Whilst we have been a seller this year, we had thought Barclays would struggle to disappoint [on] low Q3 expectations. It looks like they have succeeded,” analysts at brokers KBW said. The bank, which owns the UK’s biggest credit card company, Barclaycard, has been charged with fraud by the Serious Fraud Office over the way it raised cash during the financial crisis. It is also fighting charges by the Department of Justice in the US over the way it sold mortgage bonds a decade ago. There were no updates on either of these inquiries but the bank announced it had settled a long-running case with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for $105m (£80m). It could have faced a bill of at least $470m for allegedly manipulating power prices in California between 2006 and 2008. Staley said: “Whilstworking to put our remaining conduct issues behind us, we remain focused as a management team, on being in a position to distribute the returns that these plan will generate ... to shareholders.” On his first day at Barclays, Staley bought 2.8m shares at 233p each. Just before he was recruited, the bank’s chairman, John McFarlane, had pledged to double the share price when it was trading at 260p. The shares are now trading at 183p – below the value of the bank’s assets, which are worth around 280p a share. Staley said on Thursday that his aim was to generate enough profits to propel the banks share price above that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/26/kenyans-election-rerun-contested-kenyatta-odinga","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T13:55:48Z","webTitle":"Kenyan president says he is willing to negotiate after election boycott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/kenyans-election-rerun-contested-kenyatta-odinga","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/26/kenyans-election-rerun-contested-kenyatta-odinga","fields":{"headline":"Kenyan president says he is willing to negotiate after election boycott","bodyText":"President Uhuru Kenyatta has raised the prospect of negotiations with his opponent as millions of Kenyans voted in a contentious election rerun marred by a widely observed boycott and sporadic violence. Four people died as opposition supporters and police clashed outside polling stations, forcing election officials to postpone voting in parts of the country until Saturday. The rerun is the latest twist in a long and increasingly chaotic political saga, which has polarised the country, and looks unlikely to end soon. Before voting began, Raila Odinga, the opposition leader, called on supporters to stay at home, leaving polling stations in his strongholds almost empty, in stark contrast to the first election, which the supreme court annulled last month. Voting was brisk in areas loyal to Kenyatta, though even here turnout appeared to be significantly lower than for the previous election in August. “It is important to vote because the current problems are not helpful and we should finish this thing and go back to the routine,” said Peter Mwanda, a 32-year-old businessman, after voting in Roysambu, a neighbourhood in eastern Nairobi. Kenyatta held out the prospect of negotiations with Odinga after casting his own vote. “As a responsible leader you must reach out and that is my intention,” the 55-year-old, who has been in power since 2013, told reporters. Observers pointed out, however, that Kenyatta used similar words after his victory in the August polls but no meaningful dialogue between the rivals had followed. One man was shot dead and three others injured during protests in Odinga’s western stronghold of Kisumu. Another was killed in the Mathare slum in the capital, Nairobi, where scattered clashes continued into the early evening. Senior police officers said the vote had passed off smoothly in most of the country and warned that any attempt to interfere with the transport of ballot papers to counting stations would be met by “stern action”. In Nairobi’s Kibera slum, police fired teargas and live rounds into the air as crowds of youthful opposition supporters threw rocks and tried to storm a polling station at a primary school. Two people were injured with suspected bullet wounds. “It is a sham election ... We will keep fighting until we have Raila as president,” said Brighton, a 21-year-old Kibera resident. Inside the primary school, officials waited for ballot papers – which finally arrived under heavy police guard five hours late. “The environment is not welcoming. There is no one willing to come and vote. The staff too are a bit scared to be here because we have been warned that people will come and identify us and there will be problems,” said the presiding officer, a local teacher who requested anonymity for security reasons. About a quarter of the 180 electoral officials due to work in Kibera have resigned after intimidation in recent days, several said. As rocks hammered on the school’s tin roof, shots rang out and teargas filled the air, a second official said her “husband, father, son and brother” were among the protesters. “These are our homes, our families ... whoever is being attacked [by police] out there is being attacked in here,” she said. Not all local residents shared such sentiments, underlining the deep divisions exposed by the political crisis. Abdul Majiid, a 64-year-old retired machine operator, said he had voted for Kenyatta at the Social Grounds polling station in Kibera. “I had no problems and I had no worries. It is my right as per the constitution. I voted for the president. Progress in Kenya is very good. We have new railways, new roads, lots of things,” he said. The electoral commission said voting would be delayed until Saturday in Kisumu, Migori, Siaya and Homa Bay, where a third person died on Thursday, due to “security challenges”. The rerun election is the latest act of a political drama that began when the supreme court overturned Kenyatta’s victory in the election on 8 August. The president won the poll by nine points but judges cited irregularities and mismanagement by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The ruling, unprecedented in Africa, was hailed as a victory for democracy on the continent. Odinga then withdrew from the rerun, citing fears the poll would be marred by the same flaws that saw the August vote overturned. The opposition boycott is likely to tarnish the credibility of Kenyatta’s victory and the result will inevitably face further legal challenges, analysts say. There had been widespread fears that logistical and technological problems would cripple the poll. However, officials said they were fully prepared for the vote and their teams had all the necessary equipment. “There have been no problems. Everything has been smooth,” said Peter Karioke, presiding officer at the Kiboro primary school in Mathare, Nairobi. Kenya’s supreme court said on Wednesday it could not consider a petition to postpone the controversial vote because not enough justices were available to form a quorum. Hours later, Odinga called for a campaign of civil disobedience and resistance, telling several thousand supporters in the centre of Nairobi that the polls amounted to a coup d’etat by Kenyatta. Odinga’s claims of vote rigging after his defeat in 2007 elections prompted rioting and retaliation by security forces which tipped the country into its worst crisis for decades. About 1,200 people were killed in the ethnic violence that followed. Many Kenyans say the potential for violence has been reduced, because the country has learned from its earlier traumatic experiences. Though 70 people are thought to have been killed in violence since the August poll, widespread clashes have been avoided."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/05/a-year-ago-trump-spoke-of-binding-the-nations-wounds-so-what-happened-next","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-05T05:00:09Z","webTitle":"A year ago Trump spoke of binding the nation's wounds – so what happened next?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/05/a-year-ago-trump-spoke-of-binding-the-nations-wounds-so-what-happened-next","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/05/a-year-ago-trump-spoke-of-binding-the-nations-wounds-so-what-happened-next","fields":{"headline":"A year ago Trump spoke of binding the nation's wounds – so what happened next?","bodyText":"It was one small step for a man, one giant leap into the political unknown. Just before 3am, Donald Trump moved to the microphone at the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan as an astounded, euphoric crowd chanted: “USA! USA! USA!” The president-elect gave a thumbs up, spoke graciously about opponent Hillary Clinton and made a promise: “Now it’s time for America to bind the wounds of division.” As the first anniversary of that wild night approaches, Trump’s victory over Clinton in the US presidential election has lost none of its power to shock supporters and opponents alike. The jubiliation in the hotel ballroom with its red, white and blue lighting, Air Force One theme music and red sea of “Make America great again” baseball caps was matched by grief – and genuine fear – at Clinton’s funereal election watch party and in millions of homes. The billionaire businessman’s acceptance speech, with its nod to Abraham Lincoln (who once pledged to “bind up the nation’s wounds”), was an uncharacteristically conventional attempt to unify following the most brutal of campaigns. It raised hopes that Trump the president would differ from Trump the candidate. Today, however, many of those hopes have been dashed. Critics say he has divided America more deeply than ever, driving wedges between black and white, female and male, rural and urban – perhaps as a deliberate political strategy. “Looking back to that moment, they were just words on paper because there has not been healing, no binding of the wounds from the campaign, no return to American tradition in that sense,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “He has weaponised some of the tools in politics. He’s fascinating to watch because he’s able to manipulates messages, people, situations. It astonishes me that people are still dumbfounded by it all.” As a candidate, Trump had broken every taboo, from a launch event where he described Mexicans as rapists and drug smugglers to his attack on the parents of a fallen Muslim soldier to the revelation of an old videotape in which he bragged about groping women. Despite huge, raucously enthusiastic crowds, it was assumed he could not win an election in the America of Barack Obama. Indeed, he did lose the popular vote by 3 million yet took the electoral college to become the oldest US president to enter the White House in history and the first with no prior political or military experience. Whether his campaign knowingly colluded with Russia along the way is the subject of ongoing investigations. Two weeks before election day, a New York Times front page headline read: “Victory in sight, Clinton presses beyond Trump.” Trump supporter Benjamin Marchi, a healthcare service franchise owner and Republican platform committee member in Maryland, had, though, begun 8 November 2016 with cautious optimism. Then at around lunchtime he spoke to a friend who had seen exit polls: the outlook was bleak. “As hopeful as I was, there was no explaining away the margins in those polls,” he said. “I thought that’s that.” Marchi then got a call from the Trump campaign inviting him to the official watch party at the Hilton in New York. “My wife said, ‘Does he have a chance? I said no, not really.” Even so, they drove up from St Michaels in Maryland and found an event that, by Trump’s standards of showmanship, was relatively low key. “It was obvious when we arrived at around 8 or 9pm there was not the level of excitement or expectation,” Marchi recalled. But as the night wore on and Fox News beamed results into the room, the mood shifted and the crowd swelled, like sports fans going from resignation to curiosity to giddy laughter. “A lot of people made a big deal about North Carolina and holding close in Virginia but what did it for me was Wisconsin. When he won Wisconsin, he wasn’t going to lose Pennsylvania and I knew there was no stopping him.” A year later, Marchi, 39, can still hardly believe it. “I haven’t stopped thinking about that night since it happened because it was awesome.” He believes Trump has lived up to his promises during his first nine months in office, despite constant criticism. “He delivers tough medicine and, when people don’t want to take their medicine, they’re going to squeal. He has pursued exactly what he said he would pursue and it shouldn’t be a shock or surprise to anyone.” The celebrations at Trump HQ contrasted spectacularly with the tears across town at the Javits Center, where Clinton’s speech was abruptly cancelled, and among Democrats and progressives across the country. Many conservatives were shaken too. Charlie Sykes, a broadcaster and author, said: “I think I was numbed by the enormity of it.” Sykes was unimpressed by Trump’s election night pitch. “He can read a speech written by others that may have some grace notes but his presidency has thrived on division, stoking acrimony and inflaming the culture wars. No one who paid attention during the campaign should be surprised but it’s still shocking to see a US president behave like that. Division is a business model for much of the conservative media and it is central to the political strategy of the president.” After a concert short on stars at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, Trump took office on 20 January. It was his inaugural address, not his election night speech, that revealed his true colours: “Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation … the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives … This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.” Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton, said drily: “I don’t recall his inaugural address being similar to Abraham Lincoln’s first inaugural address in which, on the eve of civil war, he appealed to ‘the better angels of our nature’. With Trump we got ‘American carnage’.” Just a week later the president issued an executive order banning entry for 90 days by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The order also indefinitely halted admission of refugees from Syria. It triggered immediate confusion at airports as well as widespread protests. The ban was knocked back by judges and Trump has been wrangling with the courts ever since. It was a sign of the divisiveness to come along the fault lines of class, culture, gender, gun ownership, race and religion. Blumenthal, a biographer of Lincoln, added: “Trump pursues polarisation whenever he can. It’s his life raft. He cannot survive without dividing. All he has is his base, such as it is, and it can only be held together through constant alarms, emergencies and appeals to its instincts. Instead of the better angels of our nature, he appeals to the demon instincts of his base.” Trump pursued the construction of a wall on the Mexican border and terminated the Obama-era programme that protects the so-called Dreamers from deportation. He pardoned Joe Arpaio, a sheriff in Arizona who defied a court order to stop racially profiling Latino people. He set up a voter fraud commission, which many saw as an attempt to disenfranchise black voters. He championed a law and order crackdown and casually suggested to police that they should handle suspects more roughly. He condemned professional football players who “take the knee” during the national anthem in protest over racial injustice. His response to the hurricanes in Puerto Rico appeared slower than in Florida or Texas, he sparred with the mayor of San Juan and earned scorn for lobbing paper towels at citizens there. He effectively accused an African American war widow of lying. And perhaps most infamously of all he drew moral equivalence between white supremacists and anti-Nazi demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, suggesting that “both sides” were to blame for deadly violence. Julissa Arce, a former undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was at a party in Los Angeles on election night. “It was the first time I’d voted in a presidential election and I was super-excited that I got to vote for what I thought would be the first female president of the United States, so I walked into the party with a smile.” But after seeing Clinton defeated in Pennsylvania and Ohio, she left and watched the rest in her apartment. “I was stunned. I just couldn’t believe how disappointed I was in the United States for electing someone like him, who ran on such divisive rhetoric and who was not qualified.” Arce, a board member at the National Immigration Law Center added: “He continues to be incredibly divisive and, with every tweet, he divides the country more and more. The problem with it is that he gives permission to other people to be divisive as well. I see it in my Twitter feed: people are constantly saying, ‘go back to where you came from’ or ‘we need to build a wall and you should be on the other side of it’. Trump did not create anti-immigrant sentiment but he made a ripe environment to say things that were unacceptable to say in public before.” Arce, a former vice-president at Goldman Sachs and now a naturalised US citizen, is convinced that Trump is a white supremacist. “I think he’s become that more and more. He wasn’t always but as he’s embodied this persona to get election he can no longer tell the difference.” Trump got elected partly by bolting together a powerful coalition of conservative pressure groups such as Christian evangelicals, anti-abortion campaigners, Tea Party anti-tax advocates and, above all, the National Rifle Association (NRA). In Atlanta in April he became the first sitting president to address the annual NRA convention since Ronald Reagan and that “bind the wounds of division” speech in New York felt like a different universe as the crowd booed and jeered images of Clinton, Obama and Hollywood actors. Trump has also continued to fire up his core support with an average of one rally per month, seeking to delegitimise institutions through “us against them” rhetoric and claiming to back the common man against the elites. In Huntington, West Virginia, he told supporters that the Russia investigation was an attack on them; in Phoenix, Arizona, he spoke of “damned dishonest” journalists who “don’t like our country”. The crowd chanted: “USA! USA! USA! … CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! … Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!” Neil Sroka, communications director of Democracy for America, a liberal advocacy group, watched the election results with colleagues in Seattle. He had pre-written one press statement for a Clinton victory and another for a Trump surprise. “We figured Secretary Clinton would win and were trying to work out how the left could keep up the pressure,” he recalled. But as it dawned on them that Clinton would lose, they threw out the “Trump wins” statement and started a new one. “I sat in a corner and rewrote it entirely in 20 minutes because the mood had changed instantly. There was a need to change our entire position and outlook: we got very early that resistance would become central to this presidency and we haven’t let up.” Indeed, Trump’s election night plea for unity cut little ice with Sroka and colleagues. “There was not a moment of hesitation for us in the room: we knew he was lying,” he said. “This is a man who has spent his life saying what he needs to say to get ahead. In a moment of shock for him, somebody handed it to him and he read it.” The scale of the catastrophe came home to Sroka the next day when a Muslim co-worker called him to express anxiety over his future in America. “That was when the emotion hit me directly. As hard as we’d worked, there was the realisation that we hadn’t done enough. There was a deep, profound fear of what Donald Trump’s administration might do in office, some of which has been realised and some of which hasn’t because of his ineptitude. He has proved to be one of the worst managers we’ve ever seen in the Oval Office.” A year on, polls suggest that only about a third of the country supports Trump. But he continues to energise the anti-anti-Trump base in a common disdain for liberal America and could yet retrace a narrow path to victory in 2020. “There has never been a president more focused, more dedicated and more committed to dividing the country against itself over and over again,” Sroka added. “The only way he wins again is by dividing us further. It’s our job to unify the country specifically against his divisive kind of politics.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/27/evolution-of-netball-is-key-to-games-survival-in-crowded-sports-market","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T01:00:16Z","webTitle":"Evolution of netball is key to game's survival in crowded sports market | Erin Delahunty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/27/evolution-of-netball-is-key-to-games-survival-in-crowded-sports-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/27/evolution-of-netball-is-key-to-games-survival-in-crowded-sports-market","fields":{"headline":"Evolution of netball is key to game's survival in crowded sports market","bodyText":"The challenge is nothing new for those in charge of Australian sport. Fragmenting audiences and a rapidly-changing broadcast model mean individual codes must habitually offer die-hard fans, would-be followers and vitally, sponsors and partners, new and digestible “products” and variants on the traditional. Fresh, it seems, is best. One of the richest codes in the land, the AFL, gets it and – whatever your thoughts on the format – is looking at AFLX. It is also investing heavily in the women’s game. Cricket has Twenty20. And netball is no different. While the game’s governing body, Netball Australia, ultimately chose not to introduce any major new rules in the inaugural season of Super Netball, it looked closely at the highly contentious two-point shot. It did introduce several tweaks to improve the “spectator experience”. With Fast5, a five-a-side hybrid version with radically different rules, netball already has its second offering, though. Many critics of mooted changes to “real” netball point to Fast5 as the “home of the extreme”. This weekend, that extreme will be on show, as Melbourne hosts the two-day Fast5 Netball World Series. One of the game’s most exciting young players, 25-year-old South Australian Kate Shimmin, will represent Australia this weekend. She agrees with netball bosses that the game must evolve to survive and says the netball fraternity needs to be receptive to potential change, to ensure it continues to thrive in an increasingly cluttered sporting landscape. “I am absolutely open-minded to rule changes,” says Shimmin, who was made a Diamonds training partner this year. “The game needs to develop for netball to survive.” Fast5 was invented less than 10 years ago and includes teams of five instead of seven, without a wing attack or wing defence, rolling substitutions, shorter games, three scoring zones, with goals worth one, two or three points and a “power play” quarter, where points scored are doubled. Centre passes are also treated differently, with the ball given to the team which didn’t score the last goal, not alternated, as is normally the case. Like cricket’s Twenty20, Fast5 is billed as fast and fan-friendly, with neon uniforms, pyrotechnics and loud music. It’s also seen as a proving ground for possible changes to the traditional form of the game, played in the Super Netball league and around the world. The Fast5 World Series – contested by Australia, Jamaica, England, New Zealand, South Africa and Malawi – was also held in Melbourne last year. Nearly 12,000 attended over two days at Hisense Arena and 1.4 million people watched on TV. Shimmin, an athletic defender, “absolutely loves” the Fast5 format. She happily embraces what traditionalists regard as revolutionary. “I love how you have to be really quite smart in this format and use them [the different rules] to your advantage. I love the idea of power plays and how you can best use that to your advantage, then having to work out strategies to compete against their power play. “When it comes to the three-point aspect, you have just got to use your own smarts, be quick and think on the spot. It’s so fun. We are getting smarter and smarter at this format and we’ve developed lots of strategies, so I’m so excited to get out there.” As a sporting “product”, Fast5 works, she says. “Spectators want something quick and easy. It’s something different and compacted into one weekend, not drawn out. Last year’s event in Melbourne was spectacular.” Shimmin says Fast5 affords players a chance to show a bit of flair. “It’s up to the players to make it fun for the spectators, too. We get to show our own personalities and put our own little twist to it.” The format may be different, but the honour of wearing green and gold remains the same, Shimmin says. “We’re playing for our country and that’s not something we take lightly. It’s the greatest honour you can have.” The Australian team, coached by West Coast Fever’s Stacey Marinkovich and captained by 24-year-old Kate Moloney, who recently made her national debut in the third Constellation Cup test in Adelaide, is desperate to win the Fast5 crown for the first time. New Zealand have won it six times – but come into this tournament without superstar shooter Maria Tutaia, who is known for her long-range prowess. “We are on a mission to take home gold this time,” Shimmin says. “We just need to be fierce. We need to be ready to mix things up, if things aren’t working.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/26/james-packer-says-more-transparency-on-gambling-harms-may-be-needed","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T04:49:23Z","webTitle":"James Packer says more transparency on gambling harms may be needed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/james-packer-says-more-transparency-on-gambling-harms-may-be-needed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/26/james-packer-says-more-transparency-on-gambling-harms-may-be-needed","fields":{"headline":"James Packer says more transparency on gambling harms may be needed","bodyText":"The chairman of Crown Resorts, James Packer, has been questioned by anti-pokies activists at the company’s annual general meeting in Melbourne, conceding that more transparency around gambling revenue and harms may be required. Alliance for Gambling Reform representatives Tim Costello and Stephen Mayne pressed Packer and the board on Thursday morning about issues including political donations and secrecy surrounding poker machine losses and revenue. Board members were also confronted by former poker machine addict Anna Bardsley, the first time someone with experience of problem gambling has questioned Crown executives during an AGM. While Packer did not commit to more transparency, he said the board would take a “serious look and talk about it”. But he also added the board may not ultimately give anti-gambling advocates “everything that you require”. “Companies need to be more transparent than they were 10 years ago,” Packer said. “From my perspective it is a conversation that the board should have because we are living in a world of more and more transparency.” Packer also appeared to suggest Crown Resorts would move away from large political donations, though he did not say the donations would stop. Crown Resorts executive chairman John Alexander also addressed shareholders, angrily refuting allegations made under parliamentary privilege last week by independent Tasmania MP Andrew Wilkie. Wilkie alleged Crown tampered with machines to change the odds, allowed other people’s identity cards to be used to process cash transactions and turned a blind eye to drug use and family violence. “I am angered and disappointed by the outrageous and unfounded allegations levelled at us by Mr Wilkie, which unfairly smeared Crown by asserting that we have acted improperly in relation to our gaming machines and operations,” Alexander said. “We also do not improperly manipulate our gaming machines. Any employee found breaching our codes and practices would face severe disciplinary consequences. Mr Wilkie’s inferences and commentary are deeply offensive to Crown, our board of directors and our employees.” Guardian Australia attempted to attend the AGM, which was open to journalists, but was refused entry by security. The media officer appointed by Crown to the AGM also refused to respond to calls and emails. Mayne said it was another example of the lack of transparency from Crown Resorts, which unlike other major companies does not webcast its AGM nor provide transcripts or meeting minutes to shareholders and journalists. Journalists have previously criticised the treatment of media at Crown Resorts AGMs, including being made to stand in a roped-off area. “The idea that mainstream journalists were not able to gain access shows the bunker mentality at Crown,” Mayne said. “Crown are on the back-foot politically and they need to be seen as being more transparent or there will be a backlash from the public. The very first test of whether they are truly considering increasing transparency will be seeing if they release a full transcript of today’s meeting.” Packer refused to take questions from journalists prior to or after the meeting. During the meeting Packer was re-elected to the Crown Resorts board by investors almost unanimously. He was also pressed about the company’s retreat from Asia. Crown staff including executives were arrested and jailed in China last year for “gambling crimes”. It is not uncommon for casinos to send their staff to China, where gambling is mostly illegal, in order to lure them to casinos overseas including in Australia. In May, Crown announced it would sell its assets in Macau. “Sixteen staff were put in jail last year and Crown takes the welfare of its employees very seriously, very, very seriously and that forced the Crown directors’ hands in relation to Macau,” Packer told shareholders. Shareholders were told that VIP program play turnover at Australian Crown resorts had fallen 17% in the past year, which Alexander described as “encouraging given that most of the prior corresponding period preceded the detention of Crown’s staff in China.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/26/two-men-charged-over-alleged-vigilante-attack-on-alice-springs-children","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T01:09:17Z","webTitle":"Two men charged over alleged vigilante attack on Alice Springs children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/two-men-charged-over-alleged-vigilante-attack-on-alice-springs-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/two-men-charged-over-alleged-vigilante-attack-on-alice-springs-children","fields":{"headline":"Two men charged over alleged vigilante attack on Alice Springs children","bodyText":"Two men have been charged over an alleged bashing of two 13-year-olds in Alice Springs, which family members said left one boy unconscious. The two boys were walking with other children through the Todd Mall on Friday 13 October when “at least” four men pulled up in a white ute, the activist group Shut Youth Prisons said. The men allegedly chased the youths, catching the two boys. “One was beaten unconscious, with injuries to his head,” the organisation said in a statement. “The other young boy tried to shield his cousin from the blows and was kicked and beaten as he lay on top of him. Both children were later taken to hospital.” The boys’ grandfather, Bob Palmer, said he was concerned it was a vigilante attack, sparked by posts on community social media pages advocating extrajudicial justice against juveniles suspected of crime and antisocial behaviour. “Who gives them the right to bash our kids?” he said. “We have to put a stop to this. We don’t want to wait until one of our kids dies.” The Shut Youth Prisons group also published purported screenshots of posts to local community pages, including one from a woman who shared a police notice about a missing Indigenous boy and added the comment “kill em before they breed”. Another poster appeared to support a vigilante group “flogging the fuck out of any cunts congregating around town”. Northern Territory police confirmed that two men, aged 21 and 27, had been arrested and each charged with aggravated assault and engaging in violent conduct. One man was due to appear before court last week but failed to appear, and is now subject to an arrest warrant. The other is scheduled to appear next month. “We fear for our lives and the police give us no answers,” Jakita Palmer, the mother of one of the boys, said. Palmer claimed the police did not visit the hospital to take statements and did not take any photographs of the injuries until two days after the incident. NT police said they conducted a “thorough investigation” and could not comment further on the case as it was before the courts. “Police do not support or condone any vigilante activity or anyone taking the law into their own hands,” a spokesman said. “We request that members of the public stop and think before potentially putting themselves and others at risk.” In June a Western Australian man who admitted to running over and killing 14-year-old Elijah Doughty, who he suspected of stealing a motorbike, was sentenced to three years in jail. He was found not guilty of manslaughter but was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving. There have been a number of attempts in recent years to form vigilante groups in Alice Springs, in response to juvenile crime. Under the previous Country Liberal party government youth services, including a late-night outreach service, were shut down, which youth workers said led to antisocial behaviour, drug use and unaccompanied children on the streets at night. In 2015 a local man, Gary Hall, sought to form a “paramilitary” group to roam the streets at night and “bring into the line the antisocial behaviour and the criminality into what we would deem an acceptable level”. The group’s actions were condemned by the Alice Springs mayor and then chief minister, Adam Giles. Other community groups have set up outreach activities to actively engage with young people who are on the streets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/27/frydenberg-says-government-will-further-reduce-emissions-to-meet-paris-target","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:00:06Z","webTitle":"Frydenberg says government will further reduce emissions to meet Paris target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/27/frydenberg-says-government-will-further-reduce-emissions-to-meet-paris-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/27/frydenberg-says-government-will-further-reduce-emissions-to-meet-paris-target","fields":{"headline":"Frydenberg says government will further reduce emissions to meet Paris target","bodyText":"The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, says he expects the states to sign on to the national energy guarantee, despite the current pushback, and that the government will pursue further emissions reductions in other parts of the economy as part of meeting the Paris target. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s Australian Politics Live podcast, Frydenberg said he expected state governments would act in the national interest when they meet in November and consider the national energy guarantee proposal on its merits. “We are not expecting them to say no,” he said. Frydenberg also flagged more wide ranging action to reduce carbon emissions as part of the climate policy review, which is expected to report by the end of this year. Responding to criticism that the government’s preferred emissions reduction target for electricity, which is a 26% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, will see Australia fail to meet the Paris target, Frydenberg said it was acting on the advice of the chief scientist, Alan Finkel. He said the chief scientist, in his review of the national electricity market, had advised a more ambitious target for the electricity sector could have negative implications for power prices and for system stability. Labor on Thursday zeroed in on an instruction the government had given to energy regulators to model a “least-cost trajectory” assuming an emissions reduction target for electricity of 26% on 2005 levels by 2030, and a “constant target post-2030”. Underscoring the point about a lack of ambition, the shadow assistant minister for climate change and energy, Pat Conroy, highlighted the fact this meant the government was assuming no emissions reductions after 2030 – that the electricity target would remain constant. Frydenberg said the government intended to pursue additional emissions reductions beyond the electricity sector once it had completed its review of climate policy, including in the transport sector. “We have a climate review. We are looking at action in a whole range of sectors,” he said. Despite concrete evidence that emissions are rising in the Australian economy outside the electricity sector, Frydenberg suggested the current trend for emissions reduction was positive. “It may be an inconvenient truth for many, that now the emissions intensity of the Australian economy is at its lowest level in 27 years, or the amount of renewables that came in in 2016 was a five fold increase on 2015, or the fact there is $8bn worth of investment this year in renewables, which is a record amount equivalent to around 4,000 megawatts,” he said. “There are more people in Australia on a per capita basis with solar panels on their roofs than in any other country. I mean there are a lot of good signs across the emissions reduction story.” He said the national energy guarantee would see renewables increase as a proportion of Australia’s energy mix, but he said people who wanted emissions to come down should not object to reductions achieved through efficiencies or upgrades to existing thermal generators. Asked about criticism that the national energy guarantee could hard bake coal assets into the system at a time when the generation mix needed to shift decisively in favour of low emissions technologies, Frydenberg said the policy was fundamentally about technology neutrality. He said the government’s objective was to build versatility into the generation mix. “It’s not about being pro-coal or anti-coal, or pro-renewables or anti-renewables, it’s about getting the right kind of generation mix. If you are a renewable energy company, you know the cost curve is in your favour,” he said. “You also know the cost curve for batteries and storage is coming down. I can foresee an energy market where you have a solar plant next to a gas fired power station, one backing up the other, or indeed a pumped hydro facility next to a wind farm, or indeed large batteries.” The energy minister said the national energy guarantee, which imposes reliability and emissions reduction obligations on electricity retailers, was not a regulated carbon price, despite that view being expressed by some energy analysts. He said critics who contended the government’s energy policy was a sop to Tony Abbott should understand that “this would not have been Tony Abbott’s policy in a month of Sundays”. Frydenberg characterised the current objections by state governments as predictable “argy bargy” before a serious discussion aimed at ending the decade-long climate wars. “I think people recognise that it’s time to put the climate wars that have dogged the parliament to an end,” he said. “This proposal does exactly that. I hope the states keep an open mind and debate the policy on its merits come November.” The South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, has led the public criticism of the Commonwealth’s proposal, and the process which led up to the government’s announcement. The Queensland energy minister Mark Bailey warned Frydenberg this week that is was not helpful for the Turnbull government to continually criticise the states if he wanted a cooperative agreement through the Council of Australian Governments on the national energy guarantee. But Frydenberg predicted the governments would overcome their reservations. “I think the states are big enough and hopefully wise enough to know that it’s in their state interest, and the national interest, to get consensus around the new mechanism.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/26/brazil-president-michel-temer","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T06:30:22Z","webTitle":"Brazil rapper scores hit with I Killed the President – but Temer clings on for now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/brazil-president-michel-temer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/26/brazil-president-michel-temer","fields":{"headline":"Brazil rapper scores hit with I Killed the President – but Temer clings on for now","bodyText":"In the week that Brazil’s deeply unpopular president, Michel Temer, survived a congressional vote that could have seen him face criminal charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice, a rap video called I’m Happy (I Killed The President) 2 has become a viral hit. The song by Gabriel o Pensador (“Gabriel the Thinker”), 43 – a rewrite of an earlier hit the rapper released 24 years ago, during the impeachment of then president Fernando Collor – has been watched more than 3m times on YouTube. The threat implied in the title is not literal, it goes on to explain. “But if all the corrupt died suddenly / It would be all different, there would be so much money left,” raps O Pensador – whose real name is Gabriel Contino. However, most Brazilians paid little attention to Wednesday’s vote, unlike in 2015 and 2016, when Temer’s predecessor Dilma Rousseff faced enormous street demonstrations calling for her impeachment over a spiralling graft scandal and failing economy. Just a few thousand marched joined an anti-Temer protest in Rio on Tuesday. Police easily dispersed them with clouds of teargas. After Wednesday’s vote, the president thanked lawmakers for their support. “The economy has returned to growth after the biggest recession in our history. This is the biggest work of my government,” he said. The reality is more complex. The president’s mandate survived because Brazil did an uneasy deal with itself. Lawmakers bargained their support, the population shrugged, and financial markets decided not to lose another president – Rousseff was ousted in 2016 for breaking budget rules – just as Brazil’s economy is limping out of a recession. “There is an issue of avoiding the worst-case scenario, which would be an economic meltdown,” said Marcos Troyjo, an adjunct professor of international relations at Columbia University. Temer, 77, was first charged with corruption in June, but won a first congress vote weeks later to avoid being suspended for trial. Now he will probably survive in office until new elections in 2018. But the cost was high. To please a powerful agribusiness bloc in congress, Temer reduced Amazon protection and discounted fines for environmental offences. Despite Brazil’s soaring deficit and his own austerity programme, he also bought support by cancelling the privatisation of São Paulo’s domestic airport, lowering payments for fines and interest on overdue taxes, discounting payments of overdue taxes and agreeing extra money for lawmakers’ projects in their home states. All at a potential cost of $10bn since June, the Estado de S Paulo newspaper calculated. Many Brazilians were appalled. “He is terrible. He bought lawmakers so nobody would vote against him,” said Douglas Corrêa, 24, a Rio street cleaner. But the congressional vote put an end to a political crisis which began in May with the release of a wiretap of a compromising conversation the president held during a secret late-night meeting with a powerful executive. The evidence against Temer and his cronies included $152,000 in a suitcase handed to a key Temer aide filmed scuttling out of a São Paulo pizzeria and $15m in cash found in an apartment linked to a key minster and friend – since jailed. “Brazilians today feel repulsion for politicians, for the congress,” said Ricardo Ismael, a professor of political science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. But as Temer noted, the economic numbers are up, even if most Brazilians are yet to feel the benefit, with the stock market surging, and inflation, interest rates and unemployment all falling. His unpopular reforms, such as a 20-year cap on public spending and a loosening of outdated labour laws, have been credited for some of this growth. Powerful financiers had concluded the charges were going nowhere and wanted to move on. “The president is a long way from having admirers among bankers, who have no doubt his government is corrupt. But for this group pragmatism is king,” economic columnist Raquel Landim wrote in the Folha de S Paulo newspaper on Thursday. The irony, said José Álvaro Moisés, a professor of political science at the University of São Paulo, is that while Temer’s liberal economic policy helped save his mandate, he may no longer have enough support to pass his intended landmark reform – a politically explosive overhaul of a generous pension system the World Bank called “unsustainable”. “The congress base will impose more and more difficult conditions,” Moisés said. “Nobody talks any more about pension reform in the way it was originally proposed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/25/colin-kaepernick-owners-players-meeting","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T19:59:55Z","webTitle":"Kaepernick expected to attend players' meeting with owners on social issues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/25/colin-kaepernick-owners-players-meeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/25/colin-kaepernick-owners-players-meeting","fields":{"headline":"Kaepernick expected to attend players' meeting with owners on social issues","bodyText":"Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been invited to the next meeting between NFL players and owners to discuss social injustice issues, a league spokesperson said on Wednesday. NFL vice president of communications Joe Lockhart said on the league’s weekly conference call that Kaepernick has been invited to the meeting next week in New York, but was uncertain whether the free-agent signal-caller would be attending. Lockhart added the invitation was extended by the players and not the league. “We look forward to him joining the conversation,” Lockhart said. He added: “My understanding is Colin Kaepernick has been invited to these last two meetings. He has been in the discussion with the players’ coalition. I expect that he will be invited to this meeting. We look forward to him joining the conversation with the (NFL Players Association), but I don’t have any confirmation that he’s planning to attend.” Yahoo’s Charles Robinson reported later Wednesday that Kaepernick will attend and that “players are happy to have him join”. Kaepernick was not present at a meeting last week at the league’s midtown Manhattan headquarters that was attended by 13 players, 11 team owners, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith and several others. After a four-hour session, Goodell determined he would not require players to stand for the Star-Spangled Banner. “We believe that our players should stand for the national anthem,” Goodell said last week. “We want our players to stand, we’re going to continue to encourage them to stand.” He added: “We have about a half a dozen players that are protesting. We hope and we’re going to continue to work to try to put that at zero.” Mark Geragos, the attorney representing Kaepernick in recently filed grievance claiming collusion by NFL owners, issued a statement last week indicating that his client did not receive an invitation from “any official from the NFL or any team executives”. While Kaepernick has remained jobless since opting out of his contract with San Francisco in March, the 29-year-old did sign a book deal with Random House imprint One World worth more than $1m, the New York Post reported on Tuesday. Kaepernick completed 59.2% of his passes, averaged 6.8 yards per attempt and threw 16 touchdowns with four interceptions in 12 games for the 49ers last season. But his refusal to stand for the anthem to draw attention to police brutality and racial injustice became a far bigger story than his on-field performance, ultimately making him the target of bellicose rhetoric from US president Donald Trump last month. Lockhart acknowledged on Wednesday that the ongoing protests around the league have impacted the NFL’s image. “The NFL brand is always about unity and not about politics,” Lockhart said. “When politics gets injected into any business, that can have an impact on the brand. I will say this, we are in constant contact with our sponsors. Our sponsors come to work with the NFL because we’re not generally in the middle of political debates. We’re not generally being attacked by one side or the other, and that we are a unifying force. “We believe that we are. Our business is very strong and that remains the case.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"community/2017/oct/29/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-easy","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T09:00:23Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'easy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/oct/29/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-easy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/oct/29/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-easy","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'easy'","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘easy.’ Share your photos of what easy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

The visitor’s experience of being in the forest, changing over decades, being aware of the slow growth of the trees containing the writers’ ideas like an unseen energy – that’s something that has to come into being,” said Paterson. “The timescale is 100 years, not vast in cosmic terms. However, in many ways the human timescale of 100 years is more confronting. It is beyond many of our current lifespans, but close enough to come face to face with it, to comprehend and relativise.” Shafak, the author of novels including The Bastard of Istanbul, The Forty Rules of Love and most recently Three Daughters of Eve, was named on Friday as the fourth writer who would be contributing – a choice Paterson described as pertinent: “Her work dissolves boundaries: cultural, geographic, political, ideological, religious and spiritual, and embraces a plurality of voices. Her storytelling is magical and profound, creating connectivity between people and places: a signal of hope at a particularly divided moment in time.” Shafak said she was honoured to be joining Atwood, Mitchell and Sjón on the project. “It’s a very unusual project, and they’ve put so much thought and heart into it – so much faith behind it,” she said. “This entire idea of writing a manuscript that will, hopefully, be read in the future is to me like writing a letter now and leaving it in a river. You don’t know where it will go or who will read it – you just believe in the flow of time.” She also praised the project’s international reach, with writers from Canada, the UK, Iceland and now Turkey selected. “It’s a global project, at a time when there is a lot of division in the world. One of the organisers said it is like a family tree, and I love that,” she said. The authors are selected by a trust “for their outstanding contributions to literature and poetry and for their work’s ability to capture the imagination of this and future generations”. The length of the manuscript they write is up to them, as is its genre. Shafak said that writing the text – she has started thinking about it but has yet to put pen to paper – was going to be a challenge. “I may do something across fiction and non-fiction. I want it to be meaningful for the people who will read it in the future, maybe kind of reflecting the concerns of our time … what it feels like to live in these liquid times,” she said. “You’re writing for people you’ll never meet, but at the same time for yourself, so in some ways it feels like a very personal, intimate project. You don’t think about the reaction, you just write because you believe in what you’re doing, so there is a very pure core to the project.” Shafak will deliver her manuscript in the forest at a ceremony next June. It will be held, alongside Atwood’s, Mitchell’s, Sjón’s and all the future contributors’ work, in a room at the new Deichmanske public library, opening in 2019 in Bjørvika, Oslo. Its contents will remain a secret until 2114, when the anthology is printed. Atwood has said of the project: “How strange it is to think of my own voice – silent by then for a long time – suddenly being awakened, after 100 years. What is the first thing that voice will say, as a not-yet-embodied hand draws it out of its container and opens it to the first page?” Mitchell, meanwhile, called it “a vote of confidence that, despite the catastrophist shadows under which we live, the future will still be a brightish place willing and able to complete an artistic endeavour begun by long-dead people a century ago”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/29/the-week-in-radio-podcasts-where-should-we-being-5-live-daily-womans-hour","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T07:00:21Z","webTitle":"The week in radio and podcasts: Where Should We Begin?; 5 Live Daily; Woman’s Hour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/29/the-week-in-radio-podcasts-where-should-we-being-5-live-daily-womans-hour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/29/the-week-in-radio-podcasts-where-should-we-being-5-live-daily-womans-hour","fields":{"headline":"The week in radio and podcasts: Where Should We Begin?; 5 Live Daily; Woman’s Hour","bodyText":"Where Should We Begin? | Audible 5 Live Daily (BBC 5 Live) | iPlayer Woman’s Hour (BBC Radio 4) | iPlayer Esther Perel is a psychotherapist from Belgium who is, says Wikipedia, known for “exploring the tension between the need for security (love, belonging and closeness) and the need for freedom (erotic desire, adventure and distance) in human relationships”. Perel has done TED talks watched by 7.5 million people, written a bestselling book that’s been translated into 24 languages, she’s highly respected and feted internationally. Yet, busy as I was, tottering along my own security/freedom tightrope, I knew nothing about her until recently. Now, I’ve been able to listen to her in action. And it is utterly fascinating. The second series of Perel’s podcast, Where Should We Begin?, started last week. In the first episode, as in every one, we got to hear a couple’s counselling session. Certain details are changed, for anonymity, and every so often, Perel breaks out of the session to explain what she’s thinking, but for the most part, you’re right in the room. Here, the couple’s problem was not their own solid, loving relationship, but the relationship they were having with their daughter. After years of being a successful student, she had withdrawn into her room to sit at her computer for 14 hours a day. Perel’s insights were instantly enlightening. The parents had kept the situation private. “You think,” said Perel, “you are protecting her, by colluding with her. But you are doing a parallel process. She’s not talking, you’re not talking. She’s trapped, you’re trapped.” Therapy is an amazing thing, and Perel is a great therapist. Plus, her Belgian accent can’t help but remind me of someone... She’s the Hercule Poirot of emotions. She doesn’t have the fragile ego and showiness (nor the twirly moustache), but she has the detective’s unerring ability to spot clues, put them together and make the couple in the room – and those of us listening in – understand what has actually happened, what is taking place right now. The first series of Where Should We Begin? is free on iTunes (episode 4, The Addict, is a mind-blower), but the new series is on Audible, which means you pay for it. I expect it will be free once the series ends. Whether you can wait is up to you. Every episode is as gripping as a thriller, and as moving as any real-life documentary. If you were in the mood to be moved, Adrian Chiles’s interview with ex-footballer Clarke Carlisle (left) and his wife, Carrie, on 5 Live Daily last week got the tear ducts working. I’ve been a bit rude about Chiles in the past – he can seem sleepy and unengaged – but he is a natural, sympathetic interviewer and he was excellent here. Carlisle suffers from depression and, in September, left his Preston home, set on killing himself. He was spotted in a Liverpool park by a man whose friend had recently committed suicide, and who sat with Carlisle, cried with him – and saved him. Carrie Carlisle said something very astute: “If I could go back, I would stop using my own mental framework as a reference.” The polar opposite of every unhelpful why-don’t-you-just-pull-yourself-together remark. If all these emotions were a bit much, you could enjoy a broadcasting taboo being smashed on Tuesday’s Woman’s Hour, courtesy of Jane Garvey’s interviewee Katy Tur, a reporter on the Donald Trump trail. It was fascinating stuff, right up to and including the moment when Tur talked about the T-shirts women wore at Trump rallies. Some, she informed us, had “Hillary is a C-U-N-T on them”. Woman’s Hour listeners can all spell. So can their children, and it was half-term last week. Garvey made the usual apologies, but it did make me smile."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/26/stranger-things-2-review-1980s-retro-show-netflix","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T11:05:23Z","webTitle":"Stranger Things 2: retro teen sci-fi show's return is as delightful as ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/26/stranger-things-2-review-1980s-retro-show-netflix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/26/stranger-things-2-review-1980s-retro-show-netflix","fields":{"headline":"Stranger Things 2: retro teen sci-fi show's return is as delightful as ever","bodyText":"There is a weight of expectation on the shoulder pads of Stranger Things 2, the follow-up series to Netflix’s revival of, and homage to, the adventurous spirit of 1980s films like The Goonies, Stand By Me and ET. It made superstars of its young cast, was credited with re-energising the career of Winona Ryder, and won multiple awards, though its enormous impact seemed almost to take everyone by surprise, including Netflix. The power of nostalgia is certainly strong enough to paper over the series’ flaws: though charming and undoubtedly stylish, the first season didn’t quite match up to the might of its opening episode. More sweet than scary, it was carried along by a clever eye for an iconic moment, likable characters and incisive tributes to its cinematic inspirations. Stranger Things 2, then – its creators, the Duffer Brothers, have styled the title this way in a nod to the movies it references – asks more of itself and its audience. It is bigger in ambition, bigger in story – and now bigger in budget, thanks to its success. It certainly looks more expensive, though the special effects are never desperately showy, and its child stars are given emotional storylines demanding greater depth, to which some step up – Noah Schnapp as the long-suffering Will is extraordinary – and some just about manage. The action isn’t only confined to Hawkins, Indiana, and we’re introduced to several new characters in an attempt to broaden the show’s scope. It’s impossible to discuss the plot in much detail – another sign of its success is that episodes were released early only to reviewers who agreed not to mention a list of proscribed storylines, which turn out to be the bulk of the series. It would be no fun to spoil anything, though, and Stranger Things 2 really is a delight, once it finally hits its stride. It’s only when the final four instalments start to tear into the action that you realise quite how slow the rest of it has been; there’s a standalone episode that takes place in another location that puts a criminal dent in the pace by taking us away from the central gang at a crucial moment. Some of the additions to the cast, too, fall wide of the mark. There’s a marauding gang of terrorist-punks who are more fashion-mag shoot than public menace; and Billy, a bullying big brother who seems like a composite of every character Kiefer Sutherland played in the 80s, is even sillier than his hairspray mullet would imply. He doesn’t even have the worst hair on the show. But there’s a lot to admire in what the Duffers have achieved. It’s a gorgeous piece of television, in which everything from Will’s stormy-night visions of the Upside Down to a simple shot of new girl Max skateboarding looks meticulously considered. There will be plenty of spot-the-reference moments for sci-fi and horror fans, particularly as it all starts to go wrong in the lab and the series progresses towards a darker, more perilous climax. There’s as much to enjoy as admire, too. The most popular character of the first season wasn’t Will, or Mike, or even Eleven, though she was a close second. It was Barb, the plucky underdog killed off too early. This sequel is filled with the spirit of Barb, as the female characters stride to the front. Though she’s barely in it, Lucas’s little sister lights up every scene she’s in. Max is the street-smart new member of the club (though her pejorative use of the word “stalker” seems rather modern for 1984). Nancy is less simpering and more crucial, and Eleven is off on her own Carrie-ish travels, where she meets more tough girls, though her return from where we left her last season is wrapped up a little too neatly. Even Winona Ryder’s Joyce seems more focused on getting the job done this time, though it’s hard not to feel for her house, which once again ends up looking like a Blue Peter activity gone very badly awry. Stranger Things can feel as if it straddles two worlds, just as in the show. It’s part retro teen drama, with plenty of adolescent angst, and part gruesome sci-fi horror, with this season in particular ramping up the thrills. Sometimes these elements can hit a tonal barrier, in which neither is given space to fully breathe. But compromise, as police chief Jim Hopper gently explains to Eleven, means “kinda halfway happy”. Though there remains a frustrating sense that if only a few kinks were ironed out, this could be one of the best TV shows around, it would take a cold heart not to warm to Stranger Things 2."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"membership/2017/oct/28/the-article-that-changed-my-view-vote-london-mayor-election","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T11:31:10Z","webTitle":"The article that changed my view ... of who deserved my vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/oct/28/the-article-that-changed-my-view-vote-london-mayor-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2017/oct/28/the-article-that-changed-my-view-vote-london-mayor-election","fields":{"headline":"The article that changed my view ... of who deserved my vote","bodyText":"Sandra Moretti, 43, is a language and cookery teacher from Brittany, France, who lives in Bromley, Greater London I read Yasmin Alibhai-Brown’s opinion article, headlined Sadiq Khan as mayor of London would be the terrorists’ worst nightmare, in May 2016. The vote for London’s next mayor was approaching and the campaigns were in full swing. A friend sent me the piece following a discussion at a dinner party during which I had dismissed Khan as a mayoral candidate. I had not read enough about the candidates at that stage but his leaflet seemed rather too simplistic and I wasn’t sure he would provide the inspiration to effect real change. In her article, Alabhai-Brown detailed Khan’s personal and professional background, and argued that his experiences made him both unique and typical as a London man. She described how the Khan family prized education and raised a man defined by his grit, work ethic and confidence – all, to my mind, essential qualities in a good leader. Her commentary planted a seed and I started to research Khan’s politics and story – and the more I read, the more I liked. Like me, and Alabhai-Brown, he was from an immigrant family. Like me, he came from humble origins. Like me, he loves London with a passion. To me, Khan exemplifies the notion that if you work hard, you can make anything possible. One line from the article particularly caught my attention: “We are living in times when to be a Muslim, especially one with pride and ambition, is to risk being seen as the enemy within … A Khan victory would also demolish the extremists’ anti-western narrative,” wrote Alabhai-Brown. The London mayoral election came at the same time as the French election, which had seen the extraordinary rise of the Front National; the US presidential campaigns; and the EU referendum. Amid the chaos, Khan seemed to offer some hope that London could rise above the fissures and divisions and display open-mindedness. This article opened my eyes to this inspiring man and, alongside it, the Guardian as a newspaper, as well as new ways of thinking about politics. I went on to vote for Khan, and have never regretted that decision. I also haven’t stopped reading the Guardian since that day. I appreciate that it challenges popular opinion, and with that, the status quo of the country and the wider world. The main reason Alabhai-Brown’s opinion resonated with me so profoundly, was that electing Khan suddenly became synonymous with hope. In dark times, where racism was flourishing in so many places around the world – and continues to do so – Khan offered an alternative. He embodies the values that I equate with London at its best: meritocracy, inclusivity and diversity.

EHS has been described as “a sensory parasomnia characterised by the perception of loud noises and/or a sense of explosion in the head when transitioning to or from sleep. These noises are not associated with significant pain, but lead to abrupt arousal and feelings of fright”. Although this phenomenon was first described as long ago as 1876, it was not given its colourful title until 1988. Despite its long history, it has received very little systematic research attention, with most of our knowledge being based upon small samples of case histories as opposed to large-scale investigations. We, the authors of this piece, along with the world’s leading authority on EHS, Dr Brian Sharpless of Argosy University, Northern Virginia, are hoping to rectify that situation by carrying out a large-scale survey of EHS. We’re also interested in the equally intriguing phenomenon of sleep paralysis, which involves a temporary period of paralysis occurring between sleep and wakefulness, often accompanied by hallucinations. If you have ever experienced either EHS or sleep paralysis, or even if you haven’t, we would love to hear from you. In addition to explosions, other types of loud noise perceived during episodes of EHS include gunshots, fireworks, thunder, doors slamming, clapping, shouting, and the clash of cymbals. There can also be beeps, buzzing and video static. This may be accompanied by “electrical” sensations, palpitations, breathing difficulties, sweating, seeing a flash of light, and twitching. Perhaps unsurprisingly, intense fear caused by the belief that something is seriously wrong is often reported. Although episodes of EHS are generally thought to be harmless, in a minority of cases sufferers seek medical attention. There is a real risk of misdiagnosis, with potentially important clinical consequences, given the widespread lack of knowledge amongst medical professionals of this under-researched phenomenon. Recent research has contradicted the idea that EHS is rare. One study found that 10.7% of healthy subjects, 10% of patients with a sleep disorder and 13.8% of psychiatric patients reported having experienced EHS. In another study, 18% of students reported that they had experienced EHS at least once and the vast majority of those sufferers experienced it repeatedly. The latter study also found equal prevalence in males and females in contrast to earlier studies that had found a greater susceptibility in females. There has been very little systematic study of treatment options for this disorder. Several small-scale studies have produced promising results using different pharmacological interventions such as the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, flunarizine, and nifedipine. What is more, education can be useful. Simply informing sufferers of the nature of EHS, and specifically that it is a fairly benign condition, may sometimes be enough to reassure those affected to the extent that the episodes cease. This could be due to a reduction in anxiety associated with falling asleep. The survey, led by researchers from Goldsmiths, University of London, and promoted by BBC Focus magazine, is calling for members of the general public to tell us about their own sleep habits and these unusual sleep-related experiences. We’ll ask you about your beliefs and basic demographics too. We are just as keen to get responses from people who have never experienced EHS and/or sleep paralysis as we are interested in possible differences between sufferers and non-sufferers. Amongst the questions of particular interest to us are the following: What is the relationship between these unusual sleep experiences and other sleep habits? To what extent do such experiences interfere with your life in general? What do you think causes these experiences? What, if anything, do you do to try to prevent the episodes from occurring or deal with them when they occur? And how effective are your attempts? We hope that the results of our survey will be published in scientific journals, presented at conferences and publicised via the media. In this way we hope to make progress in learning more about the nature of such sleep-related anomalies. Just as importantly we want to help to reassure those who suffer from them that, although such episodes may be terrifying, they are essentially harmless. Christopher French is a professor of psychology and head of the anomalistic psychology research unit at Goldsmiths, University of London. Alice M Gregory is also a professor of psychology at Goldsmiths. Her book about sleep, Nodding Off, will be published by Bloomsbury Sigma in spring 2018 .

Bush issued an initial apology on Tuesday after Heather Lind, who starred in the AMC cable television network’s historical drama Turn: Washington’s Spies, accused the former US president of groping her as they posed for photos together with his wife and others during a promotional event for the show in 2014. A spokesman for Bush, who is 93, said then: “President Bush would never – under any circumstance – intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humour offended Ms Lind.” But Bush’s spokesman Jim McGrath, issued a further statement on Wednesday that sought to explain the former president’s behavior as an attempt to make light of social awkwardness posed by his own physical disability during photo sessions. Confined to a wheelchair, as Bush has been for about the past five years, “his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures”, McGrath said. “To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke – and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate,” McGrath wrote. “To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.” Meanwhile a second woman, actor Jordana Grolnick, told Deadspin a similar story. Following a performance of The Hunchback of Notre Dame that Bush had attended in Maine, “We all circled around him and [former first lady] Barbara for a photo, and I was right next to him,” she told the website. “He reached his right hand around to my behind, and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group, ‘Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?’ As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, ‘David Cop-a-Feel!’” Grolnick said others in the room “laughed politely and out of discomfort”, while Barbara Bush “said something along the lines of, ‘He’s going to get himself put into jail!’ to which we laughed harder”. Lind’s allegation first appeared in an Instagram post in which the actor said that seeing photos of Bush, 93, shaking hands with Barack Obama during an appearance of all five living former presidents at Saturday’s hurricane fund-raising benefit reminded her of her own meeting with the president three years earlier, when, according to her, “he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo”. “He didn’t shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side,” Lind wrote. “He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again.” Lind said the former first lady “rolled her eyes as if to say, ’not again’”. The Instagram post, since deleted, carried the #MeToo social media hashtag spawned by the recent outpouring of sexual assault and sexual harassment accusations leveled against former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Dozens of actors and assistants have since come forward, including Angelina Jolie, Lupita Nyong’o and Léa Seydoux. Weinstein has denied engaging in non-consensual sex with anyone. Police in New York City, London and Los Angeles are investigating Weinstein, who in the wake of the allegations was forced out of the Weinstein Company, the production company he co-founded with his brother, Bob Weinstein. There has also been an increase in calls about sexual assault in the US to Rainn (the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network), the country’s largest anti-sexual assault organization. Rainn revealed this week that its national helpline has been inundated with 21% more calls than usual since the Weinstein allegations became public. George HW Bush was vice-president under Ronald Reagan and then president from 1989 to 1993, during which he presided over the end of the cold war, fought a war against Iraq and signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Canada and Mexico. He was defeated by Bill Clinton in 1992.

CW, London Cash payments are certainly not ideal as the landlord is likely to be using them to dodge tax and because you have no proof of payment or, indeed, what you are paying for, unless he is issuing invoices for the services included and signed receipts. Certainly the landlord should not be entering bedrooms to collect the rent and you need to request that payments are made outside the property, according to Ralph Bullivant, partner in the property litigation team at Hill Dickinson LLP. As for the proof of residency, he says, you should have been given a tenancy agreement (normally an assured shorthold tenancy agreement). If it was not provided, the landlord can be obliged to provide a statement of terms of your tenancy, including his name and address, and it must be provided within 28 days. Even if the property is managed by a letting agent you are entitled to know the contact details of your landlord.

What they didn’t witness was that same man standing outside the Brighton dressing room afterwards, waiting for each and every one of our players and coaches to offer congratulations and a warm handshake. A few minutes before, I was sat behind the technical area while chants of “sacked in the morning” and “you don’t know what you’re doing” crashed down on Bilic from the stands, and yet here he was in the quiet of the tunnel displaying a humility and courtesy which very few people could find in those circumstances, and for the first time in my life I questioned my own ambition to become a manager. For the past five years I’ve been studying and preparing to become a coach – something I have dreamed of and worked towards while still playing – and have felt strongly motivated about gaining my licence and maybe even one day finding myself in the dugout as a Premier League manager. But seeing Bilic standing alone with his own fans baying for his blood made me shiver at the prospect of that being me one day. Do I really want to expose myself to the pain, stress and media scrutiny a manager has to accept as part of the job? And more importantly, is my family ready for the constant speculation about my job and the questioning of every decision I make from a voracious public and media? I boarded a flight to Belfast last Sunday with these questions still buzzing in my mind as I headed for the next stage of my Uefa Pro Licence course with the IFA. Since starting my coaching badges, many people has asked what the course entails, its structure and basically does it teach you how to be a manager? The answer will surprise many people because at least 90% of the course has absolutely nothing to do with football whatsoever. The pro licence course I and many aspiring coaches take is based on personal stress management, handling the media, psychology, team-building and cultivating relationships with players and staff at every level of a club – all of the skills and tools which are necessary to cope in a very pressured job at the highest level. But the lectures and coursework we have to complete are as far removed from football as you can get; it’s about developing the understanding of what makes your players (employees) tick, managing in a fickle, high-stress, results-driven business, how to maximise potential in a team environment and the art of teaching itself – all skills needed for management in every industry, not just football. Ironically, these are abilities which aren’t analysed, quantified or debated by fans or the experts and pundits in the media. Since the introduction of the famous Football Manager computer simulation game, the amount of statistical and tactical analysis available to people has led millions to believe coaching is simply a matter of examining the numbers and then selecting a team and formation and away you go. Everyone is an expert now and has an opinion of their club’s best team and formation. But can everyone walk into a dressing room full of big characters, who analyse and mock any weakness, stand in front of them and lead them to success? Can everyone deal with the outspoken players who are unhappy and think they should be starting instead of the useless donkey you’ve picked in front of them? Can everyone be the face of a club, in some cases multimillion‑pound companies and therefore face the immense financial pressures that come with every result, every week in the job? Can everyone stand on a touchline, sometimes with their family in the stands, while being abused by thousands of people with the good grace that Bilic did last Friday? Obviously knowing football systems, football philosophies and tactics is of paramount importance in the job. But in doing my coaching licences I have realised and learned that my character and example as a person, handling high-stress environments while having the ability to inspire and relate to players from different countries of different faiths and culture, is just as important. Last Friday, regardless of the result or the team he picked, I learned a very important lesson about character and humility from Slaven Bilic just as valuable as all my coaching badges combined and it will stay with me for years to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/27/danny-lloyd-the-kid-in-the-shining-i-was-promised-that-tricycle-after-filming-but-it-never-came","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Danny Lloyd – the kid in The Shining: ‘I was promised that tricycle after filming but it never came’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/27/danny-lloyd-the-kid-in-the-shining-i-was-promised-that-tricycle-after-filming-but-it-never-came","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/27/danny-lloyd-the-kid-in-the-shining-i-was-promised-that-tricycle-after-filming-but-it-never-came","fields":{"headline":"Danny Lloyd – the kid in The Shining: ‘I was promised that tricycle after filming but it never came’","bodyText":"‘Whatever happened to that kid from The Shining?” For years, horror fans pestered Stephen King about the fate of little Danny Torrance, the boy with psychic abilities who survived the Overlook Hotel. So much so that King eventually wrote a sequel, 2013’s Doctor Sleep. It’s a question that crops up on the internet too, about Danny Lloyd, the child actor with the pudding-bowl haircut who played Torrance in Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film adaptation. On IMDb, Lloyd has just one other acting credit after The Shining (a long-forgotten TV drama about Watergate). Where did he disappear to? “I once read that I had six kids and was a pig farmer,” he says, chuckling on the phone from his home. “That’s not entirely accurate.” For the record, Lloyd – who goes by Dan rather than Danny these days – is a biology professor at a community college in Kentucky. He did work on a farm to pay his way through university, “but where I’m from in the midwest, that’s where the odd jobs are, on farms”. And he’s got four children, not six – the eldest two are teenagers and tease him mercilessly about his haircut in The Shining. Nothing about Lloyd screams Hollywood. In photos, he looks like your average 45-year-old guy, clean cut with a neatly trimmed beard. Chatting on the phone, he is pure midwestern wholesomeness, his expressions running the gamut from “oh boy” to “gosh”. Because he rarely gives interviews, gossip has swirled that he hates The Shining and feels like it’s wrecked his life. Any truth there? “I don’t do many interviews. But when I do, I try to make it clear, The Shining was a good experience. I look back on it fondly. What happened to me was I didn’t really do much else after the film. So you kind of have to lay low and live a normal life.” In his early days as a teacher – long after he had quit acting – Lloyd learned fast that being the kid from The Shining was not a fact he needed to share with pupils looking for chinks in his authority. “It was disruptive in class, so that’s when I began to really play it down.” Were the kids waggling their fingers hissing “Redrum”? He laughs good-naturedly. “Yes. Very occasionally, but enough for me to know I had to downplay it. As a teacher, you’re supposed to be in control.” Lloyd was four when his father, a railroad worker, heard a call-out for auditions on local radio. Kubrick had also placed adverts in Illinois newspapers: “Seeking boy for a film. Between five and seven years of age. No previous acting experience necessary.” Why did his dad think he could act? “Well, he told me that I was always running around trying to get attention, so he sent off my photo. I think he did it as a joke, really.” But, after five or six auditions he landed the role – Kubrick’s personal assistant called the house in the middle of Lloyd’s fifth birthday. (The director later said that he’d been impressed with the little boy’s ability to concentrate.) The entire family upped sticks to London – Lloyd, his mum, dad and older brother Mike – for what they were told would be a 17-week shoot. Inevitably, filming on The Shining overran, to almost a year, as extreme perfectionist Kubrick shot take after take (he forced poor Shelley Duvall to redo the axe scene a record-breaking 127 times). “We didn’t know what we were getting into,” says Lloyd. “But I think if you were to ask each once of us individually, we’d do it again.” At the time, aged five, he had no idea The Shining was a horror film – Kubrick decided not to tell him the plot. He thought it was drama about a family who lived in a hotel. Kubrick was an imposing presence, a big slab of a man with a reputation for being difficult and exacting. What did Lloyd make of him? “Stanley was great. I remember him playing ball with me, playing catch, stuff like that. He was a big guy with a beard, but I don’t remember ever being scared of him or intimidated or anything.” Unlike Duvall, he has fond memories from the set: eating peanut butter sandwiches with Lisa and Louise Burns, the twins who played the creepy Grady sisters; an egg hunt Kubrick organised at Easter for the kids. And while the rest of us might remember little Danny pedalling like the wind along the corridors of the Overlook, hyperventilating in terror at the horrors of room 237, what stuck for Lloyd was the excitement of being allowed to ride a tricycle indoors. Although it came with a lesson in the hollowness of grownup promises. A crew member offered to send him the tricycle after the movie: “I was waiting and waiting for it, but it never came.” Kubrick and his team protected him from the scary stuff, Lloyd says. In one scene, where Wendy runs screaming through the hotel with Danny in her arms, Duvall carried a lifesize doll. “I specifically remember I was banned from the set for the entire time Scatman Crothers was being axed,” he says laughing. There is something nice and Tom Hanks-y about his measured tone and efforts not to say anything mean or controversial. I read that he accidentally walked in on Jack Nicholson filming “Here’s Johnny!” (voted the scariest scene movie history a few years ago). Is that true? “Yes, but not the actual ‘Here’s Johnny’ bit. Jack was out in the hallway with the axe. He was having fun and goofing off. I think it was a plastic axe he had. Both my parents were there and we were laughing. That wasn’t scary.” One of his costumes, a hand-knitted Apollo 11 jumper, has provided conspiracy theorists with ammunition for their hypothesis that Kubrick filled The Shining with clues that he had helped the US government to fake the moon landing in 1969. Lloyd laughs drily when I ask if believes any of the Shinologists’s theories? “Honestly, no. I don’t think there’s any basis to any of it really. I think it’s just people being such fans of Kubrick and trying to explain some of the things that are almost unexplainable. Why did he do this? Why he did do that? But no, I don’t buy into any of the conspiracies.” For years after the film, Kubrick sent the Lloyd family cards at Christmas, and telephoned around his graduation from high school: “He was interested in how I was doing in school. It was very nice of him to take time.” About a year after its release Lloyd was shown a 10-minute kiddie version of The Shining at a local cinema. He was 10 or 11 before he finally saw the real deal. Did it scare him? “No. For me when I watch The Shining, it’s like watching a home movie. I understand how it scares people. I think it’s an entertaining movie, don’t get me wrong. But I look back on it with so many memories.” These days he prefers watching documentaries to horror films. So what happened after The Shining? Where did he go? Lloyd continued to audition for roles “but with no success really”. He finally quit when he was 13 or 14. Did he find the rejection upsetting? “No, I wouldn’t say it was upsetting. I always enjoyed it. It was exciting. But as I got a little bit older, it got kind of boring. Then I had to tell my parents that I was ready to quit. Which they were fine with. They were never stage parents. They made sure I had a normal upbringing.” I wonder if things might have turned out different today? The breakout child stars from Stranger Things have been plastered over magazines, already joining the celebrity hoopla. “I think that’s entirely possible. But I’m quite happy with how things went, really. I feel like I pretty much hit the lottery with the The Shining. I have seen those kids from Stranger Things. That popularity must be dizzying for ’em.” So, no regrets? “No. I don’t regret trying acting. When I decided to stop, I don’t regret that either. At the end of the day, it’s not a huge deal. Well, it is and it isn’t. I still have to grade the tests at school, get the kids to bed. All the regular stuff.” The Shining is in cinemas across the UK on 31 October accompanied by short film Work &amp; Play: A Short Film About The Shining directed by Matt Wells. Four more child stars who opted for early retirement Peter Ostrum Aged 12, Peter Ostrum beat thousands of hopefuls to play golden ticket-winner Charlie Bucket in the 1971 film Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory. The Oompa Loompas must have got something wrong, however; afterwards he turned down a three-movie deal and became vet for large animals. He lives in rural New York, and never acted again after his debut. Mara Wilson Hollywood could not get enough Mara Wilson (Mrs Doubtfire, Matilda) when she was an adorable seven-year-old. But when Wilson hit her teenage years, the phone stopping ringing and she became the target of confidence-crushing scrutiny of her appearance (a film critic called her “odd looking” at 13). Wilson is now a writer and playwright. Last year she published a memoir about life as a child star. Mary Badham Mary Badham was a tomboyish nine-year-old when she was cast as Scout in the film of To Kill a Mockingbird. Despite not being able to cry on demand during a crucial scene with Gregory Peck (the crew had to blow onion juice in her eye) Badham picked up an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. After a couple more films, she quit acting at 14 and later worked as an art restorer. Jeff Cohen Fancy having Chunk from the Goonies as your lawyer? For fans of the film, he will always be remembered for lifting his Hawaiian shirt at the gate of Mikey Walsh’s house to do the truffle shuffle. But these days Jeff Cohen works behind the scenes in Hollywood as an entertainment attorney. “I didn’t give up acting. Acting gave me up,” he later said. The roles dried up as he hit puberty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/27/health-experts-trump-opioid-emergency-magical-thinking-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T10:00:26Z","webTitle":"Health experts say Trump's opioid response relies on magical thinking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/27/health-experts-trump-opioid-emergency-magical-thinking-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/27/health-experts-trump-opioid-emergency-magical-thinking-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Health experts say Trump's opioid response relies on magical thinking","bodyText":"When Donald Trump directed his administration to declare America’s opioid overdose crisis a public health emergency, Republicans swiftly praised his “bold national leadership”. But with no new funding, many public health experts and state officials said it was “magical thinking” to imagine that the declaration would stem the tide of opioid overdoses that has already killed 183,000. “We need more resources,” said Dr Jay Butler, chief medical officer for the state of Alaska, who was at the White House for Trump’s announcement. Butler said the president’s speech sounded “a call for an opioids moonshot, but in order to focus resources, you need resources”. Announcing the measure, Trump called on Americans to come together as a national family, and laid out a sweeping call for reform, though it mostly lacked specifics. “The federal government is aggressively fighting the opioid epidemic on all fronts,” Trump told a crowd of addiction survivors, Congress members and law enforcement officials at the White House. “We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic. We can do it.” In addition to a national health emergency, Trump announced an intention to sue pharmaceutical companies; to pull an “evil” opioid from the market; to create an addiction education campaign for youth; and to build a wall on the southern border of the United States. He also called for a public-private partnership between scientists at the National Institutes of Health and drug companies to develop non-addictive painkillers, and pledged to suspend an obscure provision of federal law that bars public funds from paying for addiction treatment in facilities with more than 16 beds. The president’s proposals heartened some. “We went into it hopeful that it would be a comprehensive strategy, and it was just that.” said Jessica Nickel, president of the Addiction Policy Forum. “Using the public health emergency route makes a lot of sense. This is a health condition, an illness.” But it was what the president left out of his announcement that most frustrated many addiction treatment advocates. Trump failed to call for more funding; stopped short of declaring a more sweeping national emergency as he had promised and his own White House commission recommended; and declared the emergency as his administration attacks public health insurance for the poor. Jeff Levi, professor of health policy at George Washington University, said it was simply “not true” that the federal government was using all the tools at its disposal. “Declaring a public health emergency brings no new resources to the table, and there is a broad consensus in the public health community that we need additional resources for prevention, harm reduction and treatment,” said Levi. The public health emergency Trump announced is technically declared by the US health and human services secretary, Eric Hargan. It will allow people to receive addiction treatment through telemedicine. It will also make federal grants for HIV and for displaced workers available to combat the opioid epidemic. It also gives the health secretary access to the health emergency fund. However, the public health emergency fund has a balance of only $57,000, and some experts were concerned using funds dedicated to HIV could mean robbing Peter to pay Paul. Further, because public health emergency declarations are typically used to cut red tape after natural disasters or during disease outbreaks, they expire after 90 days. The declaration will then have to be renewed. “It’s not a proposal, it’s not a plan,” said Dr Andrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University. “If Trump is serious, this afternoon we’ll hear an appropriations request, I believe, in the billions.” “You want – in every county – to be able to walk into a treatment center and on that same day access treatment,” Kolodny said, “regardless of their ability to pay for it.” He estimated a request to “build out” an addiction treatment network in the US would cost $6bn. James Hodge, an Arizona State University public health law professor, said declaring a public health emergency, not a national emergency, was “a real missed opportunity”. “Failing to do that against the backdrop of his own White House commission, it’s hard to understand,” Hodge said. “That’s not, in my view, the president taking the opioid crisis seriously enough. “States and localities will be struggling to figure out why the federal government is not taking this more seriously,” said Hodge. Butler, who will be looking at the declaration’s details in his own state, said: “To think we can do a lot more without any new resources is really magical thinking.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/28/coalitions-night-terrors-play-out-in-public-as-kill-bill-missive-backfires","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T22:33:27Z","webTitle":"Coalition's night terrors play out in public as kill Bill missive backfires | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/28/coalitions-night-terrors-play-out-in-public-as-kill-bill-missive-backfires","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/28/coalitions-night-terrors-play-out-in-public-as-kill-bill-missive-backfires","fields":{"headline":"Coalition's night terrors play out in public as kill Bill missive backfires","bodyText":"If we step back from the controversy surrounding the tip-off of the police raids on the Australian Workers’ Union, this was a revealing week in federal politics. To understand why it was revealing, we need to mute the shouting and examine what is actually going on. Let’s start by mapping out the current political contest, the pure politics theatre – leader versus leader, and the battle to secure the number of seats required to form a government. If we strip it back to that level, the Coalition has two preoccupations or objectives. The first is “get Bill”. The government fancies Shorten is Labor’s weakest link. Polling suggests that Australians, as of today, are angry or disengaged enough to toss out Malcolm Turnbull’s government, but they aren’t entirely sold on the Labor leader. So if you are a prime minister who might, periodically, be entranced by the mirage of a knockout blow (an instinct which has gotten Turnbull into trouble in the past), or even if you aren’t after a KO but are in the market for some momentum and a sense that fortune has turned in your favour, you will peck away at Shorten, hoping to convince voters that their hesitation is well founded. So this pecking away happens constantly, often on the theme of Bill did a bad, bad thing (to borrow from Chris Isaak; sorry, yes, my musical tastes really are that sad). Just a little backing track. But this week, the backing track shifted to top 40, courtesy of some enthusiastic stage management – an ill-advised media tip-off about the AWU police raids, which were connected to an investigation of old donations to GetUp when Shorten was the AWU boss in 2006. A bonfire ensued, roaring back, as fires sometimes do, on the people clutching the kindling and the matches. Now, we need to get to our second issue, which is the Coalition’s marginal seats problem. Quick recap. Turnbull very nearly lost the last federal election. We all remember. I clearly recall speaking to Liberals during the campaign, who were, quite literally, overwhelmed by the resources of their progressive opponents on the ground, feeling like rabbits in the headlights. The government knows that it has a major structural disadvantage in its field operation – what the political types call the ground game – because the Coalition is not supported by progressive activist groups like GetUp and the trade union movement, which campaign in parallel to progressive political parties, amplifying their effort. Now it’s a myth that trade unions support only the ALP. Certainly the majority of the effort goes that way, but unions these days also hedge their bets, helping the Greens and some other non-aligned players on the Senate crossbench in an effort to protect themselves against adverse legislative developments in Canberra. In any case, the government doesn’t quite fathom this subtlety, and sees only its problem – the fact that the centre-right in this country lacks a field operation of a comparable scale to the progressive side, and this is a serious problem if you want to win elections, unless you can counter it with some spooky kind of data magic, and even then, that gets you only so far. Ever since the last election it almost lost, the Coalition has not been able to shut up about the evils of GetUp. The night terrors play out in public, and they are amplified by a campaign the Australian newspaper is running against the activist organisation. As well as fixating on GetUp, the government has also redoubled its efforts post election to tie up the trade union movement across a range of fronts, with at least five major legislative proposals wending their way through the parliament since Turnbull returned to the Lodge. It’s no great thunderclap for Liberal governments to be intrinsically hostile to union activities; in fact that’s an article of faith for the conservative base. But the current union containment agenda across a range of fronts is busy, busy, busy. So busy in fact, that some in the union movement think the agenda is actually more about obstruction, about tying them up and diverting resources that might otherwise go into field campaigns, as it is about the practicalities of labour market regulation. Now in calling out the Coalition’s obsessive compulsions on this front, I need to be clear about my own views. Transparency needs to be at the heart of any healthy political system. Union members have a right to know how their money is being spent. Voters also have a right to know who is influencing politics and bankrolling various campaigns, whether the campaigns be progressive left, hard right, or any shade in between. So I think it’s entirely reasonable that Shorten and the AWU account for their donations a decade ago and explain whether proper processes were followed. I also think the funding flowing to activist groups, whether on the left or the right of the spectrum, should be transparent if the groups are politically active. But putting my view about the merits of transparency to one side, and tracking back now to the events of the week, and viewing them through the prism of the Coalition’s political preoccupations, you can see why the government overreached. You can see why a combination of a police raid, Bill Shorten, a trade union and a donation to a loathed activist group felt like “bonanza”, “bingo” and “boom” in the eyes of the warriors in the Coalition bunker. You can see why getting the cameras on the scene before the cops would have felt, in the amped-up universe of inside political baseball, like a good idea. It would have felt like triumphing for a moment in the minutiae of a brutal political contest. Sucks to be you, Bill, AWU, GetUp – that’ll learn ’em. Well, it learned the government alright. And the way in which the story quickly turned from triumph to tragedy underscores the fact the Coalition has sound reasons to be worried. Once the AWU was in the gun, with cameras on site before the police, the entire apparatus of Australian progressive activism swung into gear to foment outrage about abuses of institutional power. Furious union officials peppered the airwaves. The Labor party too, which possesses all the message discipline and internal coordination that the Turnbull government so clearly lacks, also swung into overdrive. The opposition rolled out one frontbencher after another to denounce the raids – on television, on radio, on the internet – and they took the ready convenience of a Senate estimates hearing to roll into full prosecutorial mode with the employment minister Michaelia Cash, hour after hour. The Greens also swung into gear, amplifying Labor’s concerns, making it a story about a misuse of institutional power rather than a story about a failure of transparency. So it’s true. The government has a clear asymmetry problem when it comes to effective campaigning. It’s a big problem for them. But how you deal with your problems in politics is actually quite important. Perhaps the Coalition – now at the end of the worst week it has yet suffered in office – could deal with its problem by trying to govern in sober and steady fashion. It could focus on the issues that matter to voters, and use that as a platform to inspire, and rally like-minded institutions to their cause. Perhaps the Coalition could deliver policies that working people were attracted to so that union members, who aren’t born with Labor chips in their brain, might vote Coalition rather than hand out leaflets and work in phone banks for Labor or the Greens. Perhaps the Coalition could just stow the too-clever-by-half strategising and focus on the business of being a competent government with something meaningful to say about the future. Because when the next election rolls round, voters are not going to give a stuff about the AWU giving money to GetUp, they are going to vote for the political party which they think has some answers, and an agenda which speaks to real-world problems. If the government’s unsteady and underwhelming performance continues, Australians will vote the Coalition out, and they will not care about whether they are fully sold on Shorten. We all know this to be true, because we’ve seen it happen, and in the very recent past. When a government couldn’t get its act together, and the voters knew it, Australians voted in droves for a prime minister they weren’t sold on. In 2013. His name was Tony Abbott."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/30/diary-of-disaster-the-last-days-inside-manus-island-detention-centre","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T06:39:28Z","webTitle":"Diary of disaster: the last days inside Manus Island detention centre | Behrouz Boochani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/diary-of-disaster-the-last-days-inside-manus-island-detention-centre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/diary-of-disaster-the-last-days-inside-manus-island-detention-centre","fields":{"headline":"Diary of disaster: the last days inside Manus Island detention centre","bodyText":"Behrouz Boochani is a journalist and an Iranian refugee held on Manus Island since August 2014. The Guardian invited Boochani to keep a diary of the countdown to the closure of the Australian-run detention camp that is due to close on Tuesday. Wednesday 25 October I woke up from a nightmare today. For a long time now I have been experiencing regular nightmares, and it is these nightmares that get me out of bed, nightmares that wake me as I sleep inside one of the warm tents within Oscar camp. Before I have even had the chance to consider my immediate surroundings I have a vision of myself outside the tent. Nightmares are a significant component of our reality here, an important part of the life of a refugee in Manus prison. I am used to sleeping until just before noon. During this period, and under these conditions, the heat of Manus has been somewhat more tolerable. For this reason, the nights have been a bit easier here in the prison. As soon as I awake I have to grapple with the images from last night’s nightmares, then immediately I approach the dining area to have breakfast. A few local guards are there, but the breakfast trays are empty. Furious, I just stare at the guards. They respond by saying they are sorry and that there is nothing left here to eat. These days, with the impending closure of the camp, there is never enough food to eat for breakfast or any other meal. At noon I go over to join the protest. For more than 80 days we have been protesting every day with the hope that the government will be dissuaded from sending us to Lorengau. During the protest all the refugees decide that we should chant slogans at the top of our voices in support of Phoebe Crane. Phoebe is the Australian women who has engaged in a hunger strike over the last 25 days in support of us. We also decide to gather for a meeting at 9pm in Delta camp to determine what strategies of resistance we plan to employ after 31 October. The central question is: what should we do when water, power and food have been cut? For the whole day I am engaged in interviews with a number of people. Among us there is a Rohingya refugee whose whole family is in danger of their lives back in Myanmar, a refugee from Pakistan who has an infection on his head and who needs to be sent to Australia for medical care, and other refugees whose role it is to write slogans on placards. During this time in almost every part of the camp refugees are consumed by discussions about the situation next week. Some men are playing cards or backgammon. Life inside the camp has become extremely mundane … just like all the prisons throughout the world. Night falls, and I am waiting in a long line to get some food. After dinner the meeting begins. This morning I woke from a nightmare, and now I have to go to bed with the fear of another nightmare. I expect another tough day tomorrow. Thursday 26 October As usual, I wake up around noon. In contrast to previous days it is raining. When the weather is like this one feels that the prison is more tolerable. A large crowd has gathered in the area between Delta and Fox camp. A tree with a large and robust trunk has fallen down onto the prison, damaging the fences. These kinds of unexpected occurrences always attract a lot of attention among the imprisoned refugees. This isn’t the first time that the overpowering tropical ecosystem of Manus forces its way into Manus prison, reclaiming its space. Reflecting on the incident, I entitle it “The Victory of Nature Up Against Steel”… a smile emerges on my face. I have a theory based on the idea that had the ecology of Manus not been so pristine, if it had not been so pure, perhaps all of us incarcerated here would have succumbed to the torture by now … we would have broken under the regime of torture and died. During all these years Australian immigration has been destroying the nature on the island; the desecration of the natural environment has been relentless. Australia has violated the sanctity of nature by disrespecting the habitat and constructing a prison. Today is another instance of nature’s struggle against the prison. I don’t eat lunch and go to join the protest. It is a peculiar protest because it is raining and everyone gets wet; regardless of the conditions a large number has turned out. An Australian guard is recording the number of people in the crowd using a counting device. This is their daily task: to measure the degree of support for the protests and send updates to Canberra. During the protest a discussion ensues about a report published by Human Rights Watch regarding the violations of human rights against us, in which they condemn Australia. Everyone experiences a fresh burst of energy. The rest of the afternoon ends like every other day. I meet a few of the refugees, while some of the others occupy their time with cards and backgammon again. At sunset a few are playing football while an audience of 200 look on. Sometimes the refugees take the game so seriously that one can’t imagine that this is a prison. It’s remarkable how these people forget that they’ve been incarcerated for 51 months. I am starving when dinnertime comes around. Like always I wait for the queue to reduce in size – I don’t have any patience for long queues any more. When it is my turn all the food is all gone. I get so angry that I swear at Peter Dutton a number of times. I swear out loud on purpose so everyone can hear. This manner of swearing is commonplace in prison; even the guards smile when they hear it. A guard sticks a document on the door of the dinning area; it writes: “Manus RPC will close Sunday. All mess facilities will cease &amp; 2 days worth of food packs will be handed out.” This is distressing, but I am pleased to read it. It will no longer be necessary to wait in the queue, and at least I can be certain that I will get something to eat. One hour later the police broadcasts a statement that they are prepared to help close the camp after the 31st. Everyone is terrified again. What is going to happen next week? I smoke cigarettes the entire night and contemplate this question. I hope I get to eat lunch tomorrow. Friday 27 October The agony of extreme hunger wakes me up early in the morning today – I’m out of bed early today so that I can make it to breakfast. The weather is cool. Whenever I’m able to find something to eat I feel a sense of calm. It’s been more than one month since cigarettes have ceased to be issued and I’ve been smoking local tobacco. Straight after breakfast I go back to sleep until noon again. I go to Oscar, Delta and Fox a number of times until I find some Kurdish refugees who lend me some tobacco. In a prison such as Manus being able to count on the kindness of those who share the same language as you is always something to be treasured. The protest has begun. We discuss the court case involving the deputy prime minister which led to him being disqualified from office. When something occurs in Australian politics everyone thinks that it might somehow lead to our freedom, but I explain to a few people that we shouldn’t forget the political climate in Australia and the fact that both major parties loathe us. Don’t forget that until now we have encountered three prime ministers and three immigration ministers and so far nothing has happened. I go over to Fox camp. The whole place is littered with garbage and the toilets are full of filth. Even cleaning services have been almost completely disbanded. I take a cold shower right next to a stinking toilet. I’ve become used to the filthy toilets, but still after more than four years I’ve yet to get used to showering with cold water. In this place a shower with hot water is an impossible dream. I do some interviews and do what I usually do up until night time. These days a lot of European news reporters are getting in touch. I feel that this place has become like a battlefield, and I’ve become a war reporter. I get in touch with the locals. For some weeks now many have been furious with the Australian government, and they are constantly threatening the refugees, saying that we have no right entering their society. Their interaction with me is all right, and they say that they have conducted a few meetings and have planned to protest against Australia’s political machinations in the next few days. Experts from Amnesty International and a few news reporters are also on the island. I speak to them on the phone and we plan to meet tomorrow. On Fridays Lorengau is a really dangerous place. Most of the attacks on refugees occur on this day. It is more or less a tranquil night. But one can sense the fear on the faces and in the behaviours of the refugees. And one can sense even more that we are now one of the most forgotten groups of people on earth. More than anything else, it is this feeling that torments me. I’m anxious about tomorrow. Anxiety and stress are the most pernicious feelings one can experience here. I’m anxious about tomorrow. We’re anxious about tomorrow. Saturday 28 October Again, I awake from nightmares. The sun isn’t up yet. It is the worst time to wake up because on the one hand, I am starving and I don’t want to miss out on breakfast, and on the other hand, I am extremely sleepy. I go back to sleep. When I wake up again, it is 11am and I have to wait another hour until lunch. Just a short distance away from my bed an Iraqi refugee, who lives with us inside the tent, is highly distressed and suffering. For years he has had pain in his eyes. It is harrowing to witness this middle-aged man lamenting in pain; he has been utterly degraded. He is an engineer. The bed over on the other side is occupied by a Sudanese refugee. With high-spirited enthusiasm, he calls me over – like he always does – to show me a picture of his daughters. A feeling of joy comes over him for a moment – he laughs, recites their names, recounts that the eldest daughter is eight years old and the youngest is six – then drifts into sorrow. Three years ago his wife has been killed. He has shown me their picture dozens of times by now; sharing his memories makes him smile and helps address the anguish. Then he asks me: “When will we be free?” I reply: “We’ll be free really soon, it won’t be long before we’re free again.” After lunch I call some people outside the prison to cancel the appointments I have made with them. These days no one can really leave the camps because the security situation is dire. The protest is simple today, it takes place without anyone engaging in any discussions, in an atmosphere of silence and heightened anxiety and stress. For the rest of the afternoon I am on the phone. Many major media outlets are waiting in anticipation to see what happens next. The situation in the toilets has become a disaster. The prison is full of rubbish and filth. The people who were contracted to clean this place have discontinued their services and there is no trace of any cleaning products. At sunset the refugees try to clean the camp as best they can. In the middle of working away, some of them are making jokes. It’s always the case that when the refugees are gripped by fear they end up joking around with each other. It’s a good strategy to forget the terror and stress. The bastards don’t give many of us any dinner, but I am one of the lucky ones who get to eat. All through the night the refugees discuss the days to come and the threats from the police. No one can sleep until really late due to the fear. Hundreds of people gather in the prison yard to talk. The prison has submerged into a state of terror, the atmosphere is full of fear and anxiety. It’s really awful that one has to stay awake all night and witness the situation here out of fear of experiencing nightmares. Sunday 29 October I wake up at 1pm today. I was pacing along the fences for the whole night; exactly what most of the other refugees did. Today the refugees receive pre-packaged food; now the long queues for food that existed throughout the history of the prison have disappeared. The PNG police force and navy are walking around outside the camp – it seems their numbers have increased. A lot of Australian guards have left Manus and we have just been left alone here. The presence of the military has evoked an extraordinary fear. We have not been sleeping properly lately. We are expecting an attack from someone at any moment. There is nothing more agonising than witnessing the agony of others, and what is even worse is having no choice but to write about them. I am weary from writing. I am weary from writing about people who have died. I am horrified at the thought of writing.

Top stories The Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, has stunned the nation by refusing to resign, saying instead that he will preside over a Zanu-PF party congress in a few weeks – ignoring the fact he is no longer its leader. Mugabe has just delivered a televised address to his impoverished nation in which he was widely expected to announce his resignation. The ruling Zanu-PF had given the president a deadline of noon on Monday to resign or face impeachment but the 93-year-old leader defied the ultimatum. “The congress is due in a few weeks from now,” Mugabe said. “I will preside over its processes which must not be prepossessed by any acts calculated to undermine it or to compromise the outcomes in the eyes of the public.” The head of Zimbabwe’s liberation war veterans, Chris Mutsvangwa, said Mugabe was “deaf and blind” to the desires of the people and that plans for Mugabe’s impeachment would now proceed. Mutsvangwa said it was time for the president – who has been in power 37 years – to step down. “We would expect that Mugabe would not have the prospect of the military shooting at people, trying to defend him,” he said. “The choice is his.” More than 200 Zanu-PF leaders voted to sack Mugabe as the party’s leader in an extraordinary meeting in Harare, the capital, on Sunday morning. The the divisive first lady, Grace Mugabe, and 20 of her closest associates were also expelled. Australia’s power grid can reach penetrations of 50% renewable energy without a significant requirement for storage to support reliability, according to a new report commissioned by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel. While the Turnbull government has made much of the need for storage to increase security and reliability in the national power grid, the new report from the Australian Council of Learned Academies (Acola) says at an aggregated national level, 50% renewables is possible without major investments in storage for reliability purposes. “More pigs will be revealed” – Asia Argento has spoken out on life after accusing Weinstein of rape. The Italian actor says she has welcomed the sexual misconduct exposés since her own account was published, but laments the slow awakening in her home country, where she reveals she has always felt oppressed. “We have been so lobotomised by the objectification of women that we, as women, don’t even know that we are being harassed and treated the wrong way,” she said. “Here people don’t understand. They’ll say, ‘oh it’s just touching tits’. Well yeah, and this is a very grave thing for me. It is not normal. You can’t touch me, I am not an object.” At the official launch of the LNP campaign, with Malcolm Turnbull, Peter Dutton, George Brandis and Matt Canavan to his left, and Campbell Newman and fellow former premier Rob Borbidge to his right, LNP leader Tim Nicholls almost cried. Speaking of his family, and the sacrifices they had made as he chased his dream to lead the state, Nicholls, the man who once faced down unionists with a laugh, and waved merrily to protesters, choked up. “Mary,” he said, directing his words to his wife who sat with their children on stage, “I could never do this job without you and I wouldn’t be the man I am today without your love. And without your wisdom.” The City of Sydney council has been criticised for publicising an anti-vaccination event on the “what’s on” part of its website, with politicians and doctors demanding it be removed. The $15 “Let’s talk about vaccines” information night is scheduled for Monday and promises to answer questions such as: “Government, media and the medical community are pushing more and more vaccines on us. Why?” The event is to feature a talk by vocal anti-vaccination activist Dr Judith Wilyman and was organised by the No Jab No Pay No Way – Freedom of Choice anti-vaccination group. Sport The Wallabies’ loss to England on Sunday was most notable for Michael Cheika’s incandescent rage at the refereeing. This has also been a feature of Australia’s past four defeats against England. Is this really the kind of image Australian rugby union wants to project to the world? An unconvincing England have beaten Papua New Guinea 36-6 in the Rugby League World Cup, in a patchy performance that will pitch them against Tonga in the semi-final, with Australia set to meet Fiji. Thinking time In a sprawling, revealing interview Sophie Heawood sits down with comedian Sarah Silverman, to discuss post-fact America, the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and rescue dog Molly, who sleeps in Silverman’s bed, in Silverman’s tiny apartment, in Silverman’s ever-expanding world. “This is going to sound obnoxious,” Silverman says, “but Mom always said be your own best friend, and I really, really mastered that. There is no one I’d rather hang out with,” she points at herself, “than this guy.” Amazon’s imminent launch in Australia threatens vibrant, community-orientated retail scenes, says independent bookshop owner Mark Rubbo. Bookstores are agents of culture, not just commerce, and along with local cafes, pubs, clubs, delis and theatres, they bind communities together, he says. “When publishers and authors from the UK and US visit … they’re amazed by how many independent bookshops Australia has,” he says. “In the US, there were roughly 6,000 independent bookstores in the early 1990s. In 2017 there are just 2,321.” A mural depicting the late singer George Michael as a saint has been defaced in Sydney by a man claiming to be defending his religion. It is the second time it has been vandalised in as many days. But while the 23-year-old accused of Saturday’s vandalism was being charged, the community gathered in Erskineville to put a positive spin on the large swaths of black paint covering Scott Marsh’s mural. Messages including “Too late, love won” and “#alllivesmatter” have appeared on the artwork, titled St George. What’s he done now? After spending last week crowing about role in releasing three UCLA basketball players from a Chinese prison, where they’d been detained for shoplifting sunglasses, Donald Trump has now turned on the players and their parents for being ungrateful. “Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail! Media roundup The Canberra Times leads with a photograph of Emily Stokes, whose mysterious and debilitating condition was solved by the Canberra Centre for Personalised Immunology, who were able to fully sequence her genome and diagnose Stokes with the incredibly rare Yao syndrome, an autoinflammatory disease of which there are fewer than 100 documented cases in the world. The Hobart Mercury splashes with prison inmate Sue Neill-Fraser (paywall) beginning a hunger strike in protest at being forced to move cells after “unusual” contraband was found in her cell, her family says. Neill-Fraser is serving a 23-year sentence after being convicted of the murder of her de facto partner on a yacht, and is one of Tasmania’s most divisive criminals, with many convinced she was wrongfully convicted. And the ABC has a fun read posing the questions: is everyone who lives in Canberra a public servant? The article delves into the statistics of how many public service the state actually has (42%) and explores what their lives are like. Coming up Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk will be campaigning in Cairns on Monday as the state gears up for Saturday’s poll.

And Democrats will pay the price","bodyText":"I think many Democrats and independent political observers are puzzled by the intensity with which Republicans are pursuing their tax cut. It’s not politically popular and may well lead to the party’s defeat in next year’s congressional elections. So why do it? The answer is that Republicans are pushing the tax cut at breakneck speed precisely because they know they are probably going to lose next year and in 2020 as well. The tax cut, once enacted, however, will bind the hands of Democrats for years to come, forcing them to essentially follow a Republican agenda of deficit reduction and prevent any action on a positive Democratic program. The result will be a steady erosion of support for Democrats that will put Republicans back in power within a few election cycles. The theory was laid out almost 30 years ago by two Swedish economists, Torsten Persson and Lars EO Svensson. In a densely written article for the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1989, they explained why a stubborn conservative legislator would intentionally run a big budget deficit. It has to do with what economists call time inconsistency – the consequences of actions taken today may not appear until the future, when a different political party will be in power. Thus the credit or blame will accrue to that party rather than the one that implemented the policy, because voters tend to attribute whatever is happening today to the party in power today even if that party had nothing to do with it. Thus Barack Obama got blamed for a recession and resulting budget deficits he had nothing to do with originating. No matter how many times the Congressional Budget Office showed that the vast bulk of the budget deficits in his administration were baked in the cake the day he took office, Republicans nevertheless blamed him and his policies exclusively for those deficits. Of course, another reason for those deficits is that Republicans systematically decimated the federal government’s revenue-raising capacity during the George W Bush administration with one huge tax cut after another. All of these were sold as necessary to get the economy growing again. The failure of the economy to respond positively was never taken as evidence of the failure of those tax cuts, but rather as showing the need for even more and bigger tax cuts. The payoff for this orgy of tax-cutting came when Obama took office. All of a sudden, Republicans noticed that there were large deficits and insisted that Obama do something about them right this minute! They even made the nonsensical argument that spending cuts would stimulate growth by reducing the burden of government. Democrats did a poor job of explaining how Franklin Roosevelt tried exactly that in 1937, slashing government spending because his treasury secretary told him it would restore business confidence. The result was a sharp downturn that raised unemployment, which had been trending down. Obama’s hands were tied by the deficit hawks in his own party as well and prevented from offering an economic stimulus adequate to offset the loss of aggregate demand resulting from the great recession that began in December 2007 on Bush’s watch. Obama even joined with Republicans to slash spending in the 2011 budget deal and put in place budget controls that made it virtually impossible to pursue any positive Democratic initiatives for the balance of his presidency. No wonder Trump won. I think Republicans remember better than Democrats the lesson of 1993 as well. Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 on an activist agenda. But once in office, he was persuaded to reverse course and put all his efforts into deficit reduction. This transformation was spelled out in detail in Bob Woodward’s 1994 book, The Agenda. Its key element was a significant tax increase that every Republican in Congress voted against. They said it would crash the economy, but was instead followed by an economic boom. Unfortunately, the boom didn’t become apparent until after the 1994 election in which Democrats took heavy losses – in large part because of the tax increase. Republicans got control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Clinton remained beholden to the deficit hawks for his entire presidency, doing nothing with the vast budget surpluses that emerged and hoarding them like a modern day Midas, despite pressing economic needs and growing financial problems withsocial security and Medicare that those surpluses could have fixed. Clinton simply bequeathed them to Bush, who promptly dissipated them with tax cuts and a huge new spending program, Medicare Part D, not to mention wars in the Middle East that continue to this day. I believe that the same cycle will rerun over the next few years. Should Democrats get control of the House and/or Senate next year, Trump and his party will insist that deficit reduction be the only order of business. Automatic spending cuts resulting directly from the tax cut will start to bite, hurting the poor and middle class primarily, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and making them forget that they resulted from a huge tax give-away to the wealthy that increased the deficit by $1.5tn. Democrats will get much of the blame due to time-inconsistency. It’s possible that Trump’s appointees to the Federal Reserve may be so alarmed by the inflationary potential of the growing deficits that they will raise interest rates in response. This could trigger a recession that will be blamed on a Democratic president taking office in 2021, just as happened with Obama. But that president may not be able to enact any stimulus at all because deficits crowd out any fiscal space. By 2022, Republicans will be back in control of Congress and in the White House by 2024. In 2025, they will demand still more tax cuts. Keep in mind that no matter how big the deficit gets from the tax cut Republicans are rushing to enact, none of them will ever vote to undo those cuts or raise taxes except, perhaps, in ways that further burden the poor, such as raising the gasoline tax. That is because they all signed a tax pledge promising never to raise taxes. Therefore, any deficit reduction will either consist solely of spending cuts or pass with only Democratic votes, as was the case in 1993. The originator of the pledge, Grover Norquist, planned it this way. I doubt he has ever read Persson and Svensson, but understood intuitively that the tax pledge was guaranteed to ratchet down the size of government forever. It wouldn’t happen all at once, but over a period of decades. The history of fiscal policy since the pledge was originated in 1988 is, sadly, proof that it has worked exactly as he hoped. The Democrats’ only hope is to defeat the tax cut in its entirety and not be seduced by Republican efforts to tilt it more in favor of the middle class. Once the deficit is programmed to increase by another $1.5tn the Republican trap will be set and Democrats will again be on the path to cleaning up their fiscal mess. Just say no to tax cuts is my advice. Bruce Bartlett worked as an adviser for Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush.

Wheatfield hair, slightly awkward smiles. Helpful at charity days, polite at press conferences, respectful about others in their field. Not quite with the cherubic aspect they had when beginning their current vocation, but hints of those chubby dimply faces remain. Steve Smith and Joe Root, Ashes captains, don’t fit the mould. It’s supposed to be all tough guys and hard bastards, sledging and chuntering, flint-eyed glares and “broken fucken arms”. Chappell, Border, Illingworth, Jardine, a legacy built on rough words and wads of brutalised chewing gum. Smith and Root are staunch, don’t doubt it. They’ve faced down scary bowling in draining conditions, soaked up scrutiny and pressure, and come out as two of the world’s best practitioners of their niche and particular art. Fifty-one international centuries between them, leaders of their sides by their mid-20s. They have never faced off in an Ashes before, but they could face off in three or four more. It could be one of the great rivalries. And it could be completely different to what we’ve come to expect. The two sides are not built in the image of those captains, but follow their style closely enough. This is a different time. After the fourth Test against India at Dharamsala this year, concluding an often fractious series, the question was whether this Australian team would follow the hard-edged route of the 2013-14 whitewashers. “I don’t think this group is at that stage,” said coach Darren Lehmann. “Obviously we’re less aggressive than we have been in the past. They have had to work out the way they want to play as a group and I think it has been brilliant. I have actually changed a bit in my ways as a coach and I’ve really enjoyed watching how they go about it.” Root, meanwhile, waxed lyrical in an All Out Cricket interview about the stated values of his primary school, including kindness and creativity. “All the best leaders have those qualities… We have some great blokes in the team who know how to behave and interact with people not just in the squad but those outside cricket who hold all those values as well. When you have the same views you become closer as a team.” There were a million ill-informed column inches in the 2000s about Michael Clarke being “metrosexual” because of an earring and a tattoo; it was a sort of mass howl of old men terrified at their own irrelevance. These days players like Usman Khawaja, Nic Maddinson, Peter Nevill and Adam Zampa can dress sharp, engage in cultural pursuits and not surrender their bona fides as cricketers. Khawaja and Moeen Ali have prompted and led conversations about religion and race, and avoid the booze-soaked sponsorship and celebrations that remain standard. Alastair Cook is the quiet old pro, Pat Cummins an eloquent chap who has just finished his university degree. Chris Woakes, Peter Handscomb, Matthew Renshaw, Jos Buttler, all fit the nice boy mould. Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Stuart Broad are more senior, but come across as pleasant human beings. There is the odd snarl, the odd throw at the stumps in the follow-through, but even that seems like it’s for show. Doing it for show was what came to mind recently with David Warner’s lines about hatred and war. Warner is the embodiment of Australian cricket’s change. The hard-drinking attack dog repudiated his ways, saying he was pushed to be aggressive by Lehmann and Clarke. In the West Indies in 2015, he adopted a monastic silence, and in the months thereafter became The Reverend. Teetotal, fittingly, Warner got into mindfulness and meditation. “I basically preached for a good month,” he said in a June interview. “Whenever I was at training and someone said something negative I would reiterate three positive things about them.” Another quiet operator, Nathan Lyon, came out with his own slew of aggressive comments on Monday, saying that Australia wanted to end careers, that the 2013-14 tourists were terrified from “one to 11”, and that it was an “unbelievable feeling” to watch a team disintegrate. “There’s a lot of scars for the English guys, especially coming over here, especially when we have two guys bowling 150, not just one now.” The antagonistic comments have a feel of fake it till you make it. Of senior players thinking that it’s their responsibility to escalate the war of words, rather than something they naturally want to do. Perhaps it reflects the faintest flicker of doubt in even the hardest of Ashes captains. “We have to hate them,” Jardine exhorted his bowler Gubby Allen, who refused to batter Australia with Bodyline tactics. “It’s the only way we’re going to beat them.” But beyond that, it raises a broader question: can you actually be yourself in the confines of an Ashes series? Do you have to conform? Starting with their leaders, the current forms of Australia and England both look like teams that have realised they’re better suited to another way. Clarke had the line about broken arms, but Starc’s best against Pakistan last December was, “Send his bails to Wales.” Australia’s sledging is dross. They’re pretending, and it’s not convincing. The speculation about whether Ben Stokes will join the tour is relevant – he’s always praised for bringing combativeness, but that attitude hasn’t more broadly brought good things. Root and Smith are some of the world’s best without it. But there survives the idea that it’s needed, among the things that are less pleasing about sport: the pressure to conform, to close ranks and close minds. Perhaps this time around, a few nicer boys can show that’s not needed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/20/the-situation-is-critical-cholera-fears-on-manus-as-water-and-medicine-run-out","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T04:25:02Z","webTitle":"‘The situation is critical’: cholera fears on Manus as water and medicine run out | Ben Doherty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/20/the-situation-is-critical-cholera-fears-on-manus-as-water-and-medicine-run-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/20/the-situation-is-critical-cholera-fears-on-manus-as-water-and-medicine-run-out","fields":{"headline":"‘The situation is critical’: cholera fears on Manus as water and medicine run out","bodyText":"The piercing pain in Joinul Islam’s right arm keeps him from sleeping. He can’t bend it to eat properly (to eat with one’s left is considered unclean), and there are precious few painkillers to allow him to rest. Four months ago, he was attacked by a gang in Lorengau, his elbow was sliced open with a machete and the surgery to repair it did not work. He was promised follow-up surgery, but it never happened. Now, he waits for more medical treatment that might never come. In the meantime, he bears the pain – his right arm fused at an awkward angle – without assistance. He has been told by Papaua New Guinea authorities he can get more painkillers, but only in Lorengau, the place where he was attacked. “I cannot go back there, I cannot go back. How can I go to Lorengau? I need a safe place,” he says. Seated in a quiet corner of the darkened Manus Island detention centre, he speaks barely above a whisper. The pain, at one point, kept him awake for two weeks, he says. “I am so tired,” he tells the Guardian, as tears well in his eyes. Islam has been formally recognised as a refugee, having fled persecution in his homeland Bangladesh. “My country, political is problem, is not safe. For safe place, I come to Australia.” Islam says he feels under intense pressure to quit the Manus Island detention centre, even to abandon his claim for protection altogether, and risk returning to Bangladesh. “All the time is pressure. My life is very difficult. I have been running five years. Too long,” he says. Islam’s case is barely remarkable inside the condemned the Manus Island detention centre – officially shuttered on 31 October, with all essential services withdrawn. There are few uninjured or healthy people among the 400 who remain in the camp, surviving on rainwater and makeshift wells, smuggled food, and solar panels powering phones that give them a link to the outside world. Inside the camp, the Guardian saw men who, while walking through the wreckage of the site, had stepped on nails that had pierced their feet. Their infected wounds wept pus as they walked. Others revealed open and infected sores on their legs – cognisant that Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei died after a small infection that, even with medical intervention, spiralled rapidly out of control in the detention centre and ultimately killed him. Nearly three weeks after the camp was formally closed, the medical situation in the condemned Manus Island detention centre has reached a new, even more dangerous stage. Even men who appear healthy are battling diarrhoea and vomiting brought on by drinking salty, contaminated water pulled from makeshift wells. On Saturday Australian Medical Association members voted unanimously to call on the Australian government to grant access for doctors to be allowed into the detention centre to intervene in what the association describes as “a worsening and dangerous situation emerging on Manus”. “It is our responsibility as a nation with a strong human rights record to ensure that we look after the health and wellbeing of these men, and provide them with safe and hygienic living conditions,” the AMA president, Michael Gannon, said. Periodically, Papua New Guinean police and immigration officials – on Australian orders, the Guardian was told – enter and poison the wells, befouling them with dirt and rubbish and making the water undrinkable. The men have some purification tablets and boil what they can, but their situation is unsustainable. “We have a new hard problem these days,” Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani says. “The toilets are full and there’s a bad smell spreading in the prison camp. Hygiene conditions are worsening day by day. Hope we have some rain today to wash away the bad smell. “The situation in Manus is critical. We are thirsty and have been waiting for rain in the past few days. We have some water we’re rationing but it’s not enough in tropical heat. Immigration destroyed the water we’d collected from tropical rain.” David Yapu, the police commander on Manus, has said fear of a widespread outbreak of potentially fatal illness was very real. “The centre is unhygienic, it is subject to illness such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery,” he says. Cholera, most often spread by unsafe water, is easily treatable with the correct medication, but without it, the infection can kill in hours. There is a meagre and dwindling cache of medical supplies inside the camp – and a fraught supply chain bringing more in – but refugees fear what will happen when these run out. Several refugees have become the unofficial medical officers of the camp, dispensing what medications they have. “Even when IHMS [International Health and Medical Services] were here,” one refugee says, “this all we got. Panadol and water. Whatever was wrong with you: panadol and water.” Many of the men, after four years in indefinite detention, have been on antidepressant medication or reliant on an ever-increasing regimen of sleeping pills. These are almost extinguished now. The Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said in a television interview last week the refugees still inside the Manus Island detention centre should leave it immediately, spruiking the alternative healthcare available. “People are squatting illegally on this maritime base and we want them to move peacefully. There are buses available; people can move to a new $10m facility where they have accommodation, they’ve got kitchens, they have running water, all of the services that you could imagine, including health services, security, etc; but people are trying to make a political statement by staying at the regional processing centre.” While there is greater access to healthcare for the refugees and asylum seekers who have moved to the alternative accommodation elsewhere in Lorengau province, this remains limited. The proposed accommodation centres are still being built, with limited running water and unreliable electricity. Refugees confirmed on Monday there is still no running water in the new West Lorengau centre. Seriously ill refugees are moved to Lorengau hospital, but that is in a state of disrepair and decay. The hospital is already far beyond its capacity, it has few working diagnostic machines, and regularly runs out of medicine itself. When a refugee was transported to Lorengau hospital from the detention centre two weeks ago suffering from what was believed to be a heart attack, the hospital’s only ECG machine was broken. Nurses were able only to take the man’s blood pressure before discharging him and sending him to alternative accommodation in Lorengau. The Guardian met the man in Lorengau; he has not had any follow-up treatment. Those refugees and asylum seekers who are sicker still are sent to Pacific International hospital in Port Moresby for treatment, but even here, there is often little treatment offered. There are more than 120 refugees and asylum seekers housed – at Australian expense – in hotels around Port Moresby. One hotel has been booked in its entirety for several months with refugees and asylum seekers from Manus. Australian Border Force officials are housed nearby. In the capital, the Guardian met more than a dozen refugees and asylum seekers awaiting treatment. Some have been in Moresby two months and have had a single appointment, with no follow-up scheduled. There are also several women who have been sent from Nauru with serious illnesses and injuries, but they have not yet been treated. “Everybody here is sick, they say we are sent here for treatment but nothing happens, we just get worse,” one refugee from Myanmar tells the Guardian. “We just wait, for what, we don’t know.

This is the main target for our team,” he said. “We heard from outside that Tottenham play for the title, blah, blah, blah. The most important thing is to stay consistent in the league.” The difficulty imposing themselves on the most challenging away fixtures remains a sticking point. Having lost at Old Trafford and Arsenal in recent weeks, next month they visit the Premier League’s pace setters at the Etihad Stadium. Spurs found it hard to penetrate Arsenal’s defence, and when Mauricio Pochettino subbed off Harry Kane and Dele Alli neither could feel they had been at their most influential. “The spirit was good, we were in the fight and able to develop our game with the ball in the floor. But in the final third we need more aggression and movement,” Lloris said. “Now we need to carry on. It’s true that we wanted to do more against Manchester United and Arsenal. Unfortunately we couldn’t do that so now it’s important to have a run of victories because we need to keep our place at the top.” Amy Lawrence • Match report: Arsenal 2-0 Tottenham Hotspur • Mustafi insists Arsenal have belief to defy the doubters 2) Wilson making up for lost time at Bournemouth When Callum Wilson broke his Premier League duck, it was with a hat-trick in a 4-3 win against West Ham United in August 2015. The future looked bright for the Bournemouth striker, but little has gone right for him since then. Two serious knee injuries in the space of two seasons were the cruellest of blows, curtailing the development of a richly promising career, and there must have been times when Wilson wondered if he would get back to his best, while Bournemouth suffered without his pace, movement and finishing. Against Huddersfield, however, Wilson gave Bournemouth a spectacular demonstration of what they have been missing in attack. The 25-year-old ripped the visitors apart, announcing his return to form with a hat-trick in a 4-0 win that carried Bournemouth towards calmer waters. It was the most cathartic of experiences for a very talented player.

Not that they are thinking of things that way. A team one point off fourth place and 17 ahead of the bottom-placed Crystal Palace are still concentrating on staying up. “The reality is still out there; 40 points is a big marker,” said Sean Dyche. Jack Cork echoed his manager. “We’ve just got to stay grounded and aim for that 40-point mark,” the goalscorer said. “After that, we can set new targets, but that will always be the aim.” Staying grounded has been a strength but carry on at their current rate and they will reach 40 on New Year’s Day. An ostensible focus on 40 points allowed Claudio Ranieri to deflect questions about Leicester’s surge two years ago. Burnley will not become the next shock champions but, like Leicester, their talk of avoiding relegation could prove a useful diversionary tactic. Richard Jolly • Match report: Burnley 2-0 Swansea City 4) Potential ban for Niasse is no comfort for Hodgson The Football Association is expected to refer footage of Oumar Niasse’s tumble to the turf on Saturday via the process for reviewing potential simulation incidents on Monday, with the three-man panel – comprising a former player, a former manager and a former official – to determine whether or not, in their opinion, the striker dived to win his team their early penalty. Each would examine the clip independently but their decision over whether this was “a clear and obvious case of simulation” would have to be unanimous for Niasse to incur a two‑match ban. Given the panel will presumably note the contact between Scott Dann’s shoulder and Niasse’s chest – there was no trip – and have been split on similar incidents involving Richarlison and Bernardo Silva to date this season, a ban seems improbable. “If they want to take action, good luck to them,” said the Crystal Palace manager, Roy Hodgson. “But I won’t get any satisfaction from it. It doesn’t change the result.” Dominic Fifield • Match report: Crystal Palace 2-2 Everton 5) Leicester on the up despite defeat to Manchester City Playing against Manchester City is perhaps not the best time to judge a side. On the one hand, you are likely to be beaten. On the other, you have the chance to prove yourselves against the likely champions. Let’s acknowledge, then, that Leicester gave Pep Guardiola’s team a game here. The 30 seconds that went from Harry Maguire hitting the post to Kevin de Bruyne killing the match was decisive, but until then the Foxes had been well in the game. Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez both imposed themselves and the duel between the speed merchants Demarai Gray and Kyle Walker was Gray’s on points (thanks largely to one audacious backheel flick over Walker’s head). Most hopeful was the combination between Vicente Iborra and Wilfred Ndidi, the pair playing together for the third consecutive league match and forming a partnership of strength and athleticism. Paul MacInnes • Match report: Leicester City 0-2 Manchester City • De Bruyne sees freedom and discipline as key to City surge 6) Klopp feeling the benefit of Salah’s evolution Jürgen Klopp offered a simple explanation for Mohamed Salah’s transformation from the player who toiled at Chelsea into the Premier League’s leading goalscorer with Liverpool, and it had nothing to do with José Mourinho’s mistrust of young talent at Stamford Bridge. “Physicality,” the Liverpool manager proposed after the £36.9m signing took his tally to 14 goals in 18 games for his new club with two goals against Southampton. Klopp admits Salah’s disappointing spell at Chelsea may have served as motivation but he also believes that Liverpool, more importantly, bought the finished article from Roma this summer. “Maybe what happened [at Chelsea] was one reason he came back,” the manager said. “For sure he wanted to show he’s better than that, but everyone knew it already. He was a kid [21] when he went to Chelsea and in that time they were really successful. It was quite difficult to come through. A little bit less muscle, a little bit less physical, and you will fly through the Premier League – but not like he’s flying now. I mean, one body-check and you are flying out of the game. With his body shape that’s now different. He’s a man now. He was a kid at Chelsea, now he’s a man.” Andy Hunter • Match report: Liverpool 3-0 Southampton 7) Pogba not in Gerrard’s class … yet After Rafael Benítez saw Newcastle United lose following a mini Paul Pogba masterclass he remained in no doubt that the Frenchman is not yet in Steven Gerrard’s class. Of comparisons with the midfielder who was his captain when he managed Liverpool, the Spaniard said: “No, they are different. Stevie was a top-class player for so many years. He was very consistent and could make the difference in every game, with or without the ball. He was a top-class player. Pogba is a great player, but he still has to be consistent for years like Stevie was for 10 or 15 years.” Benítez, whose side are five points above the drop zone, was less sure if he will be granted money in January to strengthen. “I don’t know what will happen. I will keep working until January as hard as I can to improve my players, and if we can do something, we will. If not, I will try it improve the players that are available to me.” Jamie Jackson 8) Manchester derby likely to come down to midfield face-off Pogba’s performance in Manchester United’s 4-1 defeat over Newcastle reminded the Old Trafford supporters what they had been missing during his two-month layoff, his skill crucial to the equaliser and his timing vital to finish United’s third. At least his injury came at a time when league games were more sporadic – he has returned in time for an upcoming run of 10 league encounters in 37 days, a critical period in which just maybe that slick high-energy football of Pep Guardiola’s could come unstuck. If there is to be a title race in Manchester then Pogba is surely United’s answer to Kevin De Bruyne across the city; when the two teams finally meet on 10 December the buildup will inevitably focus on the managers’ rivalry, but it is via one of these two exceptional midfield talents that a potentially defining derby is most likely to be won. Lawrence Ostlere • Match report: Manchester United 4-1 Newcastle United • Ibrahimovic says injury was ‘more severe than revealed’ 9) Silva hails his conquering wide men Marco Silva clearly is not one for rushing new signings into his teams. Marvin Zeegelaar arrived at Watford from Sporting Lisbon on deadline day and in eight league games since had made the bench just twice, and never played. “Of course he had to adapt to a different country, a different culture,” Silva said. “He knows better now our style of play.” He made his first appearance against West Ham, while Will Hughes – who had an almost identical introduction to life in Hertfordshire, spending two of his first nine league games on the bench and the remainder out of the squad altogether – made a first home start. Both impressed, with Hughes giving Watford intriguingly contrasting options on the flanks. Richarlison rampaged down the left, Hughes offered angles and options on the right and without ever being static allowed the overlapping Kiko Femenía to do the serious running. He received a standing ovation when he was taken off in the 84th minute. “He deserved the moment,” Silva said. “He didn’t give up, even when he didn’t get in the squad. He tried to improve every day. It’s a good moment for him and I’m happy.” Simon Burnton • Match report: Watford 2-0 West Ham United • Moyes calls for unity as fans turn on club hierarchy 10) Yacob erratic but still a better option than Krychowiak There was an amusing scene at the Hawthorns on Saturday just before the referee, Jon Moss, booked Claudio Yacob for a foul. Justifying his decision, Moss pointed to all the places where Yacob had committed similar offences after being introduced at half‑time. There were so many of them that the referee almost looked like a teacher doing a head-count at weekly assembly. This was Yacob’s first appearance since the Carabao Cup defeat by Manchester City in September, when his most memorable contribution to the game was an unruly tackle from behind on Ilkay Gundogan, who was making his first start after nine months out with a broken leg. There is, then, an objectionable side to Yacob’s game. But he also had an admirable dynamism, which is more than was shown by the man he replaced on Saturday, Grzegorz Krychowiak. The Pole has been an expensive disappointment since arriving on loan from Paris Saint-Germain.

Unbeaten in their first year under Eddie Jones, they have lost only against Ireland in 2017 without, Scotland at home apart, producing an entirely compelling performance. Jones will not mind, counting down as he is to the 2019 World Cup; he is completing a jigsaw puzzle, adding pieces each game. Against Argentina, England were largely on the front foot, building patiently, if unspectacularly, almost rigid in their approach. On Saturday, they played more off the back foot, absorbing pressure and feeding off mistakes. Performances should be looked at collectively rather than in isolation: in the past two weeks England have shown defensive resilience and opportunism in attack, buoyed against Australia by the return of Maro Itoje, a multi-faceted player whose decision‑making is invariably spot-on. He had been on the field only a few seconds when he spotted a run by Kurtley Beale and hauled down the full‑back before he had got into his stride. For all their strength in depth they have no one to match him. 2) Australia fall foul of ambiguous TMO system Australia were left to reflect on a performance which they were unfortunate to be behind in after 71 minutes but ended in a record defeat against England. Their head coach, Michael Cheika, had said before the game the Wallabies had developed a “no excuses” culture but after his team had fallen on the wrong side of every review by the television match official, he questioned the workings of a system that all too often adds ambiguity rather than clarity. If the yellow card shown to Beale for a deliberate knock-on seemed harsh, given that he had a try-scoring opportunity, and should have been reviewed, the three tries that were adjudicated resulted in the correct application of the law. In the case of Michael Hooper’s non-try, it is debatable whether the spirit of the law was satisfied. Originally in an offside position when Tevita Kuridrani kicked ahead, he held back and was behind Marika Koroibete when the wing played the ball with his shin. He had to be within an imaginary 10-metre line, but that was not part of the review, merely where he had been when Kuridrani kicked ahead. 3) Gap closing on previously unbeatable New Zealand A year after Ireland defeated New Zealand for the first time, Scotland were within one pass of emulating them. When Stuart Hogg realised Beauden Barrett was going to prevent him from reaching the line in the dying minutes, he tried to pass over his right shoulder but, making his decision too late, the ball went forward and the All Blacks, who had been outplayed for long periods of the match, held on. In years past New Zealand have tended to pack the team at Murrayfield with reserve players but, in homage to the home side’s revival, they were close to full strength and won because they finished most of the opportunities they created. It proved the difference as Scotland, for all their ambition and ability to last the course, too often faltered at the moment of reckoning. They can, though, take much from defeat, forcing the leading team in the world to dig deep and deeper. 4) France slide while South Africa achieve redemption South Africa held on to win the battle of the former heavyweights in Paris, but a few hours after Eddie Jones had pounced on a questioner who had asked whether England had been lucky that all the reviews at Twickenham went their way, what turned out to be the decisive score for the Springboks came after a forward pass from Eben Etzebeth to Jesse Kriel. It was judged on review to have been legitimate because the ball had been dislodged from the second row’s hands, an act that nine times out of 10 results in the ball being deemed to have gone forward. Not that South Africa care after the 38-3 defeat in Dublin the previous week but this was a match between two teams stripped of self-belief, powerhouses of the game who have lost their might. At the end of a week in which France won the right to host the 2023 World Cup, Guy Novès lost the 13th of his 20 matches in charge of the national side. Japan in a new stadium in Nanterre at the weekend is far from a foregone conclusion. 5) Second tier on the rise but Wales find way to hold on Fiji were within a penalty of drawing in Ireland and Georgia, denied contested scrums at the end, were a converted try away from a tie in Wales. Fiji recovered from 17-3 down to pull back to 20-20 before being sunk by a late penalty and Georgia were 10 points down in Cardiff after 20 minutes. Ireland and Wales were both below strength, which says something about their narrow victories. The match in Cardiff ended with uncontested scrums after the Wales tighthead prop Tomas Francis was sent to the sin-bin and the player he had replaced, Leon Brown, was deemed unfit to return to the field. Georgia were on the attack and had to go for a lineout after a penalty rather than their preferred option of a scrum. Wales said there had been no gamesmanship, but that was not their stance at the end of the Six Nations when they accused France of pulling a front-row stunt at the end of the game, a claim that was reviewed by the tournament organisers who ruled that the evidence was inconclusive. Wales face Georgia in the 2019 World Cup. Will World Rugby have put a deterrent sanction in place by then?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/19/zimbabwe-zanu-pf-meeting-new-era-robert-mugabe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T21:02:03Z","webTitle":"Zanu-PF hopes of a 'new era' confounded by Mugabe's failure to resign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/19/zimbabwe-zanu-pf-meeting-new-era-robert-mugabe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/19/zimbabwe-zanu-pf-meeting-new-era-robert-mugabe","fields":{"headline":"Zanu-PF hopes of a 'new era' confounded by Mugabe's failure to resign","bodyText":"It was meant to be the seal on a week of chaos, excitement and fear. State TV went live to Robert Mugabe’s residence, where the 93-year-old, who had been detained by the army and ousted by his own party, was expected to offer a humble resignation. Instead, he gave a rambling, 20-minute speech laying out his plans for the future. He promised a “new work culture”, more attention for veterans and reforms in a fractured party, then signed off with the defiant trademark of the liberation struggle “you and me, we have good work to do”. Crowds in one bar, who thought they had gathered to cheer the end of an era, first gasped, then laughed, then slipped silently away in stunned disappointment. Mugabe’s own party appeared to have drawn a definitive line under his rule earlier on Sunday after a week of limbo and confusion. Gathered in Zanu-PF’s concrete conference hall in central Harare, the same men and women who had cheered on the ageing president for decade after decade, bending to his every will, voted to end his political career. They stripped him of party leadership, handed out an ultimatum for his resignation, and decided the succession. Former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, ousted from party positions in the same place by the same delegates barely a month earlier, was crowned Zimbabwe’s new leader in waiting to wails of delight. Mugabe was either unable or unwilling to accept that the party that for so long had cheered him on had turned on him. Instead, he promised to preside over a long-planned party congress in December, and even warned against “acts calculated to compromise it”. It was his first address to the nation since troops had stormed his house nearly a week ago, and began as if it had been drafted by the generals behind that coup. Speaking slowly but precisely, Mugabe praised the military for detaining him. He stumbled briefly, lost his train of thought and asked to start again. With the generals helping him sort through the pages, he seemed the archetype of a fading, failing old man. When he turned to the state of the economy, it simply seemed as if he was struggling to break a lifetime habit of grandstanding addresses to well-disciplined crowds. But when he turned to internal party politics it gradually became clear that he had no plans to resign at all, ending instead with a defiant sign-off. Earlier in the day, Mnangagwa, the former guerrilla fighter nicknamed the Crocodile did not show up for his moment of triumph and vindication at the Zanu-PF meeting, and the crowd were not even sure if he was in the country. Mnangagwa fled to South Africa after being ousted as vice-president and has not been seen in public since. Mugabe’s speech suggested his caution may have been warranted, but his absence did not spoil the enjoyment of supporters old and new. Delegates from around the country leapt to their feet, dancing, clapping and singing Mnangagwa’s name in celebration. “This is the day that is defining the new birth and development of our country,” said Mike Madiro, chairman of one of the provincial party branches that set Mugabe’s formal dethroning in motion. The day’s events began with a slow rollcall through all 300 delegates to the Zanu-PF central committee, whose stolid meetings belie its power. The party controls the nation through a parliamentary majority, and the central committee technically speaks for the party. Everything about this meeting was exceptional. It was the first time a meeting had been held on a Sunday – things had never been so hasty before, one functionary said – and the first time foreign journalists had been allowed into the hall to film and question the loyal voters. Most disconcerting of all, the high platform at the end of the room where Mugabe presided for so long, was empty. All the party’s top figures had been purged or arrested in the weeks of factional fighting leading up to the coup that spelled the end of Mugabe’s reign, leaving no one with the right to take the stage. After an uneasy reference to a “leadership under the spotlight” a temporary chairman took over. Obert Mpofu, a man who had once described himself as Mugabe’s “most obedient son”, now seemed thrilled to lead the charge against the ageing, fading president. The meeting, which everyone knew had a foregone conclusion, marked “a new era not only for our party but for our nation as a whole”, Mpofu told the gathering to furious applause. Junior party members milling around outside were already wearing T-shirts printed with that very sentiment: New Era on the back; Team Zanu-PF on the front. It was intended as a show of the confidence and unquestioning party unity that has helped keep Zanu-PF in power for 37 years, and which its new leaders clearly hope will extend that legacy for many more. Mugabe’s blunt refusal to accept that authority, promising to preside over a party congress scheduled for next month, sets up the party and country for a difficult showdown. The meeting held back from attacking Mugabe himself, painting the nonagenarian as a hero led astray by a clique around his wife. And when Zimbabweans poured out onto the streets of Harare on Saturday to call on Mugabe to leave, opposition politicians shared platforms and airtime on the state broadcaster with Zanu-PF figures, and political opponents mingled in the joyful crowds. The size and emotion of that march made Mugabe’s departure almost inevitable. For all the regional distaste for coups, it was hard for even his staunchest supporters to claim he had any significant popular support left inside his country. But Zanu-PF officials handed all credit for that march to their allies, the powerful association of war veterans, and a string of party officials cast Mugabe’s departure as a moment more of party than national change. “Please don’t bring political parties into Zanu-PF affairs. We are talking about our issue: we have a majority in parliament and we have a capacity to continue government,” said Patrick Chinamasa, a senior party official and minister for cybersecurity. Because Zanu-PF controls the parliament, its nominee for president should sail through to become new leader, and the party can continue governing without a break, he said. “Why would there be a government of national unity when we are in power, when we have the majority? The nation is already united.” Chris Mutsavanga, a former Zanu-PF minister, also effectively ruled out any unity government and said opponents should focus instead on elections set for next year. “Since we are in the election mood let the people choose,” he told reporters outside the meeting. “The ruling party already has a mandate and Emmerson Mnangagwa is the leader who has been chosen by the central committee” A graffito in the headquarters toilet proclaimed an even blunter message: “Zanu-PF will rule forever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/19/paul-buckmaster-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T18:44:42Z","webTitle":"Paul Buckmaster obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/19/paul-buckmaster-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/19/paul-buckmaster-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Paul Buckmaster obituary","bodyText":"Arrangers and orchestrators have often been pop’s anonymous heroes, but the name of Paul Buckmaster, who has died aged 71, was frequently top of the list for many of the most successful musicians of the past five decades. A classically trained cellist, he was on course for a future as a soloist on the international concert circuit before his life was transformed by rock’n’roll. His leap into popular music was given a jump-start in 1969 when he added the other-worldly cello and string arrangements to David Bowie’s debut hit Space Oddity, which caught the ear of Elton John. “When I heard Space Oddity, I thought it was probably the most incredible record I’d ever heard,” said John. “I said, ‘Whoever did that, I really want to work with them.’” Buckmaster had undergone no formal training as an orchestrator, but he learned rapidly, examining Beethoven and Haydn scores borrowed from the library and doctoring some music manuscript paper to write out his first full scores. In 1970 his bold arrangements featured prominently on John’s second album, Elton John, (which included his first chart hit, Your Song) and in quick succession came Tumbleweed Connection (also 1970), Madman Across the Water (1971), and, in the same year, the soundtrack to the teen romance film Friends, on which Buckmaster was credited as co-composer as well as orchestral arranger. His partnership with John lasted decades, and they last worked together on Songs from the West Coast (2002). His credentials thus guaranteed, Buckmaster found himself in demand from a roll-call of music industry luminaries. He was the eminence grise behind Harry Nilsson’s weepy epic Without You (1971) and arranger and conductor on Carly Simon’s smash You’re So Vain (1972). He added orchestrations to Leonard Cohen’s Songs of Love and Hate (1971), and wrought elaborate choral and instrumental parts for the Grateful Dead’s Terrapin Station. Buckmaster and the jazz trumpeter and composer Miles Davis were mutual admirers, and Buckmaster appeared on Davis’s albums On the Corner (1972) and Big Fun (1974). The Rolling Stones hired him for Moonlight Mile and Sway from their classic album Sticky Fingers (1971), and Mick Jagger brought him back for his solo album She’s the Boss (1985). In the 90s he collaborated with Lionel Richie, Celine Dion, Counting Crows, Des’ree and Julio Iglesias Jr, and in the new millennium Buckmaster worked his magic for artists including Tears for Fears, Faith Hill, the Darkness, Kenny Rogers, Guns N’ Roses, Heart and many more. In 2002 he won a Grammy for best instrumental arrangement for his work on the song Drops of Jupiter by the rock band Train. Born in London, Paul was the son of the actor John Buckmaster and his wife, Ermenegilda Maltese, a concert pianist. His parents had met while his father was on second world war service in Italy, and his mother enthusiastically propelled Paul into music. He began studying at the London Violoncello School when he was four and continued cello studies with several teachers until he was 10. Then his mother took him to her home city of Naples, where, with support from the cello professor Willy La Volpe, he won a state scholarship to the Naples Conservatory. From 1958 to 1962 he divided his time between studying music in Naples and working for his GCEs in London, then won a scholarship to study the cello at the Royal Academy of Music, from which he graduated with a performance diploma in 1967. It was his cello professor at the Academy, Vivian Joseph, who perhaps inadvertently enabled his move into pop music. He asked if Buckmaster would like to join a small orchestra that was backing assorted pop acts on tour, whereupon he find himself playing behind Paul Jones (formerly of Manfred Mann), the Scaffold and the Hollies. One of the other musicians then invited him to tour Germany with the Bee Gees in early 1968. Back in London, Buckmaster was invited to a recording session where he met Tony Visconti, who would become Bowie’s regular producer, and Gus Dudgeon, who would fulfil the same role for John, but it was Dudgeon who produced Space Oddity and asked Buckmaster to arrange it. Film and TV soundtracks proved to be another fruitful area. Buckmaster, who lived in Los Angeles for more than 30 years, wrote music for Son of Dracula (1974), which starred Nilsson and Ringo Starr, and for Midnight Crossing (1988), and he composed the score for Terry Gilliam’s 12 Monkeys (1995). He regularly provided music for US TV series, including Matlock, Frank’s Place and Jake and the Fat Man. He contributed a couple of pieces to the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and recorded tracks for Nic Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976), though these were not used in the finished film. His last film score was for Most Wanted (1997). Buckmaster also worked with a number of Italian artists, including Angelo Branduardi, Eros Ramazzotti and Riccardo Cocciante. His marriage to Diana Lewis in 1970 ended in divorce three years later. He is survived by a son, Banten, from a relationship with Rosalie Van Leer, a sister, Rosemary, and a brother, Adrian. • Paul John Buckmaster, musician, composer and arranger, born 13 June 1946; died 7 November 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2017/nov/19/robert-mugabe-set-to-resign-as-president-of-zimbabwe-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T21:55:07Z","webTitle":"Robert Mugabe stuns Zimbabwe by failing to quit – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/nov/19/robert-mugabe-set-to-resign-as-president-of-zimbabwe-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2017/nov/19/robert-mugabe-set-to-resign-as-president-of-zimbabwe-live","fields":{"headline":"Robert Mugabe stuns Zimbabwe by failing to quit – as it happened","bodyText":"Mugabe remains head of state against all the odds after refusing to resign as president. He was expected to stand down in a historic address live on television after conceding to military takeover. But instead he clings to power following a rambling speech which left the nation stunned and baffled. In a statement delivered in Harare he claimed military intervention, which saw him placed under house arrest four days ago, was no challenge to his authority. The army stepped in to block Grace Mugabe’s tilt at power. Speaking slowly and occasionally stumbling as he read from pages, Mugabe talked of the need for solidarity to resolve national problems. He ended his speech by saying he will preside over an upcoming conference of the ruling Zanu-PF party. His defiance comes despite his sacking by Zanu-PF and in the face of huge public opposition. The news means widespread disappointment for those who thought they were witnessing the end of the Mugabe era and celebrated in euphoric scenes in the streets of Zimbabwe yesterday. His refusal to go plunges the country into deep uncertainty. The leader of Zimbabwe’s influential war veterans said plans for impeachment would go ahead as scheduled.

Africa correspondent for The Globe and Mail asks: did Mugabe outfox the army generals tonight or is he just deeply deluded? Read Jason Burke and Emma Graham-Harrison’s latest report on Mugabe - Chaos in Zimbabwe after Mugabe fails to announce expected resignation Grace Mugabe was nowhere to be seen as the president gave his crucial live TV speech Speaking earlier Nkosi added: “Remember there is part of the community that still respects Robert Mugabe for the role he played in the liberation struggle against white minority rule. He was in prison for 10 years, he fought his way through until Zimbabweans gained their own independence in 1980. So there are people who still respect him even though they want him to step down so their lives can move on and that is why we don’t have a Gaddafi moment today.” Reacting to Mugabe’s speech, BBC news analyst Milton Nkosi said: “He has vowed to stay on. He wants to die in office. But it is clear there is very little room for him to manoeuvre. There is no way for him to survive this week”. Chris Mutsvangwa, the chairman of the Zimbabwe War Veterans Association and leader of the campaign to oust the embattled president, says Mugabe is “deaf and blind” to the desires of the people. Lots of people are joking on Twitter that Mugabe missed out the key pages of his speech which detailed his resignation. He stated “intergenerational conflict must be resolved,” a reference to his apparent positioning of his unpopular 52-year-old wife to succeed him. In his speech, Mugabe said “failures of the past” may have triggered anger “in some quarters, which he calls “quite understandable”. Sky’s David Bowden says Mugabe’s address was “an extraordinary ramble by an old man who seems to have just blazed on through and has said we are going to have a congress in a few weeks time and I am going to preside over it”. Chris Mutsvangwa, who has been leading a campaign to oust Mugabe, told Reuters in a text message moments after the speech that people would take to the streets of Harare on Wednesday. Mugabe was constantly shuffling papers during his rambling speech. Mugabe has stunned the nation by refusing to resign and has said he will preside over party Congress in a few weeks, ignoring the fact he is no longer its leader. Zimbabwe war veterans’ leader Christopher Mutsvangwa has told Reuters that plans for Mugabe’s impeachment will proceed. He was flanked by generals as he gave his speech - he tripped over his words and towards the end said: “oh that’s a long speech”. Commentators are questioning whether he perhaps in fact said “oh that’s the wrong speech”. He wants to stay in charge despite no longer being the leader of the ruling party. Mugabe has now finished speaking... there was no hint of a resignation in his address. He says “we cannot be guided by bitterness” Mugabe says he believes the concerns were raised in the “spirit of honesty and out of deep and patriotic concern for the stability of our nation and welfare of our people”. President Mugabe says “the government remains committed to improving this social and material conditions of the people”. He has acknowledged that the country’s economy is going through a “difficult patch”. He says “the pillars of state remained functional” amid the crisis, in which Zimbabweans rallied by the tens of thousands against him and ruling party leaders told him to step aside or face impeachment. Mugabe is poised to step down after 37 years in power making him the world’s oldest head of state. He says that Zimbabwe needs to “return to normalcy”. A frail Mugabe reads his statement slowly and pauses frequently. Mugabe says army intervention was “triggered by concerns arising from their reading of the state of affairs in our country and in the ruling Zanu-PF party”. Mugabe says a meeting with the military leaders today has made him aware of issues that need to be addressed in the country. Mugabe has begun speaking on state television. Zimbabwe state broadcaster is ZBC is now broadcasting live as Mugabe prepares to make his statement. The Guardian’s Africa correspondent Jason Burke is tweeting from Johannesburg as the nation is poised for historic address. Zimbabwe’s president Robert Mugabe is resigning after nearly four decades in power, according to a source close to the negotiations. The ruling Zanu-PF party sacked him as its leader after 37 years in power. The party said if he did not resign as the country’s president by noon on Monday it would start impeachment proceedings. Zimbabwe’s Herald newspaper showed pictures of the 93-year-old meeting top generals at his State House offices. Mugabe has been under house arrest since the military moved in on Tuesday, angered by his firing of his longtime deputy and the positioning of unpopular first lady Grace Mugabe to succeed him. The president tried to buy time in negotiations with the military on a dignified exit but quickly found himself isolated. Zanu-PF is to appoint the former vice-president fired by Mugabe – Emmerson Mnangagwa – as its new leader. Mugabe’s controversial second wife Grace, once tipped as his successor, has been expelled from the party. Zimbabwe’s state broadcaster ZBC is reporting that a statement from Mugabe will air shortly ... Sky News is reporting that Mugabe’s resignation statement is pre-recorded and has already been prepared. Chris Mutsvangwa, head of Zimbabwe’s liberation war veterans, earlier on Sunday vowed to “bring back the crowd” if Robert Mugabe did not step aside, but said he was concerned that the military would end up opening fire to protect Mugabe from protesters. “We would expect that Mugabe would not have the prospect of the military shooting at people, trying to defend him,” Mutsvangwa said. “The choice is his.” ITV correspondent Richard Gaisford has tweeted there may be a delay to Mugabe’s speech amid chaos inside State House. Guardian and Observer correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison tweets from Harare: Comrade Bob and Grace may go, but little good will come if power is retained in the hands of Zanu-PF septuagenarians, writes our Africa correspondent. Reuters is reporting that Robert Mugabe has agreed to resign as Zimbabwe’s president, citing a source familiar with the negotiations. The ruling Zanu-PF party had given the 93-year-old less than 24 hours to quit as head of state or face impeachment, an attempt to secure a peaceful end to his tenure after a de facto coup. The source said the military was working on a resignation statement by Mugabe, without giving details. State broadcaster ZBC said Mugabe would address the nation shortly. Earlier on Sunday, pictured were published by the official Herald newspaper of Mugabe meeting top generals at his State House offices. Robert Mugabe is expected to address Zimbabwe to announce his resignation as president after the ruling party gave him until noon on Monday to step down or face impeachment. In an extraordinary meeting in Harare, the capital, on Sunday morning more than 200 Zanu-PF leaders voted to sack Mugabe as the party’s leader and demanded that the 93-year-old resign as head of state. Here is our live coverage of Mugabe’s departure after 37 years as Zimbabwe’s leader, the only one the country has had since gaining independence from Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/19/marnie-review-london-coliseum-nico-muhly-eno","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T16:14:06Z","webTitle":"Marnie review – Nico Muhly's psycho thriller sounds beautiful but fails to thrill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/19/marnie-review-london-coliseum-nico-muhly-eno","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/19/marnie-review-london-coliseum-nico-muhly-eno","fields":{"headline":"Marnie review – Nico Muhly's psycho thriller sounds beautiful but fails to thrill","bodyText":"Given its world premiere by English National Opera, Nico Muhly’s Marnie is drawn from Winston Graham’s 1961 novel of the same name, famously filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1964. The subject, Muhly argues, “screams out for operatic treatment”, and his heroine – a thief and liar acting out of compulsive responses to half-remembered childhood trauma – certainly has antecedents elsewhere. Muhly links her fear of sex and physical contact to Debussy’s Mélisande, who, like Marnie, is also trapped in a marriage with a potentially abusive man. There are also overtones of Emilia Marty in Janácek’s Makropoulos Case, who similarly changes her identity multiple times for the purposes of deception. Muhly and his librettist Nicholas Wright follow the outlines of the novel rather than the film. Whereas Hitchcock relocated the drama to the US, they retain the original British setting – the grubbily monetarist home counties in the 1950s. We encounter characters that Hitchcock dropped, most crucially, perhaps, Mrs Rutland, the formidably manipulative mother of Marnie’s husband, Mark. Terry, Mark’s cousin in the book, has become his attractively dissolute brother. The operatic Marnie has no phobia of the colour red, and, as in Graham but not in Hitchcock, her mother dies before the truth about the past comes to light. Music and dramaturgy are stylised, at times a bit too much so. In a gesture towards Jungian psychology, Marnie is tracked by four similarly dressed “shadows”, who sing in Monteverdian close harmony, while eight male dancers in suits and trilbies hover round her, omnipresent reminders of the masculinity she understandably dreads. The chorus are both essential to the drama and commentators upon it. The climactic hunt, in which the death of Marnie’s horse Forio results in her first experience of grief, is closer to oratorio than opera – a big choral narrative, followed by a succession of arias. The score has passages of undeniable beauty. Muhly twins each protagonist with an orchestral instrument. An oboe, by turns elegant and shrill, probes Marnie’s psyche. Growling trombones suggest Mark’s desire, while a trumpet, sleazy yet poised, conveys Terry’s louche charm. A lyrical warmth characterises Muhly’s vocal lines, and the choral writing, geared to the ENO chorus for whom Muhly has expressed great admiration, is tremendous, arguably constituting the finest music in the entire work. Yet there is a major flaw, which is primarily one of tone. Muhly’s approach is essentially reflective and there’s too little menace and tension throughout. The crucial figure of Marnie’s abusive mother strikes me as under-characterised. This psychological thriller doesn’t always thrill as it should. It is, however, superbly done. Sasha Cooke and Daniel Okulitch, fine artists both, admirably convey the central couple’s difficult relationship. Neither character is immediately sympathetic, though both performers keep us the right side of empathy. Cooke sounds gorgeous and is a compelling actor. Okulitch has a nice line in vulnerability that makes Mark’s predatory sexuality all the more troubling. Countertenor James Laing is the ambiguously motivated Terry, to whom Muhly allots arguably the most memorable aria in the score. There are strong cameos from Lesley Garrett as Mrs Rutland, and Diana Montague as Lucy, the friend of Marnie’s mother who holds the key to the past. Michael Mayer’s staging has an elegant fluidity that whisks us from offices to mansions and from tenements to a psychoanalyst’s consulting rooms. Martyn Brabbins conducts with great sensitivity. The playing and choral singing are outstanding. •At Coliseum, London, until 3 December.

He translated from French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, and in his 60s studied Russian, Polish and Serbo-Croat. He also learned enough Anglo-Saxon to read the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and enough Welsh to be able to sing the anthem at Cardiff Arms Park. Kenneth was born in Dudley, West Midlands, to Doris (nee Roper), a teacher, and Harold Chambers, an engineering draughtsman, and went to Dudley grammar school. He was offered a scholarship to Oxford, but preferred to take up a place at Birmingham University so that at 5am he could open up the newsagent that his parents had established when his father’s company hit hard times. Then he cycled eight miles to the university. Graduating in history, economics and French in 1939, he was immediately called up and was offered a commission in RAF intelligence. However, as a believer in the sanctity of life he felt he could not take up the post and instead volunteered as a nursing orderly, witnessing the atrocities of the second world war in North Africa, Italy and France. In 1941, during a brief period of leave, he married his childhood sweetheart, Norah Westwood, who worked in a draper’s shop. They had a brief honeymoon in Llandudno, north Wales, that coincided with a devastating bombing raid on Liverpool, which they watched from their bedroom. At the end of the war, demobbed as a sergeant and honoured with the British Empire Medal for Gallantry, he briefly tried teaching before successfully applying for a post of translator with the OECD in Paris. In early 1949, shortly after my birth, my mother flew out with me to join him. In 1955 my father brought the family to London to continue his career as a translator for the Western European Union, a postwar military alliance designed to counter the communist threat from eastern Europe. He stayed there until retirement at the age of 65. With a passion for rugby, he supported London Welsh in the glory days of JPR Williams, held a debenture seat at Cardiff Arms Park and travelled to New Zealand for the 1977 British Lions tour. He loved fine wine and dining, travelling, debating and completing the Guardian crossword every day. He was never permitted to demonstrate any political allegiance because of his security clearance with the Western European Union. However, his father had been a Labour party agent for Tony Benn’s father, William Wedgwood Benn, Viscount Stansgate, and my mother’s display of red flowers in our front window at every election suggested that he continued along that path. Norah died in 2006. He is survived by me and by three grandsons, Sam, William and James."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/19/ireland-is-caught-between-brexiteers-and-brussels","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T19:12:49Z","webTitle":"Ireland is caught between Brexiteers and Brussels | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/19/ireland-is-caught-between-brexiteers-and-brussels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/19/ireland-is-caught-between-brexiteers-and-brussels","fields":{"headline":"Ireland is caught between Brexiteers and Brussels","bodyText":"Rafael Behr’s brilliant evisceration of the UK government’s shambolic handling of Brexit makes for depressing reading from the Dublin side of the Irish Sea (As Tories slug it out, does anyone care about Ireland?, 15 November). However, the suspicion remains here that the problem is not just with London but with Brussels too. Brexit was initially met with anger by most Irish people but the upset receded as everyday life got in the way. Now it is back, and the island of Ireland is staring down the barrel of a hard border. These are glum and worrying times. Ireland is caught between undoubtedly ignorant rightwing Eurosceptic British politicians and the mammoth Brussels bureaucracy. Europe will let us down if it feels it is absolutely necessary to do so for its own prosperity and survival. In 2011, the European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet warned the Irish finance minister Michael Noonan that a “bomb would go off” in Dublin if Ireland dared to burn bondholders. The Irish people have been solely carrying the massive debt burden of our banking collapse ever since – including, scandalously, the huge losses of international speculative investors. When push comes to shove, will Ireland be a sacrificial lamb for Brussels in the Brexit negotiations as it was during the banking crisis in 2011? Quite possibly yes. The only difference this time, it seems, is that we might be sacrificed primarily for long-term political, rather than financial, stability in the wider European Union “family”. Joe McCarthy Dublin, Ireland • Spot-on from Rafael Behr regarding Brexit and Ireland. I like his phrase “diplomatic cohesion”. We have none. Theresa May can insist all she likes about being benign, but I fear she is part of a process – a process – of not taking Ireland or Northern Ireland at all seriously. No PM since Tony Blair has. I recall that towards the end of my period as a direct rule minister in 2006, I was asked at a Belfast reception by more than one person – did I think the next PM would take the same interest as the then current PM? There was concern that the situation would be fragile for many years. I said I hoped so. I was wrong. All three successors to Blair have failed to give the time, effort and commitment to the island of Ireland, be it north or south. There are a series of policy issues from energy to waste that are going to haunt the UK government during Brexit, and none of them need have been an issue. Jeff Rooker Labour, House of Lords; minister of state, Northern Ireland Office, 2005-06 • No one with even a cursory knowledge of Irish history can be surprised that Tory cabinet ministers are willing to risk peace and prosperity there over Brexit; moments of even-handedness and reason, notably the Sunningdale agreement in 1973 and John Major’s 1996 Downing Street declaration, stand out from centuries of callous disregard and disrespect of Irish humanity and nationhood. While the Good Friday agreement was proceeding to implementation from 1998, already William Hague as opposition leader could not resist the tribal call to side with loyalist rejectionists at several points along the bumpy road, and few believe that the historic peace settlement could have been achieved under a Tory government. The reversion to historic type was well signalled by the insulting appointment of Theresa Villiers as Northern Ireland secretary. Her reckless Brexit views were proved to be diametrically opposed by a substantial majority of the Ulster electorate in the EU referendum. Tom Brown London • The DUP’s insistence that Northern Ireland is exactly the same, and must be treated the same, as the rest of the UK is a wilful denial of history. The terrible beauty of Ireland – a land rent asunder when six of its counties were politically amputated in the aftermath of 1916 – will become even more terrible as this jingoistic approach is brought to the Brexit negotiations. Did the Brexiteers ever give the slightest thought to the problems of Ireland, its internal border and the fallout from Britain’s imperial past? I doubt it. I suspect they were used to seeing their homeland geography as a very British archipelago with the southern part of its western island (the Republic of Ireland land mass) lopped off. An irrelevance. Alison Hackett Dun Laoghaire, Co Dublin, Ireland • So Arlene Foster thinks a Corbyn-led government would be “disastrous for Northern Ireland”. Given that she leads a party that supports a hard Brexit despite a clear majority of the people in the north voting remain, I don’t know whether to laugh or cry. If it is not stopped, the government she supports will do far more damage to all of Ireland than any recent administration. That is a potential disaster worth worrying about.

Republicans’ current tax reform legislation would slash corporate tax rates and benefit wealthy Americans. Last week, after the president tweeted that he wanted legislation to include a repeal of a key healthcare mandate, Senate Republicans announced they would include the healthcare measure in their tax bill. “If it becomes an impediment to getting the best tax bill we can, then we’re OK with taking it out,” Mulvaney told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday. “It’s up to the Senate and the House to hammer out those details.” “I don’t actually” think it’s an impediment now, Mulvaney added. “If we can repeal part of Obamacare as part of a tax bill, and we have a tax bill that is still a good tax bill that can pass, that’s great.” A non-partisan analysis concluded that if the Senate tax bill became law, Americans who earned $30,000 or less each year would begin to pay higher taxes starting in 2021. CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked Mulvaney about this statistic and whether it was appropriate that low-income families would see their taxes go up as people in the highest-income levels get thousands or even millions of dollars of tax relief. “Every time I come on your network, we have a discussion about how the proposed tax bill is going to lower taxes on the rich,” Mulvaney said, saying that he had “to smile” at the question. Asked why the corporate tax cuts in the bill are permanent, while ones for individual Americans will sunset by 2025, Mulvaney said that “ this is where Washington really does speak a different language” and that the sunsetting provisions were necessary to work within the rules of the Senate and “simply trying to essentially manipulate the numbers and game the system so that you can fall into this square peg”. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said on Sunday the tax legislation was “terrible”, and “must be defeated”, arguing that it could pave the way for major cuts to social services in the future. “When they run up a $1.5tn deficit, as they will in this legislation, they’re going to come back – and that’s what Paul Ryan is saying – they’re going to come back with massive cuts to social security, Medicare and Medicaid, because they say, oh, my goodness, the deficit and the national debt are too high,” Sanders said. “When the middle class is shrinking, when our infrastructure is falling apart, when young people can’t afford to go to college, are leaving school deeply in debt, when 28 million people have no health insurance, does anyone really think that the major crisis facing this country is the need to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the very richest people in this country?” Republicans have made repealing Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, a political priority for years. But repeal legislation has repeatedly foundered, with key Republicans withholding support from voting for a repeal that analysts say would leave tens of millions more Americans without health insurance. On Tuesday, Senate Republicans announced their tax legislation would include a repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate, the requirement that most Americans have health insurance. “I personally think that it complicates tax reform,” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, one of the critical Republican votes against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, said earlier in the week. On Sunday she told CNN: “I think we need to distinguish between taking away insurance from people who already have it, which is what the healthcare bill we considered earlier this year would have done, versus removing a fine on people who choose not to have insurance.” Asked if the tax bill benefits the rich more than those in the middle class, she said: “It benefits people of all tax brackets. But what I want to do is to skew more that relates to middle- and low-income families.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/19/search-for-missing-argentinian-submarine-fails-to-find-any-clues","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T16:29:03Z","webTitle":"Search for missing Argentinian submarine fails to find any clues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/19/search-for-missing-argentinian-submarine-fails-to-find-any-clues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/19/search-for-missing-argentinian-submarine-fails-to-find-any-clues","fields":{"headline":"Search for missing Argentinian submarine fails to find any clues","bodyText":"A vast search by a multinational task force for an Argentinian submarine that went missing in the South Atlantic with 44 crew members four days ago has so far failed to provide any clues as to its possible location. The hope that arose from seven failed satellite calls detected on Saturday morning, which Argentina’s defence ministry at first said could be from the missing submarine, is also dimming fast. The government on Sunday said it could not confirm that the attempts had come from the ARA San Juan. “Regrettably, we have not yet had any contact with the submarine,” the Argentinian navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said on Sunday morning. The satellite call attempts were registered between 9am and 3pm on Saturday, lasting between four and 36 seconds, but there was no voice contact. “There were seven attempts with a very weak signal that failed to connect,” the officer said. “We are trying to squeeze that information to obtain some concrete data and a geolocation.” Argentina’s defence ministry said it was working on tracing the location of the calls with an unnamed US company that specialised in satellite communications. The families of the ARA San Juan’s crew are deeply distressed, and urged the government to clarify the situation. “We want the government to confirm if the calls were from the submarine,” said Claudio Rodríguez, brother of the crew member Hernán Rodríguez, who was travelling on Sunday from his home in the western province of Mendoza to the submarine’s home port in Mar del Plata to join other relatives gathering there in desperate search of news. A total of 13 ships and six aeroplanes are braving strong winds and high waves over an area of 66,000 sq km (25,500 sq miles) more than 400 km (250 miles) east of the bay of San Jorge off the coast of Patagonia in southern Argentina. The Argentinian navy lost radio contact with the San Juan after its last scheduled transmission on Wednesday morning. It was on a 10-day voyage from Argentina’s southernmost port, Ushuaia, to the naval base at Mar del Plata, 250 miles (400km) south of Buenos Aires. Argentina’s navy said it was not sure what had happened to the submarine or why it had lost contact but that it was now convinced the ship was beneath the surface and not adrift on choppy seas, as was previously thought. “At this point in the search and rescue mission we can’t discard any hypothesis,” said the Mar del Plata naval base chief Gabriel González on Saturday. “We haven’t been able to locate the submarine on the surface. That is why we are now giving priority to the search for the sunken submarine.” The Argentina-born Pope Francis mentioned the missing vessel in his weekly Sunday prayers at the Vatican in Rome. “I also pray for the men of the crew of the Argentinian military submarine which is missing,” the pontiff said. Among the planes overflying the area are a P-3 Orion plane belonging to Nasa, which has been diverted from a mission in the Antarctic, and a British Hercules C-130 stationed at the nearby Falkland Islands. In 1982, the UK and Argentina fought a bitter war over the Falkland Islands – known by the latter as Las Malvinas. The Falkland Islands government issued a statement on Saturday supporting Argentina in its search. “The Falkland Islands government extends its sincere hope that the submarine is found swiftly,” the statement said. The British polar ice patrol ship HMS Protector, equipped with sonar equipment, is also providing assistance. The US Navy said early on Sunday morning it would send an additional P-8A Poseidon marine patrol plane specialising in anti-submarine warfare with 21 personnel from Jacksonville, Florida, to assist with the search for the German-built ARA San Juan. Among the 44 crew members is Argentina’s first female submarine officer, 35-year-old Eliana Krawczyk. Her father, Eduardo Krawczyk, said: “We are extremely worried, with little news, waiting for information.” Other relatives were equally distressed. “We don’t know anything, we’re desperate,” said Cristina Ramallo, whose brother Javier is on board. Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, has travelled to the coastal city of Chapadmalal, near Mar del Plata, because of the situation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/19/home-office-admits-its-struggling-to-recruit-staff-to-register-eu-nationals","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T17:28:24Z","webTitle":"Home Office admits it is struggling to recruit staff to register EU nationals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/19/home-office-admits-its-struggling-to-recruit-staff-to-register-eu-nationals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/19/home-office-admits-its-struggling-to-recruit-staff-to-register-eu-nationals","fields":{"headline":"Home Office admits it is struggling to recruit staff to register EU nationals","bodyText":"Home Office officials have privately admitted the department is having problems increasing its immigration staffing levels as part of its Brexit preparations and may have to recruit Polish and other eastern Europeans to help register the 3 million EU nationals in Britain. Immigration lawyers said UK visas and immigration officials had told a recent business immigration conference that they faced a particular problem in “enticing staff to move to Sheffield, the city having been designated as the global processing centre”. The disclosure comes as the immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, is to be questioned on Tuesday by the Commons home affairs select committee on the capacity of the Home Office to register the 3 million EU nationals in Britain and to implement the immigration system post-Brexit. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has already told MPs that 700 extra immigration caseworkers have been recruited and hopes to recruit an extra 500 by next April. The Home Office said it would be looking to recruit extra staff in the coming years. But immigration lawyers in written evidence to the Commons select committee said even this level of extra staffing fell far short of the needed capacity, leaving each caseworker responsible for 1,500 of the 3 million EU registration applications. They added that if EU nationals were required post-Brexit to join the “rest of the world” queue at airports, the Border Force would also require significant extra numbers to avoid “unprecedented hold-ups that could damage the UK’s reputation on a global level”. Immigration lawyers also fear without a “seamless and simplified” new registration system there will be a repetition of the kind of errors that wrongly led to 100 EU nationals being asked to leave the country in the summer, with bank accounts being wrongly shut down and legal UK residents being asked to leave the country. The Home Office’s difficulties in “enticing staff to move to Sheffield” affect the hub that handles visa applications for work permits, student visas, premium services and family cases. Casework jobs outside London have been advertised at between £23,330 and £26,831 but lawyers said a recent decision to move assessments of applications from regional hubs around the world to Sheffield had added to the problems. The solicitors McGill &amp; Co said in October that long delays were being faced by a large number of people whose visa applications were being considered. “As applications in more and more different visa categories are being diverted to Sheffield, applicants are starting to face increasingly unacceptable delays in receiving a decision on their applications within normal timeframes. These delays are affecting applicants from both in and out of the UK,” added McGill. The Home Office said European casework was carried out in Liverpool, not Sheffield, where it said it was facing no recruitment problems. An extra 200 staff were recruited earlier this year to deal with the surge in applications for permanent residence from EU nationals and it said applications from the resident workforce were extremely high. But the Home Office also acknowledged that the jobs were not “UK restricted” and so were open to EU nationals including Polish and other eastern Europeans. “UK Visas and Immigration continues to perform efficiently and to high standards despite increasing demand for visas and immigration documents, thanks to the increased digitisation of our processes,” said a Home Office spokesperson. “The Home Office recruits on merit, not nationality, and we strive to have a workforce that is reflective of the public we serve.

The fact it was written by a journalist, a profession I aspired to, only made the book more appealing. The foreign correspondent GA Henty’s By Sheer Pluck was about an audacious lad from Deal on the English Channel, who wound up in the ultimate adventure – sailing to what was then the Gold Coast of west Africa. I won’t repeat the racist and colonial language of the book here, but suffice to say its hero sized up the backward and idiotic natives – some of my ancestors, probably – before thrashing them gallantly in Kumasi. It was an early introduction to my naive, hitherto sheltered younger self, of the fact that journalists could not be relied on to produce fair representations of supposedly exotic cultures. I learned, not without a sense of betrayal, that stories about African countries in the English literary canon were likely to be about brave, white adventurers pushing deep into dark continents and savage lands. Many such stories were accompanied by images of these men surrounded by bare-chested and dangerous-looking dark-skinned people. These stories were not created for people like me. Having learned more about the colonial history, I can at least understand the context in which these stories were written. But that cannot explain why, in November 2017, almost identical images are still deemed acceptable in Britain’s major newspapers. That’s exactly what happened when the adventurer Benedict Allen temporarily went missing last week “in a remote jungle in Papua New Guinea while searching for a lost tribe”, as the Telegraph put it. The newspaper saw fit to illustrate the story with a remarkable photo of Allen, and the BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, surrounded by four men with black skin, eyes glowering, wearing traditional costumes, including head and face gear. To remove any doubt that this was meant to be interpreted as a threatening scene, the Yaifo people of Papua New Guinea were described in the story as “quite a scary bunch” and their vocation as “headhunters”. I’m no expert on Yaifo culture, but I suspect there is more to it than scaring white people. The fact that what attracted Allen to them is their lack of contact with other communities suggests they were most likely minding their own business until BBC explorers saw fit to come along and track them down. I’m not suggesting there is no merit in seeking people who have hitherto avoided contact with British documentary makers. But there seems to be little understanding that this narrative has a history. As Robert Baden-Powell – a keen propagator of the adventure narrative – put it, the history of the empire is the history of adventurers and explorers. “Captain Cook in Australia, Lord Clive in India, opened up new countries. Speke, Baker, and Livingstone pushed their way through the savage deserts and forests of Africa,” he wrote. Allen has cited some of these men as the inspiration for his own adventures. I wonder if he, or those who wrote him up so admiringly, realise that their version of empire’s legacy was one of trying to convince people like the Yaifo, the Ashanti, and other “tribes” the British encountered, of their racial inferiority. The media’s role in all this – as Frantz Fanon explained so powerfully in his book Black Skin, White Masks – is to ensure the success of that message, whether through novels such as Tarzan, By Sheer Pluck, news stories, or whatever other medium could reach the British – and especially young white men – and bolster their masculine, conquering ambitions. Fanon was concerned with the effect literature and the media were having on young black boys who grew up reading it. Not surprisingly, his thesis was that it was traumatic. “The Bad Man, the Savage are always symbolised by Negroes or Indians; since there is always identification with the victor, the little Negro, quite as easily as the little white boy, becomes an explorer, an adventurer, a missionary who faces the danger of being eaten by the wicked Negroes.” I don’t begrudge men like Allen for their adventures, but I do wonder if they have ever contemplated the imagery and messages they are creating from the perspective of someone like me. It’s a giant act of “othering”, of placing people like the Yaifo as scary savages under a white gaze, and promoting raw colonial era ideology. And as for the press – which played such a huge role in creating colonial narratives of backward black people in savage lands – it shows no signs of stopping now. This is 21st-century, diverse Britain. Surely our journalists can do better than New models for media in Ghana If European journalists played a key role in building the empire, journalists agitating for independence within the colonies were equally central to dismantling it. Ghana – where I’m writing from this week – was no exception. From 1874 when its first African-owned, printed newspaper was published, to journalists such as Joseph Casely Hayford – still remembered for his work at the turn of the 20th century – writers, columnists and reporters influenced anti-colonial sentiment with profound effect. It was good to see the current president of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, drawing on this history at the Africa Business Media Innovators summit taking place in the capital, Accra. There’s palpable excitement in the business community in many African countries and beyond – the summit was opened by the American media mogul Michael Bloomberg – and a sense that new models for media business can both fuel economic growth in the continent and provide a return on investment. But the challenges are as breathtaking as the opportunities. Huge data gaps make it harder for the media to work. “Fake news” has a different meaning in countries where blatantly partisan and inaccurate reporting is an everyday reality. The pace with which technology continues to leapfrog a generation on the African continent is turning the broadcast media on its head, with nimble startups outdoing their competitors in capitalising on the opportunities offered by mobile phone pervasiveness and access to better data than their traditional counterparts. The Ghanaian president also, I was pleased to see, referenced the main challenge. Being a journalist in Africa still frequently involves derisory pay, and threats to life and liberty. Smart finance people congregating over business opportunities in five-star hotels would do well to remember that. A non-story The splash in the Sun, featuring photographs of BBC journalists catching some sleep during night shifts in the newsroom, was the most remarkable non-story story I have seen in a while. My initial reaction was that the headline should have been “human being feels tired in the middle of the night”. Hold the front page. We know already that as a species we are simply unequipped to do all-night shifts. The BBC’s many stories about how these working practices “throw the body into chaos”, and have been linked to higher rates of type 2 diabetes, heart attacks and cancer, were no doubt written by some of these very same BBC journalists caught fast asleep at their desks by a co-worker. Speaking of whom, what kind of colleague – generously described by the Sun as a “whistleblower” – creeps around their fellow journalists taking pictures of them asleep? The Sun sold the story as evidence of more licence fee wastage. I fear it might backfire, as the logical consequence would be that the BBC spends more on designated sleeping areas, so that much beleaguered shift-working journalists have somewhere other than the newsroom to take a nap. They may have to continue doing so with one eye open however, as long as there are Sun “whistleblowers” around."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/19/choosing-what-to-correct-or-clarify-is-presenting-new-challenges","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T17:00:06Z","webTitle":"Choosing what to correct or clarify is presenting new challenges | Open door | Paul Chadwick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/choosing-what-to-correct-or-clarify-is-presenting-new-challenges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/choosing-what-to-correct-or-clarify-is-presenting-new-challenges","fields":{"headline":"Choosing what to correct or clarify is presenting new challenges","bodyText":"Among the 30,000 contacts we receive from readers each year, how should we decide what needs correcting or clarifying? This one, from the Guardian in 2003, surely chose itself: • In our interview with Sir Jack Hayward, the chairman of Wolverhampton Wanderers, page 20, Sport, yesterday, we mistakenly attributed to him the following comment: “Our team was the worst in the First Division and I’m sure it’ll be the worst in the Premier League.” Sir Jack had just declined the offer of a hot drink. What he actually said was “Our tea was the worst in the First Division and I’m sure it’ll be the worst in the Premier League.” Profuse apologies. Ordinarily, however, judgments must be made, and as the Guardian grows on digital platforms and prepares to reshape to tabloid size in the UK next year, those choices present challenges. Editorial policy commits the Guardian to correct significant errors, and that commitment will remain. But many matters that come to the attention of a readers’ editor’s office are minor. For example, they may be spelling or grammatical errors, matters of degree or timing, literals or inconsequential ambiguities. Most do not stem from serious failings. Rather, they result from generalists gathering, editing and publishing at speed large amounts of information, much of it from specialists. Human frailty plays its part. People can mishear, misunderstand, misread, mistype and overlook. People cut corners and sometimes crash. Resources permitting, items below the threshold of “significant error” are corrected or clarified online because this improves the quality of Guardian journalism overall. Digital technologies make it possible to amend, and to footnote the fact of amendment, quicker and easier than in print. Efforts to correct and clarify online are particularly valuable because, in a 24-hour period, digital journalism is constantly being seen for the first time by fresh audiences in different timezones. New sleepers wake. Swift correction means error has less time to replicate and spread as people absorb and share Guardian journalism on social media and elsewhere. Since December 2016, the Guardian has published almost 3,500 corrections and clarifications (C&amp;Cs), and those online are outpacing C&amp;Cs in print. In 2010, when print and online C&amp;Cs began to be recorded separately, the ratio of print C&amp;Cs to digital C&amp;Cs was 2:1 in favour of print. Now digital leads 3:1. A newspaper is an artefact distributed in a limited area, and it fades in a way that the digital version of the journalism, available globally, does not. A newspaper is quickly thrown out and is unlikely nowadays to be consulted in a paper archive. Instead, people search and retrieve the same journalism in its digital form. The passage of time can make it disproportionate to correct a minor matter in perishable print. But that same matter may be worth correcting or clarifying in the digital form in which it will endure. Errors – significant or insignificant – are generally scarcer in print because less content goes in the paper than is published on digital platforms. The brevity of most C&amp;Cs belies the time they can take to prepare. A claim of error usually needs to be put to the relevant journalist and editor, authoritative sources are sought, and, when it is a matter of interpretation or degree, second or third opinions might need to be gathered. Since 1997, the Guardian has been committed to publishing a corrections and clarifications column every day from Monday to Saturday. On days when there is nothing significant, minor matters fill the space. They can be very minor, but also curious or amusing. (Corrections-as-entertainment is an established minor art/craft.) But as the shift to digital continues, the amount of time and space devoted to C&amp;Cs in print looks like it will need to change. Significant matters will of course continue to get attention. A sprinkling of fun will remain essential. But fewer minor matters are likely to be able to be corrected in print as limited resources are, of necessity, directed more to the journalism available on digital platforms. The following criteria help us to assess, in the circumstances of each case, whether an item requires correction or clarification: • seriousness of any potential harm; • consequences if item misunderstood; • urgency/timeliness/elapse of time since publication; • prominence of item when first published; • legal considerations; • degree of reputational risk to the Guardian if item not corrected or clarified. They are useful guides, but only guides."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/20/nurseries-ban-glitter-microplastics-seas-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T10:00:26Z","webTitle":"A gold star for the nurseries that have stopped being glitter bugs | Jules Howard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/20/nurseries-ban-glitter-microplastics-seas-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/20/nurseries-ban-glitter-microplastics-seas-pollution","fields":{"headline":"A gold star for the nurseries that have stopped being glitter bugs","bodyText":"What will the rocks record about the lives we lead? What might a future palaeontologist, human or otherwise, make of the structures that will come to signify these moments in which you and I live our lives? They will notice extinctions, of course. Fossils of mammals’ tusks and horns will abound in the rocks, only to disappear when we humans turn up. They will come across our mines – enormous trace fossils, perhaps the largest ever to have existed. They will see, by studying fossil pollen, that the climate changed. They will find our discarded KFC bones and they will wonder how the world supported so many chickens. And there, among it all, they will probably find that most awful of human inventions: glitter. Oodles of it – purples, pinks and reds – crushed into rocks the world over. Mineralised madness. Our lowest ebb. What will those future palaeontologists make of it? What will glitter say about us? I am reaching a point in my life when I am discovering the true awfulness of glitter. Having two small children will do that for you. Barely a day goes by when I am not picking the stuff out of my hair, my bellybutton or, inexplicably, my ear canals. It is stuck in the cracks between our floorboards. It is stuck in our carpets. There is a faint residue of it in our car from a spillage two years ago. It is in our children’s book bags, their beds. They love how it sparkles, but for me it’s become a charmless wretch of a product and we need to be done with it. Thankfully, I’m not alone. The tide is, I hope, turning against glitter. A group of nurseries looking after 2,500 children in southern England has just banned the use of glitter in their craft activities. With Christmas coming, they felt it was time to make a stand. The reason? The environment. Glitter is often made of plastic and aluminium, bonded with polyethylene terephthalate in tiny structures that scientists call microplastics. It’s capable of being blown vast distances and the sea, being so massive, is often its inevitable destination. Thirty per cent of all ocean plastics are microplastics like this, or the microbeads that the UK government has just outlawed. Many will persist in the environment for decades, where they are swept into foodchains, assimilating themselves into the bodies of fish, corals and crabs and probably many other species, piscivorous humans included. Glitter: it really does get everywhere. Not everyone will support the so-called glitter ban, of course. “It’s health and safety gone mad!” some will inevitably say. “Let kids be kids!” they will mutter. I agree, mostly, but I’m almost certain that a child’s love and appreciation of crafting will not be shot to pieces because of the absence of a substance that reflects the ceiling light in a few different directions, instilling a feeling of momentary half-amazement before the vacuum cleaner has to come out. There are alternatives – glitter that is biodegradable, for instance. And why shouldn’t we tell nursery-age children how the choices we make can safeguard the planet that they will one day inherit? It’s not really a “ban”, either. It’s not as if the glitter was being brought in from home, or snuck in by mules. It was just something that these nurseries used to buy. So I applaud this decision, and I applaud others who are finally turning their back on this pernicious, devilish dandruff. I dream of a world where craft sessions will no more finish in human tears. No more will I have to pick it out of my teeth or from between my fingers. No more shall I be fishing it out of our plughole or, more bluntly, my various body holes. No more. No more. This is an intervention. All that glitters is not gold. Perhaps this is our line in the sand. Our mark in the geological strata. A brave first step into a post-glitter epoch, and it all started with a handful of children’s nurseries. A world in which glitter has finally lost its shine. May we find new ways, as a species, to sparkle. • Jules Howard is a zoologist and the author of Sex on Earth and Death on Earth"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/20/mondays-best-tv-would-i-lie-to-you-my-mothers-lost-children-stalkers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T05:59:21Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: Would I Lie to You?, My Mother’s Lost Children, Stalkers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/20/mondays-best-tv-would-i-lie-to-you-my-mothers-lost-children-stalkers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/20/mondays-best-tv-would-i-lie-to-you-my-mothers-lost-children-stalkers","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: Would I Lie to You?, My Mother’s Lost Children, Stalkers","bodyText":"Would I Lie to You? 8.30pm, BBC One There are those who look down on this fib-based panel show, but it is capable of delivering sustained belly-laughs like few others – not least when Bob Mortimer is on.

Decades later, the kids reappeared, and several life stories full of pain, abandonment and words left unsaid were forced to mesh. Ben-Moshe somehow brings a note of humour to a tale of the terrible power parents wield.

Town halls in England and Wales spent £758m buying up commercial property in the first eight months of this year, according to property market data from Savills, but are only building 1,730 council houses a year, government figures for 2016-17 show. The £1bn councils are on track to spend could produce more than 8,000 new council homes, an expert estimate suggests. Earlier this year, Downing Street indicated that amount could deliver 12,500 homes. While no nationwide figure is available for the total cost to the taxpayer of council houses built in 2016-17, expert estimates putting the cost per property at up to £125,000 would suggest local authorities spent in the region of £250m. About 77,000 households in England and Wales are living in temporary accommodation and 1.2 million are on council waiting lists. Council leaders are demanding that the government lifts the cap on borrowing for housing in the budget next week. John Healey, the shadow housing minister, said: “It is absurd that out-of-date rules let councils borrow to build or buy commercial property, but not to invest in affordable housing. “Conservative ministers are about the only people left who don’t think councils should be free to build new, low-cost homes to benefit their areas. It’s a budget no-brainer for Philip Hammond to lift this cap and get councils building tens of thousands of affordable homes.” Coventry city council decided last month to buy Coombe Abbey hotel in a multimillion-pound deal, prompting protests from locals that it was doing so while making wider cuts. The local authority has no council housing despite rising homelessness, with more than 600 households in priority need. The council believes it can earn a 10% annual return on the investment. Kingston council in Greater London spent £54m buying two office buildings and a business park in the last year, but only invested in one new council house, a former school caretaker’s cottage. Demand for social housing far exceeds supply and the borough has 9,524 households on an ever-lengthening waiting list. The boom in commercial property investment dwarfs the amount spent on homes partly because central government restricts how much councils can borrow against their existing housing assets. However, the Treasury offers cheap loans that can be spent on commercial property. Councils have been using them in an attempt to create new income streams to fill budget holes left by Whitehall cuts. Other councils’ recent commercial investments include a solar farm, and a shopping centre, cinema and bowling alley complex due for completion in 2020, in which Barnsley council invested £70m this year. Spelthorne council in Surrey has spent more than £400m in the past 14 months on office buildings including the Sunbury-on-Thames campus of BP, and the headquarters of the contactless payment software company Verifone, located outside the borough. The council said it made the latest purchase because “the withdrawal of funding for local authorities means that many councils are having to find new ways to fund services”. There is no council housing in the borough and it has warned of “very long” waiting times for housing, and said many people will not be housed. Earlier this year, the independent peer Lord Oakeshott, who chairs a property management company, described the trend as “a gigantic game of Monopoly with taxpayers’ cash”. Last week, the government warned that some councils were becoming overly dependent on commercial income to fund statutory services and could be left “financially exposed”. It is considering insisting that councils no longer borrow only to generate investment returns and requiring them to show councillors “understand the risks as well as the opportunities of investment decisions”. The Department for Communities and Local Government would not comment on whether local authorities would be allowed to borrow more for council housebuilding. “We want local authorities to deliver a new generation of council homes, that’s why just last month, we announced a £2bn boost to deliver more affordable properties at social rent in areas where they are most needed. We’re seeing progress, with twice as many council homes built in England in the past five years than between 1997 to 2010,” a spokesman said. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association housing spokesman, said it was vital that the government lifted the cap on council borrowing to build homes. “As a nation, we need to build more than 300,000 homes a year, and we’re currently building roughly half that,” he said. “The last time this country hit that number, in the 1970s, councils built more than 40% of new homes.” This article was corrected on 18 November 2017. Lord Oakeshott is an independent, not a Liberal Democrat, peer; and Kingston is no longer in Surrey, but is part of Greater London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/17/latin-grammys-2017-despacito-luis-fonsi-ruben-blades","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T12:51:29Z","webTitle":"Latin Grammys 2017: Despacito reigns as stars pull their political punches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/17/latin-grammys-2017-despacito-luis-fonsi-ruben-blades","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/17/latin-grammys-2017-despacito-luis-fonsi-ruben-blades","fields":{"headline":"Latin Grammys 2017: Despacito reigns as stars pull their political punches","bodyText":"In the final minutes of the Latin Grammys’ three-hour broadcast last night, Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi sauntered on stage for an acoustic rendition of Despacito, the pop-meets-reggaeton juggernaut he popularised with the help of Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber. His performance was an appropriate way to close a ceremony that belonged to the viral hit all along: few eyelids were batted when Despacito took four of the evening’s major awards, including record of the year and song of the year. The global smash holds the joint record for the most weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, and the video is the most viewed ever on YouTube, with 4.3bn views. Despacito’s reign brought new hope to Latin artists eager for crossover success, so it comes as little surprise that the Latin Recording Academy would reward the song. At the ceremony, held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, hosts Jaime Camil and Roselyn Sánchez bobbed and weaved their way through the award categories and nearly a dozen live performances. In addition to Despacito, the Academy singled out Puerto Rican rapper Residente, of the duo Calle 13, for his cutting-edge solo album inspired by a DNA test he did to learn more about his heritage. Of the nine nominations he received, Residente won two awards, for best urban music album and best urban song. He also delivered the first performance of the night, dedicating the jíbara-influenced song Hijos del Cañaveral to Puerto Rico, capturing the proud and defiant ethos of his new album. Lin-Manuel Miranda, accepting the president’s merit award later in the evening, channeled a similar spirit by promising to march and remind the government of Puerto Rico’s struggles and humanity. The Mexican singer Lila Downs contributed a brilliantly colourful ode to folklore and revolution with her song Zapata Se Queda. But those artists aside, the Latin Grammys avoided political controversy and confrontation, opting instead for benign moments of silence and public service announcements. Any political manoeuvres were recast as calls for unity and support, and Donald Trump’s name did not once come up on the teleprompters. Spanish balladeer Alejandro Sanz used his person of the year award to shine a light on the ending of Obama-era Daca protection for undocumented students, inviting a cadre of young Dreamers on stage for a song. Yet he sidestepped any direct references to the current administration’s decision to rescind Daca in September. Dominican newcomer Vicente García, a dreadlocked singer-songwriter known for sentimental acoustic melodies, beat nine other emerging acts to the best new artist award. He pulled ahead over CNCO, Latin America’s answer to reality-show boy bands, and Danay Suárez, a subversive Cuban rapper and indie darling. When it was time for the flagship album of the year award, salsa legend Rubén Blades was so stunned to hear his name called that he remained seated, blinking and bewildered, for several seconds. For those who have noted salsa’s dwindling sales and radio play, the win was a reminder that there’s still life pulsing through the genre. The Latin Grammys face near-constant criticism for lagging behind the trends that bubble up in the Spanish-speaking world – the Academy has notoriously taken its time to warm up to reggaeton and, this year, seemed to avoid rappers from the flourishing Latin trap movement. The evening’s performances were a chance to offer an answer to that. Smartly, Colombian reggaeton star J Balvin and Puerto Rican trap producer/rapper Bad Bunny were both enlisted, and duly gave the most thundering performances. The prominence of rappers and reggaeton stars also proved that Latin urban music is the most obvious frontier for mainstream collaborations. French Montana and Steve Aoki leapt on stage to buttress J Balvin’s performance, adding extra hype to his hit Mi Gente. And after a delicate acoustic version of Despacito, Fonsi transformed the song into an uptempo medley with Diplo and Bomba Estéreo. Already, Latin artists have pulled major acts into their music – Bieber on the Despacito remix, Beyoncé on the Mi Gente remix – and, if this year’s awards are any indication, their global popularity is continuing to build. It’s not clear whether that interest will expand into other styles of Latin music, but the Latin Grammys have at least acknowledged the splash Despacito made, and are hoping others ride the song’s wave toward success."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/17/benedict-allen-rescued-suspected-malaria-papua-new-guinea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T11:00:29Z","webTitle":"Benedict Allen rescued with suspected malaria in Papua New Guinea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/17/benedict-allen-rescued-suspected-malaria-papua-new-guinea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/17/benedict-allen-rescued-suspected-malaria-papua-new-guinea","fields":{"headline":"Benedict Allen rescued with suspected malaria in Papua New Guinea","bodyText":"An explorer who was feared lost in the Papua New Guinean jungle has been rescued with suspected malaria five days after he went missing. Benedict Allen, who has made programmes for the BBC, had gone travelling alone in an attempt to find the Yaifo tribe, one of the few left in the world that has little to no contact with outsiders, and which he first visited 30 years ago. Fears for his safety grew after he missed a planned flight home on Sunday amid criticism from friends and family of his decision not to take a satellite phone or tracking devices. On Friday Allen’s agent told the Guardian he had been rescued by helicopter from a remote airstrip in central Papua New Guinea. “He has been picked up and is safe,” a spokeswoman for Jo Sarsby Management said. A statement from the company added: “We can confirm that Benedict Allen has been evacuated by helicopter and is now safe in Port Moresby. He is reported as feverish with suspected malaria. Benedict looks forward to being reunited with his family and friends but will need some time to get back to full health. He would like to send thanks for all the kind messages he has received.” Steven Ballantyne, a Hong-Kong-based fixer who has been coordinating Allen’s rescue, confirmed that all was well. Writing on Facebook he said: “I have now spoken to Benedict Allen – it was good to hear his voice and to know all is now well – Benedict has had quite an adventure and we should be proud that he, with the help of many amazing people in PNG, came so far.” Later he told the Guardian: “I had advised advised Benedict to travel with a member of my own team in Papua New Guinea for safety.” Simon Tonge, the UK high commissioner in Papua New Guinea, told the BBC Allen would be flown home tomorrow. The BBC’s security correspondent, Frank Gardner, a close friend of Allen, reported that he was recovering from a fever. He suggested this might account for why he went missing. Allen was expected to have returned to the capital, Port Moresby, by Sunday to catch a flight to Hong Kong, where he was scheduled to speak to the Royal Geographical Society. In one of his last tweets before getting lost he urged friends not to come and find him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/17/toto-riina-sicilian-mafia-boss-of-bosses-dies-cosa-nostra-italy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T15:50:25Z","webTitle":"'He killed all his rivals': Totò Riina, Sicilian mafia's ‘boss of bosses’, dies at 87","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/17/toto-riina-sicilian-mafia-boss-of-bosses-dies-cosa-nostra-italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/17/toto-riina-sicilian-mafia-boss-of-bosses-dies-cosa-nostra-italy","fields":{"headline":"'He killed all his rivals': Totò Riina, Sicilian mafia's ‘boss of bosses’, dies at 87","bodyText":"Salvatore “Totò” Riina’s son was 17 years old when his father ordered him to strangle a kidnapped businessman in the countryside – a killing that would mark the boy’s formal entry into the Cosa Nostra. It was just one example of the murderous reign of terror that Riina, who died in a prison hospital bed early on Friday morning, inflicted on Italy for nearly four decades as the “boss of bosses” of the Sicilian mafia. Nicknamed “the Beast” because of his cruelty, Riina was an unrepentant criminal who not only assassinated his criminal rivals on an unprecedented scale in the 1980s and 90s, but also targeted the prosecutors, journalists, and judges who sought to stand in his way. In the end, it was Riina who was defeated. The Sicilian mafia is far weaker now, left in disarray by Riina, who sought unsuccessfully to lead it from his prison cell in Parma. The crime syndicate still exists, and still shapes people’s social and economic lives in parts of Sicily, but it is a shadow of what it once was, undermined by the relentless scrutiny of Italian police and prosecutors and unable to regain its dominance of the illegal drug trade. If anyone beat Riina, it was the legacy of his most famous victim, Giovanni Falcone, the anti-mafia judge murdered in a car bomb Riina ordered in 1992. “Riina’s death marks the end of an era,” said Federico Varese, a mafia expert at Oxford University. “You can compare him to [the Colombian drug lord] Pablo Escobar. Both launched a direct attack against the state and that created a backlash.” Riina was serving multiple life sentences after convictions for ordering 150 murders, though experts believe the true figure was much higher. He died while he was in a medically induced coma following cancer treatment. In his birth city of Corleone, immortalised as a mafia stronghold by The Godfather book and film trilogy, responses to Riina’s death were mixed. While young people saw the death as a chance for the town to escape its corrupt reputation, elderly people recalled Riina with fondness, describing the mafia boss as a gentleman. “When Riina was around, everybody had a job here in Corleone,” said Paolo, 77. “These men gave us jobs. I knew him. I knew him very well. It’s a day like the other as you can see. But not a day to celebrate.” Riina rose to power in the mid-1970s, when he became the de facto leader of the Corleone crime family. Sicily had become a hub for the heroin trade into the US following the Vietnam war, and Riina became fixated on the narcodollars that he saw flowing to his rivals in Palermo. He created new alliances and staged a bloody coup using his death squads, said John Dickie, a mafia expert and author of Mafia Republic. “He assassinated his rivals. He killed all of them, hundreds of them, he literally ethnically cleansed them out of Palermo,” Dickie said. Mario Francese was the first journalist to expose the role of Riina and the Corleonesi within the Sicilian mafia and was killed in 1979. “I have never sought revenge for my father’s death, only justice,” his son Giulio, a journalist, said on Friday. While other mafia bosses were also brutal, Riina was less invested in maintaining peace, and less closely linked to politicians. His rise marked a new level of violence: he ordered the notorious murder of a 13-year old boy who was kidnapped, strangled, and dissolved in acid, to send a message to those who might turn against him – and the Italian state was forced to respond. The so-called Maxi trial, a series of cases beginning in 1986 that targeted the mafia, led to the indictment of nearly 500 mafiosi, many of whom who were sentenced to life in prison. The trials represented a formal acknowledgement of how pervasive the mafia was in Sicily. Riina responded with brute force: ordering the murders of Falcone and, two months later, another judge, Paolo Borsellino. He also mounted more attacks on the Italian mainland in an effort to get the state to back down. It did not. Riina was arrested in Palermo in 1993. Counted among his official victims was Piersanti Mattarella, the president of Sicily, who was shot dead in his car in 1980. His brother, Sergio, now serves as Italy’s head of state. Although Riina was the subject of special measures to to cut off his ability to communicate from prison, he still made attempts, and never ceded his title of the boss of bosses. In July, as his cancer worsened, a court denied his family’s request to transfer him home to Sicily. Doctors said he was still lucid, and he was caught on wiretap this year saying he regretted nothing. “They’ll never break me, even if they give me 3,000 years,” he said. Many rivals of Riina fled to the US during his years of terror, some of whom have came back to try to re-establish the Cosa Nostra’s dominance. The last time the crime network’s governing committee met was in 1993. “To the best of our knowledge they have tried twice and everyone trying to attend has been arrested both times,” Dickie said. Corleone was deserted on Friday except for people who had gathered at the main square. A local priest said he agreed with church authorities in Palermo, who have already determined that Riina would not be given a church funeral. “I can understand the suffering of Riina’s family with this loss. But he was the head of the the mafia and no sign of redemption ever came from him,” said Don Luca Leone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/nov/17/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-17-november","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T08:10:34Z","webTitle":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 17 November","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/nov/17/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-17-november","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/nov/17/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-17-november","fields":{"headline":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 17 November","bodyText":"I’m not writing my usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, argued that big business now trusts Labour more than the government on the economy and Brexit as he launched his vision for a budget next week that would involve more investment and an end to austerity. Iain Duncan Smith’s thinktank is calling on the chancellor to renege on promised Tory tax cuts and instead plough billions of pounds into universal credit if he wants to help families that are just about managing. The government will be more than a decade late in meeting EU targets on air quality, a report from the National Audit Office (NAO) has revealed.

Worries about the Republican’s prospects of getting their tax cut proposals left Wall Street lagging, while some downbeat results and broker downgrades undermined European shares. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 6.26 points or 0.08% at 7380.68 Germany’s Dax dropped 0.41% to 12,993.73 France’s Cac closed 0.32% lower at 5319.17 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.51% to 22,092.95 Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.78% at 10,010.4 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.58% to 712.46 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 82.9 points or 0.35%. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. Carillion is one of the day’s biggest fallers following another profit warning. Jill Treanor writes: Carillion, one of the construction companies working on the HS2 London to Birmingham rail line, is racing to refinance its business after issuing its third profit warning in five months and suffering a collapse in share price. Shares in the company, which is at the heart of several major building projects in the UK, were suspended eight times on Friday after the shock update to the City that it would breach the terms on its existing lending at the end of the year. The shares crashed 60% when the stock market opened on Friday – to their lowest ever levels – and were still down nearly 40% near the end of the day’s trading. At this price, about 25p, the shares are barely a tenth of the 240p level seen at the start of 2017 and values the company at just £120m. Carillion has debts of £1.6bn and analysts expect the company – known for its work on expanding the main stand at Liverpool’s Anfield football ground and its ongoing development of Battersea power station – to have to ask its lenders to swap their debt for shares. The company employs 30,000, two-thirds of them in the UK, and has contracts with the Highways Agency, Network Rail and the Ministry of Defence. It is building hospitals including Merseyside’s Royal Liverpool and also has a support services operation which has maintenance contracts for buildings. The government, one of its major customers, said it was being kept informed. The full story is here: Meanwhile over in Athens thousands of Greeks chanting anti-austerity and anti-capitalist slogans are marching through the city centre to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Polytechnic uprising against military rule, writes Helena Smith. Greek riot police, bracing for possible violence, are out in force. Communist party members, holding red flags aloft, are leading the protest and using it to decry the”barbaric” policies enforced on workers. “Brussels you won’t be able to disentangle yourself from the left” is among the chants currently wafting over the capital. Anti-US slogans are also rife with demonstrators deploring the agreements the leftist led government recently signed with Washington during official White House talks between the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and US president Donald Trump. Global markets are shrugging their way towards the end of the week, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: The Dow Jones dipped 50-ish points after the bell, keeping the right side of 23400 as investors (very lightly) fretted over the Republicans’ ability to get their tax plan through Congress. The dollar, meanwhile, could only ease, rather than eradicate, the day’s losses, with the greenback down 0.1% against the pound, 0.2% against the euro and 0.5% against the yen as investors process the news that Robert Mueller subpoenaed more than a dozen of Trump’s campaign officials back in October. Over in the Eurozone the euro’s gains continued to cause a headache for the region’s indices. The DAX slipped 0.1%, the CAC 0.4% and the IBEX 0.8%, cementing a rather miserable week for the trio. As for the FTSE, despite a relatively flaccid performance by the pound, and the reversal of early losses in the commodity sector, the UK index just couldn’t get anything going this Friday. Instead it sat flat around 7390, preventing from taking off thanks, in part, to United Utilities and Severn Trent. The UK water sector was hit by a downgrade on United Utilities from HSBC analysts, who cut their recommendation from buy to hold. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $8000 after reports that a software upgrade which could split the cryptocurrency in two was going ahead. The price had fallen last week on suggestions the upgrade would be suspended. The move would mean owners of Bitcoin would in theory also hold the new spin-off, and sell it at a profit. Bitcoin has risen more than 700% this year and is on track for its best week since July. David Cheetham, chief market analyst, at XTB said: Major fundamental concerns remain as to the efficacy of Bitcoin but for now price remains in a strong uptrend and many observers experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out) are looking at any drops as buying opportunities. After showing good gains on Thursday, US markets are on the slide again. With the latest results season coming to a close and no major economic data due, investors are focused on political issues, especially concerns about the Republicans’ ability to get their tax reforms through Congress. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 66 points or 0.28% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.14% lower. But the Nasdaq Composite has bucked the trend, opening broadly flat. One standout performer is retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. After more than a year of declines, it reported strong quarterly sales growth of 4% and forecast postive sales for the forthcoming holiday period. Its results were boosted by a strong performance from its surfwear brand Hollister. The company, which failed to sell its business in July, saw its shares jump 20% following the latest figures. Shares in Carillion have fallen from about 240p at the beginning of this year to 28p today: US homebuilding jumped to a one-year high in October as communities hit by hurricanes started to replace homes damaged by flooding. Housing starts jumped by 13.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million homes, the Commerce Department said. It was the highest level since October 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a smaller number, at 1.18 million homes. The increase in starts ended three consecutive monthly declines. Benchmark Brent crude oil is currently up 1.2% or 72 cents at $62.05 a barrel. But it is still on course for the first weekly loss in six, as Russia’s reluctance to cut production fuels concerns of oversupply. Prices are expected to end the week 2% to 3% lower than the end of last week. Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said the rise today shouldn’t be overplayed. After five days of continuous losses, an upside correction is always on the cards. Such a jump, however, will not mean a change of heart. Over in Greece, EU auditors have given a mixed verdict on the handling of the country’s three bailouts. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The three financial lifelines thrown Greece in 2010, 2012 and 2015 achieved their overarching goal of averting default but were far from successful in other respects, EU auditors have concluded. Issuing their first in-depth look into the cash- for-reform programmes, the independent Luxembourg-based court of auditors said Greece’s continued inability to finance itself on international markets “remains a challenge.” Design and implementation of economic policies was poorly judged, the watchdog claimed, with Greece’s economic depression being much deeper than ever envisaged as a result of tough fiscal measures. It added: The [EU] commission did not comprehensively consider Greece’s implementation capacity in the design process and thus did not adapt the scope and timing accordingly. More than €350bn has been poured into Greece by the EU and IMF to keep the country afloat. The Greek government, which is preparing to exit the country’s third €86bn rescue programme in August 2018 – and is desperately trying to rally spirits ahead of that – did not comment on the report. It is far from sure if Greece will require further aid when its current programme officially expires. The FTSE 100 has reversed its earlier losses and is now up 15 points, partly because the pound’s earlier gains have largely been erased. The FTSE tends to do better when the pound is weaker, because so many of the companies listed have significant overseas earnings. Here are the current scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,402 Germany’s DAX: +0.1% at 13,065 France’s CAC: +0.2% at 5,345 Italy’s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 22,158 Spain’s IBEX: -0.3% at 10,058 Europe’s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 384 The pound has lost some of its earlier sparkle and is now trading roughly flat against the dollar at $1.3197. It has also slipped agains the euro, down 0.2% at €1.1186. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains the gravity of the situation facing Carillion and its shareholders: Shares in Carillion have collapsed yet again as the troubled construction company stated it will breach its banking covenants. The company also lowered its profit outlook again and stated that their asset sale programme isn’t going as fast as they had hoped. Things have gone from bad to worse at Carillion, and the business is in dire need to cash to keep the lights on. Even though the business has plenty of work in the pipeline, it must scramble for cash in order to keep its head above water. The UK government is one of Carillion’s biggest clients and is monitoring the firm’s troubles. Reuters quotes a spokeswoman at the Cabinet Office: The company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress “Carillion horror show continues”, is how Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, describes the latest developments at the construction firm. He adds: Some sort of recapitalisation was inevitable, but a possible debt for equity swap, with debt even higher than the group had anticipated, is probably as bad as anyone would have guessed. The group has made some progress on asset sales, and it sounds like some cost savings are being made. It’s not what the group expected though, and it’s clearly not enough. It’s also probably irrelevant given the state of the balance sheet, with net debt already many multiples of the group’s market capitalisation. Carillion shares plunged as much as 60% in early trading after the construction group involved in HS2 and Battersea Power Station issued its third profit warning of the year: The group now expects that a combination of delays to certain PPP disposals, a slippage in the commencement date of a significant project in the Middle East and lower than expected margin improvements across a small number of UK Support Services contracts, partially offset by cost savings initiatives realised in the fourth quarter, will lead to profits for the year to 31 December 2017 being materially lower than current market expectations. Shares are now down 37% at 26p. The company, which is struggling to cope with a large debt pile and badly-performing contracts, said the board expects a covenant breach at the end of December and will need to implement a recapitalisation plan. Keith Cochrane, interim chief executive, said: Whilst we continue to target cash collections, reduce costs, execute disposals and focus on delivering for our customers, it is clear that significant challenges remain and more needs to be done to reduce net debt and rebuild the balance sheet. Constructive dialogue is continuing with our financial stakeholders, and I am grateful for their support. I remain focused on addressing this issue before my successor, Andrew Davies, takes up the role on 2 April 2018. Love it or hate it, Black Friday is almost upon us. In recent years Britain has embraced the American tradition where retailers slash prices the day after Thanksgiving. British shoppers are expected to spend £10.1bn in the week of Black Friday, which falls on 24 November this year. Just in case you’re interested, here is a piece we’ve done on some of the best deals going this year: News of Greggs controversial decision to replace the baby Jesus with a sausage roll in an advent calendar has rippled across the Atlantic: Draghi concludes by returning to one of his favourite themes, saying eurozone governments should do their bit to secure future economic stability by getting their “fiscal houses in order”. The ECB will do our bit, you do yours, is the message: ECB’s mandate is framed in terms of price stability, as this is the best contribution that we can make to the welfare of citizens. Ensuring price stability is a precondition for the economy to be able to grow along a balanced path that can be sustained in the long run. This is the guiding principle of all our monetary policy decisions. With the recovery ongoing, now is the right moment for the euro area to address further challenges to stability. This means actively putting our fiscal houses in order and building up buffers for the future – not just waiting for growth to gradually reduce debt. It means implementing structural reforms that will allow our economies to converge and grow at higher speeds over the long term. And it means addressing the remaining gaps in the institutional architecture of our monetary union. The full text of Mario Draghi’s speech is available on the ECB website: Here comes the “but” part of the ECB president’s speech. Mario Draghi says that despite solid growth and rising employment, inflation is not at the point where it will pick up without stimulus from the central bank. (Eurozone inflation dipped to 1.4% in October from 1.5% in September.) He says the recovery thus far has been highly dependent on the bank’s support. The key quote: We are not yet at a point where the recovery of inflation can be self-sustained without our accommodative policy. A key motor of the recovery remains the very favourable financing conditions facing firms and households, which are in turn heavily contingent on our policy measures. An ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation over the medium term. The ECB announced last month that it would slow its bond-buying programme to €60bn to €30bn a month starting from January. However, it extended the support for at least another nine months to the end of September 2018, “or beyond, if necessary,” Draghi says. The key message here is that ECB policy is likely will remain supportive for some time to come. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you’d expect, there’s an at-a-glance agenda of the day’s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Draghi is running through stats to illustrate how much the employment picture has improved in the eurozone. He says it “a remarkable success story” that unemployment has come down in the single currency-bloc at the same time that participation in the labour market is rising, as more women and older people enter the workforce. Consumption is being supported by a virtuous circle between rising labour income and rising employment. Employment in the euro area has reached its highest level ever, while unemployment has fallen to its lowest rate since January 2009. Importantly, this has taken place against the backdrop of a rising participation rate, which is now 2 percentage points above its pre-crisis level. This has been driven in particular by the increased entry of women into the workforce, whose participation rate has risen by 4 percentage points since 2008 and reached an all-time high. It has also been strongly driven by older people. Since the start of the crisis, the participation rate has increased by 3.6 percentage points for people aged 50-54, 13.6 percentage points for 55-59 year olds and 17.1 percentage points for 60-64 year olds. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is speaking in Frankfurt at the European Banking Congress. He begins on a positive note on the outlook for the eurozone economy: The euro area is in the midst of a solid economic expansion. GDP has risen for 18 straight quarters, with the latest data and surveys pointing to unabated growth momentum in the period ahead. From the ECB’s perspective, we have increasing confidence that the recovery is robust and that this momentum will continue going forward. The FTSE is suffering from the stronger pound this morning, Spread Ex’s Connor Campbell says: The pound’s up 0.4% against the greenback, with the dollar losing its House tax plan-passing buzz, as Robert Mueller subpoenaed more than a dozen Trump campaign officials. Against the euro, meanwhile, sterling nudged 0.2% higher, keeping above €1.12. This meant the FTSE continued to founder around the 7380 mark, dipping 0.2% as it struggles to escape its 6-week lows. As has been the case all week, commodities are doing their part, with a smattering of red among the oil and mining stocks helping suppress appetite in the UK index. The FTSE 100 is down 17 points this morning, and the biggest faller among its major European peers: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,370 Germany’s DAX: +0.2% at 13,074 France’s CAC: -0.02% at 5,335 Italy’s FTSE MIB: -0.01 at 22,204 Spain’s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,074 Europe’s STOXX 600: +0.02% at 385 Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist, has been interviewed by the Guardian’s economics editor, Larry Elliott, and it’s well worth a watch if you missed it: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has a spring in its step this morning, hitting a two-week high against the dollar of $1.3252. Sterling is benefitting from a sharp sell-off of the dollar triggered by reports in the US that special counsel Robert Mueller served President Trump’s election campaign a subpoena in mid-October, requesting documents relating to Russia. As CMC Markets’ Michael Hewson explains, positive sentiment earlier in the day (generated by the passing of a bill in the House of Representatives aimed at cutting US company rates from 35% to 20%), quickly evaporated: The passing of yesterday’s bill helped the US dollar close near its intraday peaks yesterday, while also helping push up US yields with the 2 year yield hitting its highest level since October 2008. These US dollar gains were pretty short-lived and soon gave way to selling on reports that Trump officials had been subpoenaed by special attorney Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian involvement in the Trump Presidential campaign. This sent the US dollar sharply lower against the yen, dragging on the Nikkei as well as pushing the euro above 1.1800 and the pound to a two week high above 1.3200. The pound is currently up 0.3% at $1.3229 and is up 0.1% against the euro at €1.1223. The dollar index – which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies - is down 0.2%.

For the first Test match held in the Northern Territory capital, Kangaroos skipper Cameron Smith equaled Bob Fulton’s record for the most World Cup appearances with 15, Billy Slater joined Jarryd Hayne as the greatest try-scorer in tournament history with 14, and most memorably Valentine Holmes grabbed a phenomenal five tries. No other Australian player in history had crossed five times in a Test match before. In the hot and humid conditions of the north, the power and punch of the Polynesians was largely nullified. Australia, hardly getting out of first gear, easily outmatched an underwhelming Samoa who have been one of the big disappointments of this World Cup. Exiting with three defeats and just one draw, Samoa have floundered badly while neighbours Tonga are now challenging the “big three” of the sport. There would be no Hamilton horror show for the hosts, no seminal upset like Tonga produced against New Zealand. This contest went entirely to script as Friday night belonged to the clinical Kangaroos and their eight tries. Holmes finished with five and Michael Morgan a double in a match that was more like a physical training run than a tough quarter-final for the green and gold. Building a 30-0 lead at half-time, Australia practically neutered the Samoans after only 40 minutes. Matt Parish’s men had a completion rate of just 47% in the first period – virtual suicide compared with the ruthless execution of the Kangaroos. The carnage started in the ninth minute when Holmes got his first. Cooper Cronk hoisted a bomb up near the Samoan line and Josh Dugan leapt, tapping the ball back perfectly into Holmes’ path. Eight minutes later the Cronulla flyer was in again, making a break near in his own try-line and then finding Cronk in support, and getting the return pass, to dash 80 metres away to score. It was Slater’s chance next to strike, the five-eighth benefitting from a timely offload from Matt Gillett to match Hayne’s record. Then Morgan stepped into prominence, first dancing and dummying through some feeble defence to touch down. Soon after he had his brace when Smith had the insight to banana kick in behind for the primed Cowboys playmaker to pounce. On this display Morgan will keep the No6 jersey for next weekend. Five tries behind, and with Smith peerless with the boot, Samoa were put to bed at the break. In the second half their errors continued to mount and eight minutes in they finally received their first penalty of the match. The Samoans did build some pressure on Australia’s line but the Kangaroos defence, which has conceded just two tries this entire tournament, was on song to stop them dead. In the 51st minute the scoring started up again after Tyson Frizell was held up over the line. On the next play the ball was spun wide and Holmes had his hat-trick. Soon after his fourth arrived in simple circumstances as a Slater offload saw Morgan break through and find Cronk who then fed his fellow Queenslander. Holme’s record-breaking fifth came in the final six minutes, when he brilliantly stepped past some tired defenders to touch down. Before the match Australia coach Mal Meninga revealed the thought of losing – so far the Kangaroos have never lost a game under him – was always on his mind. Slater admitted the world champions might never suffer a Tonga-style upset, when a tier-two country beats a tier-one team. On Friday night’s evidence, and with both England and New Zealand already faulting in this tournament, Slater’s belief might be spot on. When Australia is in this mood, and with a defence that gives their opposition absolutely nothing, they are unbeatable. The visible signs of rust, evident early in Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney, evaporated in the warm Darwin night. The scary thing is the Kangaroos are just getting warmed up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/20/do-you-love-australian-birds-heres-your-chance-to-vote-for-your-favourite","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T02:04:54Z","webTitle":"We're so lucky to share Australia with a stunning array of birds | Sean Dooley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/20/do-you-love-australian-birds-heres-your-chance-to-vote-for-your-favourite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/20/do-you-love-australian-birds-heres-your-chance-to-vote-for-your-favourite","fields":{"headline":"We're so lucky to share Australia with a stunning array of birds","bodyText":"The recently released The Australian Bird Guide (CSIRO Publishing) chronicles a whopping 927 species seen in Australia since 1940. About 160 are considered vagrants – birds that have accidentally arrived here, blown off course or, in the case of North American migratory shorebirds, literally taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque – and vast numbers of the rest are rare, difficult to see or only occur in remote areas, so that only the most dedicated of bird nerds ever gets to delight in their magnificence. But this doesn’t mean that the largely urbanised Australian population don’t experience some of the most stunning birds on the planet, often on a daily basis. Topping the charts for the fourth year running in this year’s Aussie Backyard Bird Count conducted by BirdLife Australia was the rainbow lorikeet. More than 205,000 of them were recorded across almost 26,000 backyards and parks right around the country. But this ubiquity by no means suggests this is a yawn of a bird. With a ludicrously intense colour scheme, these raucous nectar-loving parrots have a legion of fans. I remember being on the Cairns Esplanade, an internationally famous location to see migratory shorebirds up close and personal, when I bumped into a couple of young British twitchers fresh off the plane. Shaved heads, tattoos and lager-soaked, they could easily be taken for football hooligans, were it not for the binoculars draped around their pasty necks. One of the lads seemed to be distressed as he peered up into a palm tree filled with screeching lorikeets. Huge tears cascaded down his cheeks as he turned to me, pointing at the birds and said in a broad Scouse accent, “We don’t have fucking nothing like this back home!” And plenty of Aussies agree. In 2013 we ran a poll for BirdLife Australia supporters to find out their favourite bird. Rainbow lorikeets came in at number five. Familiarity clearly doesn’t breed contempt. In my travels around Australia I’ve met many people with a love of birds, a story about birds, a connection with them that was profound and heartfelt. There’s even a lot of love for the ibis, or “bin chicken”, which terrifies city dwellers in Sydney and Brisbane as it snatches a sandwich from their hands in city parks. There is actually quite a lot to admire in the ibis. Two hundred years ago they were as rare as hen’s teeth in cities but they have adapted to the changes inflicted on the landscape wrought by European settlement with many seeking shelter in places where there is plenty of refuse for them to scrounge through. The No 1 bird in that 2013 vote was the superb fairywren, followed closely by the Australian magpie. These results were not without controversy. Goaded on-air by his co-host, Mick Molloy, that the blue boys were beating the magpies yet again, Eddie McGuire was unable to rally the magpie faithful to get their bird over the line in a late surge. And when I was recently in Perth for the Aussie Bird Count I was berated by a WA birder who had not forgiven us for not including the splendid fairywren, the west coast equivalent of the superb fairywren, which is perhaps even more spectacularly blue. This is an oversight that the compilers of the Guardian shortlist have not made. The selection of 50 birds encompasses some of Australia’s iconic birds such as the emu, kookaburra and lyrebird, as well as many of the brilliant birds most of us are familiar with. I will be fascinated to see the results of this poll. Will the general Australian public do as they did in a similar vote in 1908 and elect the humble willy wagtail as the nation’s favourite? Will the split in the blue wren vote between the superb and splendid factions see the mighty magpie win in a cakewalk? Or will a smoky emerge from the field to steal the favourite bird crown? Reading over the list, from the muttonbird to the whipbird, it is clear how extraordinarily lucky we are to share this continent with such a stunning array of birds. • Sean Dooley is editor of Australian Birdlife magazine"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/19/rude-katie-hopkins-digested-read","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T17:00:06Z","webTitle":"Rude by Katie Hopkins – digested read","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/19/rude-katie-hopkins-digested-read","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/19/rude-katie-hopkins-digested-read","fields":{"headline":"Rude by Katie Hopkins – digested read","bodyText":"I appreciate that many people think I am a twat. And I can see why. My whole career has been founded on people believing that I am a twat. But I am not a twat. Honestly. If you were to meet me in person, you would probably think I am not as much of a twat as you thought I would be. The bar really is that low. Vagina. Women don’t say the word vagina nearly enough. I am proud of my foof. A vagina is empowering. Too many women go through life playing the victim card. There’s no point moaning when a man puts his hand on your knee. Rather, you should take it as a compliment. Unless the man touching you up is a Muslim. In which case he should be thrown in prison or deported. You’re probably wondering how I became like this. The simple answer is that I have a narcissistic personality disorder that makes me say any offensive rubbish just to get some attention. Are you still reading? Well get off your fat arse, then. I can’t stand people who waste their lives munching their way through supersized fast food while reading books. Get a job instead and stop moaning like a bleeding-heart liberal. So you’ve got a mental illness and a hyperactive thyroid problem? Big deal. I’ve had epilepsy. Spare us the tears and just get on with your life. I had loads of jobs before I became a professional gobshite. Security guard, barmaid, sex therapist. And what I learned was that it is always the chubsters who are the problem. The first to fall off their mobility scooters they have been given by the state because they are too fat to walk to the shops. That’s another thing. Why do supermarkets always situate the mother and child parking spaces so close to the entrance? Most mothers of young children are hideously obese and could do with more exercise. So do them a favour and make them park as far away as possible. Don’t get me wrong. I like children. My children, at least. That’s because my children aren’t fat. It’s not a matter of genetics, it’s a question of discipline. If I ever catch India or Poppy wolfing down a couple of extra biscuits, I yell at them: “Stop that, you useless fat moron.” More people need to be fat-shamed. And name-shamed. There’s no bigger giveaway that your parents are thick and overweight than being given a name like Charmaine or Destiny. And don’t get me started on Mohamed. I won’t let my kids play with anyone who isn’t called Margaret, Nigel or Donald. Politics and religion. People often compare me to Hitler and I take that as a compliment. At least people remember Hitler. So here’s where I stand. Contrary to what is often said, I am not Islamophobic. Islamophobia is an irrational fear of Muslims. My fear of Muslims is entirely rational, as they are all out to kill you. I don’t much like Germany or Turkey either. I do like Israel, though. There’s a country with the guts to shoot first and ask questions afterwards. Britain would do well to take a leaf out of their book. Brexit. The best thing that’s ever happened to this country. By voting to actually make itself poorer, Britain has ensured that fat people won’t have so much money to spend on food. So all those chubbies who now gorge themselves on eight litres of full fat Coke and a family-sized bucket of chicken nuggets will just have to learn to go a bit hungry. Think of the advantages of not getting held up by huge blobs getting stuck in doorways. Hopefully, a lot of old people will also die of hypothermia. Most old people are a waste of space and the country could do with a bit of a cull. Other things I hate. The BBC. What a useless, deadbeat organisation that is. Imagine a broadcaster that can produce a show like The Apprentice that merely acts as a springboard for any third-rate gobshite to get a national platform. Gingers. All people with red hair should be put down. Men with small penises. A waste of space in the bed and invariably a sign of an inferiority complex. In my experience, all men who voted to remain in the EU or who work in the voluntary sector have micro-penises. People who got me sacked from LBC for tweeting we needed a final solution after the Manchester bombing. Get a sense of humour. If Hitler had one, so can you. Me. Most of all, I really hate me. The more offensive I become, the more inadequate I feel. Please don’t go. Without you, I’m nothing. Are you there? Is anyone there?

David Lidington, the justice secretary, had suggested on Thursday that the prime minister was open to listening to suggestions from rebel Conservative MPs who are concerned enshrining the exit date in law could tie the UK’s hands in negotiations with Brussels. And on Friday a cross-bench committee of MPs sharply criticised the plan, warning that such a tactic would backfire. However, No 10 said it was not considering backing down over its unexpected amendment to the EU withdrawal bill that sets the point of Brexit at 11pm on 29 March 2019. “As the PM has said, we want to listen to parliament,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. “We are clear, though, on our determination to get the best possible outcome for the UK. Key to doing that is certainty. “What the amendment does is provide certainty over our position that we are leaving the EU on 29 March 2019. We would encourage all MPs to support it.” Later on Friday the Brexit select committee, made up of a majority of Tory MPs, said that stipulating the exact moment of departure would dangerously tie the hands of ministers and hamper their ability to extract the best deal during last-minute haggling. “We need to maintain flexibility as the negotiations proceed,” said the committee chairman, Hilary Benn. “But ministers are now proposing to remove from the [withdrawal] bill the power to set different exit days for different purposes and replace it with a single exit day. This would create significant difficulties if the negotiations were to continue until the 59th minute of the 11th hour, as the secretary of state suggested to us might happen.” Last week the Brexit secretary, David Davis, first proposed the new clause, stipulating departure at precisely 11pm on 19 March, amid mounting anxiety among Tory backbenchers that the government was preparing a series of concessions to the EU. But the symbolic move appeared to have instead galvanised a rebellion among moderate Tories worried that ministers were taking an overly dogmatic approach. Half the Tories on the committee voted with its Labour chairman and other parties in calling for a rethink. “The flexibility to set multiple exit days was described to us as a tool for setting different commencement dates for different provisions and providing for possible transitional arrangements,” says the committee report. “The government’s latest amendments will however, if agreed by the House, remove this flexibility.” Lidington had previously hinted the government was considering softening its stance, when he spoke at a lunch for journalists in the House of Commons. Asked whether the exit date amendment could be withdrawn, he said: “It’s hypothetical but as the PM said, various constructive suggestions have been made during the committee debates about how the bill might be improved and obviously we will listen to ideas coming from colleagues across the house during the bill’s progress in both the Commons and Lords. “All that clause was designed to do was clarify and put beyond doubt what is already inherent in the wording of article 50. Article 50 says that after two years of the date of notification unless there is a withdrawal the treaties cease to apply to the country that is leaving.” Speaking later in London, May’s deputy spokesman said the amendment was seen as necessary even though the timing of the triggering of article 50 on 29 March this year started a formal two-year countdown to exactly the same date. “We think it provides important certainty,” he said. “We have listened to the views of members from all sides of he house and we think the amendment does provide important certainty on this issue.” Asked what legal difference the amendment would make, he said: “It’s the issue of certainty is what’s key.” Conservative rebels are confident the government would almost certainly lose if it put the amendment to a vote, since more than 15 MPs are prepared to defy the whip, but most believe that will be averted by a compromise by No 10."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/17/indian-app-fights-porn-addiction-with-devotional-songs-and-political-speeches","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T05:59:03Z","webTitle":"Indian app fights porn addiction with devotional songs and political speeches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/17/indian-app-fights-porn-addiction-with-devotional-songs-and-political-speeches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/17/indian-app-fights-porn-addiction-with-devotional-songs-and-political-speeches","fields":{"headline":"Indian app fights porn addiction with devotional songs and political speeches","bodyText":"Indian neurologists have developed an app to address porn addiction that will play Hindu devotional songs, chant “Allahu Akbar” or recite speeches by Nelson Mandela when a user tries to access adult videos. The app was developed by Vijay Nath Mishra, a professor of neurology at Banaras Hindu University, in response to behaviour problems he was seeing in his patients. It currently plays Hindu chants and prayers when users try to access adult or violent material, but Mishra said he aimed to widen its appeal as much as possible. “Within a month it will contain songs and prayers suited to the Muslim community, so that it could be comfortably used by members of all religions,” he said. Also to be added are inspirational speeches from figures including Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and the Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. “Addiction to pornography cannot be treated but this is a humble attempt at changing one’s behaviour,” Mishra said. The app has been named Har Har Mahadev, a Hindu chant exhorting Lord Shiva to destroy all evil. The website Pornhub says Indians make up its third largest user base behind Americans and Britons. According to 2014 data, Indian users who access porn are more likely to be female than the global average. The Indian government tried to ban 857 porn websites in a sudden move in 2015 but was forced to back down less than a week later after a massive backlash and concerns the censorship may be illegal. Sunny Leone, a Canadian porn star of Indian origin, leveraged her online popularity in 2012 to make the leap into Bollywood, where she has attained mainstream success despite opposition including a 2015 lawsuit alleging she was “destroying Indian culture”.

With wages growth remaining weak and much of the jobs growth geared towards lower paying work, maybe what is needed is a jolt of optimism – and just maybe this could come from this week’s overwhelming victory for marriage equality. It has to be said that the employment news is overwhelmingly good. Employment has now been growing in trend terms every month since December 2013, and according to the more erratic seasonally adjusted measure, it has been growing for 13 straight months – the best consecutive run since 1994. Right now nearly 77% of all 25 to 64 year olds are working – the highest level ever recorded, largely off the back of a record number of women in the workforce. And best of all, the jobs have been full-time. In the past 12 months hours worked has risen by 3.1% – the best result since December 2010 – and full-time employment has grown by 3.6% – the strongest growth since June 2007. It is undeniably good news. You can quibble all you like about what is classed as employment, but having 289,000 more people working full-time than a year ago is hard to spin as a negative. And yet despite a nice recent rise, the latest ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence measure remains at a point actually lower than it was this time last year. And last year, it should be recalled, was a terrible year for employment – it was one of the few calendar years where full-time employment fell. The level of growth of our retail spending is also lower than it was this time last year. Every year around this time we start getting stories about Christmas sales and stores gearing up for a booming December. Most often they are just retail industry spin – trying to get us believing that going out and shopping is being done in big numbers so we shouldn’t feel bad about doing it ourselves – indeed we should be doing it! But this year such stories should be true. After all the unemployment rate of 5.4% is the lowest it has been since January 2013. And while, somewhat oddly, employment growth and retail spending growth don’t line up all that well, it is a bit odd that in light of the good employment news, overall we are spending less in the shops than when the job situation was worse a year ago. One reason might be that in the past 12 months most of the jobs have come from industries that are generally lower paying. Over the last year two thirds of the increase in net employment has come in industries that have lower average earnings than the national average. This is an issue the Reserve Bank highlighted in its latest statement of monetary policy when it noted that “employment growth remains strongest in the household services sector, particularly in health care and social assistance”. It also noted this could mean average earnings are lower than otherwise would be expected because there is “more growth in lower-income jobs”. What is worse is the Reserve Bank has also noted that new employment within industries is geared towards lower paying jobs. It noted anecdotal reports that suggest “an increase in the proportion of new employees hired on lower salaries than their predecessors”. So yes, we are seeing a solid increase in employment, but this is not resulting in a rise in overall average incomes like we would expect and as a result we are not seeing a similar boost in spending or consumer confidence. And when you throw in to the mix the fact that wages growth across the board is down it makes for a disconnect between the unemployment rate and our desire to spend. But perhaps there is some hope. Often when talking of the need to encourage investment, economists talk of “animal spirits” – essentially the need for people to be willing to take a risk and invest because they believe things are going to get better. In a speech this week, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, Guy Debelle listed this as the most powerful reason why non-mining investment has been weak. A similar case might apply to consumer spending. One problem with consumer confidence is that it is generally linked with the performance of the government. If people think the government is doing well they are more inclined to think the economy is performing well and also that they are confident things will either stay good or keep improving. This is why ALP and Liberal voters often swap their levels of confidence from positive to negative after a change of government. With the government mired in bad polls, this is unlikely to change, but perhaps the overwhelming yes vote result in the marriage equality survey might produce some sense of optimism that things are not so bad. Of course should the conservatives forces conspire to bog the process down, any optimism would probably dissipate, but were it all to go through quickly, perhaps people might gain some sense that life is not so bad. And while it is unlikely to provide a significant increase in total spending, at the very least there should be a bit of a boost from shopping for some long-waited-for weddings in January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/18/muriels-wedding-the-musical-how-channelling-mark-latham-brought-muriel-up-to-date","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T21:12:29Z","webTitle":"Muriel's Wedding the musical: how channelling Mark Latham brought Muriel up to date","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/18/muriels-wedding-the-musical-how-channelling-mark-latham-brought-muriel-up-to-date","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/nov/18/muriels-wedding-the-musical-how-channelling-mark-latham-brought-muriel-up-to-date","fields":{"headline":"Muriel's Wedding the musical: how channelling Mark Latham brought Muriel up to date","bodyText":"For 20 years people had been telling PJ Hogan that Muriel’s Wedding could work as a musical. His 1994 debut feature told the story of dumpy, dreamy twenty-something Muriel Heslop, who retreated from her disappointing life and verbally abusive family by blasting ABBA songs and fantasising about fame. The film, a gloriously sly satire of small-town Australia, transcended its idiosyncratic setting and sense of humour to become a surprise international hit, scoring then-unknown Toni Collette a Golden Globe nomination, and kickstarting Hollywood careers for both her and Hogan. And on Saturday night, Muriel’s Wedding: The Musical opens at the Roslyn Packer Theatre in Sydney, directed by Simon Phillips – a man with a track record for adapting Australian stories for the stage, including Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Ladies in Black. With a book adapted by Hogan from his original script, it follows the original story but plants it in the present day, recreating the plastic-frangipani sheen of Porpoise Spit and a darkly glittering Sydney with an extraordinary 3D puzzle of a set, designed by Gabriela Tylesova. According to Hogan, adapting the story for the modern day was surprisingly easy. Muriel’s third-act notoriety is recontextualised with Instagram and Twitter followers, and the spittle flecked rants of her father Bill Heslop, played by Gary Sweet, have been updated with some unlikely inspiration: former ALP leader-cum-provocateur Mark Latham. “Not verbatim,” Hogan clarifies – Latham has a litigious bent, after all. “But he’s certainly led me quite easily to my inner Bill.” Phillips had been “nagging” Hogan about the show for almost a decade; the pair would toss around ideas, dropping in existing pop songs as placeholders, and eventually began the long process of finding the right composer. Importantly, this is not an ABBA jukebox musical (and not just because there’s one of those already). While the Swedish superstars and their hits feature heavily, the show boasts over 20 original songs, written by Australian pop artist Kate Miller-Heidke and her partner in music and life Keir Nuttall. After all, a jukebox musical could never work for a story this emotionally complex. “What would be the ABBA tune when Muriel bares her soul in the bridal shop?” Hogan says. “ABBA didn’t write a song like that.” Miller-Heidke’s acrobatic voice and classical training give her songs a cheeky, theatrical bent, and with Nuttall the pair’s ear for a neat rhyme and wordy, shockingly funny lyrical twists make the songs crackle with energy. Several are simply excellent pop songs in their own right, such as Amazing: a tumble of honest affection and gorgeous harmony where Rhonda and Muriel cement their new friendship under the stars. It’s impossible to hear it and not picture a pair of teenage BFFs trying to talk their music teacher into letting them perform it at school, despite the gleeful F-bomb in the chorus. “I just got the great advantage [in Miller-Heidke and Nuttall] of people for whom theatre might not have been their natural idiom, but their instincts for how the theatre works are incredibly impressive,” says Phillips. “[The songs] serve all the purposes that theatre songs need to serve while making you think, ‘Oh, god. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a song like that before’.” Despite that originality, Nuttall says, “We were very protective of the source material ... I think people who loved the movie will not feel like it’s being violated. PJ was always going to make sure of that, but certainly it was an important film for me and Kate.” There are plenty of lines from the film audiences will be looking out for, and they won’t be disappointed – unless they were hoping to head home with a catchy reprise of You’re Terrible, Muriel stuck in their heads. Nuttall and Miller-Heidke mostly avoided writing songs around the most iconic quotes. “I would’ve liked to have really written a song called What A Coincidence, a duet between Bill and Deirdre [Chambers, his tacky mistress],” admits Nuttall. “‘What a co-in-ci-dence…’ It even sings so well, you know.” But, as Miller-Heidke points out, “There’s a lot of story to get through ... We don’t have time for [Muriel’s sister] Joanie to do a soliloquy.” Those iconic supporting characters are tough to recreate. As with any adaptation, a balance must be struck between honouring the original performances and allowing the new cast members to make the roles their own. Maddi Jones’ Rhonda, for instance, is a pink-haired spitfire in black mesh layers, her energy less brittle than Rachel Griffiths’; Gary Sweet as Bill dials down Bill Hunter’s gruff, sweaty sheen (though none of the insistent casual racism) for a more photogenic local pollie; and as mean girl Hall of Famer Tania Degano, Christie Whelan-Brown brings a self-obsessed mania over from her character in The Wrong Girl, to create a 2017 Tania you’d absolutely hate-follow on Instagram (while secretly coveting her hair extensions). The most crucial bit of casting, of course, is Muriel herself. Not only is she in every scene, but she’s in the shadow of Collette’s star-making, devastating original performance. The team had the initial audition group narrowed down to a handful of promising young actors last year, but felt there was still someone out there who ticked every box. Then they received an audition video from LA: then 20-year-old Maggie McKenna, thick hair tied loosely to one side in a ribbon, putting an astonishing amount of feeling into every note of Dancing Queen and radiating hope and yearning. While she’s young – younger, in fact, than the original film itself – and has never tackled a role of this size before, McKenna glows onstage. Imagining her glamorous future life, she beams not just with her whole face but with her whole body, infusing her Muriel with a goofy, guileless, endearingly broad bogan charm. At other times, her flashes of obliviousness and petulance call to mind another iconic Australian character: Kim from Kath &amp; Kim, immortalised by McKenna’s mother Gina Riley. “When I watched the character of Muriel as a child, I don’t think I fully understood the complexity of her,” McKenna told Guardian Australia in an email this week. “Yes, she’s larger than life and a goofball, but she is also incredibly self conscious, unhappy and lonely.” As Hogan says, “It wouldn’t be Muriel’s Wedding if it didn’t have a dark side – and if it didn’t have heart.” He admits he always associated musicals with what he diplomatically calls “lighter fare”, until a recent trip to New York where he discovered the complex emotional core of the stories that also happen to be modern Broadway’s biggest hits. “[There were] a lot of interesting shows on that I went to see like Fun Home, Book of Mormon and Once. And I thought, you know, the musical [as a genre] has changed. They’re not the musicals that I grew up with. Audiences not only accept something that is a little deeper and cuts closer to the bone, they almost demand it now.” The show is personal for Hogan, but not only because it was his first feature, his first real success, and arguably his defining work, but because it came directly from his own life. “A comedy that comes from a place of anger”, he calls it in the upcoming documentary, Making Muriel, directed by Nel Minchin. Muriel and Betty are based on his downtrodden sister and mother, we learn, and Bill the Battler his bullying father. Circling back nearly 25 years after the film has underscored why good adaptations work: Muriel the musical sees even its creator affected anew by his most familiar story. “It’s still strange to watch my family singing and dancing,” Hogan says. “I’ll never get over that. Liberating – yet strange.” • Muriel’s Wedding: The Musical runs at Sydney Theatre Company until 27 January 2018.

At the UN climate meeting in Bonn, 19 nations led by the UK and Canada officially joined together on Thursday in a Powering Past Coal Alliance, committing to a swift phase out of coal. In making this commitment, they put front and centre the key argument I made two months ago: that coal kills people. No longer couched in obscure language, these governments declared that coal is already killing some 800,000 people a year due to air pollution, and many more stand to die thanks to climate change-driven droughts, storms, floods and fire. Meanwhile in Australia, not a single audience member in a Sky News Queensland election forum supported government funding for the Adani Carmichael coal mine. Not one single person raised their hand to back this idea championed by our federal government and the Queensland opposition, and until very recently supported by the Queensland government as well. While this is an incredibly stark demonstration, it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. Australians have long told pollsters that we oppose coal and want to see our country powered by renewable energy. We’ve taken action ourselves in extraordinary numbers to install rooftop solar and solar water heaters. And yet coal maintains a deep hold on our electoral politics, with the Liberals and Nationals tightly bound to it and Labor still engaged in a complicated dance, ducking and weaving, contorting itself into intricate positions to express both support and opposition. Of course, electoral politics is only one small part of democracy – and by no means the most important part in a truly democratic system. Voting is a complex process – a mix of consideration of a broad range of policies, old habits and allegiances, emotional attachments, and basic tribalism. I’ve lost count of the number of times polls have shown overwhelming support for an environmental issue – from renewable energy to forest protection to marine sanctuaries – but the same people have voted to install a government which declares its intention to actively undermine and destroy those precious things. Here in Australia we’ve just had a demonstration of another way of doing democracy. The deeply misguided and unnecessary postal survey on marriage equality, despite enabling appalling hate speech, has actually ended up showing that when the people speak clearly enough on an important issue, politicians have no choice but to follow. Out of a very different process indeed, Adani may well lead us to the same conclusion. Here, community groups from all across the country have been working hard to build a groundswell big enough to overturn the pro-coal political consensus. Occupying banks and politicians’ offices, interrupting press conferences, locking themselves onto mining equipment and sites, writing songs about it, many thousands of people have made this an issue that can’t be swept under the carpet. Politicians have been forced to answer questions about it day in day out, despite wishing they could just quietly get it done. Both of these battles are far from won, but they both point to the deep desire of Australians to seize back the right to make decisions that matter to us from a political class that would prefer we let them take care of business. And it’s exactly the same processes that have led the UK and Canada to the point where they can commit to phasing out coal in the very short term. In the UK, grassroots protests against coal, adoption of renewable energy technologies and the tremendous democratic energy behind the Scottish independence referendum, Brexit and Corbyn, all contribute to a politics where a quick exit from coal has become political common sense. In Canada, increasingly passionate anti-fossil fuel protests, feeding into the development of the Leap Manifesto led by Naomi Klein and others, helped create the political atmosphere where Justin Trudeau could not only be elected but also see a strong mandate to phase out coal. Again, just as our battles in Australia are far from won, both the UK and Canada are very far indeed from democratic wonderlands. Their electoral systems are both far less representative than our own. But, even within those limits, they show that it is possible to prise coal’s fingers off our necks. We’re at a moment of incredible opportunity and risk. The deep democratic deficit inherent in late capitalism is sending too many people into the arms of the avowedly anti-democratic extreme right. But it is also invigorating those who are ready, willing and able to reclaim and rebuild democracy for all. The sun is setting on coal as it rises on democracy.

It’s not a job that wins praise. But something is more deeply awry on the Australian panel than disagreement, a malaise that has persisted through changes of personnel. The problem isn’t decisions made. It’s the spurious justifications given. It’s the complete lack of any coherent policy, core belief or overarching rationale. The reasons given for one selection vanish for another. Principles committed to in one case are abandoned. Panel members pick whoever they feel like, then invent a reason, building arguments so flimsy that a Big Bad Wolf would only need to give a meaningful look. This Ashes side mostly could have picked itself. Only the wicketkeeper was an obvious flaw. Of the other two changes, you can make an argument for dropping Matt Renshaw due to Cameron Bancroft’s eye-catching run. You can counter-argue that Renshaw’s last Test innings in Australia was 184, he played important knocks on tough Asian tours, and that quiet domestic games to start the home season are largely irrelevant. That is fair discussion. The hypocrisy starts once the call is made. “We would like him to go back to first-class cricket and push his name forward with the selection panel through big runs,” said Hohns, though his panel has spent years ignoring others who’ve done the same. At the same time as saying domestic results matter, the panel picked Tim Paine. Australia needed an in-form wicketkeeper who could remedy a shortage of runs from Matthew Wade. Paine has kept wicket in exactly three games for Tasmania the past two seasons, and has made one first-class century in a 12-year career. He has been desperately unlucky with injury, and it will be a great story if he can take this chance. That doesn’t mean there was logic in the pick. The selectors used the fig leaf of two recent half-centuries – one in a net for England’s bowlers as they took apart a youth team, another as Tasmania piled on declaration runs against Victoria. Ironically, Tasmania only delayed the declaration in the hope of getting Wade a final hit, but Paine never got out. The greatest morass of nonsense, as ever, came with picking Shaun Marsh to replace Glenn Maxwell at No6. Call him the Selectors’ Cat – Marsh is already up to life number eight. To be fair, Marsh played a couple of top innings in India, then was left out for Bangladesh. There have been times when he hasn’t deserved to be dropped, but there hasn’t been a time when he has deserved to be picked. Said selectors, he’s “playing very well at the moment, having scored consistently in the JLT One-Day Cup and first three rounds of the JLT Sheffield Shield competition”. Marsh made a hundred and three fifties in the one-day stuff. So did George Bailey. Marsh made three fifties in the Shield, Bailey made 106 and 59 in his last outing. Callum Ferguson followed an unbeaten 182 with 88 in whites, having piled up 50-over runs. Half a dozen others were in similar nick. Ed Cowan didn’t get the chance to try. The top Shield run-scorer in the country over the past three seasons was ordered out of the New South Wales side by Australian captain Steve Smith. Younger players were a chance for a Test gig, was Smith’s acknowledgement, but never Cowan. Likewise, Victoria ditched Cameron White, while an unwanted Michael Klinger left Perth to play in the Bangladesh Premier League. Cowan and Bailey are 35, White 34, Klinger 37, Ferguson 32. None were ever in the frame, seen as has-beens whose chance has gone. Yet the new Test No6 is 34, and his chances never end. For Marsh, selectors will ignore his age and point to his state form. For any other, they’ll point to his age and ignore his runs. Poor old Maxwell. The incumbent, with a fighting maiden century in India earlier this year. To Marsh’s three Shield fifties, Maxwell made two and a 45 not out, grinding a draw from 115 balls to show the versatility requested. Aged 29, one of the most talented ball-strikers of a generation has never played a home Test. This is a criminal waste, on the pitches that produce his best cricket. It was a waste last summer, when the spot was handed to a struggling Nic Maddinson, then on to gut-feeling choice Hilton Cartwright. This summer, it’s another waste by handing it to a player about whom nothing more can be learned. It looks like the fear of an Ashes loss got Australia’s selectors spooked. If my career relied on Shaun Marsh’s batting, I’d be worried, but he’s seen as a safe pick while Maxwell is a risk. But whatever the reasoning, it’s never adequately explained. People don’t like being misled. What we keep getting is a lack of transparency, a lack of accountability and a mentality of jobs for the old boys. It doesn’t just annoy fans, it messes with the lives of players. Careers stutter and sputter out, as old boys look after the new. But the very existence of boys’ clubs is under threat. The world is changing: gradually in the main, then with occasional rushes of subsidence. You can’t beat erosion. You can only move ahead of the fall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/17/royal-commission-tells-nt-government-to-shut-down-don-dale-centre","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T01:34:40Z","webTitle":"'Shocking failures': NT royal commission calls for closure of Don Dale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/royal-commission-tells-nt-government-to-shut-down-don-dale-centre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/royal-commission-tells-nt-government-to-shut-down-don-dale-centre","fields":{"headline":"'Shocking failures': NT royal commission calls for closure of Don Dale","bodyText":"The Don Dale juvenile detention centre must close, and its high security unit should shut down immediately, the Northern Territory royal commission into the protection and detention of children has recommended. The inquiry’s final report, released on Friday, found “shocking and systemic failures” over many years that were known about but ignored at the highest levels, commissioners Margaret White and Mick Gooda said. “The procedures and requirements of the law have simply not been followed in many instances. The systems failed to comply with the basic binding human rights standards in the treatment of children and young people,” the report said. It upheld shocking allegations raised during the 12 weeks of public hearings, including verbal abuse, physical control, inappropriate force and restraint, and the bribing or daring of children to carry out humiliating or degrading acts, or to commit violence against one another. “Children and young people were subjected to regular, repeated and distressing mistreatment in detention and there was a failure to follow the procedures and requirements of the law in many instances,” the commissioners said. “These things happened on our watch, in our country, to our children.” The commission revealed it had referred a number of matters to police, including potential criminal conduct by youth justice officers, the harassment or threatening of witnesses or potential witnesses, and the physical, sexual and neglectful abuse of children in out-of-home residential care settings. The NT government has three months to deliver a plan for closing Don Dale – a widely criticised centre that previously housed maximum security adult prisoners until they were transferred because it was no longer suitable for habitation. The isolated high security unit cells should be closed immediately, the report said, describing them as:“wholly inappropriate, oppressive, prison-like environment that is detrimental to [the] health, wellbeing and prospects of rehabilitation” of detainees. Among more than 230 recommendations the commission called for: The age of criminal responsibility to be raised to 12 and the detention of under-14s to be banned except for serious crimes. A commissioner for children and young people to be given free access to detention centres and detainees. The use of force to maintain “good order” and any use of teargas to be banned. Policies of isolation, bail, body searches and transfers to be overhauled. Recommendations for the child protection sector included: The development of a 10-year generational strategy for children and families. The establishment of a network of at least 20 family support centres across the NT. The phasing out of purchased home-based care and vast improvements to out-of-home care. Working with Aboriginal organisations to achieve an increase in kinship care placements for Indigenous children. There are currently 35 children in Don Dale, including 23 on remand and six who are under the age of 14. The four-volume report of more than 2,100 pages detailed a litany of failures and errors, as well as potential and actual breaches of law and international human rights standards. It targeted every level of authority, including police and executives, and ministers from the Labor and CLP governments. “Senior executives and the management and staff at the detention centres implemented and/or maintained and/or tolerated a detention system seemingly intent on ‘breaking’ rather than ‘rehabilitating’ the children and young people in their care,” it said. The absence of up-to-date standard operating procedures was attributed to the former corrections commissioner Ken Middlebrook and, for a limited period, Salli Cohen. Frequent understaffing from 2010 resulted in officers – who, the report noted, had minimal or no training – being overworked “with potentially dangerous consequences”. It made specific findings against individual guards, including Conan Zamolo, who filmed detainees inappropriately on at least three occasions and “likely made a recording of a detainee while he was in the shower”, Derek Tasker, who “put his hand or hands around the throat of detainees on three occasions”, and Trevor Hansen, who used the “wedgie” restraint technique against children. The recommendations also appeared to address concerns raised by the former NT justice minister John Elferink about male circumcision, calling for a forum of boys, advocates, elders and leaders to review any ceremonial practice which affected the health of boys. The findings and recommendations come at the end of a 10-month royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory. It acknowledged the “profound shift” it was proposing for NT authorities, but said it was necessary given the system to date had continued to “simply fail the entire community”. “The time for tinkering around the edges and ignoring the conclusions of the myriad of inquiries that have already been conducted must come to an end. “What we have found is disturbing on many levels, not least of course because it has occurred on our watch and in our count,” White and Gooda said on the eve of the report’s release. The royal commission uncovered deep-seated and confronting problems in Australia “that come at an enormous human and financial cost,” they said. “Neither will be sustainable for the NT in the short term.” White and Gooda said their recommended changes to the youth justice and detention system would deliver savings of $335.5m by 2027. Conversely, “doing nothing” would result in last financial year’s costs of $37.3m increasing to $113.4m by 2027. The main driver of that cost blowout would be to continue using existing facilities, they said. NT chief minister Michael Gunner said the report was a story of the NT government’s failure to care about and protect children who needed it most. “It will live as a stain on the Northern Territory reputation,” he said in a speech on Friday morning. “For this I am sorry. But more than this I’m sorry for the stories that live in the children we failed.” He said the government had received the report only that morning and needed time to consider it, but he believed it shared “the same vision”. He said the government had already begun improvements with its sweeping justice reforms and housing package. In its report the commission said many of the reforms were positive, but there continued to be “troubling incidents still occurring” in NT detention centres. The royal commission was called after the ABC broadcast disturbing footage from inside the Don Dale detention centre and Darwin adult prison, of children being mistreated, beaten, restrained, and teargassed. It brought long running concerns to Canberra. The commission received more than 480 witness statements, more than 320 submissions and heard from more than 210 witnesses in 12 weeks of public hearings. Bureaucratic witnesses described a failed system that could not keep up with the volume of child protection reports, could not guarantee protection of those children, and at times covered things up. Corrections witnesses revealed a detention system without sense or accountability. Guards were inadequately trained and got away with abhorrent alleged acts. Juvenile witnesses – all of whom with the exception of Dylan Voller testified in private – spoke of the upbringing and poor decisions that landed them in detention, the horrors they endured there and what needed to change. Ministerial witnesses described challenges trying to fix a broken system without cabinet support, of taking the initiative themselves without expertise of their own or seeking advice from others. Elferink remains unapologetic. The former chief minister Adam Giles recalled nothing. Even after the hearings ended, shocking allegations and evidence continued to be presented by sector workers and advocacy bodies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/17/david-davis-blames-germany-france-brexit-talks-deadlock","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T10:15:24Z","webTitle":"David Davis blames Germany and France for Brexit talks deadlock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/17/david-davis-blames-germany-france-brexit-talks-deadlock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/17/david-davis-blames-germany-france-brexit-talks-deadlock","fields":{"headline":"David Davis blames Germany and France for Brexit talks deadlock","bodyText":"The Brexit secretary, David Davis, is seeking to drive a wedge between Germany and France, and the rest of the countries in the European Union, over the stalled negotiations to leave the bloc. Speaking on Friday before an economic conference in Berlin, Davis suggested the two most powerful countries in Europe were blocking the UK’s hopes, backed by other EU states, to start trade negotiations. “Many of them do want to move on,” he told the BBC. “They see it [progressing to trade negotiations] as very important to them. Countries like Denmark, Holland, Italy, Spain and Poland, can see there are big, big benefits in the future deal that we are talking about,” he said. “They have all got things to benefit from that. This is not a one-way street.” Speaking a week after the EU’s chief negotiatior, Michel Barnier, set the UK a two-week deadline to commit to a higher financial settlement, Davis said the UK and these other countries were looking to Germany and France to compromise on whether sufficient progress had been made to allow the talks to move to the next phase. “Germany and France are the most powerful players on the European continent,” he said. “So what they believe is very influential, sometimes decisively so. But it is a whole-of-Europe decision, it is a 27-country decision.“Always in a negotiation you want the other side to compromise. I want them to compromise – surprise, surprise. Nothing comes for nothing in this world. “But so far in this negotiation we’ve made quite a lot of compromises, on the citizens’ rights front we’ve made all the running … we have been actually offering some quite creative compromises.” Asked whether the EU wanted see a commitment to a bigger divorce settlement, Davis said: “Of course they are saying that, but the other thing that is also clear is many of them do want to move on.” He suggested the UK was willing to accept the jurisdiction of the European court of justice in the first phase of any transition deal. “It will start under the regulations as they are now. Then ideally we’ll end up with a circumstance where we have another arbitration mechanism, but that’s for negotiation.”Davis also signalled a willingness to drop a government amendment to the EU withdrawal bill which would set a date for exiting the EU on the face of the legislation. He said: “It is a good idea because it is stating something which is clear government policy: that we will leave on 29 March 2019. “Now how it’s done, what the form of it is, is being debated in the House … The whole of this bill is going to be debated through the House, and there are parts of it which will change as we go through, undoubtedly.” Meanwhile, the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has called on the UK to give Ireland “more clarity” on its proposals for the Irish border after Brexit. “We all want to move on to phase two of the Brexit negotiations but we are not in a place right now that allows us to do that,” Coveney said at a briefing in Dublin with the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, on Friday. “We also have very serious issues in phase one, particularly around the border and the Good Friday agreement and the peace process, that need more clarity than we currently have.” Coveney suggested the final negotiations over Britain’s exit and its implications for Ireland could take up to five years to work out. Johnson, making his first visit to Ireland since becoming foreign secretary in July 2016, said no one in London or Dublin wanted to see a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit. He said he recognised the “unique circumstances” of the border. “We have to work together, and in order to resolve those issues and get it right for our people it is necessary now to move on to the second stage of negotiations which entail so many of those questions.” His trip to Dublin comes as Theresa May holds talks with her Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on the sidelines of an EU summit in Sweden."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/nov/17/tesla-roadster-electric-supercar-elon-musk-fast","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T11:11:58Z","webTitle":"Tesla Roadster: nine things we know about the 'smackdown to gasoline cars'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/17/tesla-roadster-electric-supercar-elon-musk-fast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/nov/17/tesla-roadster-electric-supercar-elon-musk-fast","fields":{"headline":"Tesla Roadster: nine things we know about the 'smackdown to gasoline cars'","bodyText":"Tesla announced a new version of its very first car, the Roadster, turning it into an electric supercar described as a “hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars” by company founder Elon Musk. The new sports car was unveiled alongside Tesla’s new electric truck, and promises to wow drivers with some extraordinary statistics that make it look like a Top Trumps card turned into an electrified reality. Here’s everything we know about the new Tesla Roadster. 1. Zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds Musk said prototypes of the “base model” are able to hit 60mph from a standstill in 1.9 seconds and that a production version of the car may be able to accelerate even faster. That’s a full 0.4 seconds faster to 60mph than the current fastest Tesla, the Model S P100D, in the so-called ludicrous plus mode, which hits 60mph in 2.3 seconds. But it would also be faster than any current production car, with the performance hybrid Porsche 918 Spyder the current king with a 0-60mph time of 2.2 seconds. The fastest 0-60mph time ever recorded was 1.5 seconds by the AMZ Grimsel Electric Race Car. 2. Zero to 100mph in 4.2 seconds If hitting 60mph in 1.9 seconds wasn’t enough, Tesla reckons the Roadster will be able to reach 100mph from a standstill in 4.2 seconds and go on to do a quarter-of-a-mile time of 8.9 seconds, should Vin Diesel ever come calling. 3. A top speed of 250mph Musk proudly proclaimed that the Roadster will have a top speed of over 250mph, if you can find a straight long enough. The current record for top speed for a production car is the Koenigsegg Agera RS, which reached a speed of 277.87mph on 4 November, in Pahrump, Nevada. 4. Three motors Using a similar system to the Model S P100D, the Roadster will have three motors. One in the front to drive the front wheels and two in the rear to drive the rear wheels giving the Roadster all-wheel drive. 5. It can do 630 miles between charge As if record-breaking acceleration wasn’t enough, Musk said that the Roadster should be able to drive around 630 miles of motorway driving between charges with a 200kWh battery. The current top-rated distance for the Model S 100D at 55mph, at 20 Celsius, is 424 miles. 6. Four humans (of different sizes) will fit in it The Roadster is what is called a 2+2, meaning it has two full-size seats in the front and two smaller seats in the back, meaning that if you really wanted to you could probably squeeze four people into the car, as long as the rear passengers are small people. Other 2+2 cars include Audi’s TT coupe and the Porsche 911. 7. It’ll cost you $200,000 The standard retail price of the so-called base model will start at $200,000 (£151,530) making it the most expensive Tesla to date above the £144,440 top of the line Model X. However, even at the not insignificant sum of $200,000 the Roadster will actually be comparatively cheap for its performance levels. The Porsche 918 Spyder, for instance, cost about £780,000 when new, while the Bugatti Chiron costs about £2.5m. The first 1,000 Roadsters sold will actually cost $250,000 and will be limited edition Founder’s Series. 8. You can’t get one until 2020 Musk said the Roadster will go on sale in 2020, although that figure is speculative given the problems and delays Tesla has faced getting its other cars to market.

Bluegogo burned through 600m yuan (£68m) in investor funding in the year since it was founded by its youthful CEO Li Gang, deploying 700,000 bikes across cities in China. Commonly hailed as the “Uber for bikes”, cycle sharing companies saturated Chinese streets with a technicolour of orange, yellow and blue cycles, frequently crowding out pedestrians. Infamous scenes of derelict bicycles piled in mangled heaps have become common sights. The companies let customers rent bike using their smartphone, and bicycles could be dropped off anywhere. Users pay a deposit fee of 99 to 299 yuan (£11.30 to £34.10) depending on the company and then are charged a fee for every 30 minutes of use. But as reports emerged Bluegogo was in trouble, Chinese social media erupted with users complaining they were unable to get their deposits back, and rumours that Li had fled the country. Bluegogo claimed it had 20m users across China at its height in an open letter written by Li this week. That would mean the company at one point had at least 1.98bn yuan (£226m) in deposits, although it is unclear how much the company is currently holding. Rumors have also spread on Chinese social media saying Li had left China, prompting him to post on his profile: “I have always been in the country, fighting on the front lines for redemption”. The company’s operations will be taken over by another bike sharing startup, Li said in the letter. Visits by Chinese journalists to Bluegogo’s offices found the doors locked and office space abandoned. Bluegogo did not respond to e-mails and text messages seeking comment. In the open letter, Li said the company’s problems began in June, “first with an advertising accident that affected a large investment and possible acquisition”. The ad campaign ran over 4 June replaced the icons for some bikes with tanks, with users encouraged to take those bike to win prizes. The promotion coincided with the 28th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, when Chinese soldiers killed thousands in an effort to suppress democracy protests, and tanks rolled through the streets of Beijing. A company that supplies bikes to Bluegogo is reportedly still owed 10m yuan, saying Bluegogo suspended orders in April, citing financial problems. At least three other bike sharing companies have also gone bust in recent months, although Bluegogo is by far the largest. The wave of consolidations may mean China’s bike sharing industry will soon be dominated by just one or two companies. Bluegogo tried to expand into San Francisco earlier this year but was met by stiff resistance from local politicians. Less than four months later, the company suspended its US experiment. The company also supplied bicycles for an Australia-based bike sharing firm Reddy Go, although it is an separate entity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/18/the-artists-saving-traditional-knowledge-for-the-next-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T23:07:33Z","webTitle":"The artists saving traditional knowledge for the next generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/18/the-artists-saving-traditional-knowledge-for-the-next-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/18/the-artists-saving-traditional-knowledge-for-the-next-generation","fields":{"headline":"The artists saving traditional knowledge for the next generation","bodyText":"English-born landscape artist John Wolseley and Mulkun Wirrpanda, a Yolngu bark painter from north-east Arnhem Land, may seem an unlikely alliance. People might look at Wolseley, his lineage traceable to the Saxons, and Mulkun, the daughter of a murdered warrior, her Yolngu ancestors on this continent for tens of thousands of years before time held meaning, as coming from different worlds. But the truth is that, despite their divergent backgrounds, they inhabit the same world in a universe whose truth has drawn them inextricably together. Their collaboration began informally about six years ago when Mulkun adopted the Englishman as her brother while he was visiting Arnhem Land with other artists. She called him “Läŋgurrk” – a witchetty grub that favours a certain wetland tuber. Now the result of their artistic, scientific and emotional connection is Midawarr Harvest: the art of Mulkun Wirrpanda and John Wolseley, an exhibition opening next weekend, at the National Museum of Australia and a book about the subject that unites them: the traditional foods of north-east Arnhem Land. Wolseley is nearing 80. Mulkun is already well into her ninth decade. What they have made will invariably be seen within the critics’ circle as a tremendous legacy project, which it is. But it is also a gift to the Yolngu – scientific, cultural, gastronomic and, without exaggeration, existential – and their unique place in the world. The book, edited by Wolseley and Will Stubbs (the coordinator of Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Arts Centre in Yirrkala in Arnhem Land), is the manifestation of the knowledge acquired and shared by both artists in their quest to document the natural abundance of the region. Resonant in some ways of Joseph Banks’ Florilegium plant anthology, the book juxtaposes Mulkun’s elaborate bark paintings of traditional foods – bush banana, bush orange and apple, emu berry and numerous tubers, for example – with those of Wolseley from his monolithic, 10-metre-wide watercolour tableau, Distant glimpses of the great floodplains seen through a veil of trees and hanging vines. Yolngu woman and Yirrkala school principal, Merrkiyawuy Ganambarr-Stubbs, has drawn on the knowledge of Mulkun and other old people (as well as her own) to offer detailed descriptions of all the identified foods. A passion to reintroduce the Yolngu to these foods, is what drove Mulkun to obsessively travel, harvest and paint the fruits, vegetables, nuts and berries. Merrkiyawuy says: “This is important because when people like Mulkun pass away, a lot of that knowledge dies also. The exhibition and the book revitalises it, keeps it alive for our people, so the children don’t just eat junk food from the shop. I knew many of these foods from my childhood. But I haven’t seen some of them for a very long time.” Wolseley, who migrated to Australia in 1978, uses various techniques including watercolour, collage, and frottage. While the name Wolseley dates to the 1100s in Staffordshire (where his family is said to have killed the last of the English wolves) and links to various royal courts, he describes his mob as “mostly pretty dull horses and hounds types”. The family crest includes an English wolf, his family’s notorious connection to which, he says, may be responsible for his ardent environmentalism and love of nature. “One of the most amazing things about Mulkun’s paintings is the fact that she can paint out of her head something like 50 different kinds of plants. I wonder how many white artists could do the same – maybe a daffodil or perhaps wattle or something? Or maybe nothing,” he says. “I really think this book is, in a sense, an Indigenous equivalent of Joseph Banks’ Florilegium in that every illustration of a plant is a great work of art in itself and Merrkiyawuy’s detailed description of each plant is done with attention to its practical and cultural significance to the Yolngu.” Mulkun’s resolve to reintroduce the Yolngu to traditional foods became evident when she brought what Stubbs regarded as “a strange bark painting” – essentially a detailed botanic depiction – into the arts centre a few years back. She said it was “Bundjunu”. His research determined it was of Capparis umbonata – a native Australian caper. Mulkun, whose warrior father Dhakiyarr Wirrpanda disappeared, believed murdered, after the high court cleared him of murdering a white policemen in 1934, explained why: “This is the food we ate when I was young. Back then, everywhere you looked there were old people. Strong and healthy – they lived with us for a long time. Nowadays people die when they are only young. There are very few people as old as I am. Children are given rubbish food to eat. It is killing us.” In his essay for the book, Stubbs, a former criminal lawyer who is married to Merrkiyawuy, writes: “The human genius to do ‘less for more’ allows deep-fried chips with chicken salt to become the ‘tuber’ of choice among young Yolngu. And these Yolngu are dying faster than the ancient knowledge itself on a diet that results in obesity and diabetes ... This collection of paintings is a love poem to those delicious and bounteous foods which surround the children even as they are being poisoned.” Wolseley recalls how, with some irony, he and Mulkun would declare themselves “off to the supermarket” when they would embark on their travels to the numerous ecosystems within Yolngu country to harvest, dine and paint. The tensions between nature and artifice, instinctive tradition and modernity, freights the stylistically contrasting exhibition works of the two artists. They are themes, of course, that define the sometimes seemingly intractable clash of approaches to nature and cosmology at the nexus of black-white Australia. The Yolngu have long appreciated the wild divergences of terroir in a country that can produce dozens of different edible tubers (the innocuous “weed” above the ground can hide the most delicate culinary pleasure beneath). But climate change and its consequent saline leach now threatens the mangroves and other wetland and dryland habitats. The Yolngu world might be beautiful Arnhem land, its salt and fresh waters, its stories and its heavens above, but it is not immune from global ecological impact or its economic/social scourges, including junk food. It is conceivable, then, that this Yolngu knowledge, to harvest and feed, could save lives beyond north-east Arnhem Land. While monetising such knowledge is somewhat antithetical to the Yolngu world view, such possibilities must, to other minds, seem endless. A white European man dropped in the Arnhem Land wilderness might still die of starvation today while surrounded with food. While white Europeans stole much of the continent, we still don’t know quite how to survive its wildernesses alone. It is a pretty stark contrast with those who have been here 60,000-plus years. Story, its sacred traditions and ownership, is intrinsic to the creation of Yolngu country, all its people, animals and plants. Most plants are somewhere in the songlines; one may rate a mere mention while others will have whole songs and long stories dedicated to them. There are many clans. It is not for one clan to tell – in song, dance or in paint on bark – the stories of another. This posed the type of practical artistic problem for Mulkun that would be unimaginable for a non-Indigenous artist. She explained: “Once I started painting food plants without reference to their sacred identity, I had to find a new way to paint. I could not use the [madayin] min’tji (sacred design) or steal the sacred identity of the plants which belonged to clans other than my own. So I had to find a marwat (cross-hatched background) which was just wakinŋu (ordinary) but not just infill. I had to let the plants tell me what their secular identity or character was. By the way they grow or the way they look or express themselves. They gave me their rhythm or their pattern.” Midawarr Harvest: The Art of Mulkun Wirrpanda and John Wolseley is the gift in return. Midawarr Harvest: The Art of Mulkun Wirrpanda and John Wolseley is on at the National Museum of Australia from 24 November 2017 to 18 February 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/20/what-is-australias-favourite-bird-have-your-say-in-the-guardians-2017-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T01:53:20Z","webTitle":"What is Australia's favourite bird?

Have your say in the Guardian's 2017 poll","bodyText":"Birds. From the glorious king parrot to the much-maligned white ibis, Australians are passionate about them. But is there one bird that reigns supreme in the hearts and minds of the public? The Guardian is determined to find out. In partnership with BirdLife Australia, we are running a poll to determine the Australian bird of the year for 2017. Last month Guardian Australia staff conducted their own straw poll on their favourite birds. Now the net has been cast wider and we are seeking the views of readers. Will the magnificent cassowary grab the top spot? Or will the lyrebird sing its way to victory? Little penguins might endear themselves to many, but will this be enough to pip the majesty of the wedge-tailed eagle? History may hint at which way the Australian public will vote. In 1908 the Argus ran a similar poll, with 1,500 Victorians voting. Their decision? The humble but playful willy wagtail – then also known as the black and white fantail – took the top spot. BirdLife Australia ran a national poll in 2013, when the superb fairywren came out on top. In both surveys, the authors and the voters agonised about the birds on the shortlist, with the 2013 poll resulting in some controversy. This year there are 50 to choose from, but we have no doubt readers would want others included. (This author feels the night parrot, once considered Australia’s most elusive bird, ought to be on the list. As should the palm cockatoo – Australia’s largest cockatoo.) So if you feel the best Australian bird has been ignored, we have included an option for you to add it yourself. If a write-in campaign is waged, a bird not on the shortlist could win. Sean Dooley from BirdLife Australia says his favourite bird is not among those included. As a lifelong birdwatcher, his choice is a little obscure for many city dwellers. “The grey-crowned babbler is a great bird that is spread right across Australia,” Dooley says. But among the choices on the shortlist, he is torn between the cassowary (“hard to ignore”) and the Gouldian finch (“bloody beautiful birds”). The project has a serious side. Many birds are threatened, primarily through habitat loss. And even among those that are not, distributions are changing rapidly. Deforestation, fire regimes, rising temperatures, modern development practices and changing seasons are all taking a toll on birds that many Australians hold dear. There have been reports of Carnaby’s black cockatoos falling out of the sky in Perth when temperatures soared during heatwaves. Changing fire regimes have contributed to the declining population of Gouldian finches. Muttonbirds, while still common, are being severely affected by climate change and plastic pollution in the ocean. Many readers will have seen the variety of birds in their backyard changing over time. Dooley says the trend has been a loss of diversity, with larger and more aggressive birds dominating – such as magpies, noisy mynas and rainbow lorikeets. So cast your vote. And if you want to get your favourite to the top, you might need to call on your friends to do the same."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/18/helicopter-pilot-killed-in-mid-air-crash-named-as-mike-green","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T17:23:39Z","webTitle":"Helicopter pilot killed in mid-air crash named as Mike Green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/18/helicopter-pilot-killed-in-mid-air-crash-named-as-mike-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/18/helicopter-pilot-killed-in-mid-air-crash-named-as-mike-green","fields":{"headline":"Helicopter pilot killed in mid-air crash named as Mike Green","bodyText":"A helicopter pilot killed in a mid-air collision in Buckinghamshire on Friday has been named as Capt Mike Green, according to the Press Association. He was a senior instructor with Helicopter Services, based at Wycombe Air Park. A spokesman for the company, which offers training flights and gift experiences, declined to comment. Green, who had learned to fly in the army, was hailed by fellow pilots as “one of the best”. Former colleague Capt Phil Croucher said: “He was probably the most well-respected instructor in the country. He achieved a very high position within the army as an instructor. If you wanted a training instructor there’s no one more highly qualified.” The police have yet to officially release any details of the victims, saying formal identification was still under way. Green, who was in his 60s, is survived by a partner and family. He was said to have been training a student on a beginners’ course when the helicopter was involved in the collision. Recorded flight data showed the helicopter had been in the air for 15 minutes after taking off from Wycombe Air Park, 20 miles from the crash scene. It was flying at just over 1,000ft when it vanished off the radar just after noon on Friday. Eyewitnesses reported it collided with a Cessna 152 two-seater plane. Local reports said the plane was being flown by an instructor and the passenger was understood to be a student at Buckinghamshire New University. Police and air accident investigators continue to scour the crash site near the Waddesdon estate, the former country seat of the Rothschild banking dynasty, for clues about the cause of the collision. Supt Rebecca Mears of Thames Valley police said air crash investigators and police were expected to be at the scene until at least Monday. She said it was “too early to tell” what might have caused the crash. Speaking to reporters at the scene, Mears confirmed that the four people killed in the crash were all men, two in each of the aircraft involved. “All the families have now been informed and are being supported by officers in the family liaison arena,” she said. “Three of the families have visited the site today with our support so they can understand a little bit more about what’s happened to their loved ones. “We remain on site today so that we work with the air accident branch and a number of other experts from the fire service and the military with a view to using their expert services to recover the men’s bodies, hopefully before the end of the day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/19/leonardo-billionaires-taste-wealth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T00:05:46Z","webTitle":"Great collectors used to have great taste.

Now they simply show off their wealth","bodyText":"If you walk around Mayfair or Manhattan at twilight and look up, you could glimpse a Damien Hirst spot painting through an apartment window. The simple circles of colour on a grid and a white background are recognisable and everywhere. There are more than 1,000 in existence, and they have been exhibited all over the world. The spot paintings are visually inoffensive; if one catches your eye, it does not hold it. One works as well hung in the living room as it does in the boardroom. But whichever wall it does grace, even a child knows it’s a Hirst, though painted by his assistants, even if they can’t differentiate one work from another. That is the state of modern-day art collecting: safe, boring and expensive. According to a recent UBS/PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the world’s billionaires have seen their net worth climb by more than $900bn in the past year, collectively topping $6tn. There is a new rich class swimming in liquidity that can afford art with a high price-tag, which serves as both an asset, if an unreliable one, and a display of status. Chinese, Russian and Ukrainian billionaires have entered the market. Hedge fund managers trail behind them. A pricey artwork is just what you need after remodelling your billion-pound home: you splash your cash to display your wealth, if not your taste. All of this goes some way to explain the astonishing price tag of Salvator Mundi, the most expensive painting ever sold at auction. The 500-year-old painting of Christ is thought to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci. It sold for a record $450m (£341m) in Christie’s auction rooms in New York last Wednesday evening. The identity of the buyer has not been revealed. Though Leonardo da Vinci was a masterful artist, Salvator Mundi is not a great work of art. Christ faces the viewer in a conventional composition, with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere. His eyes are blank; his hair is limp. Cleaned and repainted so often, and layered in varnish, there is little left of what was original. It probably was by Leonardo, but not many of the brushstrokes can be his. He used assistants a lot at the time it was painted, and now much of it is reconstruction. The inflated price was the result of a brilliant marketing campaign. The auction house conjured up a spectacle of smoke and mirrors. They named the work the “male Mona Lisa”. Pre-sale viewings in London, New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong drew 27,000 people. They commissioned a video – entitled The Last da Vinci: The World is Watching – more visually pleasing and dramatic than the painting, chronicling the emotional response of viewers. The buyer purchased a celebrity, something famous. Critics of the sale have trotted out the usual complaint, that the incredible amount of money could have been spent on hospitals and playgrounds. But I’d argue that there is nothing wrong with spending this much on art per se, just on this piece. More shocking than the price tag is that great works of art are available for a fraction of the Leonardo, but few collectors are interested. The most telling move is that Salvator Mundi was sold in the auction houses’ post-war and contemporary sale, rather than in an Old Masters sale, where you expect to find paintings from the period between the 13th and 18th century. The Leonardo, thought to have been painted in early 1500, sat alongside the currently hot Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol, from the 1980s and 1960s respectively, though the jaded may joke that much of the paint on the Leonardo is so recent that it qualifies. In a few weeks’ time, there will be other far more worthwhile sales, but no bidding billionaires will be in attendance. The new money usually only sits in the auction room when something 20th century turns up. They leave when the old stuff arrives. Yet what is on offer at the December Old Masters sales at Christie’s and Sotheby’s, including one of Joseph Wright of Derby’s best-known works, An Academy by Lamplight, is breathtaking and, in context, extraordinarily cheap. One of the first paintings listed, The Betrayal of Christ from the School of the Lower Rhine (circa 1510-15) is projected to go for £200,000 – £300,000. A late portrait by Titian should fetch £1m to £1.5m. Here you can get a decent Old Master, something museum-worthy, for a fraction of the cost of an unremarkable house in London. What’s concerning is that in the past these would have been snapped up by collectors who were keen to demonstrate not only their status and wealth – vanities that have always driven the art market – but their erudition and social conscience. I’m thinking of the likes of the Anglo-Austrian art collector and art historian, Count Antoine Seilern, an old-school collector, one driven by scholarship, who devoted himself to the study of art history. He enrolled at the University of Vienna to study art history, and the subject of his doctoral dissertation was the Venetian influences on the ceiling paintings of Peter Paul Rubens. So loved was his collection of oil paintings that he rarely opened the blinds to his home in London’s South Kensington, where he lived after the second world war, to protect them; he largely refused to turn on the lights because he said it distorted the colours. Seilern was one of a coterie of rich collectors who tried to buy great and important pictures, rather than, as now, chasing what was obvious. The men, and they were often men, did their own research, took risks, and bought what was unknown, unrecognised, and unfashionable. Among them was the American art historian Bernard Berenson, who worked for Joseph Duveen, a key dealer who bought art from European aristocrats and sold it to rising US robber barons in search of status. Duveen famously attributed his success to noticing that “Europe has a great deal of art, and America has a great deal of money”. The public benefited from those connoisseur collectors in a way that it doesn’t from modern-day ignorant billionaires. They shaped taste and furnished great museums and galleries with tremendous art work: Duveen helped build the great collections of Mellon and Kress, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington; he funded the Duveen Gallery in the British Museum designed to house the Parthenon sculptures. Even Seilern’s paintings eventually came down from his darkened walls and were hung in broad daylight as the bulk of his collection was bequeathed to the Courtauld Institute of Art. Go there to see a true masterpiece.

Credit to the All Blacks for holding out – and scoring a sensational try – with 14 players for much of that climax. That’s all from me, thanks for reading. Stuart Hogg accepts the man of the match award and says he’s “bloody disappointed” not to have claimed the win. His captain John Barclay says they’ve let a huge opportunity slip by. Hogg walks away in tears, he’s devastated. “He’s a dangerous player, isn’t he?” Kieran Read says with a grin. “We’re lucky we have a quick player too in Beauden Barrett to catch him.” And with that, the referee blows his whistle. A thrilling second half –Scotland came so close. 80 min Stuart Hogg makes a brilliant run, carving through the All Blacks’ defence and searing towards the corner but he’s hauled into touch with the try line just a few metres away! Agonising. 79 min Scotland claim the restart and they will end this match searching for that try... 78 min Russell adds the extra two to put Scotland within a converted try of an historic victory. Scotland 17-22 New Zealand. 77 min They are back in it! Scotland work it wide where Hogg plays a clever bouncing kick down the line. It’s caught by Seymour who passes to Huw Jones and the centre goes over in the corner. 76 min Liam Squire makes a stunning dash through the Scottish defence but he can’t decide on a pass and eventually loses it at the breakdown, conceding a penalty for holding on. 74 min The All Blacks win a free-kick and of course they opt for a scrum, where not only do they have an advantage but they can eat up valuable time. 73 min They didn’t – the scrum turns and the All Blacks win a penalty. 72 min Scotland are piling on the pressure, but the referee pauses things and hands them a scrum that I’m not sure they really wanted. 71 min Sam Cane returns but with Crockett off, New Zealand remain at 14. 70 min Another fantastic response by Scotland who go searching for a try. They win a penalty after Wyatt Crockett cleans out the scrum-half before the ball was out of the ruck, and he’s off. 68 min Barrett adds two more points and the All Blacks have not the sin-binning of Sam Cane affect them. Scotland 10-22 New Zealand. 66 min This is a sublime try. It all starts from Sonny Bill Williams whose backhanded offload in the tackle is almost matched by the bursting run of Damian McKenzie. He charges through the Scottish defence and has Beauden Barrett on his outside to finish the move. So quick, so accurate. Breathtaking rugby by the All Blacks. 64 min After several little gains the ball is spilled by Scottish hands in the centre of pitch. Scrum New Zealand. 62 min Russell adds the two points, and suddenly Scotland are right in this with a one-man advantage for the next nine minutes. Scotland 10-15 New Zealand. 61 min Scotland tap the next penalty and finally they break through, as Jonny Gray picks from the ruck and thumps through the tacklers and over the line. 60 min Jonny Gray gathers the lineout with a stretch and the Scottish pack drive. They send runners battering into the New Zealand defence, winning a penalty, and when it’s taken quickly Sam Cane concedes another penalty and is sent to the bin. 59 min Scotland get a penalty following a collapsed maul and they opt to kick to the corner. 58 min Suddenly the game comes alive. New Zealand make a break down the left wing and are surely in for a try but Finn Russell anticipates the final pass and intercepts brilliantly, chipping down field and forcing the All Blacks to scramble back. The crowd enjoyed that passage. 56 min A lull with both teams probing without much luck. 53 min Scotland again build some good momentum but it ends in a mistake when Pete Horne can’t quite grab an offload. 52 min Barrett adds the simple conversion: Scotland 3-15 New Zealand. 51 min New Zealand follow a lineout with a drive from the pack before spreading the ball into the centre, where Damian McKenzie gets on the end of clever Williams grubber kick and touches down under the posts. Hamilton is transported form the field with his ankle in heavy strapping and play resumes. 49 min The clock is stopped for an injury to Luke Hamilton, who looks to have damaged his ankle making a tackle. 47 min Scotland show some more of the excellent running rugby they delivered in the first half, building pressure in the All Blacks’ half, until Horne concedes a penalty for tackling a man at the breakdown. 45 min Barrett doesn’t get the required curl on his kick from the touchline and it remains 3-8. 44 min Rieko Ioane catches a high ball beautifully before offloading and the All Blacks stream forwards. Smith shimmies down the blindside before they shift it all the way across the line to the far side where Codie Taylor is waiting to surge over in the corner. 42 min They power towards the try line but at the second breakdown Stuart McInally fails to release, under pressure from Sam Whitelock, and that’s a penalty. 41 min New Zealand were oddly lacking in intensity in that first half and they have begun the second in a similar manor. Scotland have a scrum inside the 22, slightly to the left, and it’s a brilliant platform. Russell kicks the second-half under way and the All Blacks quickly hand over a gift of a knock-on. A half-time email from Geoffrey Roberts: “It’s good to see the Scots going in with great energy and enthusiasm and they have shown the ABs a thing or two. The ABs look jaded to me, scrappy, untidy so the Scots have a great chance for a famous victory, but what did the man say ... ‘Don’t make them cross’.” Not a thriller, but Scotland will be delighted with that first 40 minutes. The only disappointment will be that they couldn’t convert some more of those promising positions into points – they should really be in front on the scoreboard. 42 min Russell tries a long drop-goal which goes nowhere near, and suddenly the All Blacks collect it and counter at speed through Ioane. They are awarded a penalty for holding on after the tackle which Barrett slams into the Scottish 22. Lineout, deep into this additional time, but an error at the breakdown hands the Scots a penalty which Russell boots into the crowd to end the half. 40 min Williams tries a pass out of the back of the hand but it’s spilled into touch. Scotland will have one last attack before the break. 38 min Beauden Barrett puts the penalty through the posts. 37 min Barclay is penalised for trying to rip the ball from the breakdown while he was off his feet. The replay shows he was leaning slightly on the tackled All Black with his knees and he clearly got a warning from Matthew Carley before losing the decision. A chance for the All Blacks to kick themselves level. 35 min The Scottish pack are creaking and they concede a penalty which the All Blacks use to go for another scrum. But this time it spins and Scotland pinch the ball! 34 min A big mistake by Tommy Seymour. The ball clearly touches his leg before bouncing over the Scottish try line, but he touches down all the same. The referee Matthew Carley spots it and the All Blacks have a five-metre scrum. 32 min It’s Fagerson who is penalised at the set piece, conceding a penalty which Barrett boots close to halfway. 31 min Scrum for New Zealand in their own 22. I haven’t needed to bring up the score since the sixth minute – a reminder that Scotland lead 3-0 and they have been good for that advantage, too. 30 min ...they go through 18 phases when Zander Fagerson spills and New Zealand survive. 29 min Scotland make the most of the penalty, winning the lineout and going on the attack. The home team probe in and around the fringes of the breakdown, cautious not to lose the opportunity... Referee Matthew Carley decides to give only a penalty, with no card, due to Scotland’s No9 Ali Price impeding Naholo moments before Hogg was taken out. Seemed a yellow card from my seat. 28 min The All Blacks push too early and the scrum is scrapped. Scotland kick long and when it returns, Waisake Naholo seems to take out a leaping Stuart Hogg. To the TMO. 27 min Clock stopped as Hamish Watson receives treatment. 25 min Cane peels off the back of the lineout and charges into the heart of the Scottish defence. Read picks and goes and several of his team-mates follow suit. They eventually open it out to Barrett but his pass to the charging Ryan Crotty outside him is adjudged to be forwards. A great spot by the referee. 24 min The All Blacks make huge gains via Rieko Ioane’s burst from a lineout, earning a penalty for not moving away near the corner which Barrett kicks to touch. 21 min This has been a near-perfect opening 20 minutes by the home team, bar that handling error a moment ago. Ali Price kicks perfectly to the corner and it bounces off the field for a New Zealand lineout. 20 min It was Russell’s pass to Huw Jones, and Jones who actually dropped the ball in a brilliant position. 19 min Scotland’s forwards work through several phases, slowly increasing the pressure. Suddenly they pass wide but it’s dropped by Russell with the try line beckoning! 18 min Another penalty after Nepo Laulala came in from the side. Kickable, but Scotland want more and go for the corner. 16 min Brilliant enthusiasm at the breakdown by the Scottish forwards and particularly their captain John Barclay, earning a penalty for their work. 15 min New Zealand earn a scrum in a useful spot on the left side near Scotland’s 22. 13 min Hogg again joins the line and dances around a tackle, but at the next breakdown Sam Cane is quickly there putting on pressure and forcing a penalty, which the All Blacks kick to touch to gain their first piece of meaningful territory. 12 min Russell’s kick drifts wide of the posts from 40 metres. Not an easy kick, but one you feel shouldn’t be wasted against this opposition. 11 min The Scots are pushed back by the All Blacks’ swarming blitz defence but a moment later Scotland earn a penalty when Vaea Fifita fails to release the ball in the tackle. 9 min Smith box-kicks and doesn’t get huge distance, handing Scotland a lineout in a promising area just outside the 22. 8 min Russell almost claims a crucial interception which would have surely resulted in a try, but drops the ball on the stretch attempting to catch. 6 min And their slick play generates a first penalty for holding on after the tackle. Finn Russell slots the kick. 5 min Hogg has started brightly and he almost steps into a gap in the All Black line but is pulled down at the last moment. Scotland are going well, offloading quickly and moving the ball well. 3 min They run it from the back through Sonny Bill Williams, then kick long and a few moments later Russell measures a lovely kick off the pitch with a couple of bounces. 2 min A knock-on by a Scottish hand gives an early scrum to the All Blacks. Peeeep and we’re off, and quickly Scotland gain some good territory and earn a lineout in New Zealand’s 22. Former international Doddie Weir presents the ball to warm applause – it was announced in the summer that he is suffering from Motor Neurone Disease. Here’s the Haka, fronted by Kieran Read, who made his debut at Murrayfield 108 caps ago. Flower of Scotland is quite simply the best national anthem out there. Murrayfield gives it some gusto. “While I would dearly like to see some All Black magic,” emails Geoffrey Roberts, “I fear that the Scots will play right up to and over the legal limit. I know, I know the Britfans cannot ever forgive McCaw for his liberal ways to tame the referee but I hope that in the match the rules will be strictly interpreted. The ‘new scrum rules’ excepted of course.” Scotland have never beaten the All Blacks. In all of their 30 meetings they’ve managed only two draws, conceding 900 points along the way, so how on earth do they go about rewriting history? “It’s just a stat,” insisted the captain John Barclay this week. “We have 80 minutes to try and change that record.” Stuart Hogg had the same fighting talk: “We’re not going out to stand back, watch and admire the All Blacks, are we? They’re the best team in the world, so bring it on. We are more than capable of knocking them over. If you don’t believe that, you are in the wrong place.” It is perhaps a compliment that New Zealand have named their strongest side, but it makes the task at hand just about as difficult as it gets in rugby union. The teams Scotland: Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour, Huw Jones, Alex Dunbar, Lee Jones, Finn Russell, Ali Price; Cornell du Preez, Hamish Watson, John Barclay (captain), Jonny Gray, Ben Toolis, Zander Fagerson, Stuart McInally, Darryl Marfo.

This week, the father of five was commenting on teenagers posting provocative selfies online. He’s banned his 14-year-old daughter Daisy from posting selfies, and says that some of the photos he’s seen of other girls are “quite porno, luscious, pouty, pushing boobs out”. Oliver notes that this is the first parental generation to deal with social media, and wonders: why are the girls allowed to do it? Oliver says: “I’m like: Really? Aren’t their parents all over that like a rash?” Well, I have news for Oliver – it’s quite probable that parents aren’t “letting them do it”. And it’s almost certain that they’re not looking at their daughters’ “porno” photos, saying: “You look great there, licking your lips suggestively in that tight top – why don’t you put it on Instagram?” The point being that parents either don’t realise that their children are doing it (or at least the extent of it), or they do realise, but they also twig that there no way of stopping it altogether, short of confiscating all phones and tablets, and locking the children in a padded cell between the ages of 11 and 19. And, believe me, there may be times when that latter option doesn’t seem completely out of the question. Many a battleworn parent of a teenager has travelled the trajectory from “Fly, my child, fly fearless and free”, to a version of “Off to the tower, Rapunzel, and, if you let down your hair, all Netflix rights will be suspended.” What sometimes seems to be going on is self-willed parental myopia – an often-unconscious reluctance to realise that, while there are always exceptions, their kids are most probably up to everything their friends are up to, or a version of it – either some, or all of the time, either right in front of their faces, or sneaking around behind their backs. It’s part of the Secret World of Teenage, and in that designated age-restricted zone, operating within their own circles, it’s usually (not always, but usually) harmless and short-lived enough. And, of course, it’s not “porno”. They’re playing – testing boundaries, experimenting with their image – which has always gone on to an extent. While most parents wouldn’t have taken selfies in their youth, let’s be honest, it’s only because we didn’t think of it. Personally, I did a fair bit of prancing about in front of other people’s cameras, and, from the looks of it, my self-obsession was in rude health, with rude the operative word – in some photos, the look I appear to be going for is Trafficked Goth. While it’s a bit excruciating, it’s also screamingly funny. However – and this is the generational dividing line – back in my day, my cringeworthy cavorting was kept more or less private. As Oliver points out, there’s now social media to deal with. Photos have the potential to drop a cluster bomb of far-reaching consequences – ranging from the degradation of revenge porn, problems with future employers, to young kids just not registering that, quite often, it’s not just their target peer group that can see the images. So, Oliver is right, there’s plenty to worry about – in terms of short-term behaviour and long-term consequences. As any half-bright celebrity could tell you, the thing they miss the most is their anonymity. Many young people are losing this great privilege, tossing it away for a few “likes”, at a time when they’re too heartbreakingly young to realise the full implications. Even sadder, there’s no stopping it. Tech-wise at least, most kids would be far savvier than their parents. Too often, this isn’t about parents “letting them do it”, or failing to stop it – if certain kids want to do it, the truth is they will usually find a way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2017/nov/18/zimbabwe-economy-robert-mugabe-grace","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T21:21:25Z","webTitle":"This is redistribution for Zimbabwe’s elite, not revolution in a ruined nation | Jason Burke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2017/nov/18/zimbabwe-economy-robert-mugabe-grace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/commentisfree/2017/nov/18/zimbabwe-economy-robert-mugabe-grace","fields":{"headline":"This is redistribution for Zimbabwe’s elite, not revolution in a ruined nation","bodyText":"Drive any distance anywhere in Zimbabwe beyond the upmarket Borrowdale neighbourhood in Harare, where Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace are detained in their sprawling mansion, and the scale of the challenges facing what was once one of the wealthiest countries in Africa is evident. In the capital, the roads are potholed, outside they are cracked and crumbling. Banks are so short of cash that people wait hours to withdraw even tiny sums. The only jobs are in government service, yet salaries are rarely paid. The best and the brightest have long fled abroad. Warehouses are empty, fields lie fallow. The busiest store in rural villages is the “bottle shop”, selling dirt-cheap spirits. Zimbabwe has famously abundant natural resources but resuscitating the economy after 20 years of disastrous mismanagement and wholesale looting by corrupt officials is a major undertaking. The banking system needs to be rebooted, faith restored in the national currency and government finances somehow replenished. The vast debts incurred by Mugabe’s regime need to be rescheduled or waived and new funding arranged to rebuild the country’s shattered infrastructure. Investors have long been interested in Zimbabwe but put off by the significant risk that any funds will be stolen or any successful venture appropriated. Can they now be sure that will not happen? Old habits die hard. The ruling Zanu-PF party and allies in the military launched their takeover to purge an ambitious faction that threatened their position, not because they wanted to see structural reform that would shut down their own lucrative rackets and rent-seeking. There are immediate practical problems, too. The police are seen as creatures of Mugabe by the military and allies, but someone needs to patrol the streets. There is the fate of Comrade Bob and Grace, when they are no longer president and first lady, to decide. There is a government to form, possible elections to hold. It is this political process that poses the greatest challenge. The people of Zimbabwe have high hopes of a new democratic era. But the ousting of Mugabe was a redistribution of power within the ruling elite of Zimbabwe, not a people’s revolution. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the ousted vice-president, who is most likely to succeed Mugabe when he finally leaves power, is no committed democrat. He was Mugabe’s chief enforcer, with a long history of human rights abuse. Mnangagwa, 75, will need to make some concessions to public opinion within Zimbabwe and the hopes of the international community, not least to get the donor and diaspora money the country so desperately needs. However, he will seek to do this while reinforcing, not weakening, the grip of the party. But how long will Zimbabweans tolerate the rule of a clique of septuagenarian veterans of an armed struggle that took place before most of the population was born? A similar question has been asked elsewhere in Africa over recent decades. It is being asked today in neighbouring South Africa, where the lustre of the African National Congress has steadily diminished over its 23 years in power. The eventual demise of parties like Zanu-PF is inevitable. But so, too, is the trauma that accompanies their passing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/19/zimbabwe-is-not-the-banana-republic-of-western-fancy-after-mugabe-it-can-thrive","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T00:05:46Z","webTitle":"Zimbabwe is not the banana republic of western fancy.

After Mugabe, it can thrive","bodyText":"On Friday, an office worker at a government building took down President Mugabe’s portrait to dust it, as she has done every day for years. Then she paused, unsure whether to put it back up. The portrait is everywhere, from supermarkets, offices and banks. There he is – Mugabe, sitting stiffly in his dark suit, peering down through thick-rimmed glasses, as the stern father looking down at us. Much like the portrait, Mugabe has been an ever-present influence in every Zimbabwean’s life. But yesterday, as strangers hugged and stopped to dance with each other when I made my way to an anti-Mugabe rally, it seemed that he was finally leaving, with Zimbabweans looking to the future with a mix of anxiety and hope. Everyone has imagined what they would do the day Robert Mugabe goes. They have replayed it in their minds, over and over. They would go into the streets, sing and dance and honk their car horns. They would, over a beer, toast the end of a rule that has denied opportunity to an entire generation. But his end has not been that sudden. The last days of Mugabe have, instead, been something of a soap opera. Is this really how it is all going to end, we’ve asked each other over the last days. Many of us have known no other leader. He was sold to us as the father of the nation. Our guardian. The one who led our struggle for independence and protected us from imperialists. Watching the reign of such a dominant figure end in such a farce is not what we imagined. The military action against him was made in plain sight. Zimbabweans stared at their phones as incredible pictures of army vehicles rolling into Harare flew around social media. That Tuesday night, few slept. The army had taken over the state broadcaster, someone said. No. It was all fake news, we said. But then, in the early hours of Wednesday, two men in military uniform appeared on the screens. We are here just for the criminals around Mugabe, they said. This is not a coup. For a full day, there were no further updates. We scrolled through the foreign news channels desperate to find out what was happening in our own country. In the vacuum, we did what we do best. We created memes online and joked away the anxiety. Soon we grew tired of the jokes. For years, state media had sold us the image of an invincible man. Now we watched, mouths agape, as the young ZBC presenter said the words we never thought we would hear on national television: “Zanu-PF has asked President Mugabe to step down.” This was when we knew we had to start thinking of life without him. He has built for himself the image of a father figure who the country cannot do without. Many Zimbabweans had even come to see him as the country and now wonder what life will be without him. In the western media, he has often been touted as the good leader who somehow turned bad midway, especially when he started taking over white-held land. Only after the land takeovers did the world start to see him as an ogre. Zimbabweans know better. As Mugabe himself told an interviewer in 1981: “What I was, I still am.” In the 1980s, a military brigade that reported directly to Mugabe killed thousands of civilians in the south of the country. Through the 1990s, Mugabe expelled party officials who opposed his plan to establish a one-party state and make himself leader for life. Protests by unions were brutally crushed as the economy collapsed. Now, a generation that has lived under no other leader must dare to hope. Zimbabwe is often portrayed as the standard African banana republic. We face-palm when we read distorted western portrayals of the country we live in; we side-eye the talking heads on CNN as they call us a failed state. Zimbabwe has suffered greatly, but we remain a young nation still bursting with unrealised potential. We are relieved, but cautious. The changes are a chance to start over, even though we are not quite sure what change exactly this is. Despite all the years of decline, Zimbabwe’s infrastructure – from roads to communications – is largely intact. Banks are without cash, but the financial sector is modern. The population is young, well educated and desperate to use its idle skills. From the rolling hills in the east to the game parks in the west, Zimbabwe has some of the best tourist attractions in Africa. The country is rich with minerals, from gold to lithium, with demand for latter growing as it is used in rechargeable devices. Yesterday morning, before Zimbabweans marched for Mugabe’s resignation, I went to the place where it all began for him. Stodart Hall is in Mbare, Harare’s oldest township. There is nothing here that suggests it is a place full of history. The light bulbs have been stolen and, at the entrance, there is a sign announcing the start times for the next prophetic healing service. On Pazarangu Avenue, which runs past the hall, jobless youths sit on piles of bricks and prop their feet up on boxes to avoid the slime flowing from a broken sewerage pipe. Across the road, at what used to be a sports complex, a crew is preparing for a show, later that night, of Kinnah, a popular artist of the dancehall music that has become the refuge of many poor urban youths. Nothing says that this was where Mugabe, almost 60 years ago, began his political career when a fiery speech he made sparked weeks of protest. Mugabe has come back to Stodart Hall frequently, but only to preside over the funerals of his dead war comrades. The hall is used for such occasions. At the National Heroes Acre, the burial place for heroes of the struggle, a sculpture of Mugabe stands fixed to a towering wall. Many who lie here sacrificed more, but it is Mugabe alone who stands immortalised in bronze, chest thrust forward, flag fluttering behind him. On one visit, Kingston Kazambara, the curator, looked up at the massive piece of North Korean art, and gushed: “That’s none other than His Excellency, Comrade Robert Gabriel Mugabe, majestically, triumphantly, bravely guiding his flock forward to a new future.” Now we must imagine a new future without him, and without the portraits of a big man looking down on our every move.

But this doesn’t mean that your liveblog-based fun is over! Here’s Barry Glendenning with the latest from Old Trafford. Bye! Match reports! The history boys: In League One, 10-man Shrewsbury scored a stoppage-time winner at Rotherham to take full advantage of Wigan’s slip and secure their position at the top of the table for a little while. Meanwhile, Merthyr Town grabbed a late goal and thus their game at Chesham United in a 13-1 home win. Ed Hewitson, their goalkeeper, was named man of the match. Luton started the season with an 8-2 home win against Yeovil, smashed Stevenage 7-1 at Kennilworth Road a month ago, and today have trounced Cambridge 7-0. Incredible goalmanship there. Lots of goals for home teams and absolutely none for the travellers. Lots of drama but no winners at Selhurst Park. In League One, Bradford have taken a 2-1 stoppage-time lead at Wigan, who thus won’t go top today. Two excellent goals do the job for the leaders, who could have been a man down inside the first couple of minutes. But weren’t. Chelsea are second in the league as I type, though Manchester United could reclaim that place later on. Pulis is a great organiser and seems an affable chap, but West Brom have been on a path that leads inexorably to this point for a couple of years, probably longer. Most matches are entering stoppage time, though some of those have quite a bit of it to play: there’ll be six minutes at Burnley, thanks to that Tammy Abraham injury. That is a harsh scoreline: Huddersfield dominated possession in the first half, and have pretty much owned the ball in the second. They’ve still found time to concede a couple, though: Callum Wilson has now completed his hat-trick, which I believe means he has never scored a top-flight brace – the last time he scored two in one game, against West Ham a couple of years back, he also got a third. And talking of misses, James McClean has missed a fabulous chance to give West Brom a totally irrelevant but potentially morale-boosting goal against Chelsea. The good news for Crystal Palace is that Christian Benteke is back, as a second-half substitute against Everton. The bad news is that he’s missed an absolute sitter when he should have put his side back into the lead. In other injury news, Swansea’s Tammy Abraham has been stretchered off with a back injury. At Bournemouth, Nathan Ake has required lengthy treatment to a head injury. It looks like he’s going to play on, though. So Paul Pogba starts for Manchester United, and Zlatan’s on the bench. Here are the players who will be contesting today’s late kick-off: Man Utd: de Gea, Valencia, Lindelof, Smalling, Young, Pogba, Matic, Rashford, Mata, Martial, Lukaku. Subs: Rojo, Ibrahimovic, Lingard, Romero, Ander Herrera, Shaw, Fellaini. Newcastle: Elliot, Yedlin, Clark, Lejeune, Manquillo, Ritchie, Hayden, Shelvey, Murphy, Gayle, Joselu. Subs: Diame, Aarons, Perez, Mbemba, Darlow, Jesus Gamez, Mitrovic. Referee: Craig Pawson. Ben Foster has just pulled off a really excellent one-handed save to stop Chelsea going 5-0 up. Incredible scenes: Huddersfield, a man up and two goals down, have had 82% of second-half possession without quite managing a goal, and then Bournemouth spring down the other end and increase their lead! Harry Arter gets on the scoresheet. Good news for West Brom: Eden Hazard has left the field. Pedro replaces him. I meanwhile have totally failed to keep you abreast of news from Serbia’s big match, which is proving predictably one-sided. Firmino shoots, Forster spills – it seemed easier to push it round the post for a corner, but he somehow shovelled it out towards the penalty spot – and Coutinho gobbles up the rebound! “Manchester City have now scored their 40th league goal of the season,” notes Meno Toutsidis. “No other team in the EPL is to date close to reaching 30. But does anyone know what is the record for a team reaching 50 league goals in either the EPL or the First Division?” I certainly don’t. Anyone? Eden Hazard is having one of those days. A long ball is booted upfield and he controls it ludicrously well just outside the area, cuts inside the nearest defender, takes his time, pushes the ball out of his feet, and shoots past a hopelessly exposed Foster! Goalkeepers! Watch and learn: how not to deal with an innocuous cross: Leicester have their first shot of the entire game and nearly score – it all got a bit messy but they hit the post, I think. Then City scream down the other end, Sane tees up De Bruyne, 25 yards out, and he thumps in with his left foot. Just too good. Here’s a glimpse of their first: Needing to transform the game, Tony Pulis has turned to Claudio Yacob. Not the obvious game-changer, really. Everton, meanwhile, have made a double substitution at the break – rare for a team that isn’t even losing – with Davies and Calvert-Lewin on for Lookman and Schneiderlin. Peeeeeep! The second halves have begun! Impressive attacking stat dept. The Salah one has since become more impressive, as his league goal tally is now nine: It’s been a hard week for Merthyr Town, who amid a cash-flow crisis have “cut the playing budget significantly” and lost 80% of their senior players. Today they’re fielding a youth team at Chesham United, and they’re losing 9-0 at half-time. Apparently their 15-year-old goalkeeper is having an excellent game. A bit of a wacky Premier League afternoon: six games, 14 goals, a controversial penalty, a controversial not-red-card, an actual red card – and it’s only half time. Hope for Huddersfield, as Simon Francis is shown a second yellow card just before half-time, and he won’t be out for the second period! Just the most terrible goal to concede. Speroni has it, under little pressure, and then he passes to, I think, Dann, who is under all sorts of pressure, is immediately robbed, and then a simple pass plays in Niasse, whose job is straightforward! Gabriel Jesus completes a lovely move, and City take the lead! This doesn’t sound good. Dover lead 1-0, the wonderfully-named Nortei Nortey with the goal. So there have been at least two goals in every Premier League game except at Leicester, where the nation’s finest attacking side is being held to a goalless draw. Salah is on the scoresheet again! Coutinho’s through-ball is perfect in both weight and timing, and the Egyptian runs onto it and sends it bobbling over Forster! Swansea have the ball in their own half. They play it right, they play it left, they work it right again, then they give it away for little reason, and Burnley swiftly play it to Barnes, running into the penalty area, and he smashes it inside the near post from 18 yards! Chelsea have a free kick just outside the left side of the penalty area. Fabregas chips it to the back post, where Alonso is all alone and volleys in from an acute angle! That was a lovely cross as well, drilled low and hard by Ward, zipping diagonally across the penalty area and presenting Zaha with a tap-in at the back post. Wilf Zaha converts a low cross and Palace are in the lead once more! Callum Wilson didn’t have to wait very long for his third league goal of 2017, as Bournemouth make another set-piece count. That’s a fine goal, curled into the far corner by Mo Salah with his left foot from 20 yards (though how Southampton so horribly messed up an opportunity to break from a defensive corner I do not know). Jack Cork has scored against his former club, with the simplest of headers after he ghosted into the penalty area utterly unmarked! Callum Wilson scores from a corner, his second league goal of 2017 and first since 3 January. So much for Tony Pulis’s hope for a scrappy 1-0. Morata’s flick releases Hazard, and he goes round Foster before scoring. This does not sound good. Now it’s Sunderland 1-2 Millwall. Saville gets another, both his goals coming direct from free kicks. Alvaro Morata with a 17th-minute strike, tucking in the loose ball after Foster saved Eden Hazard’s low shot. Before today Sunderland had led at home for just three minutes all season. Today they scored in the 12th minute through Lewis Grabban, and conceded in the 16th, George Saville equalising for Millwall. Still, that’s their total tally of home leadership more than doubled. Bad news for Plymouth, for whom Ryan Edwards has been sent of for a professional foul. He conceded a penalty in the process, and Ryan Ledson has converted it to put Oxford 1-0 up. I’ve just seen that penalty incident, and Oumar Niasse could be on his way to a three-match ban for a ludicrous dive. Baines’s penalty was emphatic, shooting low to his left while the goalkeeper went the other way. Leighton Baines equalises for Everton, with six minutes on the clock! Now Everton have a penalty! Less than two minutes on the clock and Vincent Kompany could have been sent off – Vardy spins away from him and is heading towards goal when he’s tripped from behind. The referee brings out a yellow! Everton had one touch of the ball before they fell behind, and that was Pickford, pushing Loftus-Cheek’s shot straight to McArthur after 48 seconds! Well, that didn’t take long. James McArthur is on the scoresheet already! 3pm: They’re off! Kick-off is but a few moments away. Use up those moments by reading about today’s early kick-offs: Tony Pulis speaks ahead of his side’s game against Chelsea, in which they will seek their first league win for three months: We need a result. There’s no hiding the fact that this is a results business. I could do with one just going over the line for us and getting a scrappy 1-0. The players have worked really hard, it just hasn’t broke for us. That happens now and then. If I can get out of this run then I’ll be pleased as punch.

Six top-flight matches top our 3pm menu, including the visit of our noble leaders, Manchester City, to Leicester, where they lost 4-2 in a memorable encounter last December. Chelsea beat West Brom 1-0 home and away last season, thanks to goals in the last quarter-hour from Diego Costa and Michy Batshuayi respectively, and have another go this afternoon, while Liverpool and Southampton met four times last season, with only two goals (both the Saints’) scored in those matches combined and both league encounters finishing goalless. No wonder in those circumstances that Jurgen Klopp ended the season thinking a Southampton defender might come in handy. Premier League Bournemouth v Huddersfield Burnley v Swansea Crystal Palace v Everton Leicester v Man City Liverpool v Southampton Man Utd v Newcastle (5.30) West Brom v Chelsea Sky Bet Championship QPR have only lost one home game all season, and in their last two home fixtures beat Wolves and Sheffield United, which makes Aston Villa’s task this afternoon look troublesome. Wolves will go top if they win at Reading, while both Cardiff and Bristol City need to win just to vaguely keep up with the top two. Sunderland meanwhile will climb off the foot of the table if they beat Millwall at home. Birmingham v Nottm Forest Cardiff v Brentford Fulham v Derby (5.30) Hull v Ipswich Norwich v Barnsley QPR v Aston Villa Reading v Wolverhampton Sheff Wed v Bristol City Sunderland v Millwall Sky Bet League One Shrewsbury lost to Peterborough last time out, their first league defeat of the season, and could slip off the top of the table if they fail to see of Rotherham, though Wigan will have to get at least a point from their home game with Bradford if that’s to happen. Plymouth have won two and lost none of their last five games – compared with eight defeats and no wins in their previous 10 – to haul themselves off the foot of the table, and today are at home to Oxford. Northampton and Scunthorpe meet for the third time this month – the last two encounters coming in the FA Cup – with only one goal scored in their last two matches. Bristol Rovers v AFC Wimbledon Bury v Blackburn Charlton v Milton Keynes Dons Fleetwood Town v Doncaster Northampton v Scunthorpe Oldham v Rochdale Peterborough v Blackpool Plymouth v Oxford Utd Portsmouth v Southend Rotherham v Shrewsbury Walsall v Gillingham Wigan v Bradford Sky Bet League Two It remains tight at the top, with Notts County, Accrington Stanley, Exeter and Luton all capable of topping the table by 5pm. They will all be feeling confident, with none of them facing a team higher than Newport’s ninth and Exeter visiting rock-bottom Chesterfield. Lincoln and Coventry, two of three teams currently tied on 27 points on the edge of the play-off places, meet at Sincil Bank.

The 19-year-old has not been seen for 11 days and clothes belonging to her were found on open land near cliffs south of the Dorset town on Thursday. Her father, Richard Sutherland, thanked those who had come to search areas around Swanage on Saturday. “I just want to say a massive thank you for coming out. It is very heartwarming and the support gives us a lot of hope,” he said at Durlston country park. Organised by the Find Gaia group on Facebook, volunteers gathered at the country park, near the main beach and to the north of the town to look for Pope, who has severe epilepsy. Since she disappeared, hundreds of missing person posters have been distributed across the county. Detectives have arrested and released under investigation three people: a 71-year-old woman, a 19-year-old man and a 49-year-old man, named locally as Paul Elsey. On Friday Pope’s mother, Natasha Pope, said she had not given up hope of her daughter being found alive. “I believe in this community and I believe miracles can happen. I am holding on to hope, along with Gaia’s sisters and the whole family, who are my strength. Please hold on with us,” she said in a message on social media. “My eternal thanks to everyone who is out there searching for my little girl. Please come out over the weekend and do what you can. Every one of you makes a difference.” Earlier, Sutherland said he feared his daughter’s epilepsy may have played a part in her disappearance as she had been warned by doctors that she was at risk of sudden death from the condition. Pope has not been seen since about 4pm on 7 November in Manor Gardens, Swanage. An hour earlier she was captured on CCTV buying an ice cream at St Michael’s Garage near the town, having been driven there by a relative. She was wearing a red checked shirt with white buttons, grey and white woven leggings and white trainers. The black jacket she had on was recovered from an address in Manor Gardens. More than 50 emergency services personnel, including police, coastguard, the fire brigade and Dorset search and rescue were continuing to look for Pope."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/19/first-woman-in-sistine-chapel-choir-cecilia-bartoli","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T00:04:46Z","webTitle":"Sistine Chapel breaks 500-year gender taboo to welcome soprano into the choir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/19/first-woman-in-sistine-chapel-choir-cecilia-bartoli","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/19/first-woman-in-sistine-chapel-choir-cecilia-bartoli","fields":{"headline":"Sistine Chapel breaks 500-year gender taboo to welcome soprano into the choir","bodyText":"For the past 500 years, beautiful sacred music has echoed up towards Michelangelo’s sublime ceiling frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, performed exclusively by male choirs. Until now. In a development that will delight both music lovers and reform-minded Catholics, one of the church’s gender taboos has finally been broken. Cecilia Bartoli, one of Italy’s most celebrated classical singers, has become the first woman to perform inside the chapel with the all-male Sistine Chapel Choir, as part of a unique musical project which draws on ancient, neglected musical archives of the Catholic church. On Friday night the mezzo-soprano joined the 20 men and 30 boys who make up the choir, among the oldest choral groups in the world, to sing Beata Viscera, by the Renaissance composer Pérotin. A few days before, the five-time Grammy award-winner told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that she was “in seventh heaven” about the prospect of performing in the chapel, and [possibly] before Pope Francis. “It’s a huge privilege,” she added. Bartoli’s dream of meeting Pope Francis was not fulfilled – he was unable to attend the performance – but the singer made a huge impact on the choir. “She was incredible,” Mark Spyropoulos, the first British full-time member of the choir, told the Observer after the show. “She’s well known for her interpretations of early music and it was great for us to be recording with someone like that. Women sing with a different timbre to men, so to hear that sound, the wonderful richness that women sing with on that piece, is very unusual in the Sistine Chapel … because, of course, it’s an all-male choir.” Spyropoulos, a former flower presenter at the Royal Opera House in London’s Covent Garden, was particularly enamoured by her presence, especially having presented flowers to her at the end of shows she performed there. “And now to have sung with her – it was amazing.” Bartoli’s voice also features on the pontifical choir’s 16-track Christmas CD, Veni Domine: Advent and Christmas at the Sistine Chapel, which was released in Italy in October and worldwide this month. The recording, made up of a repertoire of scores from manuscripts by the greatest composers of the Renaissance era, which are contained within the vast archive of the Vatican library, was produced in the chapel in part because of its unique acoustics, but also because three of the compositions had originally been produced to be sung there for papal celebrations and had never been performed in modern times. “This new production, focusing on the liturgical time of Christmas, is based on the unique characteristic of translating into sound the manuscripts present in the Sistine Chapel archive, a truly precious treasure chest,” said Archbishop Georg Gänswein, prefect of the papal household, during a press conference at the Vatican on the day the album was released. It is the third album produced in partnership with Universal Music Italia and the German classical music label Deutsche Grammophon, with proceeds from sales going to the papal charities. “It’s ancient music, with its simplicity,” Bartoli told Corriere. “And to sing that music in the place it was conceived was fascinating.” She described the acoustics of the chapel as “generous, and ideal for this type of repertoire; the voice travels naturally”. Federico Capitoni, a journalist and music critic for the daily newspaper La Repubblica, said that the inclusion of a woman in the choir was a “significant gesture of openness by the Vatican”. Once the decision had been taken, the 51-year-old Bartoli was an obvious choice. “Her voice is especially predisposed to the music from that period, as well as her character – the lightness and subtlety,” he told the Observer. “And she is probably the most famous Italian mezzo-soprano; it’s inevitable they chose her.” The choice marked a monumental shift in a choir which formed in the 15th century and enjoyed a golden period during the Renaissance before suffering a decline in the second half of the 20th century, when it earned the unfortunate nickname of “the Sistine screamers”. More recently, under the leadership of Monsignor Massimo Palombella, a Salesian priest appointed choirmaster by Pope Benedict in 2010, the group has been enjoying a revival, even undertaking its first tour of the US in 30 years in September. Nowadays, men no longer have to be ordained, unmarried or Italian to join the choir. So it was probably only a matter of time before a woman was allowed in, although it’s unlikely to be a regular occurrence. “The problem is, our repertoire is written for men, with the bulk of it being written in the pre-15th century and 16th century,” said Spyropoulos, who joined the choir in 2015. “As a choir in the Sistine we have to sing with a very aesthetic precedence, so it’s difficult to include women in this particular choir. Personally I’m a great advocate of women singing choral music – it’s fantastic. But this is really a question of the right timbre for this kind of music.” In her interview with Corriere, Bartoli, who became artistic director of the Salzburg Whitsun Festival in 2012, spoke about the lack of women in orchestras. “There is still so much to do [in that respect],” she said. Capitoni disputes this observation: “Her experience of things is no doubt different, but it’s a question of changing times. A few generations ago, there were few women but today I come across many who are studying music, singing and performing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/nov/18/roger-federer-v-david-goffin-atp-world-tour-finals-semi-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T16:09:11Z","webTitle":"David Goffin rocks Roger Federer to reach ATP World Tour Finals final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/nov/18/roger-federer-v-david-goffin-atp-world-tour-finals-semi-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/nov/18/roger-federer-v-david-goffin-atp-world-tour-finals-semi-final-live","fields":{"headline":"David Goffin rocks Roger Federer to reach ATP World Tour Finals final – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all for now. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to check back later for our match report. David Goffin has finally defeated his childhood idol for the first time in seven career meetings. And what a way to do it: rallying from a set down on a stage where Federer has played so extraordinarily well down the years. Goffin becomes only the sixth player ever to defeat Federer and Rafael Nadal at the same event. Third set: Federer 6-2, 3-6, 4-6 Goffin (*denotes next server) Biggest service game of Goffin’s career? And away we go. He opens it with aces of 121mph and 115mph, the 12th and 13th consecutive points he’s won on his serve. Two points from the match. Federer pounces on a Goffin second serve for a winner, but he nets a backhand on the net point and Goffin has a pair of match points. He needs only one, closing it out with a service winner! Third set: Federer 6-2, 3-6, 4-5 Goffin* (*denotes next server) At 15-all, Federer hits a forehand winner. But Goffin dictates a rally from the baseline until Federer nets a backhand for 30-all. The Belgian now two points from the finish line, but Federer hits a pair of winners for the hold. Goffin to serve for the match after the change of ends. Third set: *Federer 6-2, 3-6, 3-5 Goffin (*denotes next server) ... followed by an equally fast love hold for Goffin. Now Federer, with new balls, will serve to stay in the match. Third set: Federer 6-2, 3-6, 3-4 Goffin* (*denotes next server) It’s a lightning-quick hold for Federer ... Third set: *Federer 6-2, 3-6, 2-4 Goffin (*denotes next server) At 15-all, a pressure point for Federer is afoot when he misses on a serve to fall behind 15-30, which he challenges unsuccessfully. Goffin now two points from a commanding double-break advantage in the decider, but Federer rattles off two quick points for 40-30. Now he’s pounded a forehand winner to earn the hold, but Goffin is still ahead a break and Federer is running out of time and opportunities to turn this one around. Third set: Federer 6-2, 3-6, 2-3 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Goffin is locked in, simply crushing that forehand point and point. He sprints out to 40-love and finishes off the hold when Federer overcooks a backhand from the baseline. Third set: Federer 6-2, 3-6, 2-3 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Federer races to 40-love including a 125mph ace, then finishes off the love hold with a service winner. A clinical hold of serve, but he’s still trailing by a break and will need to make headway on Goffin’s serve if he has any hope of winning this match. Third set: *Federer 6-2, 3-6, 1-3 Goffin (*denotes next server) Goffin misplays what should have been an easy passing shot and Federer is into the Belgian’s serve at love-15. Goffin answers with a point, but misses badly on an approach shot for 15-30. The crowd buzzes between points. Federer then misfires on a forehand from the baseline for 30-all, then misses on a passing shot for 40-30 (which he challenges unsuccessfully). And how Goffin double-faults for the first time today. Oh boy. Deuce. Lengthy rally breaks out and Federer ends with with a forehand winner for a break point. Goffin saves it with a calm volley winner at the net after running Federer beyond the alleyway with a tightly angled forehand.

Third set: Federer 6-2, 3-6, 1-2 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Goffin hits a return winner and Federer is behind on his serve, a rarity today, at love-15. Now he makes another error and a massive opportunity has suddenly opened for Goffin at love-30. Federer pulls a point back, but Goffin pounds a backhand down the line that Federer can only return to position Goffin for smash winner for 15-40 and a pair of break-point chances. Federer saves the first of them but Goffin’s backhand winner on the ensuing point gives him the early break in this decider! Third set: *Federer 6-2, 3-6, 1-1 Goffin (*denotes next server) Goffin opens with an error then Federer rips a forehand winner for love-30. A big chance for the Swiss here on Goffin’s serve.

Third set: Federer 6-2, 3-6, 1-0 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Federer with a quite Federer-like service game, getting on the board early in the decider. He’ll be serving from ahead from here on out, putting the pressure squarely on the Belgian. Second set: Federer 6-2, 3-6 Goffin Three quick points for Goffin and he’s got three set points. He needs only one of them, however, ripping a service winner to close out the second set and force a decider here at the O2 Arena. It’s only the third set Goffin’s won against Federer in seven career meetings. Second set: Federer 6-2, 3-5 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Federer wins a pair of quick points before Goffin rips a forehand winner. Federer than makes his first double fault of the match for 30-all and Goffin is two points from leveling this match. Goffin then makes an unforced error off the forehand side followed by a Federer winner and the Swiss holds. Now Goffin, with new balls, will attempt to serve out the second set. Second set: *Federer 6-2, 2-5 Goffin (*denotes next server) Goffin, far more efficient on his serve in this set, races to 30-love before Federer hits a winner for 30-15. Now Goffin nets a backhand for 30-all and the crowd swells in anticipation. Another bad miss by Goffin on the next point, which he challenges unsuccessfully, gives Federer a break-point chance, but he squanders it with an unforced error for deuce. Goffin then dials in a 122mph ace for game point followed by a volley winner that Federer can scarcely get a racket on. Federer will now serve to stay in the second set. Second set: Federer 6-2, 2-4 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Three quick points for Federer – that’s seven straight on his serve since the break – before he finally makes an error for 40-15. Now Goffin hits another winner for 40-30, but Federer holds with a service winner. Second set: *Federer 6-2, 1-4 Goffin (*denotes next server) Federer with a sneak attack on Goffin’s serve for a quick winner, but Goffin rattles off a pair of points for 30-15. They trade unforced errors for 40-30, but then Federer rips a forehand winner that paints the baseline for deuce. Close. Goffin momentarily considers challenging it but elects to play on. Now Goffin hits a forehand winner down the line, a shot that betrayed him consistently in the first set, and follows it with another winner for the hold. Second set: *Federer 6-2, 1-3 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Federer answers with a love hold of his own but will need to make progress on Goffin’s serve if he’s to get back on level terms in this set. Second set: *Federer 6-2, 0-3 Goffin (*denotes next server) A crucially important service game for Goffin to back up the break and he comes through with brio, rattling off four quick points for the hold at love. In the blink of an eye the Belgian is halfway home in the second. Second set: Federer 6-2, 0-2 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Goffin forces it to 30-all for a rare stab at a Federer service game. Federer follows with a winner but Goffin forces an error for deuce. The Swiss follows with a service winner, but then misses on a backhand from the baseline for deuce number two. Federer forces Goffin into another error for another game point, but sends a backhand into the net on the next point for deuce. Now Goffin hits a winner and the Belgian has his first look at a break point today. And he’s got it! Goffin lies back and lets the point unfold before crushing a cross-court backhand winner just as Federer came to net. Brilliantly played by Goffin and Federer has been broken for only the third time in 46 service games at this year’s ATP World Tour Finals. He’d faced only 12 break points at the event before that one, saving 10 of them. Second set: *Federer 6-2, 0-1 Goffin (*denotes next server) Goffin makes an error on the opening point, but hits a pair of winners for 30-15. Federer than rips a backhand winner up the line for 30-all, but Goffin answers with a shrewd backhand volley winner followed by a Federer error to come away with the hold. First set: Federer 6-2 Goffin Federer opens with a pair of service winners, followed by an overhand smash for 40-love. Three set points on deck but he needs only one, finishing off the love hold with a winner that gives him the opening set in 27 minutes. Federer at his imperious best in his service games today, dropping only five points on his serve in the opener. An ominous sign for Goffin. First set: *Federer 5-2 Goffin (*denotes next server) At 15-all, Federer hits a beautiful drop-shot winner to put the pressure on Goffin again. The Swiss great is two points away from another break and the first set. Goffin pulls one back on a Federer unforced error, but he follows with a missed forehand down the line and Federer has another break-point chance, this one a set point. He’s unable to capitalize, however, as he puts a forehand into the net for deuce. Now he misses on another forehand from the baseline and Goffin has a game point, but Goffin’s forehand lets him down (again) and it’s back to deuce. Goffin then pounces on a short ball for another game point, and he has the hold when Federer sends a backhand from the baseline a few inches long. Now Federer will have a chance to serve out the opening set. First set: Federer 5-1 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Federer rattles off a quick love hold, mixing in a serve-and-volley capped by a backhand winner on the penultimate point. He’s playing like he’s trying to make the early bird special. First set: *Federer 4-1 Goffin (*denotes next server) Two quick points for Federer and Goffin is in danger of letting this opening set get out of hand. The Belgian then comes to net at the end of a baseline rally and Federer makes his pay with a picturesque one-handed backhand winner down the line. Love-40 and triple break point for Federer. Goffin saves the first and then the second, but Federer runs his opponent ragged on the next point until he’s able to hit a clincial backhand volley winner into an open court to finish off the service break. First set: Federer 3-1 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Goffin mishits a backhand and Federer jumps on the short ball for an easy winner, but the Swiss follows with an unforced error for 15-all. They trade points for 30-all, but Goffin then sprays a backhand from the baseline and, on the next point, Federer hits a backhand volley winner at the net, adjusting adroitly when the ball skips off the netcord. He’s held for 3-1 in the opener. First set: *Federer 2-1 Goffin (*denotes next server) Goffin races to 40-love on a run of quick points, then sits back as Federer pounds a return into the net. An easy love hold and the Belgian is on the board. First set: Federer 2-0 Goffin* (*denotes next server) Federer opens with a quick service winner but nets a forehand early in the next point for 15-all. He then hits a gorgeous drop-shot winner from the baseline that flummoxes Goffin, followed by an even-more-gorgeous forehand winner on the run that brings the crowd to its feet. Federer then mixes in a couple of errors for deuce, but follows with a winner for game point. Goffin then sends a return long for the hold and he’s backed up the break. First set: *Federer 1-0 Goffin (*denotes next server) Goffin immediately behind love-30, making an error on the opening point and watching Federer hit a gorgeous backhand winner up the line. Goffin aces, then misses wide on an inside-out forehand on the approach and Federer has a pair of break-point chances not two minutes into the match. Goffin saves the first when Federer nets a backhand, then the second with a service winner. He hits another service winner for game point, but then sprays a backhand to return it to deuce. Goffin then overcooks a forehand from behind the baseline and Federer has a third look at a break point. A lengthy baseline rally breaks out, ending when Federer comes to net and nets a forehand volley. Back to deuce. Goffin nets another backhand and it’s a fourth break-point chance for Federer. Another greulling baseline rally and Federer blinks again for deuce, but Goffin sends a forehand long on the next point and it’s break point number five for Federer. Finally, Goffin sends a cross-court backhand long and Federer has the hard-won break to open the match after nearly eight minutes. It’s been a resurgent year for the great Federer, who’s captured seven titles including the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Should he win today and tomorrow, he will finish the year a scant 140 points behind Rafael Nadal for the world No1 ranking. He’s lost four matches all year. He’s won all six matches against Goffin, dropping only two sets along the way. Hi there and welcome to today’s semi-final between Roger Federer and David Goffin at the O2 Arena. The winner of today’s match, the third-to-last of the season, advances to Sunday’s final against either Jack Sock or Grigor Dimitrov, who face off later today.

Three of the five seats on the committee, which is chosen by Norway’s parliament and must reflect its political complexion, fall vacant this year after general elections that saw the populist Progress party return to government with a 16% vote share. The party said last week its controversial former leader Carl I Hagen, a vocal opponent of immigration who has also attacked Muslims, gay people and single mothers and called for Norway’s withdrawal from international human rights treaties, would be taking the Nobel committee seat it was entitled to. With parliament due to begin deliberating on all the candidates on Monday, fierce opposition to Hagen’s nomination has focused – in public, at least – on the longstanding convention that current government members and MPs should not be members of the Nobel committee. This is meant to ensure the committee cannot be subject to political pressure should, for example, its choice of laureate be considered likely to harm government interests – as in 2010, when China reacted furiously to the award of the prize to one of its leading dissidents, Liu Xiaobo. Hagen, 73, is the anti-immigrant Progress party’s first deputy MP, meaning he could be called to sit in the Storting at any time – and for any length of time – should an MP be absent. “Appointing an active politician to the Nobel committee would absolutely send the wrong signal about the independence of the committee,” Abid Raja, a Liberal party MP and deputy speaker of the parliament, told the Guardian. “It’s vital for the legitimacy of the Nobel peace price that it’s completely independent from government and parliament. I’m surprised the Progress party is ready to break this tradition.” The Labour party leader, Jonas Gahr Støre, said committee members could not have formal ties to government. “As a deputy member, Hagen may be called to sit in parliament until 2021,” he said. “The Progress party has the right to appoint one member, but should definitely find another candidate.” In private, however, many are scandalised that a politician with Hagen’s views could find himself on the peace prize committee. “His opinions are not consistent with the values the prize promotes and that much of Norway wants to project,” said one politician, who asked not to be identified. “It’s that simple.” Among the veteran populist’s more outspoken comments are: “A society without ethnic minorities is a society in harmony,” “Single mothers … can thank themselves for their situation, and get too much public help,” “Without immigrants, Oslo wouldn’t have a housing crisis,” “Being gay … is nothing to celebrate,” and “alien cultures” must be resisted. In his 2007 book, Honestly Speaking, Hagen wrote of relations between ethnic Norwegians and the country’s Muslim community: “Freedom of expression is subordinate to the warlord, rapist and woman trafficker Muhammad.” The secretary of the Nobel committee and director of the Nobel Institute, Olav Njølstad, told the public broadcaster NRK that Hagen’s appointment would be “completely untenable” and “indicate little understanding and respect for the Nobel committee’s work”. Two of Norway’s leading newspapers, Aftenposten and Dagens Næringsliv, have also published strongly worded editorials saying Hagen should not be appointed. The Progress party’s arguments – that its former leader deserved the job and had long experience – were irrelevant, Aftenposten said. Støre told the Guardian the Nobel peace prize, awarded this year to the anti-nuclear campaign group Ican, was “the world’s most prestigious prize. We should do our outmost to secure the integrity of the committee awarding it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/nov/18/england-v-australia-rugby-union-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T17:07:58Z","webTitle":"England 30-6 Australia: rugby union international – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/nov/18/england-v-australia-rugby-union-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/nov/18/england-v-australia-rugby-union-international-live","fields":{"headline":"England 30-6 Australia: rugby union international – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all from me, thanks for reading, and do come join me for the All Blacks at Murrayfield: Michael Hooper speaks: “It got away from us at the end. There were a couple of decisions that didn’t go our way. It’s hard to judge when you’re on the field, but I thought they were both tries.” And here’s Dylan Hartley: “Very happy. We’ve come out the other side and I’m really proud of the guys today. We play to win, every week we focus on improving. Today we executed our game. Nine and 10 directed the game very well.” What to make of that. England ran out the deserved winners with their biggest ever win over Australia but had Koroibete been awarded that try in the second half, which was ruled out for crossing, it would have been 13 all and very much game on. Here’s Eddie Jones: “We always back ourselves to play out 80 minutes. Our finishers did a great job, our scrum did a superb job, a great team for us. There wasn’t much in the game but we got the bounce of the ball. Seeing as most of the commentary last week about us going backwards at a rate of knots it’s not a bad win.” Farrell misses the kick and that ends an entertaining contest. Australia will be hurting. This is getting silly now. Jonny May breaks away via a brilliant bit of skill with his feet to flick the ball into his arms, and when he is eventually caught Care is on hand to grab the offload and go over in the corner. 79 min Farrell misjudges his kick. The scoreline is not really a reflection of this contest. Jonny May races after a Care kick down the right wing, claims the bouncing ball and spins out of a couples of tackles to crash over the line. 77 min The brilliant Joe Launchbury, who has made more tackles than anyone on the pitch, is handed man of the match. 76 min An England scrum near the halfway line is reset. 74 min Care dishes out another excellent box-kick, relieving some pressure. 73 min Farrell adds the kick from a slight angle and makes it England 20-6 Australia. A poor pass by the frustrated Hooper puts his team under pressure and Beale is forced to boot downfield from deep. Danny Care replies a moment later with a clever kick into space and Jonathan Joseph gives chase, gathering up the ball skilfully and sliding over the line! 70 min I didn’t go off and make a cup of tea, that TMO decision just took forever. Australia have now had two tries disallowed by the TMO, England have had one confirmed. Ben O’Keeffe rules that Stephen Moore was crossing in the buildup! Michael Cheika cannot believe it. 69 min Suddenly a brilliant break by Koroibete, who is proving such a handful. He offloads and Australia work it through a couple of phases into the centre before bundling over the line, but was it grounded? Chris Robshaw thinks he’s held it up. TMO. 68 min Hooper’s decisions over when to kick and when to go for the corner have not been vindicated. 67 min Moore’s first lineout is a low-ish one secured by captain Hooper. But in the ensuing maul Australia are adjudged to have illegally brought it down and that’s a big win for England when they were under pressure. 65 min Daly is forced to retreat and kick the ball out of play on the slide, which brings play back for an Australian penalty. Foley boots to the corner. 64 min Stephen Moore and Joe Marler both enter the game among several changes. Bernard Foley seems to slightly mishit another kick, but it goes through the posts all the same. 63 min A penalty to Australia for offside, and Owen Farrell is told to have a word with his team and ensure there are no more little errors. Foley will go for the posts. 61 min That was extremely daft by the former captain. Fortunately for him, Itoje quickly scrambles it back into England hands inside their own 22 and they run it through Daly who is tackled into touch. 60 min Australia come forwards once more but England are defending excellently, and actually make ground after a series of tackles. Beale boots high into the air and Robshaw is penalised for a late challenge on the kick – needless. 58 min Scrum to Australia in the centre of the field after the 527th knock-on of the match. From it they gain a penalty, which Reece Hodge curls away from touch and straight back to England. What a waste. 56 min Farrell adds the conversion, curling it through the posts to make it England 13-3 Australia. “It’s not conclusive so we are going to stick with the try,” referee Ben O’Keeffe tells Michael Hooper. Daylight on the scoreboard for England. The replays seem inconclusive. The camera rock and rolls the bouncing ball. This is tense. 54 min What a kick this is by Farrell. It stays just in field (I think) and Daly races up the wing, kicking the ball towards the try line and chasing it down to score. But was the ball out of play? TMO time... 53 min Itoje is caught delaying with the ball and an Australian hand scoops it back from him. A moment later Australia seem in trouble when Kerevi is forced to run it from deep but he does brilliantly, charging up field and almost setting up a try before Kuridrani drops his pass. And then... 51 min England fashion a little break and then spread it wide to the wing where Hartley was lurking. They seem to be building pressure but suddenly Koroibete smashes through Owen Farrell and the Wallabies pounce, winning a penalty for their efforts. Pats on the back all round for the men in green and gold. Farrell has had the wind taken out of him. 49 min It has been a pretty good start to the second half for Australia. They are now restored to fifteen players with Beale’s return and in the meantime they’ve reduced the deficit on the scoreboard. Reece Hodge booms the kick through the posts with plenty to spare. 47 min An offside and Australia have a penalty just inside England’s half. Hodge will have a go at this tough kick. 46 min Hooper has returned to the action – he was everywhere for Australia in the first half. Beale still has another four minutes in the bin. 45 min Another drop, this time by and England player in midfield – the weather has deprived us of a flowing game of rugby. 44 min Scrum Australia. They secure it and a flurry of kicks follow before McCalman grabs it and runs, and when England win it back May finds touch. 43 min England make progress down the right side via Itoje but the ball then slips out of Vunipola’s hands as he approaches the 22 when several team-mates were lurking in space on the far side. 42 min Foley punts a long kick to England’s back three who switch it from right to left for Daly to run. Hooper will be back on the pitch in a couple of minutes. England get the second half under way. Beale insisted he hadn’t deliberately cut out the pass and had tried to make a catch, but the replay didn’t corroborate that theory. Foley boots the ball into the stands and that’s the half. Michael Cheika is fuming and lets off some steam in the direction of a couple of officials on the sideline on his way towards the dressing room. 39 min The Wallabies pinch it, race downfield, concede a penalty, England race upfield, that’s intercepted but fumbled, and Kurtley Beale is sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on. He’s very unhappy about the decision but it matters not and that’s a two-man advantage for England now. A chaotic and scrappy end to the half. 38 min I assumed Ford opted to kick because he had a penalty advantage to fall back on, but apparently not. An odd option, then. Anyway, England are quickly back on the front foot and looking to finish the half with a flourish. 37 min Ford attempts a drop-goal but he is pretty far out and it isn’t dead straight, and he hooks it wide. 36 min Eventually Australia take it out of the scrum and run... and immediately knock-on. 35 min Scrums are awful to watch. 34 min The first of Hooper’s 10 minutes in the bin is soaked up by the restart and the next couple go by as the scrum is reset several times. And Owen Farrell does the business. With an extra man it’s advantage England. 32 min The penalty is right under the posts... 31 min This time it is England’s turn to reject a kickable chance and go for the corner. Interesting. They do the next bit and secure the lineout via Lawes, and suddenly just about every England player piles in. They go close to the line with the crowd roaring behind them, then work through several pick-and-gos. They get a penalty advantage and when they work it wide it all falls down – and the referee turns back to sin-bin Hooper for numerous infringements. 29 min The replay after that disallowed try, incidentally, showed a fuming Michael Cheika sarcastically applauding and using a few choice words under his breath. 28 min Ford tries a kick for Daly on the far side but Beale does wonderfully well to leap and pinch the ball from the wing’s grasp. 27 min This is brilliant by Australia. Quick hands shift the ball to space on the left wing and when Kerevi slides a low kick through it looks as if Koroibete will score. He can’t quite get control of the bouncing ball with his feet but Hooper slides in to seemingly score instead. However, the referee checks with the TMO who shows the captain was offside. 25 min The Wallabies are given a penalty and this time they reject the chance to go for the posts and instead kick for the corner. A bold call, and it quickly becomes the wrong call when Itoje claims the lineout. 24 min An exchange of kicks ends with a knock-on by May under pressure from Foley chasing his own up-and-under. It looked like May was hit slightly in the air and he’s not happy about the decision, but it’s not changing. 22 min He misses! Foley pulls the kick left of the posts and brings a cheer from the Twickenham crowd. Horrible strike. 21 min England are penalised for holding on to the ball after the tackle – Jonny May the guilty man who got a little isolated in midfield. Foley will take on the straightforward kick. 20 min The ball squirms loose at a ruck and Robshaw reacts, throwing a boot in. It ricochets back on to England’s side and Youngs boots long and into space – on commentary, Clive Woodward approves of the tactic. 18 min Australia are putting pressure on with the latest scrum and England are warned that they are in danger of conceding a penalty. Eventually the scrum holds up and Australia work it first wide and then back into the centre of the field. Genia moves the ball quickly for Foley who kicks towards May near the corner – who almost drops the ball into touch but just about regathers. 16 min Brilliant this from Michael Hooper, slamming a hand into Hughes who drops the slippery ball. Meanwhile Sam Underhill is going off for a head injury assessment, which means Itoje is on earlier than expected, to a cheer from the home crowd. Robshaw will shift to No7. 15 min This time the ball squirts out of the scrum quickly. Youngs reacts well and shifts it wide for May. Eventually a smart kick by Farrell pushes Australia right back into the corner. 14 min Kerevi punches a hole in the England defence but the gains are wasted when Genia passes forwards. 12 min England eventually take the ball from the scrum and Youngs makes a low kick, but Australia bring the ball straight back. A couple of huge hits and a dart down the wing by Koroibete rouse the Twickenham crowd before England win a penalty and Youngs kicks again, this time going long and into space. 10 min A minute is eaten up at the scrum, which is reset and then reset again. This is going to be an interesting duel between these front rows. By the way, Michael Keene is bang right when he emails to ask if the referee is New Zealand’s Ben O’Keeffe – not from South Africa as previously stated. 7 min May almost intercepts a high pass out to the right wing but can’t quite collect it. He would have had a brilliant opportunity had he been able to. Knock-on, Australia scrum on halfway. Owen Farrell slots the penalty from perhaps 40 metres at a slight angle and England lead. 5 min The slippery conditions are causing a few early fumbles which is making for a stop-start game thus far. The latest error gives England a scrum and they work it to the open side. Launchbury hits his man and offloads to Robshaw and suddenly things open up, with Farrell on the overlap, but eventually the ball squirms loose in a tackle and the referee brings it back for a penalty to England. Very kickable. 3 min Australia get the first scrum of the match after a knock-on in the air as May went for a high catch, which he almost took brilliantly. The Wallabies are given a free-kick from the set piece which they boot long. The first refrains of Swing Low ring out. 1 min England claim the ball and Youngs box-kicks into Australian territory. A kicking duel ensues and is ended by Foley who finds touch for an English lineout just inside their own half. Our Kiwi referee gives his whistle a peep at a drizzly, grey Twickenham and Foley boots a deep kick. The players are out on the pitch all lined up for the anthems. The atmosphere at Twickenham was pretty meek against Argentina last week, I thought, but I don’t think that will be the case this afternoon. Added spice: Kick-off is a mere 10 minutes away. Here’s the coin toss in action which one of the teams must have won, but I have not been able to discover who landed that early psychological blow. There have been the usual barbs flying between Eddie Jones and Michael Cheika this week, but perhaps the most interesting was this line from the Australia coach suggesting England are “united” behind a ploy of late tackles: “England are a big, powerful side and they will try to bully us around,” said Cheika. “They try to bully us at the scrum, the lineout and the ruck and then they niggle, trying to get into our half-back after he passes and the 10 after he passes. There is so much footage of that. “The fact they are unified behind that strategy means we are going to have to look them in the eye and take them on if we are going to be able to resist that.” Here’s the full story. England rugby fans #bantz. Grumpy looks terrifying: For some pre-match reading to get us in the mood, here’s Chris Robshaw on England’s rivalry with Australia, Eddie Jones’ management and making Twickenham a fortress: We are being treated to an abundance of England v Australia sporting action at the moment and this match might just be the best chance of English success – even if it is masterminded by an Australian. England are slight favourites but Eddie Jones’s team delivered an underwhelming performance against Argentina last weekend while the Wallabies showed fortitude in beating Wales. Jones has labelled Australia the form team in the world and certainly they arrive at Twickenham carrying a far greater threat than they did last year, when England recovered from a sluggish first half to win 37-21. Jones has restored Owen Farrell to his backline while Maro Itoje will be expected to make a significant impact from the bench – Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury start at second row. Michael Cheika has chosen Kurtley Beale at full-back who will look to join Australia’s lines of attack and take up the role of playmaker, as Nick Evans explains: There is always something special about meetings between England and Australia, in any sport, but often one team are in the ascendency while the other (usually England, let’s be honest) are in some kind of funk or daze, or are quickly left in one after approximately three bouncers from Mitchell Johnson. Not here: England have won 20 of their 21 matches under Jones and two Six Nations crowns; Australia are unbeaten in their past seven Tests with the All Blacks their prize scalp. This England v Australia is beautifully poised. The teams England: A Watson; J May, J Joseph, O Farrell, E Daly; G Ford, B Youngs; M Vunipola, D Hartley (capt), D Cole, J Launchbury, C Lawes, Robshaw, S Underhill, N Hughes.

Just as American film and television can’t seem to get enough of British theatre-trained actors, so we return the favour, with no one lighting up the London stage quite as much as an American screen star. Although most of his acting career has been spent in either obscurity or overlooked supporting roles, and although he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Lyndon B Johnson in Robert Schenkkan’s All the Way, Cranston is indeed a screen star – thanks to his celebrated role as Walter White, the chemistry teacher-turned-drug lord, in the cable hit Breaking Bad. He has the Breaking Bad logo tattooed on his ring finger to remind him, as he’s said, that “any opportunities I have now are because of that show”. Network is the latest of those opportunities and it’s a smart piece of casting. Cranston showed in Breaking Bad that he is a master of transformation, moving, as the show’s creator Vince Gilligan memorably put it, “from Mr Chips to Scarface”. The transformation of Howard Beale, the news anchor in Network, is speedier but no less dramatic. One moment he’s a reliable veteran of TV news, the next he’s having a breakdown during a live broadcast, threatening to kill himself and then becoming a kind of crazed celebrity guru. The original film, written by Paddy Chayefsky, was a satire – in many respects a prescient one – on the commercialisation of news and the mindless malleability of the viewing masses. Although a great film in many ways, it was overburdened with speechifying of the kind more often seen on stage than in cinema. So a theatrical adaptation makes more sense in this case than in others, even if the advent of Fox News, fake news, a former reality TV star as president and seemingly weekly mass shootings by notoriety-hungry lunatics has rendered its message a little out of date in America. But another reason why Cranston makes sense in the part is that, just as Beale becomes an unlikely star, Cranston knows what it’s like to encounter unexpected fame. He’s justly praised for his acting skills today, but they were far from universally recognised when, for example, he was appearing in adverts for haemorrhoid cream in the 1980s. Even when he managed to secure a more high-profile gig with the part of the father in the comedy series Malcolm in the Middle, he wasn’t by any stretch a name. And with a name like Bryan Cranston, almost a platonic ideal of forgettable, you really do have to stand out for anyone to remember it. Still, in Malcolm and in Cranston’s occasional appearances on Seinfeld as Dr Tim Whatley, “dentist to the stars”, the interested observer could tell that he had a gift for anxious comedy. There was a restless, frustrated quality that he brought to his parts, something of a ticking bomb that would eventually explode with Breaking Bad. It was Jane Kaczmarek, his screen wife on Malcolm, who noticed the actor Cranston most resembled in style. “He always reminded me of Jack Lemmon,” she said, noting that he was very funny but also “the real thing dramatically”. Certainly, there was a lot more going in his work than the nice guy everyman roles his pleasant, but unremarkable, looks tended to attract. That note of underlying angst that he shared with Lemmon could, without need of a psychology PhD, be traced to the destabilising experiences of his childhood. He grew up in the San Fernando Valley, the huge, rather bland suburb that lies beyond the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. His father, a boxer and failed actor, quit the family home when Cranston was 11, completely disappearing for a decade. As he recounts in his autobiography, A Life in Parts, his mother then took to drink, the house was repossessed and the young Cranston and his brother were sent to live with their grandparents on a poultry farm in the middle of nowhere, while his sister and mother lived with another grandparent. All this, he said, left him with “a reservoir of anger and resentment and abandonment issues”. He’s spent a good deal of time in therapy, and still occasionally visits a couples therapist with his wife of 28 years, Robin Dearden. “Our agreement is, if either of us feels like we want to go, the other can’t object,” he told one interviewer. As a teenager, he harboured ambitions of becoming a detective, and joined a police explorer group, a programme that gives youngsters a chance to explore a career in law enforcement. But he caught the acting bug when, during a delay in a road trip with his brother, he read Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler and came to a realisation. “The idea was to do something I love and become good at, rather than something I was good at and hoped to love.” He’s said many times since his late fame arrived that he only ever wished to make a living out of acting, that he was perfectly content with being a successfully employed character actor operating under the celebrity radar. It may even be true, but why get a tattoo to remind you of your lucky break if you’re content for the spotlight to be occupied by your peers? After all, in Los Angeles, actors who are unbothered by their middling status in the industry are as rare as snow. Perhaps he was closer to the reality when he told me during an interview for this newspaper: “In order to be an actor, you really have to be one of those types of people who are risk-takers and have what is considered an actor’s arrogance … the type of person who wants the ball with seconds left in the game. The masses don’t want the ball. They don’t want to be responsible for not making the shot. Actors need to want that chance. Give me that chance.” Vince Gilligan, who’d written an X-Files in which Cranston played a paranoid antisemite back in 1998, offered the actor that chance 10 years later, with his drama about a frustrated teacher diagnosed with terminal cancer who launches a new career as a producer of crystal meth. Cranston has not looked back since, except with a hint of regret. He says that fame has changed him, and he’s not sure if it’s for the better. He has “a tendency to hide away” nowadays, he says, often having to settle for socialising with other famous actors such as Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro. These are people, he explains in his book, who don’t need anything from him or vice versa. “We can relax in each other’s company.” Relax, of course, is not the word one associates with Howard Beale. His most famous line is “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take this any more,” which probably understates his fury. Finch’s performance was so feverishly manic that it may have shortened his life – he died of a heart attack while promoting the film, and won a posthumous Oscar. Cranston’s is arguably a more nuanced interpretation, and unquestionably less ranty in delivery. The play is directed by Ivo van Hove, the ultra-cool Belgian director who wowed critics with his productions of A View From a Bridge and The Crucible. Van Hove has said that Cranston has the “perfect look” of a news anchorman. “That was immediately clear that he was the perfect man. I think I can perhaps totally misdirect the whole thing, but Bryan cannot do anything wrong. It feels that it’s so natural to him.” One obvious point that Network makes is that fame authorises opinion, and Cranston is no stranger to that process. It’s unlikely anyone sought his view on politics, for example, when he was doing daytime turns on Sabrina the Teenage Witch. But, leading up to the last presidential election, he vowed to move to Canada if Donald Trump won. A few weeks ago, with Trump in the White House and Cranston still living in Ventura County, he said that to people who hope Trump fails, he has a message: “Fuck you. Why would you want that? So you can be right?” Beale, you feel, would be proud of both opinions and in particular the language of their expression. Having found late middle-aged stardom, wealth and acclaim, Bryan Cranston, it seems, is as mad as hell and he’s not going to take it any more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/19/observer-killer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T00:01:45Z","webTitle":"Observer Killer Sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/19/observer-killer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/19/observer-killer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer Killer Sudoku","bodyText":"Normal Sudoku rules apply, except the numbers in the cells contained within grey lines add up to the figures in the corner.

The receptionists, security officers, postroom staff and porters working at the University of London are employed through the facilities management company Cordant Security, but are seeking the right to agree their pay and conditions directly with the university. Papers for the case, led by gig economy union the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, and the Good Law Project, devised by the barrister Jolyon Maugham QC, are being filed at the central arbitration committee on Tuesday. The case argues that denying the workers the right to collectively bargain with their “de facto employer” is a breach of article 11 of the European convention on human rights concerning joining trade unions and having them protect their interests. If successful, the case could potentially open the door for thousands of outsourced workers across the UK to negotiate with the company that ultimately benefits from their labour. The union said that if it established the precedent of a joint employer for the purposes of collective bargaining, this could potentially be applied to people employed via agencies, such as those working in the Sports Direct warehouse. The IWGB general secretary, Jason Moyer Lee, said: “When it comes to the most important elements of pay and terms and conditions for the outsourced workers, it is the University of London and not Cordant which calls the shots. “In order for these workers’ collective bargaining and human rights to mean anything, we need to be able to negotiate directly with the university, not the glorified middleman.” A University of London spokesperson said: “The university does not employ any of these workers and does not accept that the relevant legislation recognises the concept of joint employment. We have therefore not agreed to the IWGB’s request for recognition.” The spokesperson added that the university had begun a review of the performance of its contracted facilities management services, which would cover pay, conditions and benefits.The court case is the latest in a series of battles over better employment rights and pay between outsourced workers, particularly cleaning staff, and universities and other big institutions including hospitals. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said the practice of using outsourced workers hit those in the lowest-paid sectors the hardest. “Outsourcing’s a cheap trick used by bad bosses to dodge their basic responsibilities to workers. They’re trying to hammer down people’s pay and get an unfair advantage,” O’Grady said. “Other European countries have a sensible way of dealing with this. Unions and businesses negotiate fair pay rates for the whole sector, which means outsourcing can’t drive down pay and conditions.” • This article was amended on 21 November 2017.

I fear we won’t get justice","bodyText":"I’ve been researching undercover policing ever since the boyfriend I knew as Mark Cassidy left me in spring 2000. Like the other female activists bringing cases of undercover police abuse to light, I have become skilled in scouring documents, interrogating and interpreting evidence. We’ve fought a legal case against the Metropolitan police to expose its institutional sexist practices, and waited for five years for an apology that should have been given much earlier. Now I’m one of the 180 “non-state core participants” (NSCPs) in the public inquiry into undercover policing. Established in March 2015, the inquiry was due to report in July 2018, but it’s looking unlikely any evidence will be heard until 2019, and the end date is no longer even in sight. Sir John Mitting, the inquiry chair, is sitting for three days this week in the Royal Courts of Justice in London, listening to legal arguments and counter-arguments about police anonymity. He obliquely responded to a letter from October signed by 115 NSCPs expressing our concern about the inquiry’s lack of openness and transparency, stating that his priority was to “discover the truth”. For many of the ordinary people attending as core participants, the Royal Courts building – with its endless gothic corridors – is intimidating and alien. Sitting in the public gallery of court 76 is a collection of journalists, core participants, and our friends and family. We are listening to the lawyers discuss principles established in case law that very few of us sitting at the back will understand. We usually sit politely and wait in good faith, as we’ve been doing now for two years, for crumbs of information about the police officers who collectively used and abused us. But yesterday morning was different. Vocal interventions from core participants expressed our frustration at a process which, despite the judge’s reassurance, is looking more likely to obfuscate than reveal the truth. Because nothing is being revealed. Not even the full list of the groups spied on. Despite the Metropolitan police apology issued to me and the other women, Mark Jenner (who I knew as Mark Cassidy) is the only officer cited in our case whose identity has still not been officially confirmed by either the Met or the inquiry. No reason has been given. The latest tranche of documents promised that some names would be revealed: a few cover names (including HN81, who infiltrated the Stephen Lawrence family campaign) and some real names. Each officer is coded by an HN number, and the list is dizzying. But many officers we will learn nothing about. The judge has already made some orders for some evidence to be heard in secret, and it will no doubt be so heavily redacted before it reaches the public as to be meaningless. In these cases, he will rely on information collected by the police about their own officers. How can this be fair? How can a judge determine the impact of secret deployments if those who were targeted are not told who spied on them? Without transparency, how do we know if these nameless HN numbers infiltrated other family justice campaigns? How do we know if they had abusive, intimate relationships with those they spied on? How do we know if they passed on information to private corporations resulting in trade unionists being blacklisted from work? And how do we know if they acted within the law? Trying to access and make sense of their redacted evidence buried deep within the inquiry’s website is hugely challenging. Like the corridors of the building, the complexity of the website renders many of us bewildered and disengaged from a process in which our participation feels anything but “core”. Despite institutional racism being central to the setting up of the inquiry, when it was revealed that the Lawrence family was spied upon, the inquiry team is all white. It is predominantly male and is now being chaired by a judge who is a member of the men-only Garrick Club. A letter sent to the home secretary in September, requesting a meeting to discuss the inappropriateness of the new judge, has been ignored. Instead of recognising the damage done to those of us who tracked down our ex-partners, various witnesses are characterising our searches as malicious. And the emphasis the police are placing on the right of the abusers to protect their families contrasts sickeningly with their total lack of regard for the families they intruded upon. Mitting must appreciate the context in which his inquiry is now taking place. Since the recent revelations about abuse of women by men in the film industry, parliament and elsewhere, the misogyny of our society has become unignorable. What happened to us was sustained abuse. The men who have been exposed in other spheres have been named and shamed. Harvey Weinstein, Max Stafford-Clark and Kevin Spacey cannot hide who they were when they were abusing their positions of power. Undercover police officers, by contrast, were given state-sponsored identities. From what we know thus far, it’s likely that many committed long-term and far-reaching human rights abuses, for which they may never be held publicly responsible if their real names are concealed. If they didn’t commit these wrongdoings, what are they afraid of? If their targets were legitimate, why do they need to hide behind fake names? Sexual abusers should not be able to rely on a court anonymity order. No one else alleged to have committed such abuse is offered this privilege. We know that three officers who had intimate, sexual relationships with activists (John Dines, Bob Lambert and Andy Coles) all went on to reinvent themselves, taking on public roles as advisers and consultants to international police departments and university criminology courses, or holding public office as a deputy police and crime commissioner. Without knowing the real names of the officers involved in our lives and the lives of others, how do we hold to account those who have since created illustrious careers advising policymakers on police matters? Many of us feel this inquiry is turning into another attempt at an establishment cover-up. Our patience is running out. • Alison is one of eight women who successfully took legal action against the Metropolitan police over the conduct of undercover officers.

What he needs is humility, 20 October). Can I suggest that even at this late moment there is a book that the chancellor should consult: Benjamin Disraeli’s Sybil. Although today’s circumstances differ from 1845, the essentials are not too different. Then there was a numerous, discontented working class struggling to survive on low wages and living in poor housing; today the numerous members of the precariat and the “just managing” suffer the same plight. Disraeli realised that this discontented group could be won to the Tory cause. The policies of one nation Toryism created the working-class Tory, who enabled the Conservatives to become the natural party of government. While the rightwing populism of Brexit has won many working-class voters to the Tory cause, once the negative impact of Brexit hits the country, this support could evaporate. If Hammond wants to lead the Conservative party he must produce a radical Disraeli-like budget that will appeal to the losers in society. Disraeli was able to turn a party dominated by politicians far more reactionary than Jacob Rees-Mogg into a conservative party imbued with a sense of duty and care towards the poorest in society. Derrick Joad Leeds • Re the letter from Joseph Stiglitz and others (The chancellor must end austerity now, 20 November), the chancellor should also note that controlled rage is the only rational response to the Paradise Papers’ revelations that billions of pounds are shipped out of the UK tax free to tax havens at the same time that councils are enforcing council tax arrears, plus court costs and bailiff fees, against the lowest UK incomes. That happens on top of rent arrears, the dire increases in the cost of living and family and individual insolvency. For weeks, sometimes months, those households have no income to pay the tax due to the benefits sanction, zero-hours contracts and universal credit. Their housing benefit has been cut by the overall benefit cap, by the bedroom tax and by the local housing allowance, while rents increase. The council tax enforcement army takes no prisoners, while the elite enjoy the unearned and untaxed huge increase in the value of their UK land, their tax-free yachts and their private aircraft. Rev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty • Part of the government’s apparent problem in allowing councils to borrow in order to build council housing (Fiscal Phil’s get out of jail free card: sort out housing, 20 November) is the treatment of such expenditure as merely increasing debt. In fact, it creates assets, even if these can be sold at a discount under right to buy. The other part is its ideological objection to council housing in the first place. Both stances have to be abandoned if the housing crisis is to be tackled. I look back to 1967, the year in which I was first elected as a councillor in Newcastle, when the city built 3,000 council houses. Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords • In the past, housing benefit bought more social housing. Now it goes into landlords’ pockets. Time now to build future-proof social housing and use the rents to recreate the virtuous cycle. At the moment, we have a system by which the government commands and “bribes” local councils to build. This leads to councils taking the line of least resistance by using green fields and big property companies. Here in High Peak a development of 107 houses on beautiful green fields rewards the council with almost £500,000 of government money. The town is already gridlocked; primary schools suffer increased pollution; and the amenity loss is huge (ancient trees, bats, owls, insects, deer etc). The houses are mostly three-to-four bedroom, of the type that maximise developers’ profit, with a few “affordable” homes tagged on. The houses are not Passivhaus. So, more houses are built, but they leave a toxic legacy. Can we build housing that meets the current needs of local communities and does not jeopardise the future? Lorrie Marchington Whaley Bridge, High Peak, Derbyshire • “Nobody has a shorthand typist any more,” the chancellor says (Hammond ‘detached from reality’ over no unemployed gaffe, 20 November). Note the “has”, not “is”. This is very revealing about where Philip Hammond sees his place in the world. It reminds me of the Lady Chatterley’s Lover trial: “Is it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?” Andrea Royce Ruddington, Nottinghamshire • Philip Hammond correctly observed that “20 years ago we were worried about what would happen to a million shorthand typists in Britain as the personal computer took over”. He need go no further than Zimbabwe to see how an ambitious and flexible typist can demonstrate those splendid Tory virtues, “better themselves” and give the best possible start to their children.

After an array of Russians, Walton’s two symphonies mark a fresh departure. Symphony No 1 (1935), which the composer struggled to finish, opens – after a pianissimo timpani roll – with a broad, outdoor canter and an unmistakable splash of Sibelius. By the last movement, Walton’s own majestic, brass-rich orchestral voice takes over (strains of Crown Imperial, which he wrote soon after). In contrast, the second symphony has lighter textures, with echoes of Stravinsky, and, surprisingly for a more rear garde composer, ventures into atonality. Brass and woodwind shine throughout, and the BSO strings sound punchy and lithe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/21/clockenflap-pop-festival-hong-kong-stormzy-massive-attack-kaiser-chiefs","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T11:01:53Z","webTitle":"Clockenflap: the postcolonial pop festival trying to unite Hong Kong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/21/clockenflap-pop-festival-hong-kong-stormzy-massive-attack-kaiser-chiefs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/21/clockenflap-pop-festival-hong-kong-stormzy-massive-attack-kaiser-chiefs","fields":{"headline":"Clockenflap: the postcolonial pop festival trying to unite Hong Kong","bodyText":"Hong Kong enjoyed its musical heyday in the 1970s and 80s when clubs such as DiscoDisco, the former British colony’s answer to Studio 54, saw Andy Warhol and Madonna grace the dance floor – followed by decades of inertia. A leading light in reviving it has been Clockenflap, which sets out to create a world-class music and arts festival – it has just celebrated its 10th anniversary with Massive Attack, the Prodigy, Kaiser Chiefs and Stormzy. But there’s still a way to go, as co-founder and musical director Justin Sweeting explains: “Our festival serves as an annual rallying cry for those who yearn for more creative stimulus. Though we need many more of these pieces across the spectrum to make for a fully functioning, sustainable music scene.” With Hong Kong charts dominated by Cantopop and mainstream artists such as Taylor Swift, Clockenflap has been key in diversifying the artists performing there, while at the same time creating a platform to amplify its homegrown talent on a world stage. Tedman Lee, AKA Junkie T, vocalist of NI.NE.MO and co-founder of creative agency Hehehe, agrees. “They have brought in so many good acts over the past 10 years As far as getting local musicians to the Hong Kong western population, it certainly helps.” Fergus Heathcote, who has been showcasing local DJ talent at his Sounds of the Underground night for seven years, agrees. “Clockenflap’s programming has been incredible and keeps getting better. They make a great effort in showcasing a spectrum of local musicians.” Heathcote, who has also lived in London and had a show on the alternative radio station Balamii in Peckham, added: “Nowhere in the world can compare to the UK music scene, but Hong Kong is relatively healthy. A lot of new bars, clubs, spaces, nights and internet radio stations have been opening up. Six years ago, there were only a couple of underground music nights, such as Heavy Hong Kong, Kongkrete Bass and Magnetic Soul, and you would get a couple of big international acts every couple of months, but nowadays there seem to be at least five or so every month. We’ve seen the scene grow rapidly, with more homegrown labels, DJs, producers and musicians, such as Young Queenz and Yeti Out. As a 17-year-old, I could never have imagined Hong Kong becoming like this.” Clockenflap has played a significant role in regenerating the Hong Kong music scene by creating a “proper festival” that attracts acclaimed artists such as the Mercury prize winners Young Fathers, who played Red Bull’s YourMum stage on Sunday. On his first visit to Hong Kong, Stormzy responded to chants of his name by quizzing the crowd on their grime knowledge. In a continent where grime is still in its infancy, it’s not surprising that he initially wondered, “Do they even know me in Hong Kong?”, but with half the crowd raising their hands when asked who’s from the UK, it was clear that he was performing to an international audience, something that was evident throughout the weekend. Tom Ogden of Blossoms paid testament to the festival’s success: “We couldn’t have asked for a better final gig of the year. Hong Kong made us feel like we were playing Stockport Plaza all over again. As expected, we brought the weather with us, but that didn’t stop the crowd. We’d love to go back and play a headline show.” Notable performances by local talent included one by Supper Moment, who bridge the gap between Cantopop and rock; lead singer Sunny couldn’t help surfing his home crowd. Sonic Youth-inspired ANWIYCTI (A New World If You Can Take It), who had just arrived back from a short European tour, are a leading light in the local indie scene, and took to the stage with swagger. Meanwhile, five-piece experimental indie rock band Chochukmo, whose frontman wore a Joy Division T-shirt for their headline set, demonstrated how local acts can hold their own on a world stage. Clockenflap has created a synergy of sounds by colliding east and west in an organic, uncontrived way, demonstrating an appetite for underground music and emerging artists. With Sonar, Ultra and Creamfields music festivals all now venturing to “Asia’s world city”, Clockenflap can be proud that it has gone a long way in promoting social cohesion among locals and expats. It still struggles to draw a truly mixed crowd, but then it took decades to transfer Hong Kong back to Chinese rule – its musical decolonisation could take just as long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/nov/20/it-is-absurd-and-prejudiced-to-suggest-that-hijab-sexualises-girls","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T19:16:57Z","webTitle":"It is absurd and prejudiced to suggest that hijab ‘sexualises’ girls | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/20/it-is-absurd-and-prejudiced-to-suggest-that-hijab-sexualises-girls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/nov/20/it-is-absurd-and-prejudiced-to-suggest-that-hijab-sexualises-girls","fields":{"headline":"It is absurd and prejudiced to suggest that hijab ‘sexualises’ girls","bodyText":"Amanda Spielman, head of Ofsted, says “creating an environment where primary school children are expected to wear the hijab could be interpreted as sexualisation of young girls” (Inspectors to question girls in primary school who wear hijab, 20 November). These inspections and the accusation that hijab “sexualises” girls are absurd and reek of prejudice. As a Muslim mother, I do not believe, according to Islamic jurisprudence, that my daughters should wear hijab before they are young women and I will never coerce them to wear hijab at any stage. Yet, in an attempt to copy my mother, I stubbornly wore hijab as a young girl against the wish of my parents then. So, I would like to ask Amanda Spielman, will Ofsted inspectors be “questioning” young girls copying their mothers, whether by wearing hijab, lipstick or stilettos? The argument that hijab, as a religious headgear, “sexualises” girls is flawed. If it does then it also “sexualises” women. Many Muslim women view hijab as an article of faith and modesty that liberates them from objectifying societal expectations, and this is what I will teach my daughters. Amanda Spielman is arguing that a certain garment sexualises girls. If so, will Ms Spielman be extending this “inspection” to cover other items of clothing? Do short skirts sexualise girls more than trousers? What about girls’ weather-exposed shoes compared to well-padded boys’ shoes? Will Ms Spielman focus only on girls, or are boys wearing skullcaps and turbans bound to be “sexualised” too? Shockingly, the NSPCC reported that 31% of women in the UK experienced sexual abuse in childhood. Ofsted needs to get its priorities right instead of targeting a minority Muslim population and excluding the voice of Muslim parents.

Spokesman Enrique Balbi said “a biological source” was behind the noises which were picked up by two Argentinian navy ships searching for ARA San Juan and by sonar buoys dropped by a US P8 surveillance plane.The navy has also revealed the submarine’s last communication, on Wednesday, was to report a mechanical breakdown related to its batteries. Captain Gabriel Galeazzi, who runs the naval base in Mar del Plata, which was the submarine’s destination, said mechanical problems were not uncommon and rarely posed a risk. The announcement regarding the noises dashed hopes raised by a CNN report on Monday that stated the sounds could be crew members banging tools against the hull. “The sounds are not from the submarine and do not correspond to a pattern that could be interpreted as Morse code,” Balbi said. The five-day search has entered a “critical phase”, the navy said, because the submarine is approaching the probable limit of its oxygen reserves.Earlier on Monday, Balbi told reporters that although the vessel has enough food and fuel to survive 90 days on the surface, it only had enough oxygen to survive for seven days underwater. Balbi also speculated that the submarine could have already been traveling underwater due to the rough conditions on the surface when it last made contact on Wednesday morning. Balbi confirmed that seven failed satellite phone calls detected by navy listening posts on Saturday morning were not from the submarine. “None of the communications on Saturday were from the San Juan,” Balbi told reporters. News of the attempted calls were disclosed on Sunday, but they turned out to be from another ship broadcasting on the same frequency employed by the San Juan, Balbi said. The news came on the morning the submarine had been scheduled to arrive at Mar del Plata naval base on its 10-day journey from Argentina’s southernmost city of Ushuaia. “This phase is critical,” said Balbi. The submarine “should have arrived in Mar del Plata on Sunday or today Monday if the problem had only been a communications breakdown”. A large number of international ships and aeroplanes, including a British polar exploration vessel, are braving strong winds and six-metre high waves in the area off the coast of Patagonia where the submarine was lost. The rough conditions were clearly shown in footage posted online by the Argentinian navy on Monday. “These were the meteorological conditions and the state of the sea yesterday in the search and rescue operations zone,” the navy tweeted. The US navy has also joined the search, deploying unmanned submersibles and aeroplanes to the South Atlantic. Two US air force planes landed in the southern coastal city of Comodoro Rivadavia on Sunday carrying a US navy submarine rescue team, including a mini sub, a submersible rescue vehicle and a remote control unmanned submersible equipped with video cameras. A British Royal Navy Hercules C-130 plane and the HMS Protector ice patrol ship are also participating in the rescue effort. Mauricio Macri met relatives of the crew at the Mar del Plata naval base on Monday morning. The president said on Twitter that the government was “deploying all possible national and international resources to find [the crewmembers] as soon as possible”. But the wait is taking its toll on the relatives of the missing submariners. “Every day is leading us closer to a sad ending, regrettably,” Carlos Mendoza, brother of crew member Fernando Ariel Mendoza told the Infobae website. “It’s sad, but we have to be realistic.” Karina Vargas, the wife of crew member Cayetano Vargas, told the local newspaper San Juan 8 that she had seen her husband in a dream after the submarine had left Ushuaia. “I’ve never had a bad feeling before, but this time I saw him arriving at home before time. He said hello and I made joke about asking him to look after the boys so I could go out.” Other family members have used social media to ask for support during the search. “Pray so that my husband Fernando Santilli can return home,” Jesica Gopar said on Twitter. “He’s on the San Juan submarine.” In another message, she tweeted a picture of her missing husband, with the message: “Your son and I are waiting for you. I love you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/26/houston-person-rain-or-shine-review-soulful-yet-sparky","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Houston Person: Rain or Shine review – soulful yet sparky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/26/houston-person-rain-or-shine-review-soulful-yet-sparky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/26/houston-person-rain-or-shine-review-soulful-yet-sparky","fields":{"headline":"Houston Person: Rain or Shine review – soulful yet sparky","bodyText":"Although he doesn’t attract much critical attention, Houston Person must have a large and loyal following, judging by the number of albums he’s made over the years.

Now, I am of the opinion that feminism is the answer to pretty much everything, so the idea of bell hooks and Kate Millett swooping in to save the day where all those medical professionals failed certainly has its appeal. So, like I say, sweet – but also a teensy bit annoying. I would never dissuade anyone from reading feminist theory, but the suggestion that a mental illness can be treated by argument feels a mere skip from saying its causation is similarly straightforward. Gender influences, like cultural influences (fashion models, women’s magazines, all the usual suspects), play a part in anorexia’s external manifestation, but the causes are as deep and knotty as a tree root. Mental illness, by its very nature, defies logic. Since I first wrote about my own experience with anorexia in this paper many years ago, I’ve received, on average, an email a week from parents, siblings and teachers about someone they’re worried about. Over a period of 17 years, that’s a lot of fear and love and pain in my inbox. The stories vary – a mother who has fainting spells, a sister with legs so thin, you can circle them with your thumb and forefinger – but the last question is always the same: “How did you recover?” I’ve been thinking of writing about my recovery for a while. Not, alas, because I think it is a universal cure – every anorexic’s experience is utterly individual, which is part of the reason I query any mooted general solution – but because you hear so few happy endings to experiences such as mine. Between the ages of 13 and 17, I had six long-term stays in psychiatric units, plus an emergency admission to a general, and of all the girls, women and men I met in those stays, I know of only three who recovered. The others, at least those I know about, are either still stuck in the narrow twilit world of anorexia, or dead. There was Nicola, who slept in the bed next to me in the Maudsley hospital for six months, whose death from organ failure I learned about from the Daily Mail 10 years after we hugged goodbye. And there was Fritha, whose grace and kindness made me idolise her when we were in the Priory together, who later killed herself. Why did I recover and not them? Luck and timing, mainly. I was extremely lucky to have found – after many false prophets and worse – a wonderful doctor, Professor Janet Treasure, who was the first medical professional I encountered who understood me and who I couldn’t outsmart. That she was a woman was, for me, a bonus, and I felt more comfortable talking to her about body image and sexuality than I had with previous male doctors. After I left hospital for the seventh time, I was offered a place at university, but I was losing weight again; Prof Treasure said if I lost any more, they’d tell the university I was too sick to go. I’d worked so hard to keep up with my school year – doing my GCSEs in three months while in hospital, my A-levels in a year – that the thought of falling at this final hurdle was too much: at last, I had something to eat for. My ambitions for myself had, finally, become stronger than the illness. I understand why some doctors tell patients to cut themselves off from their outside life and focus on their recovery – one doctor dropped me because I refused to quit school. But, for me, having a connection to the world outside was my lifeline out of the land of sickness. I was also lucky to be young, so I only had to slip back into schooling when I left hospital, as opposed to trying to find a job. The biggest motivator for me was not reading feminist theory, or any other academic idea, but seeing the painful reality of the alternative. In hospital, I met women who had been sick for more than 30 years. At some point, I was able to swim to the surface, look at them in suspended animation beneath the waves, and think: “That is not going to be my life.” And it wasn’t. But it so easily could have been. I was lucky in my specifics, but when you recover, you are scarred for life. Even now, when I go out to eat without studying the menu obsessively for days before, the illness is there, just below the ice. Every year the ice gets thicker, but going through something like that sucks out a little bit of your soul. You know how easily you can slip past those who love you into a dark night that they can’t reach. It also means I’m always standing a little to the side of myself, looking at the life I have, and thinking about the one I didn’t."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/29/guardian-public-service-awards-2017-congratulations-to-all-our-winners","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T10:29:56Z","webTitle":"Guardian Public Service Awards 2017: Congratulations to all our winners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/29/guardian-public-service-awards-2017-congratulations-to-all-our-winners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/29/guardian-public-service-awards-2017-congratulations-to-all-our-winners","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Public Service Awards 2017: Congratulations to all our winners","bodyText":"It’s a well-worn maxim that insanity is doing the same thing time and again and expecting different results. Yet that is still how many of us think and behave. The winners of the Guardian Public Service Awards 2017 are the exception: they have paused, thought and come up with fresh ways of delivering services that are yielding huge benefits. Our overall winner, Hertfordshire county council, ticks almost every box with its new approach to child protection. With time spent by children in the care system down 50%, no wonder other councils are now trying the same. Two other category winners, Swansea council and Highgate primary school in north London, have similarly swum upstream of developing family and behavioural problems that can require costly interventions by multiple agencies. More importantly, they are transforming children’s lives. Airedale NHS foundation trust has thought, and acted, differently about supporting people who stammer, not just locally, but across the country. Warwickshire county council has opened “charity tip shops” at its household waste centres. Charity Hope into Action has come up with an inspired way of housing homeless people. And Greater Manchester Police is achieving remarkable results in the diversity of its recruitment by, yes, doing things differently. We have two individual winners. Paul Allen, a social work manager for Manchester city council, scoops our leadership excellence trophy for the way he motivates his children and families team. And Stephen Smith, our public servant of the year, has been chosen by a readers’ vote for his tireless work over more than 25 years in Lancashire for people who, like him, have a learning disability. Thanks to all who voted, to our valued sponsors and the hundreds of entrants for the awards. Public service is changing, and for the better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/20/in-zimbabwe-its-hello-china-goodbye-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T19:15:27Z","webTitle":"In Zimbabwe it’s hello China, goodbye Britain | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/20/in-zimbabwe-its-hello-china-goodbye-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/20/in-zimbabwe-its-hello-china-goodbye-britain","fields":{"headline":"In Zimbabwe it’s hello China, goodbye Britain","bodyText":"One aspect of the coup d’etat in Zimbabwe (Chaos in Zimbabwe after Mugabe refuses to resign, 20 November) is highly significant for Britain and the wider world: it has been suggested that shortly before the coup the head of the army, General Constantino Chiwenga, visited China to obtain tacit Chinese government support for the move. That is a stunning indication of the importance of China to Zimbabwe, especially to its elite, and of the complete eclipse of the influence of Britain as the former colonial power. Similarly, despite the 2009 dollarisation of the Zimbabwean economy and the US’s status as supposedly the world’s only superpower, American views carry little weight in Harare. Zimbabwe is only one of many countries where China is acquiring an overseas empire of investment and influence. For example, Chinese companies now have investments in mining in almost every southern African country – from Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania southwards. This year China opened its first permanent overseas military base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. In south Asia, Chinese military advice and support were crucial to the Sri Lankan government’s 2009 defeat of the Tamil Tigers in the long-running civil war. It is time the British government and people woke up to our insignificance and vulnerability in the world and started to take the necessary measures to improve our economy, strengthen our armed forces and reduce our national debt.

Millions of people will get up and go to work as normal; families will remain widely dispersed; shops will be open as usual; and at the end of the day the nation will gather for its traditional meals of takeaway and microwaved convenience foods eaten in front of a screen. In the US, by contrast, it will be the feast of Thanksgiving, when the whole country shuts down and families gather from across vast distances for a ritual meal celebrating America’s founding myth. An anthropologist might well suppose that this was the most important festival of the year, far more so than Christmas. No one would dare declare a war on Thanksgiving. So it makes a kind of sense that the day after be given over to the frenzy of shopping. It makes no sense at all for Black Friday to be transplanted to Britain. There is nothing at all special about the day in the British social calendar. Even in the retail calendar it falls squarely in the middle of the runup to Christmas, which nowadays starts some time in early October, so that there are already angels watching over the crowds in Oxford Street in central London, while in Bradford the Christmas decorations went up even earlier. It’s obvious why the retail sector is keen. The things that are bought specially at this time of year are almost by definition things that people don’t need. They are merely passing through on their journey from factory to landfill. Yet the whole modern economy is built around the notion of shopping as a pleasure in itself. Without a thriving market for frivolities, fewer people could afford necessities. It might seem shocking to have such a festival of consumerism in a country where so many are dependent on food banks, but things would be even worse without it. With that said, two things about this week’s sales stand out. The first is that they will do very little to benefit high street retailers. That may be even more true in the US, where shares in bricks-and-mortar shops are being sold short in anticipation that this will turn out to be another triumph for Amazon. But even here, the kinds of shops and small businesses that tend to build up communities are unlikely to benefit from the steadily increasing shift to online shopping. The one thing physically located retailers can offer that can’t so easily be reproduced online is, paradoxically, the one thing people are increasingly willing to pay for, if they are shopping recreationally: an experience rather than a physical object. One of the most profitable companies in the world today, Apple, has made its fortune by tying the experience and the widget so closely together that its phones and computers work on the imagination like sacred objects, offering an experience to their owners that is quite distinct from their performance. This also explains why Apple stores are among the most profitable retail outlets in the world, and the least affected by the online world. The act of shopping becomes its own reward. Meanwhile, in China, the Singles Day sales have been boosted as an equivalent to Thanksgiving and Black Friday, but they are entirely online. The idea is to turn shopping into a collective online experience, like a game, where the imagination is freed from the dreary inconveniences of physical shops. In the last analysis, materialism is not really about material objects at all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2017/nov/20/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T21:00:39Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/20/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/nov/20/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• An article mistakenly said that a bill included “changes to the law to make it easier for workers to gain union recognition”.

I met her at the first showing of the film. She happened to be in London and she just sort of turned up at the screening room. It was a really intimate setting and her arrival was a delightful surprise. Everyone has their preconceived idea of what Grace is going to be like: larger than life and unpredictable was what I thought beforehand. We didn’t actually meet until the end of the film. I could tell she was enjoying it throughout as she was whooping and clapping. At the end she turned around to look at me and said: “I just love the smell of your film!” I remember thinking that was a wonderful way of describing something. A group of us went for dinner afterwards, and that’s really when we got talking. She’s a brilliant conversationalist. We talked about religion and her upbringing. I remember her saying: “You understand where I come from.” I think she appreciated that I was looking at the impact the church had had on her upbringing. Grace contacted me 18 months later and said the BBC had been in touch with her, wanting to make a documentary, and that she didn’t want to do it. She suggested we do something together instead. We began spending time on the phone and seeing each other when we could. She had a transcendental agenda. I remember her saying that she wanted to do this project with me because she felt it was necessary to “drop the construction and performative aspect of being Grace Jones”. She wanted to “be seen by the world in a private way” and had always kept that out of the limelight. Sometimes Grace likes to go, what she calls, “Totally coco-loco” – partying and clubbing etc, but there is also a quieter, more contemplative side to her. It was my job as her friend and the filmmaker to capture those moments – to be her mirror. It’s been a long friendship between the two of us now. She has taught me a lot about life and myself, and I hope I have done the same for her in some way. She describes us as “soul sisters” and I like that very much. We’re two women who connected. She’s generous and she’s intense, and she’s not ashamed of who she is in any way, and I like that.

Katy Perry was barred for seemingly supporting the independence of Taiwan, while model Gigi Hadid transgressed by squinting in a way some Chinese people thought was racist, while posing with a fortune cookie that looked like Buddha. Add in China’s standard unpredictability when it comes to issuing press visas and you have loss of face all around. Victoria’s Secret staff are said to believe their emails are being watched. To which seasoned business travellers to China might respond: why do you think we’ve been carrying burner phones and disposable laptops there for years? This is serious business. Demand for high-end women’s underwear is surging in China, as real wages rise and women’s social attitudes change. Sales volumes have doubled in five years, to $18bn (£14bn). For reference, the combined efforts of all the queues of sheepish men outside Britain’s knicker shops this Christmas will drive the UK total to just $2bn. But the average Chinese retail outlet still prefers functionality over seductiveness – with shop window displays that would make the ladies underwear section at Marks &amp; Spencer look risque. Into this gap have surged numerous online-only Chinese underwear brands, selling designer garments at less than half price of the equivalent VS product. But their presence in the malls, where the young salaried women shop is still minimal. So battle is commenced – with the Chinese brands engaged in a price war against each other, while being relentlessly boosted by the state-owned media against the foreign competition. The ultimate prize is significant: whoever wins brand supremacy, once China’s 200 million young adult women are prepared to buy bras at $90 (£68) a time, will be raking in large profits. Under Xi Jinping, everything is political. Hadid was hounded across Chinese social media for having “mocked Asian people”, according to the newspaper Jing Daily, which added that the company’s “insufficient response” – ie refusal to sack her – was “a slight to the national pride of Chinese millennials”. She has since apologised for her actions, saying “ I have the utmost respect and love for the people of China.” Xi, whose “thoughts” were enshrined in the party constitution in October, has effectively turned the brittle nationalism of Chinese cyberspace into government policy. China is building a new physical infrastructure across Central Asia and into Europe, buying up assets as far as Greece and the Balkans and building up its military to match the US’s presence in the region. Xi has cracked down on all potential opponents, issuing a series of warnings to anybody who might be thinking of opposing him. And he has ordered the party cadres to learn actual Marxism – not the neoliberal management theories people thought were Marxism under his predecessors. The impossibility of knowing how this will play out is summed up in the Chinese bureaucracy’s habitual use of the word “while” – often inserted between two entirely opposed objectives. For example, Xi will “lower Chinese barriers for foreign investors, while strengthening domestic innovative capabilities in digital, engineering, genetic, aerospace, cyberspace, and smart technologies”. How many Chinese barriers should foreign businesses expect to encounter if they want to invest in such capabilities? They are left guessing, as are the organisers of Victoria’s Secret who reportedly could not even get a permit to film on the street outside the venue where their fashion show was to be staged. The game China has played with globalisation up to now has been logical and, if we consider how brutally its own markets were torn open in the 19th century, karmic. It has protected its own industries and consumer sector behind a string of unofficial barriers, and with a slew of soft loans and politicised investments that a regular capitalist government could never get away with. Above all, it used the Great Firewall, which western companies initially accepted as part of the political setup, as a protective economic barrier behind which it could create global-scale tech and internet companies. But China’s intended next steps in shaping its domestic market will take this principle a whole lot further. Sesame Credit, set up by Ant Financial, an offshoot of Alibaba (known in China as Zhima Credit) is one of a number of credit scoring systems that look designed to make Orwellian self-surveillance a reality. It is one of a number of credit scoring agencies recently set up to seeking to aggregate user behaviour to offer incentives. Tencent’s rival service collects data users’ from social media. Both companies are using user data in a way that would not be possible in the UK. The private initiatives are seen as precursors to a government plan, in 2020, to launch a comprehensive social credit system. As well as creditworthiness, it will measure political loyalty based on online behaviour. People with low scores won’t get job offers, loans or high-speed internet; people who network with people with low scores will also get downgraded. The project, which is awaiting regulatory approval, has been decried by human rights groups as a mass surveillance tool. But it is nothing compared to what China is planning with artificial intelligence. Last month, the Chinese state issued a strategy designed to achieve global leadership in AI by 2030. As part of the plan, the private sector is ordered routinely to share its user data with the state. This puts China in the unique position among major powers of having no formal barriers to state exploitation of private commercial data. If it succeeds, China will create a consumer market whose customer data is completely interpenetrated with state surveillance mechanisms, and a population whose behaviour can be predicted right down to their choice of underwear. In these circumstances it is right to ask: what is left of the idea of a global marketplace? The Shanghai branch of Victoria’s Secret will look like any other branch in the world – but it will be selling into a marketplace whose dynamics it cannot properly see, in which its customer data is not protected from the state, and where every purchase, every search inside its online store is recorded, as of right, by the government – as with any business operating in China. Ten years ago, it was only corporations such as Google who had to decide whether they could ethically continue operating in markets distorted by state surveillance. Today that dilemma is beginning to confront the most basic, physical consumer brands trying to operate in China – and, as mass surveillance technology is deployed, it will get worse. On the internet, there is already Balkanisation; there is the Chinese tech market and the rest of the world. Soon, right down to issues such as choice of styles or colours in fashion, global companies will be selling into two kinds of market. In one, consumers really do exercise choice, and consumer data is for the use of the seller only; in another, China, every micro-level consumer choice is scanned by the mass surveillance programmes in case it signals disloyalty. Victoria’s Secret clearly blundered into an issue it could not anticipate, but the experience should prompt all businesses operating in China to ask the question: with every sale I make, am I now providing a repressive state with the means to keep my customers under surveillance? • This article was amended on 30 November and 4 December 2017 to correct some details about Sesame Credit, which had been based on information in a report that was found to be incorrect after publication. The company was not setup by Alibaba and Tencent. Sesame Credit was setup by Ant Financial, an offshoot of Alibaba. Tencent runs a different credit scoring service.

The name, the court was reported to have said, is so similar “that it was sufficiently likely that an observer would surmise some kind of link between Miss Ono and the bar”. An observer of the graffiti-covered dive bar possibly wouldn’t assume it was run by the mega-rich artist, but apparently that’s not the point. Here are some other celebrities who have had to fight for their good names. Uri Geller v Pokémon In 1999, the illusionist complained that Nintendo’s Pokémon game had used his name and image for two of its monsters. “I wouldn’t have given permission for an aggressive and, in one case, evil character to be based on me,” said the spoon-bender. Gladys Knight v her son The chain of Gladys Knight’s Chicken &amp; Waffles restaurants, run by Shanga Hankerson, became a source of embarrassment to his mother after he was arrested for financial irregularities in 2016. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported earlier this year that Knight had won the case – and that her name, and anything associated with her, should be phased out. Clint Eastwood v furniture The actor took umbrage at a furniture company which, according to reports, was marketing a “Clint entertainment center”. The unit, said the company, virtually incomprehensibly, makes you look as if you live in “a perfect world of a million dollar baby” (bold, lawyer’s own). Rosa Parks v Outkast Lawyers and caretakers acting for the civil rights activist eventually settled with the hip-hop duo Outkast over the use of Parks’ name in a song title. Scarlett Johansson v literature In the French novel La Première Chose Qu’on Regarde (The First Thing You See) by Grégoire Delacourt, one character is a Scarlett Johansson lookalike. The real Johansson was reportedly unhappy – her lawyers said the character was a “fraudulent and illicit exploitation of her name, her reputation and her image”. A French judge agreed it was defamatory, but awarded her just €2,500 in damages and €2,500 legal costs (much less than the €50,000 sought) and rejected her demand that it should not be translated. The English-language version was published in 2015.

But Elliott denied having been told to go in pursuit of the pot by Outlander’s owner, who has famously made a fortune through his association with a budget airline. “I don’t think the million would interest Michael O’Leary too much,” Elliott said, wryly. “Listen, to be honest, the chances of our lad winning the three is very slim but, if you’re not in, you can’t win. So we’ll take our chance. “Don Cossack on his day might be the horse that could have done it. But it’s hard to do it. Just to get a horse to turn up on the three days in peak order. It’s a massive incentive to do it and I’d love to have a horse good enough but listen, I don’t know if our horse is, to be honest.” Up the road at Moone Jessica Harrington was much more upbeat about her chances with Sizing John, the horse she turned into a top-class staying chaser last winter after inheriting him from Henry de Bromhead. The main concern has been whether the horse can be fit enough for his first run since April, in which he will face race-fit rivals like Cue Card and Bristol De Mai. But Harrington revealed on Monday that she has taken him for “away days” not once but three times in her determination to get him ready for Saturday’s venture to Haydock. A spin on The Curragh was followed by two miles jumping fences at Naas and then a mile and a half gallop round Punchestown on Sunday. Harrington was in jovial mood on the gallops but her eyes narrowed and her manner became grave as she said: “I’ve got him as fit as I can hopefully. And he seems to be in good form there this morning. He was throwing his head around when he came in after working yesterday. But you never know until you get them as far as the racecourse.” Robbie Power, the jockey who partnered Sizing John to Gold Cup glory in March, seemed similarly optimistic about the horse’s readiness. “Look, I couldn’t be happier with him. He’s as ready as we can get him without having a race.” Power described how Sizing John had blossomed last winter after being stepped up in distance, having repeatedly struggled to match the best at two miles. “You talk about confidence in a jockey or a sportsperson but I think horses need confidence as well and he’d been getting his arse spanked by Douvan all the time. “I think the horse got his confidence back when he was getting his head in front. His work from Leopardstown to Cheltenham was something we hadn’t seen him do before. He just got better and better and the last couple of weeks I was fairly hopeful he would win the Gold Cup.” Bristol De Mai heads the betting for the Betfair at odds of 7-4 after Monday’s entry stage, with six rivals left to take him on. Sizing John is a 9-4 shot with Outlander an outsider on 10-1. Harrington had news of future arrangements for the horses owned by Alan Potts, who died last week, which include Sizing John. It appears that Potts, who was 80, transferred the ownership to a limited company some months ago and made arrangements for the horses to be trained until their retirement, in the event of his passing. “The horses are to run away until they’ve stopped running,” Harrington said. But she does not expect that Potts’s heirs would be seeking to buy young horses and certainly not at the rate or the expense that Potts did himself.

But his loser cult lives on","bodyText":"Charles Manson is finally dead. There is no resting in peace for such a person. At his trial, Manson told the prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi that he was already dead. He had said previously that he had been dead for 2,000 years, part of the confused allusions he made to being Christ. The terrible murders he committed in 1969 and his courtroom testimony transfixed America. The cult leader was finally starring in his own movie, strutting and fretting his hour upon the stage – a short, long-haired man full of violence, rage and manipulation. Now, if you care to look on the internet, Manson’s ramblings are memorialised on various websites, like inspirational quotes complete with images. The court could not break him, but then he had been broken and killed many times over many years ago, he claimed. There was some truth in it, although not the whole truth. Never that. These quotes may not be inspirational but they remain influential: the killer as the apotheosis of alienation, a strange object of admiration. Now that Manson really is dead, will his influence – if he really was anything other than a con man and a paranoid schizophrenic – live on in our culture? His name itself is a shortcut to some edgy, wicked outsider mentality: Marilyn Manson; Kasabian (named after Linda Kasabian, a member of Manson’s cult). In interviews conducted in his later years in prison, where he says spiders he fashioned out of the yarn of his socks allowed him to control the world, Manson comes across as old, pathetic, bewildered, mentally ill. These are what people should take a look at. Yet at the time of the murders – the details of which are still so absolutely shocking (the X cut on murdered Sharon Tate’s pregnant belly) – society was still strangely ambivalent about him. Manson appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone, a Christ-like image with a headline asking if he was the most dangerous man in America. Rock star murderer? The myths abounded: he had an audition for the Monkees (this is doubtful); he communicated to his followers from prison telepathically, as they all carved swastikas on their foreheads the same day. Then there is the ongoing argument that he didn’t actually murder anyone himself, he just got them to do it instead. The reality was both more prosaic and ugly. He had been in and out of prison all his life, where he learned to be abused and how to abuse – he actually asked to stay in prison knowing he was unfit for life outside it but the plea went unheeded and he became a pimp and a thief offering suburban girls drugs and his psychopathic version of family. Having been rejected by mainstream society he was also rejected by the counterculture, and could not make his way in the music scene. His anger and sense of omnipotence gave him a kind of charisma. His overriding fantasy was of a race war. He was a loser who would become a winner, and he would do it through white supremacy. The thing he called Helter-Skelter would ignite this war. This was the rationale for the slayings. It was a holy war then against the rich and the powerful. The racial aspects seem to me to be forgotten by those who sought to understand him and who gave him the attention he craved. Dennis Hopper went to see him in prison, and film director John Waters attended the trial. The Manson murders were seen to represent the end of the counterculture – peace and love giving way to brutal murder. But parts of the culture turned Manson into a strange kind of idol. Joan Didion, in her 1979 essay The White Album, recounts hearing of the murders at Roman Polanksi’s house on Cielo Drive. The numbers of dead were not yet finalised but there was talk of black masses and bad trips, hoods and chains. She said: “And I also remember this and wish I did not: I remember that no one was surprised … At a stroke, the 60s ended – the paranoia was fulfilled.” Celebrity and fame were no protection against the darkness, and Didion describes the unease everywhere. She recalls too how she helped Kasabian, who testified against Manson’s group, find a short green velvet dress to wear for the trial. This is a long, long time ago, but the mythology around Manson and his cult never quite goes away. His songs, such as they are, have been recorded by Guns N’ Roses, Marilyn Manson, of course, and GG Allin, among others. What truths do they tell? He has been interviewed in prison, and movies have been made about him. Most killers do not get this sort of treatment, let alone purveyors of white supremacism. His death comes though as his pernicious beliefs in a race war have entered the American mainstream. His warped logic holds sway at the highest levels of US society. Was he evil or mentally ill? Or was he in fact a product of a system that has not changed in all these years. When he said in court: “My father is the jailhouse. My father is your system … I am only what you made me. I am only a reflection of you,” he told America something. And it was awful. He died an old pathetic and disturbed man. A banal monster. Nothing special. Remember that – and his victims. • Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/21/uk-food-prices-la-nina-coffee-cocoa-brexit-inflation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T07:00:52Z","webTitle":"UK shoppers face 'year of anxiety' over food prices as La Niña returns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/21/uk-food-prices-la-nina-coffee-cocoa-brexit-inflation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/21/uk-food-prices-la-nina-coffee-cocoa-brexit-inflation","fields":{"headline":"UK shoppers face 'year of anxiety' over food prices as La Niña returns","bodyText":"UK consumers could be hit by a new bout of food price inflation next year after the return of the La Niña global weather phenomenon, which may hit production of key commodities including coffee and cocoa. The UK is expected to be particularly exposed to the effect of the event, which tends to prompt dry weather in the US midwest and heavy rainfall in south-east Asia and Australia, because of the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Stefan Vogel, head of agri commodity markets at Rabobank, predicted a “year of anxiety for UK farmers and consumers”. Vogel said: “We see significant threats on the horizon to global food prices in 2018, which have been relatively stable or even trending lower for a number of years. “Chief among them is the potential of La Niña, a weather event caused by the cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean that could affect areas ranging from grain fields in the Americas to palm oil plantations in Asia. “Unfortunately, the current high-inflation environment in the UK makes it disproportionately exposed to any significant movement in food prices, while the uncertainty over trade deals when Britain leaves the EU exacerbates the situation further.” According to the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the chance of La Niña conditions strengthening and lasting over the northern hemisphere winter is currently between 65% and 75%. The UK’s Met Office has also warned of an “increasing risk” of a La Nina event this winter, bringing a cold snap to the UK. It says it is unlikely there will be a major La Niña event, as experienced between 2010 and 2012, when severe droughts in key growing areas including the US midwest devastated crops while excessive rains in Columbia led to the spreading of a deadly coffee fungus. In its outlook report for 2018, Good Buy, Low Prices, Rabobank’s analysts predict that La Niña is likely to prompt volatile prices for commodities – ranging from palm oil in south-east Asia, where above-average rainfall and isolated flooding can take place, to crops in parts of Argentina, Peru, southern Brazil and the US that might be affected by drought or low rainfall. Jara Zicha, a commodities analyst at Mintec, said the effects of a La Niña and its stronger brother El Niño were hard to predict. A change in the weather could also be beneficial to some crops. Two years ago, one of the strongest El Niños on record brought rain to drought-stricken California helping fruit and nut farmers in the region, for example. “What is important is how strong La Niña is,” Zicha said. But he added: “This just adds another level of uncertainty. The UK already has very weak sterling making prices expensive and we are slowly starting to see those now. Going forward, Brexit is another uncertainty and La Nina is another factor the UK has to deal with.” Rising crude oil prices and global freight costs as well as the potential imposition of new tariffs on the import of goods once the UK leaves the EU, could all add to price rises according to Rabobank. Further price rises would come on top of increases in the price of fish, fats and vegetables which have driven food price inflation to the highest level in more than four years. City analysts and some retailers had predicted that the big drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016 would cease to have a strong upward effect on prices by the end of this year. But Rabobank’s analysts suggest otherwise. “Alongside weather, the rising cost of global trade and potential currency fluctuations also create upside risks for food prices,” Vogel said. “Our view is these outweigh the downside risks in 2018. Food and agribusinesses must therefore plan ahead to manage these risks proactively and appropriately.” •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/08/gulf-work-trap-tragedy-sri-lankan-family-kafala","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T07:00:35Z","webTitle":"The Gulf work trap that brought tragedy to an entire family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/08/gulf-work-trap-tragedy-sri-lankan-family-kafala","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/dec/08/gulf-work-trap-tragedy-sri-lankan-family-kafala","fields":{"headline":"The Gulf work trap that brought tragedy to an entire family","bodyText":"Holed up in an apartment on the seventh floor of a tower block in Sharjah, the family of five desperate Sri Lankans were racking up debts and disquiet at an alarming rate. Unable to pay fines that had been mounting daily since their visas expired four years earlier, they felt trapped. The father’s passport had been withheld by an employer, which meant the 55-year-old could neither find work in the United Arab Emirates nor leave the wealthy Gulf state to seek employment elsewhere. The tragedy that unfolded from there demonstrates how kafala, a “slave-like” system that binds a worker to their employer, can push migrant families to breaking point. When the father lost his job as a jewellery designer in 2013, the family had no one to sponsor their continued stay in the UAE and therefore became illegal residents. The resulting fines, imposed on each family member, mounted rapidly. Before long, they owed £36,000 – in addition to the loans the father had taken out simply to enable the family to survive. Tragically, on 26 August, the couple’s only son, 19, died at home during an epileptic fit. The family were so terrified of being discovered that they decided not to report the death to police or hand his body over for burial. Distraught at the loss of his only son – the family’s only other potential breadwinner – the father gathered together his wife and daughters to discuss what to do. He offered to give himself up, which would mean going to jail, but his wife said she would kill herself if that happened. How far the daughters, aged 17 and 27, agreed to what happened next is the subject of dispute. What is clear, however, is that the family entered into a suicide pact. The father wrote a full-page note saying it was “nobody’s fault” and that the family’s decision to end their lives was theirs alone. When the first attempt failed, the father sold his wife’s gold bracelet and used the money to buy a large amount of alcohol. By midnight, everyone was drunk on spirits. The father slashed the wrists of his 54-year-old wife,who bled to death in his arms, as well as his daughters. Blaming himself for what he had brought upon his family, he then threw himself to his death from the apartment balcony. The girls were later found “drunk and bleeding” next to their dead mother. Nearby was the son’s body, covered with a sheet. As they were rushed by ambulance to the al-Kuwaiti hospital before being transferred to the Ibrahim Hamad Obaidalla hospital in Ras al-Khaimah, an investigation was launched. It emerged that the father had left Sri Lanka with his family 20 years earlier, initially working in Saudi Arabia before moving to the UAE. “It was all going well and he was able to raise his family,” said Charitha Yattogoda, Sri Lanka’s consul general in Dubai. “But in 2013 he lost his job. He was a jewellery designer and there were a lot of computer-based jewellery designers coming along. That was one of the reasons he could not find work. “Without settling all his debts it was not possible for him to leave the country. He also had no passport.” Under Islamic law, the two sisters now face potential charges of attempting suicide and living illegally in the UAE. Upul Gamage, president of the Sri Lanka Welfare Association, said: “According to what I’ve heard, their punishment will most probably be caning and blacklisting and deporting.” But Yattogoda believes the courts will show mercy and allow the girls to return to Sri Lanka, where an uncle and their grandmother have offered to look after them. He believes the parents coerced the girls into suicide. Nisha Varia, of Human Rights Watch, said: “The restrictive kafala system can trap migrant workers in a vulnerable situation, especially if have they lost their valid immigration status after fleeing an abusive employer. “Those who have overstayed their visa face hefty fines, deportation, and potentially a few months in prison if they cannot pay the fines.” International suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.
